all biomedical knowledge to decode mechanisms of pathogenesis. Despite the recent renaissance in neural networks, a platform for the real-time synthesis of the exponentially growing biomedical literature and deep omics insights is unavailable. Here, we present the nferX platform for dynamic inference from over 45 quadrillion possible conceptual associations from unstructured text, and triangulation with insights from single-cell RNA-sequencing, bulk RNA-seq and proteomics from diverse tissue types. A hypothesis-free profiling of ACE2 suggests tongue keratinocytes, olfactory epithelial cells, airway club cells and respiratory ciliated cells as potential reservoirs of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor. We find the gut as the putative hotspot of COVID-19, where a maturation correlated transcriptional signature is shared in small intestine enterocytes among coronavirus receptors (ACE2, DPP4, ANPEP). A holistic data science platform triangulating insights from structured and unstructured data holds potential for accelerating the generation of impactful biological insights and hypotheses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>single cell RNA-seq</kwd><kwd>natural language processing</kwd><kwd>artificial intelligence</kwd><kwd>machine learning</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>No external funding was received for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 is expressed in nasal olfactory epithelia, tongue keratinocytes and small intestine enterocytes, connected with the COVID-19 patient phenotypes such as anosmia and diarrhea.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Since December 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been rapidly spreading across the globe. The associated disease (COVID-19) has been declared a pandemic by theÂ WHO, with over 5 million confirmed cases and over 300,000 deathsÂ globally as of May 23, 2020 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, 2020</xref>). The constellation of symptoms, ranging from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) to gastrointestinal issues, is similar to that observed in the 2002 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic and the 2012 Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak. SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 are all caused by <italic>Coronaviruses</italic> (CoV), deriving their name from the crown-like spike proteins protruding from the viral capsid surface. Coronavirus infection is driven by the attachment of the viral spike protein to specific human cell-surface receptors: ACE2 for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhou et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hofmann et al., 2005</xref>), DPP4 for MERS-CoV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Raj et al., 2013</xref>) and ANPEP for specific É-coronaviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yeager et al., 1992</xref>). In addition to these receptors, the protease activity of TMPRSS2 has also been implicated in viral entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hoffmann et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gierer et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In a recent clinical study of COVID-19 patients from China, 48% of the 191 infected patients studied had comorbidities such as hypertension and diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhou et al., 2020b</xref>). Epidemiological and clinical investigations on COVID-19 patients have also suggested fecal viral shedding and gastrointestinal infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Xu et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Xiao et al., 2020</xref>). In the case of the earlier SARS epidemic, multiple organ damage involving lung, kidney, and heart was reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang et al., 2010</xref>). The mechanisms by which various comorbidities impact the clinical course of infections and the reasons for the observed multi-organ phenotypes are still not well understood. Thus, there is an urgent need to conduct a comprehensive pan-tissue profiling of ACE2, the putative human receptor for SARS-CoV-2.</p><p>A deep profiling of ACE2 expression in the human body demands a platform that synthesizes biomedical insights encompassing multiple scales, modalities, and pathologies described across the scientific literature and various omics siloes. With the exponential growth of scientific (e.g. PubMed, preprints, grants), translational (e.g. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>), and other (e.g. patents) biomedical knowledge bases, a fundamental requirement is to recognize nuanced scientific phraseology and measure the strength of association between all possible pairs of such phrases. Such a holistic map of associations will provide insights into the knowledge harbored in the worldâs biomedical literature.</p><p>While unsupervised machine learning has been advanced to study the semantic relationships between word embeddings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mikolov et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">LeCun et al., 2015</xref>) and applied to the material science corpus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tshitoyan et al., 2019</xref>), this has not been scaled-up to extract the âglobal contextâ of conceptual associations from the entirety of publicly available unstructured biomedical text. Additionally, a principled way of accounting for the distances between phrases captured from the ever-growing scientific literature has not been comprehensively researched to quantify the strength of âlocal contextâ between pairs of biological concepts. Given the propensity for irreproducible or erroneous scientific research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nature Editorial, 2016</xref>), any local or global signals extracted from this unstructured knowledge need to be seamlessly triangulated with deep biological insights emergent from various omics data silos.</p><p>The nferX software is a cloud-based platform that enables users to dynamically query the universe of possible conceptual associations from over 100 million biomedical documents, including the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset recently announced by the White House (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">The White House, 2020</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). An unsupervised neural network is used to recognize and preserve complex biomedical phraseology as 300 million searchable tokens, beyond the simpler words that have generally been explored using higher dimensional word embeddings previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mikolov et al., 2013a</xref>). Our <italic>local context</italic> score is derived from pointwise mutual information content between pairs of these tokens and can be retrieved dynamically. Our <italic>global context score</italic> is derived using word2vec (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mikolov et al., 2013a</xref>), as the cosine similarityÂ between 180 million word vectors projected in a 300 dimensional space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Knowledge synthesis and the nferX Single Cell resource.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Knowledge synthesis: capturing association between concepts from over 100 million documents.

Here, we use this first-in-class resource to conduct a comprehensive expression profiling of ACE2 across host tissues and cell types and discuss how the observed expression patterns correlate with the pathogenicity and viral transmission shaping the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ACE2 has higher expression levels in multiple cell types of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract compared to respiratory cells</title><p>To systematically profile the transcriptional expression of ACE2 across tissues and cell types, we triangulated scRNAseq-based measurements with literature-derived signals to automatically delineate novel, emerging, and known expression patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

We independently validated this observation by computing gene expression correlations from bulk RNA-sequencing of human small intestine samples from GTEx (nÂ =Â 187), which similarly revealed that DPP4 and ANPEP are among the top 1% of correlated genes to ACE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1C</xref>).

The complete set of studies profiled is outlined in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> and includes both tissues which were identified from bulk RNA-sequencing as potential sites of expression for one or more receptors (e.g. kidney, adipose tissue, heart, testis, prostate, blood/immune system) as well as other tissues which did not show any evidence for expression at the bulk level (e.g. brain, retina, ovary, uterus). The analysis of data from all other tissues is discussed below with corresponding images found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplements 3</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s18">18</xref>.</p><p>Our analyses of bulk RNA-seq, proteomics, and IHC demonstrated that all coronavirus receptors are highly expressed in the kidney in addition to the small intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplements 2</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">6</xref>). scRNAseq of human and murine kidney corroborates this finding, showing that ACE2, DPP4, and ANPEP are each robustly expressed in epithelial cells of the proximal tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2âfigure supplement 5</xref>). Although clinical data suggests that SARS-CoV-2 does not reside in the urine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2020c</xref>), we wondered whether ACE2, DPP4, and ANPEP show an overlapping pattern of expression heterogeneity among proximal tubular cells similar to that observed among small intestinal enterocytes. To address this, we computed cosine similarity scores between gene expression vectors specifically amongÂ ~27,000 recovered human proximal tubule epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stewart et al., 2019</xref>) and found that again DPP4 and ANPEP are among the genes with the most similar expression profiles to ACE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref>). This is further supported by the strong transcriptional correlations among GTEx kidney samples (nÂ =Â 85) by bulk RNA-seq, where DPP4 and ANPEP are again among the top 1% of gene correlations to ACE2 among theÂ ~16,600 genes with mean expressionÂ &gt;1 TPM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2âfigure supplement 6</xref>). These observations are quite consistent with our previous analysis of small intestinal data and together may suggest an underlying transcriptional network which coordinates the expression of coronavirus entry receptors across diverse human tissues and cell types.</p><p>We then examined coronavirus receptor expression in the heart given the relatively high expression of ACE2 by bulk RNA-seq and the strong literature association identified between this gene-tissue pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2âfigure supplement 7</xref>). In the human heart, ACE2 is detected in 11% of cells or fewer from multiple populations including smooth muscle cells, cardiomyocytes, and fibroblasts. It is detected in a higher fraction of cardiac myofibroblasts from the Tabula Muris study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2âfigure supplement 7CâD</xref>) while showing no appreciable expression in any cardiac populations from the Mouse Cell Atlas dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2âfigure supplement 7EâF</xref>). We consider this evidence inconclusive in light of the discordant IHC patterns observed in HPA (not shown). This disagreement both within and across data types highlights the heart as a tissue which certainly requires thorough follow-up regarding the intricacies of ACE2 expression.</p><p>Across multiple studies of adipose tissue, ACE2 is not strongly expressed in any cell population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s8">Figure 2âfigure supplement 8</xref>). Of note, this includes studies of the murine adipose stromovascular fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s8">Figure 2âfigure supplement 8AâD</xref>) along with unfractionated adipose tissue subjected to single nucleus RNA-seq (sNuc-seq) which allows for the capture and sequencing of adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s8">Figure 2âfigure supplement 8EâF</xref>). DPP4 and ANPEP are both detected in adipose stromal populations along with smaller fractions of immune cells. Across multiple datasets, TMPRSS2 is exclusively expressed in cells defined by canonical epithelial markers (e.g. EPCAM, KRT8, CLDN3, KRT18), suggesting epithelial contamination of the adipose tissue preparations in these studies.</p><p>In the testis, ACE2 expression was unexpectedly low by scRNAseq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s9">Figure 2âfigure supplement 9AâD</xref>) given its high expression by bulk RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2A</xref>), strong staining by IHC, and high detection levels by proteomics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2BâC</xref>). The reason for this discrepancy is not clear. Based on the strong protein and bulk RNA-seq evidence, we suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may indeed be able to infect certain testicular cells, but our scRNAseq analysis did not shed light on the most likely cellular targets in this case. In both human and mouse ovary, coronavirus entry receptors and TMPRSS2 are not appreciably expressed, which is consistent with a lack of detection by our other data modalities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s10">Figure 2âfigure supplement 10AâD</xref>).</p><p>In the liver, expression of these genes was generally consistent with the protein expression patterns observed by IHC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s11">Figure 2âfigure supplement 11</xref>). ACE2 shows minimal detection throughout liver populations, while both DPP4 and ANPEP are expressed in the epithelial compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s12">Figure 2âfigure supplement 12</xref>). ANPEP expression is particularly high in the EPCAM<sup>+</sup> population of cells which may mark hepatic progenitor cells. TMPRSS2 is also expressed in these cells and in a subset of mature hepatocytes, which is discordant with the lack of TMPRSS2 staining in the liver by IHC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s12">Figure 2âfigure supplement 12</xref>).</p><p>In the pancreas, ACE2 is expressed in different cell types including acinar cells and ductal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s12">Figure 2âfigure supplement 12</xref>). DPP4 is robustly expressed in pancreatic alpha cells with lower expression detected inÂ ~20% of ductal cells, while TMPRSS2 and ANPEP are both strongly expressed in the acinar and ductal populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s12">Figure 2âfigure supplement 12</xref>). These patterns are largely consistent with our observations of protein expression by IHC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s11">Figure 2âfigure supplement 11</xref>).</p><p>To assess expression in blood and immune organs, we analyzed scRNAseq studies from blood, spleen, bone marrow, and thymus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s13">Figure 2âfigure supplements 13</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s14">14</xref>). Generally ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are not highly expressed in any populations from these tissues. DPP4 is expressed in subsets of T cells across these studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s14">Figure 2âfigure supplement 14</xref>) along with B cells and various progenitor populations in the bone marrow from the Tabula Muris study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s14">Figure 2âfigure supplement 14</xref>). ANPEP expression was mostly restricted to monocytes and macrophages along with some small bone marrow progenitor populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s14">Figure 2âfigure supplement 14B,D</xref>). Similarly, ANPEP expression in monocytes and macrophages may provide an alternative non-epithelial route of infection for other coronaviruses such as CoV-229E.</p><p>In both bladder and prostate samples from human and mouse, TMPRSS2 is robustly expressed in various epithelial populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s15">Figure 2âfigure supplement 15AâH</xref>). The coronavirus entry receptors are only minimally detected across all bladder cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s15">Figure 2âfigure supplement 15AâF</xref>), whereas DPP4 and ANPEP are detected in subsets of human prostate luminal cells (~8% of 18%, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s15">Figure 2âfigure supplement 15H</xref>). ACE2 expression is low across all recovered populations from the prostate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s15">Figure 2âfigure supplement 15H</xref>).</p><p>In the mouse uterus dataset ofÂ ~3700 cells from the Mouse Cell Atlas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s16">Figure 2âfigure supplement 16A</xref>), Ace2 was uniformly absent from all recovered populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s16">Figure 2âfigure supplement 16B</xref>). Anpep is robustly detected inÂ ~60% of glandular epithelial cells along with a smaller fraction (~10%) of stromal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s16">Figure 2âfigure supplement 16B</xref>). Dpp4 expression is detected inÂ ~17% of dendritic cells (nÂ =Â 23 of 131) along withÂ ~5% of glandular epithelial cells, and Tmprss2 is expressed in a similarly small fraction of the epithelial population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s16">Figure 2âfigure supplement 16B</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we assessed the expression of these genes in central nervous systemÂ (CNS) tissues despite their uniformly low expression and lack of detection in brain samples from GTEx and HPA, respectively (data not shown). scRNAseq data suggests similarly low expression across CNS populations, including various regions of the mouse brain and the human retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s17">Figure 2âfigure supplement 17</xref>). From the Tabula Muris study, Ace2 is detected in a small number of pericytes (22 of 146) and an even lower fraction of endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s17">Figure 2âfigure supplement 17B</xref>). Dpp4 is also expressed here inÂ ~20% of endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s17">Figure 2âfigure supplement 17B</xref>), which may warrant follow-up but importantly is not reflected in endothelial cells of the cerebral cortex by IHC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s18">Figure 2âfigure supplement 18</xref>). In all brain-derived cell populations from the Mouse Cell Atlas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s17">Figure 2âfigure supplement 17CâD</xref>) and human retina-derived populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s17">Figure 2âfigure supplement 17EâF</xref>), these genes were uniformly not detected at significant levels.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>ACE2 expression and patient demographics</title><p>While our study profiles the expression of the coronavirus receptors from various tissue samples, whether and how much receptor expression varies among individuals across various factors like age, disease states, genetic diversity, lifestyle, and environmental factors are not well understood. For instance, in order to understand variation of expression with age we explored ACE2 expression using GTEx samples. Interestingly, ACE2 expression levels in colon (transverse) samples were higher in younger individuals in comparison to older individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s19">Figure 2âfigure supplement 19A</xref>). In contrast, ACE2 expression levels in the esophagus (gastroesophageal junction) were lower in younger individuals in comparison to older individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s19">Figure 2âfigure supplement 19B</xref>). These patterns of ACE2 expression need to be tested more rigorously on larger sample sizes across diverse ethnicities to establish statistical significance. If ACE2 were found to be expressed more significantly in the colon of younger individuals, taken together with recent reports of sustained fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Xu et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gu et al., 2020</xref>), the emerging epidemiological hypothesis of younger individuals having fewer respiratory complications in general and serving as facile vectors in transmission of COVID-19 requires more deeper investigation.</p><p>The recent reports of hypertension as a comorbidity in COVID-19 patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fang et al., 2020</xref>) and specifically the use of ACE inhibitors as antihypertensives contributing to mortality encourages a hypothesis-free examination of the FDA adverse event reporting system (FAERS; see MaterialsÂ andÂ Methods). Examining the differential patterns of adverse event reports between ACE inhibitors and beta blockers - both antihypertensive drug classes, with the former known to increase ACE2 expression in select cardiovascular tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ferrario et al., 2005</xref>) - shows that use of ACE inhibitors is associated with a higher risk of respiratory edema (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s19">Figure 2âfigure supplement 19C</xref>). Any reports of patients on beta blockers also were removedÂ from the ACE inhibitors set, and vice versa, for this analysis. The increased adverse events of epiglottic edema, epiglottis, pneumopericardium, upper airway obstruction, eosinophilic oesophagitis, edema mucosal, edema of the mouth, tracheal edema, palatal edema, and allergic edema associated with ACE inhibitors compared to beta blockers suggests that a thorough investigation of all 10 million plus adverse event reports is necessary, to triangulate any drug-induced side effects that also appear as comorbidities from the emerging evidence of COVID-19 mortality. Availability of single-cell RNAseq data from healthy, pathological, and drug-treated tissues would enable us to profile the age-associated and treatment-based expression levels of ACE2 across cell populations. These observations underline that investments are needed to conduct comprehensive scRNAseq profiling of tissue samples from across different demographics and pathologies pertinent to COVID-19, as such effort will hold tremendous potential to reveal under-appreciated fingerprints of coronavirus transmission patterns, tissue tropism, and mortality.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Recent advances in scRNAseq are empowering us to study tissue and cellular transcriptomes at previously unprecedented resolutions. Several single-cell RNA sequencing based efforts such as the Human Cell Atlas are spearheading coordinated efforts to catalog gene expression across tissues and cell types, and the raw data from many of these studies are available on public platforms such as the Broad Institute Single Cell Portal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Single Cell Portal, 2020a</xref>) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Analyses of these datasets are of interest to a wide range of researchers but currently prove challenging for all but a few due to the need for specialized workflows and computing infrastructures. Consequently, the widespread use of this data for biomedical research is hampered, an issue which is particularly evident in the face of public health crises like the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. To address this unmet need, the nferX platform Single Cell resource enables the rapid and interactive analysis of the continually growing scRNAseq datasets by specialists and non-specialists alike. Furthermore, the seamless triangulation of scRNAseq insights with global and local scores derived from the synthesis of accessible biomedical literature creates a truly first-in-class resource.</p><p>By making the resource available to all academic researchers, we enable scientists to not only dive deeper into insights that are aligned with existing knowledge but also to prioritize the novel insights which warrant further experimental validation. Looking forward, we plan to automate the integration of the rapidly growing number of scRNAseq studies so that access to the entire worldâs knowledge of single-cell transcriptomes is just one click away for any researcher. As we do so, we encourage interactive feedback from the scientific community so that this platform can evolve to optimally support research needs across the biomedical ecosystem, beyond the COVID-19 focus on the current study.</p><p>Combined with our analyses of bulk RNA-seq, IHC, and proteomics datasets, our characterization of the known human coronavirus receptors (ACE2, DPP4, ANPEP) using the nferX platform Single Cell resource represents the most comprehensive molecular fingerprint of host factors determining coronavirus infections including COVID-19. While this serves as a primer of the deep profiling that is made possible with this resource, we also identified several interesting aspects of coronavirus receptor biology which warrant further experimental follow-up.</p><p>We identified tongue keratinocytes and olfactory epithelia as novel ACE2-expressing cell populations and thus as important potential sites of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This molecular fingerprint is a striking correlate to established clinical reports of dysgeusia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anosmia AAO-HNS, 2020</xref>) and anosmia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">ENT UK, 2020</xref>) in COVID-19 patients, which strongly implicate the gustatory and olfactory systems in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and human-to-human transmission. Tongue epithelial cells have also previously been shown to uptake Epstein-Barr virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tugizov et al., 2003</xref>), and importantly a recent study found that ACE2 is appreciably expressed in theÂ tongue based on a small number of non-tumor bulk RNA-seq samples from TCGA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Xu et al., 2020b</xref>). This same study further showed by scRNAseq that ACE2 expression is observed in a subset of the human tongue (but not other oral mucosal) epithelial cells, albeit in onlyÂ ~0.5% of the recovered epithelial population. This data has unfortunately not been released for public consumption but certainly does provide preliminary support for our finding, particularly as the listed set of cluster-defining genes for this population (SFN, KRT6A, KRT10) is consistent with the tongue keratinocyte identify from the <italic>Tabula Muris</italic> data set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s20">Figure 2âfigure supplement 20</xref>). We thus emphasize the imminent need for further generation of multi-omic expression data from large numbers of healthy and diseased human tongue samples drawn from a cohort of wide demographic representation.</p><p>We also observed that expression of ACE2 and other coronavirus receptors is intimately linked to the maturation status of small intestinal enterocytes, pinpointing the more mature subsets as the most likely cells to harbor SARS-CoV-2 virus. This finding amplifies the potential for fecal-oral transmission of COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Xu et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Xiao et al., 2020</xref>) and should motivate further experimental validation to determine whether monitoring of fecal viral loads should be considered clinically for diagnostic or prognostic purposes.</p><p>We further found that this transcriptional mirroring of coronavirus entry receptors was not unique to theÂ small intestine,Â but was also strongly present among renal proximal tubule epithelial cells, where ACE2, DPP4, and ANPEP expression tends to be observed in the same cellular subsets. These observations suggest the existence of a transcriptional network spanning tissues and cell types which may drive and regulate coronavirus receptor expression. The question of whether coronaviruses have evolved to exploit such a network may be relevant to pursue, particularly given that downregulation of ACE2 by SARS-CoV has been reported previously and is associated with poor clinical outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Glowacka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kuba et al., 2010</xref>). It is possible that SARS-CoV-2 is also able to induce cleavage of ACE2 as a means of viral entry and concomitant production of inflammatory cytokines (e.g. TNF-Î±). However, the moderate homology of spike proteins between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 requires additional experimentation to understand if such a mechanism operates in infection with SARS-CoV-2.</p><p>The emerging picture of the coronavirus life cycle appears to be intricately interwoven with many proteins beyond the primary host receptors. For instance, a recent structural complex of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with ACE2 identified SLC6A19 as an interaction partner of ACE2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yan et al., 2020</xref>). Further, spike proteins from some coronaviruses can interact with CEACAM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miura et al., 2004</xref>) and sialylated glycans similar to influenza hemagglutinin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tortorici et al., 2019</xref>) as host receptors. Future studies are likely to highlight several other proteins and glycans that constitute the âinteractomeâ of the coronavirus proteome. Understanding the expression profiles of the interactome across tissues will provide systems level insights on the cellular dynamics of the functional partners and the regulatory machinery of the host receptor proteins. Like in the current study, the nferX platform will be an excellent resource for unraveling the purported interaction partners for coronavirus receptors and profiling their expression across different tissues and cells constituting the human body.</p><p>Overall, this study evidences the utility of an integrative data science platform to enable rapid and high-throughput analysis of publicly available data to generate relevant biological insights and scientific hypotheses. We hope that by making our biomedical knowledge synthesis-augmented single cell platform publicly accessible, we help empower the research community to advance our understanding of the worldâs most pressing biomedical challenges such as COVID-19.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Unstructured biomedical knowledge synthesis and triangulation capabilities</title><p>In order to capture biomedical literature-based associations, the nferX platform defines two scores: a âlocal scoreâ and a âglobal scoreâ, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Park et al., 2020</xref>). Briefly, the local score is obtained from applying a traditional natural language processing technique which captures the strength of association between two concepts in a selected corpus of biomedical literature based on the frequency of their co-occurrence normalized by the frequency of each individual concept throughout the corpus. A higher local score between Concept X and Concept Y indicates that these concepts are frequently mentioned in close proximity to each other more frequently than would be expected by chance. The global score, on the other hand, is based on the neural network renaissance that has recently taken place in Natural Language Processing (NLP). To compute global scores, all tokens (e.g. words and phrases) are projected in a high-dimensional vector space of word embeddings. These vectors serve to represent the âneighborhoodâ of concepts which occur around a given concept. The cosine similarity between any two vectors measures the similarity of these neighborhoods and is the basis for our global score metric, where concepts which are more similar in this vector space have a higher global score.</p><p>While the global scores in this work are computed in the embedding space of word2vec model, it can also be computed in the embedding space of any deep learning model including recent transformer-based models like BERT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Devlin et al., 2019</xref>). These may have complementary benefits to word2vec embeddings since the embeddings are context sensitive having different vectors for different sentence contexts. However, despite the context sensitive nature of BERT embeddings a global score computation for a phrase may still be of value given the score is computed across sentence embeddings capturing the context sensitive nature of those phrases.</p><p>From a visualization perspective, the local score and global score (âSignalsâ) are represented in the platform using bubbles where bubble size corresponds to the local score and color intensity corresponds to the global score. This allows users to rapidly determine the strength of association between any two concepts throughout biomedical literature. We consider concepts which show both high local and global scores to be âconcordantâ and have found that these typically recapitulate well-known associations.</p><p>One key aspect of the nferX platform is that it allows the user to query associated concepts for a <italic>virtually unbounded number of possible query concepts</italic>. This is achieved by means of two features: Firstly, the nferX platform allows the user to compose queries using the logical AND, OR and NOT operators to logically combine any number of biomedical concepts in a query, each combination amounting to a gross or nuanced composite biomedical concept. Secondly, since logical combinations yield a virtually unbounded number of biomedical concepts that can be queries, the nferX platform implements a completely dynamic method of computing local scores on the fly by using novel high performance parallel and distributed algorithms that, in real time, scan hundreds of millions of documents to quickly locate user query related text fragments and count co-occurring biomedical concepts for computing strength of association scores and their significances.</p><p>The platform further leverages statistical inference to calculate âenrichmentsâ based on structured data, thus enabling real-time triangulation of signals from the unstructured biomedical knowledge graph various other structured databases (e.g. curated ontologies, RNA-sequencing datasets, human genetic associations, protein-protein interactions). This facilitates unbiased hypothesis-free learning and faster pattern recognition, and it allows users to more holistically determine the veracity of concept associations. Finally, the platform allows the user to identify and further examine the documents and textual fragments from which the knowledge synthesis signals are derived using the Documents and Signals applications.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Association scores</title><p>Having a method that automatically consumes a corpus and computes a numeric score that captures the strength of the association between any pair of entities is obviously beneficial because then given any entity, its association strength score with all other entities can be sorted to find a sorted list of other associated entities.

One popular traditional measure for association strength between tokens in text is pointwise mutual information, or PMI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Evert, 2005</xref>), which we consider in several association scores.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Measures of association</title><p>Formally, an <italic>association score</italic> is some real-valued function <italic>S(q, t)</italic> where <italic>q</italic> is a query token/entity and <italic>t</italic> is another token/entity.

For single token queries (where q is a single entity and not a logical combination of entities) , qâs context consists of all corpus segments that are âwindowsâ formed by taking words within a distance w (usually a tunable parameter) of words from an occurrence of q in the corpus. The dynamic adjacency engine generalizes this notion of context in a natural way to logical queries: the context for a logical q can be generalized as a certain set of fixed-length fragments.Â </p><sec id="s4-3-1"><title>Co-occurrences</title><p>This is just the number of times <italic>t</italic> appears in the context of <italic>q</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2"><title>Traditional PMI</title><p>This is log(p(<italic>t</italic> | <italic>q</italic>)/p(<italic>t</italic>)).

The purpose of these vectors is usually to be used as features in downstream NLP tasks. But they can also be used for similarity. The original paper validates the vectors by testing them on word similarity tasks: the association score is the cosine between the vector for <italic>q</italic> and the vector for <italic>t</italic>. This score only applies to single-token <italic>q</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-4"><title>Exponential mask PMI (ExpPMI)</title><p>This is our first new proposed score. PMI treats every position in a binary way: itâs either in the context of <italic>q</italic> or not. With a window size of say 50, a token which appears three words from a query <italic>q</italic> and a token which appears 45 words from a query <italic>q</italic> are treated the same. We thought it might be useful to consider a measure which distinguishes positions in the context based on the number of words away that position is from an occurrence of <italic>q</italic>. We did this by weighting the positions in the context by some weight between 0 and 1. Our weighting is based on an exponential decay (which has some nice properties especially when we extend to the case of logical queries).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-5"><title>Local score</title><p>This is another new proposed score. We find that PMI and ExpPMI can vary a lot for small samples (i.e. small numbers of co-occurrences, occurrences).

A query âegfr AND kidneyâ should return results related to the latter meaning, while âegfr AND lung_cancerâ the former.

The âcosineÂ similarityÂ &gt;=Â 0.32â bar at zero value suggests that roughly 11% of vector pairs whose cosine similarity where greater than 0.32 (âstrong associationsâ) never occurred together even once in a document. It is also clear from the figure that albeit more of the mass of the âcosineÂ similarityÂ &gt;=Â 0.32â distribution is skewed to the right as expected (more co-occurrences and hence unsurprisingly larger cosine similarityÂ values), there is a long tail of the âcosine similarity &lt; 0.32â distribution (very high co-occurrences but small cosine similarity).

The cosine similarity ranges from 0 (representing no semantic association) to 1 (representing strongest association).

The typical dimensionality used by our neural network for generating the Global Scores is nÂ =Â 300 dimensions.

But it has the problem that generally common events will often show up at the top, where weÂ are often more interested in events that are differentially associated with the query drug over other drugs. An issue with PRR is that it is noisy when the total number of event reports is small. If there are three reports of some oddly specific event and one occurs with the query drug, that event will likely have a very high PRR,Â but it may not be the event weÂ would be most interested in for a drug (in FAERS such rare events are often not even proper adverse events) - we want events that occur often, and also are differentially associated with a drug - a balance between count and PRR.</p><p>The AE score tries to strike this balance in an all-in-one measure. It up-weights events that occur often for the query drug (this is the ln(count) term), and that are differentially associated with the query drug (this is the sigmoid term).</p><p>The sigmoid(PRR-1.5) term ranges smoothly from 0 to 1. It's equal to 0.5 at PRRÂ =Â 1.5. When PRRÂ =Â 6, sigmoid(PRR-1.5)=0.99; so PRR valuesÂ &gt;=Â 6 are all treated roughly equivalently by the AE score. Thus, extremely high PRRs due to small counts will not swing the AE score much beyond PRRÂ =Â 6, and the ln(count) term will down-weight those small-count cases, so that they do not show up at the top of the AE score list.</p><p>A nice property of AE score is that, for a given query drug, the AE scores of the events with that drug turn out to roughly follow an exponential distribution, particularly at the tails. We can then fit exponential distributions to the scores, andÂ analyze them. A benefit of the exponential fit is that we can make more robust claims about how significant a certain score is for a query drug, even if the empirical data is sparse/noisy at the tails for a particular drug.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Murali Aravamudan, Peter Lebowitz, Ajit Rajasekharan, and Mathai Mammen for their insightful reviews and feedback on our research.

best unclear. In that regard, both the nferX platform and your scientific findings are topical and are likely to be of wide-ranging interest to physicians, physician-scientists and scientists, as well as to a broader readership.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Knowledge synthesis of 100 million biomedical documents augments the deep expression profiling of coronavirus receptors&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Mone Zaidi as the Reviewing Editor and Matthias Barton as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments and/or clarifications are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>This study examines single cell sequencing datasets for the expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors in cell subsets from 25 tissues and considers potential roles in the disease. The study also connects these datasets to a novel machine learning method to additionally measure the literature associations in an unbiased manner that map back onto the single cell sequencing data. The analysis provides a deep analysis of the expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors and allows for many interesting tissue type specific hypotheses to be entertained.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Overall, the reviewers considered the approach to be novel and to facilitate a characterization of cells with the potential to be SARS-CoV-2 targets. The study further provides a useful resource that examines many tissues in considerable depth. Notably, the authors accurately suggest that with expanding availability of complex datasets, there is an increasing need for integrative tools that will assimilate the available information. In this respect, they use ACE2 and other putative coronavirus receptors and profile their expression across a spectrum of body tissues. The idea that this may become a broader resource for all genes was thus considered a welcome one. With that said, there are considerable issues with the analysis and integration that need to be resolved satisfactorily before further consideration.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The analyses seem to be confirmatory of existing literature and this approach is unable to resolve discordance between tissue expression and pathological phenotypes. As an example, while the authors demonstrate renal and intestinal hot spots of ACE2 expression with relatively lower ACE2 expression in the lungs, it is increasingly clear that the lung is the organ that drives the majority of the disease pathogenesis. Their approach is thus unable to provide novel information that could explain this discrepancy. For example, are there explorable differences between the co-expression of tissue proteases such as TMPRSS2 and ACE2 between the kidney, lung and intestines?</p><p>2) The authors describe the ambitious approach to pan-tissue profiling of ACE2 expression by applying neural network platform and triangulating with the available transcriptome/proteome data. Throughout the analysis, however, local context score and global context score did not help in identifying the correlation of ACE2 expression with the COVID-19 pathogenicity except for kidney proximal tubular cells (local context score &gt; 3). A well-known SARS-CoV-2 reservoir, respiratory tissue, was scored insignificant which is raising the question about the platform's performance. Is there room to improve the performance of the nferX based on this study, and</p><p>do the authors think that the nferX platform is still crucial for the analysis compared to the transcriptome/proteome analysis alone other than identifying underappreciated tissue/cell types?</p><p>3) In the same context, the authors were not able to prove the synergetic performance of unsupervised machine learning from unstructured text data and the big data analysis yet trying to oversell their &quot;deep learning&quot; platform. They should revise the performance of their neural network platform or re-structure the manuscript without the integrating the neural network platform.</p><p>4) The authors state that hypothesis-free profiling of ACE2 expression was conducted, yet respiratory tissues were prioritized despite the low ACE2 expression and insignificant local scores (local context score &lt; 3) derived from the neural network platform. Do the authors now consider the manual curation of clinical information necessary for the understanding of the pathogenesis?</p><p>5) Concern arises from the author's statement that even low ACE2 expression in lung cells may be sufficient for the pathogenesis. The obvious analysis would need a look at the expression in the spatial context and determine if the ACE2 expression level differs based on the location within the respiratory tissue.</p><p>6) Please discuss the findings in relation to the Cell paper (April 27).</p><p>7) The authors should consider comparing scRNAseq data and single cell proteomics data and examine the expression discrepancy. This will considerably strengthen the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58040.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>Overall, the reviewers considered the approach to be novel and to facilitate a characterization of cells with the potential to be SARS-CoV-2 targets.

ACE2 expression is still detected notably in type II alveolar cells, club cells and clara cells of the lung and epithelial cells of the respiratory tract and nasal cavity.</p><p>Initially the lung was indeed thought to be the primary organ associated with the COVID-19 pathogenesis, but there is increasing evidence of the association of other organs such as kidney (e.g. Acute Kidney injury) and intestine (e.g. diarrhea). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> we show the growth of the number of COVID-19 documents associated with, for example, kidney, blood and intestine. Lung and the respiratory system may be more accessible relative to the organs and systems.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-58040-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>We agree with the reviewer that some points are confirmatory, which attests that the platform is able to recapitulate the ground truth automatically. However, we would also like to highlight that we present key findings that are completely novel. These include ACE2 expression in tongue keratinocytes and olfactory tissues, which were yet to be appreciated fully at the time of writing of the paper. Furthermore, the correlation of transcriptional signatures of coronavirus receptors with maturation stages of intestinal epithelial cells, to the best of our knowledge, is being described for the first time.In line with the reviewersâ suggestions, we have also analyzed the co-expression of TMPRSS2 and ACE2 across different cell types (Shweta FNU et al., under review at <italic>eLife</italic> and available on medRxiv at https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.19.20067660v2). We observed that there is overlap of TMPRSS2 and ACE2 expression in the cell types of respiratory, intestinal and renal tissues (please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>, Figure S1 of Shweta et al., 2020, medRxiv).</p><fig id="sa2fig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-58040-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><p>On a general note, the low detection of ACE2 in lung single cell studies may be owing to technical dropout effects. Below we cite two examples that highlight this view.From a recent article by Human Cell Atlas Lung Biological Network:</p><p>â... note that studies may lack specific cell types due to their sparsity, the challenges associated with isolation or analysis methodology. Moreover, expression may be under-detected due to technical dropout effects. Thus, while positive (presence) results are highly reliable, absence should be interpreted with care.â</p><p>Sugnak et al., Nature Medicine 2020 (nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0868-6)</p><p>âAdditionally, we provide an overall note of caution when interpreting scRNAseq data for low abundance transcripts like ACE2 and TMPRSS2 because detection inefficiencies might result in an underestimation of the actual frequencies of ACE2+ or ACE2+TMPRSS2+ cells in a tissue.â Ziegler et al., Cell 2020</p><p>(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867420305006)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors describe the ambitious approach to pan-tissue profiling of ACE2 expression by applying neural network platform and triangulating with the available transcriptome/proteome data. Throughout the analysis, however, local context score and global context score did not help in identifying the correlation of ACE2 expression with the COVID-19 pathogenicity except for kidney proximal tubular cells (local context score &gt; 3). A well-known SARS-CoV-2 reservoir, respiratory tissue, was scored insignificant which is raising the question about the platform's performance. Is there room to improve the performance of the nferX based on this study, and</p><p>do the authors think that the nferX platform is still crucial for the analysis compared to the transcriptome/proteome analysis alone other than identifying underappreciated tissue/cell types?</p></disp-quote><p>As noted by the reviewer, ACE2âs expression in the kidney proximal tubular cells was captured indeed. We note here that was done in an automated fashion. Confirming this using manual curation of a large volume of literature would be time-consuming and laborious. In general, the description of names of specific cell-types that are associated with ACE2 are still emerging in literature, which we do indeed capture with the epithelial cells of the lung, nasal cavity and respiratory tract, with local context scores tending towards 3. As more and more papers get published about COVID-19, local context scores reflect stronger association between COVID-19, ACE2 and tissues.</p><p>Furthermore, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref> we examine the literature-based associations between ACE2 and tissue-types, and show that there is indeed significant association with respiratory tissues (lung, nasal cavity, trachea, bronchus).</p><fig id="sa2fig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-58040-resp-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In the same context, the authors were not able to prove the synergetic performance of unsupervised machine learning from unstructured text data and the big data analysis yet trying to oversell their &quot;deep learning&quot; platform. They should revise the performance of their neural network platform or re-structure the manuscript without the integrating the neural network platform.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to clarify that we do find synergy between unstructured data and analysis of single cell RNAseq data (please see Figure 2). Please note that there are several points with significant local score and considerable ACE2 expression. Furthermore, the knowledge synthesis approach also enables us to identify the cell-types that have high-association from literature but low expression in terms of single cell expression (Figure 2). This provides a new lens to interpret the single-cell expression data For example, multiple endothelial cells have a strong association with ACE2 based on literature-derived signals, however, the single cell RNAseq expression is zero. This led us to explore endothelial cells related phenotypes and clotting has a strong literature-based association (local score: 3.5). We explored clotting systematically using lab tests of COVID-19+ patients and found it to be strongly correlated in COVID-19+ patients (plots given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4</xref>; see also Figure 3, Pawlowski et al., 2020, medRxiv, https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.21.20109439v1). Thus, the knowledge synthesis not only allows us to flag cell types with the knowledge from biomedical corpora, but also leads to generation of new testable hypotheses.</p><fig id="sa2fig4"><label>Author response image 4.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-58040-resp-fig4-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors state that hypothesis-free profiling of ACE2 expression was conducted, yet respiratory tissues were prioritized despite the low ACE2 expression and insignificant local scores (local context score &lt; 3) derived from the neural network platform. Do the authors now consider the manual curation of clinical information necessary for the understanding of the pathogenesis?</p></disp-quote><p>We are certainly of the view that clinical context is relevant to understanding pathogenesis. An automated curation of biomedical document trends shows respiratory tissues to be associated with ACE2 and there are longitudinal trends in the growth of number of documents associated with COVID-19 and respiratory tissues, as highlighted above in responses to points 1 and 2. These factors motivated us to highlight the expression of ACE2 in the respiratory tissues.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Concern arises from the author's statement that even low ACE2 expression in lung cells may be sufficient for the pathogenesis. The obvious analysis would need a look at the expression in the spatial context and determine if the ACE2 expression level differs based on the location within the respiratory tissue.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the spatial context matters and would be great to analyse. At the link below, there is a list of all of the spatial datasets that are currently available using the 10x visium system. Unfortunately, there are no lung studies yet. We will be happy to update the single cell resource when lung data is available.</p><p>https://www.10xgenomics.com/resources/datasets/</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Please discuss the findings in relation to the Cell paper (April 27).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for drawing our attention to this study. As suggested, we now discuss our findings in relation to the Cell paper: âSARS-CoV-2 Receptor ACE2 Is an Interferon-Stimulated Gene in Human Airway Epithelial Cells and Is Detected in Specific Cell Subsets across Tissues.â</p><p>Specifically, we have now analyzed data from non-human primate and human lung samples from Zeigler et al., Cell 2020. In this study, the authors identify ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-expressing cells within lung type II pneumocytes, ileal absorptive enterocytes, and nasal goblet secretory cells. They also identify that ACE2 is an interferon-stimulated gene in vitro using airway epithelial cells. While the latter finding is distinct to this study, for the former observation in addition to these cell-types, we find a few other cell-types (e.g. kidney tubule cells) to be coexpressing ACE2 by leveraging additional publicly available datasets. We describe these in the Shweta et al. medRxiv preprint:</p><p>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.19.20067660v2</p><p>We would like to highlight that the data from this Cell paper is now available on the nferX single cell app. In addition, we also provide access to the single cell RNAseq data from the following SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 related study: âHost-viral infection maps reveal signatures of severe COVID-19 patientsâ. Bost et al., Cell 2020</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors should consider comparing scRNA-seq data and single cell proteomics data and examine the expression discrepancy. This will considerably strengthen the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that comparing scRNA-seq data and single cell proteomics data would indeed help examine expression discrepancy and potentially strengthen the findings. From a practical standpoint though, single proteomics technology is still under development (please see Marx, 2019, Nature Methods, âA dream of single-cell proteomicsâ) compared to scRNA-seq and the data dissemination mechanisms like Gene Expression Omnibus for scRNA-seq are yet to be in place. Furthermore, since single cell proteomics is a completely different modality from scRNA-seq, building a robust software workflow is a significant undertaking. There is value in sharing findings from scRNA-seq as seen from the recent publications. Thus, in the interest of sharing this COVID-19-related resource with the scientific community in a timely manner, we prefer to release the scRNA-seq platform for now. Of course, in line with the reviewerâs suggestion, once the single cell proteomics data is available we would indeed be happy to build and share a single cell proteomics data resource as a follow up to this study.</p></body></sub-article></article>
