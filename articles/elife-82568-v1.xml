Yet, how SV proteins are sorted to presynaptic nerve terminals remains the subject of debate. The leading model posits that these proteins are randomly trafficked throughout neurons and are selectively retained in presynaptic boutons. Here, we used the RUSH (retention using selective hooks) system, in conjunction with HaloTag labeling approaches, to study the egress of two distinct transmembrane SV proteins, synaptotagmin 1 and synaptobrevin 2, from the soma of mature cultured rat and mouse neurons. For these studies, the SV reporter constructs were expressed at carefully controlled, very low levels. In sharp contrast to the selective retention model, both proteins selectively and specifically entered axons with minimal entry into dendrites. However, even moderate overexpression resulted in the spillover of SV proteins into dendrites, potentially explaining the origin of previous non-polarized transport models, revealing the limited, saturable nature of the direct axonal trafficking pathway. Moreover, we observed that SV constituents were first delivered to the presynaptic plasma membrane before incorporation into SVs. These experiments reveal a new-found membrane trafficking pathway, for SV proteins, in classically polarized mammalian neurons and provide a glimpse at the first steps of SV biogenesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>axonal transport</kwd><kwd>synaptobrevin</kwd><kwd>polarity</kwd><kwd>synaptic vesicle</kwd><kwd>HaloTag</kwd><kwd>synaptotagmin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH061876</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chapman</surname><given-names>Edwin R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS097362</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chapman</surname><given-names>Edwin R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chapman</surname><given-names>Edwin R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS098604</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vevea</surname><given-names>Jason D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100002558</institution-id><institution>Warren Alpert Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Distinguished Scholars Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vevea</surname><given-names>Jason D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Using carefully controlled expression levels and a variety of optical pulse-chase assays in mammalian neurons, an updated model for the polarized transport of synaptic vesicle proteins, and the first steps of synaptic vesicle biogenesis, were uncovered.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neurons present a dramatic example of cell polarization. These highly specialized and asymmetric cells form elaborate axonal and dendritic arbors, with some axons extending great distances (e.g., axons in a blue whale can reach a length of 30 meters; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Smith, 2009</xref>). Within this polarized framework, axons and dendrites are highly adapted to carry out different functions and, consequently, each harbor somewhat distinct molecular constituents. For example, in chemical synapses, dendrites require a steady supply of receptors and proteins that are involved in postsynaptic signaling, whereas axons require the machinery that drives the synaptic vesicle (SV) cycle, including the exocytosis of neurotransmitters. How this molecular and cellular polarity is maintained, specifically in the case of highly extended axons, is an essential question since preserving this extreme polarity underlies neuronal function. Indeed, defects in axonal transport have been implicated in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hung and Link, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Maday et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">May-simera and Liu, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vicario-Orri et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Many aspects of axonal and dendritic transport are well characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hirokawa, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Maday et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Roy, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Twelvetrees, 2020</xref>). Specifically, several families of motor proteins, which carry transport vesicles along microtubule and actin tracks, have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hirokawa and Takemura, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kneussel and Wagner, 2013</xref>). Together, motor proteins and the cytoskeleton constitute a transport network that supports the formation and maintenance of synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Waites et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Ziv and Garner, 2004</xref>). In the case of the axonal transport of SV proteins, anterograde movement is driven by the kinesin motors, KIF1A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Okada et al., 1995</xref>) and KIF5B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nakata and Hirokawa, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Song et al., 2009</xref>), and retrograde transport is mediated by dynein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fejtova et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Paschal and Vallee, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schnapp and Reese, 1989</xref>). However, how SV proteins are sorted to presynaptic boutons remains unclear.</p><p>Considerable progress has been made concerning the postal system by which proteins are selectively sorted to dendrites. A direct pathway, with proteins traveling directly from the soma to dendrites, is thought to be established early in neuronal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burack et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Karasmanis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Petersen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Silverman et al., 2001</xref>). Studying the sorting of axonal cargo, specifically SV proteins in mature mammalian neurons, is more challenging, in part due to the limited flux of materials to neurites after synaptogenesis, a point we return to below. Two membrane trafficking pathways that sort SV proteins to axons have been proposed. The first pathway, often called the selective retention model, is based on the non-polarized delivery of axon-destined cargo to both axons and dendrites. In this pathway, SV proteins that were delivered to axons are retained there, whereas SV proteins that were delivered to the plasma membrane (PM) of dendrites are endocytosed and re-routed back to axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fletcher-Jones et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sampo et al., 2003</xref>). The second pathway is a variant of this model. It differs in that axon-destined transport vesicles move through axons and dendrites, but do not fuse with the dendritic PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burack et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nabb and Bentley, 2022</xref>). This second model has been termed ‘direct transport’, despite the observation that transport vesicles carrying axonal proteins often entered dendrites prior to entering axons, to emphasize the lack of fusion of these vesicles in the somatodendritic domain. After decades of research, the widespread conclusion is that SV proteins are trafficked with a low degree of selectivity into both axons and dendrites of mammalian neurons, and are either selectively retained in, or have partially biased transport toward, axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bentley and Banker, 2016</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to these low-selectivity transport models, recent studies suggest the existence of a direct and selective transport pathway of SV proteins to axons in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> DA9 bipolar neurons and rat and mouse pseudounipolar dorsal root ganglion cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gumy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li et al., 2016b</xref>). However, DA9 bipolar neurons have a simplified microtubule orientation, and pseudounipolar neurons lack an axon initial segment, have a bifurcating axon, and do not have dendrites, so it is unclear whether the transport observed in these models extends to mammalian neurons with conventional morphology and microtubule polarity. One elegant study, using mouse hippocampal neurons, concluded that temperature-sensitive vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G tsO45) underwent directed polarized axonal transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nakata and Hirokawa, 2003</xref>). VSV-G tsO45 is a foreign protein in mammalian neurons, and the untagged version of this protein is sorted to dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dotti and Simons, 1990</xref>). Still, the selective trafficking of this viral protein to axons suggests the existence of an axon-specific pathway in mammalian neurons with classically polarized axonal and dendritic arbors.</p><p>The main objective of the current study is to use new, improved methods to address whether axonal proteins arrive at their destination via non-polarized delivery, or via direct and specific transport to axons. Specifically, we trace the path that two distinct SV proteins take from the soma to axons in mammalian hippocampal neurons. We focused on synaptotagmin (SYT) 1, a Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor that regulates rapid neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chapman, 2008</xref>), and synaptobrevin (SYB) 2, a vesicular (v-) SNARE protein, also known as VAMP2, that assembles into <italic>trans</italic>-SNARE complexes to catalyze membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Südhof and Rothman, 2009</xref>). We note that SYB2 has been used in axonal transport studies for decades and was included here to directly address the idea that its polarized distribution is achieved via either of the two non-polarized delivery models outlined above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nabb and Bentley, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sampo et al., 2003</xref>). These two SV proteins were also selected because SYT1, a canonical type I transmembrane protein, is co-translationally inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Perin et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shao and Hegde, 2011</xref>), whereas SYB2, a type II tail-anchored protein, is post-translationally inserted into the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kutay et al., 1995</xref>). Moreover, SYT1 and SYB2 have been shown to be trafficked by different kinesin motors, KIF1A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Okada et al., 1995</xref>) and KIF5B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nakata and Hirokawa, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Song et al., 2009</xref>), respectively. The selection of two distinct SV proteins with different topologies, and consequently different biosynthetic pathways, as well as different trafficking motors, enabled us to investigate whether there is a conserved mechanism underlying their polarized distributions.</p><p>We reiterate that the low rate of SV protein egress from the soma, once neurons mature and switch from establishing to maintaining polarity, makes it difficult to monitor movement of SV precursors via live-cell imaging, without overexpressing the protein of interest. To overcome these technical challenges, we took advantage of recently developed tools to sequester SV proteins in the ER of mature neurons. We then released them in a synchronized manner, after synaptogenesis, to track their path to synapses after leaving the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boncompain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Farías et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zahavi et al., 2021</xref>). We combined this system with HaloTag labeling approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grimm et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Grimm and Lavis, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Los et al., 2008</xref>) to follow the fate of SYT1 and SYB2 as they leave the soma and are ultimately delivered to nerve terminals. In these experiments, careful attention was paid to expression levels since overexpression results in the spillover of SV proteins into inappropriate compartments, thus obscuring polarized transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pennuto et al., 2003</xref>). These experiments uncovered a novel pathway in which transport vesicles, bearing transmembrane SV proteins, are directly and selectively delivered to axons. Moreover, after delivery to axons, we found that these vesicles fuse with the presynaptic PM creating a hub, or reservoir, from which SVs are eventually generated.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Using RUSH to study egress of SV proteins from the soma of cultured neurons</title><p>We took advantage of the retention using selective hooks (RUSH) system to study the sorting itinerary of newly synthesized SV proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boncompain et al., 2012</xref>). In the RUSH system, proteins of interest are retained in the ER and released upon addition of the small molecule, biotin. The ability to synchronize protein release from the ER makes it possible to observe their trek to their target destination. In our experiments, retention of the SV proteins, SYT1 and SYB2, was accomplished by appending a streptavidin-binding peptide (SBP) to the intravesicular end of each protein; translocation of the amino-terminus of SYT1 into the ER was aided by the addition of a pre-prolactin leader sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). The tagged proteins bind to the co-expressed streptavidin ”hook”, which is localized to the ER by a retention signal (Lys·Asp·Glu·Leu; KDEL), thus retaining them. The addition of biotin displaces the SBP and allows natural egress to occur. Each cargo also includes a HaloTag that was used for visualization.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Using retention using selective hooks (RUSH) to study egress of synaptic vesicle (SV) proteins from the soma of cultured rat hippocampal neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A cartoon of RUSH; pre- and post-biotin conditions are shown.

To mitigate this confound, the viruses used to express SYT1 and SYB2 were carefully titrated to achieve a sparse transduction such that only a select few neurons were expressing minimal levels of the tagged protein. To further ensure low levels of expression, cells that had lower than average fluorescence (as compared to other transduced cells on the coverslip) were selected for imaging. Within this low-expression paradigm, live-cell imaging and immunocytochemistry (ICC) confirmed the localization of the SV reporter proteins within the ER prior to biotin-triggered release, and then with the Golgi and eventual endpoint targeting to synapses following release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>).</p><p>With the temporal control afforded by this assay, we can designate an exact starting position and time of release in the cell, and record trafficking events immediately upon exit from the Golgi, approximately 20–30 min after biotin addition. This is a key point, because without defining a start time and location of release, we cannot know if SV cargoes were trafficked through dendrites on their way to axons. To definitively identify axons, we used an extracellular pan-neurofascin antibody to label the axon initial segment of live neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We also expressed an ER-targeted GFP (GFP-KDEL) to determine whether transport vesicles were post-ER organelles, as indicated by the absence of this marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Upon release of ER-tethered SYT1, we observed little to no transport activity in proximal dendrites (defined as the first 20 µm of the neurite) as shown by the lack of diagonal lines in the kymograph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>); however, there was noticeable movement of tagged SYT1 as it began to egress from the soma directly into axons in an anterograde direction, as represented in the kymograph by diagonal lines with a negative slope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). These initial findings contradict the idea of SV proteins being trafficked with low selectivity into axons and dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bentley and Banker, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nabb and Bentley, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sampo et al., 2003</xref>), and thus warranted a deeper examination. We highlight that the majority of anterograde-moving vesicles observed in proximal axons did not contain the co-expressed ER-targeted GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), confirming that these are post-ER organelles. In contrast, the stationary SYT1 signal in proximal dendrites colocalized with ER-targeted GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), indicating the observed signal is protein in the ER, rather than post-Golgi transport vesicles. Taken together, the lack of movement in proximal dendrites, and the robust anterograde trafficking in axons, suggest the existence of a selective and specific pathway that sorts SYT1 to presynaptic boutons.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>A direct and selective axonal transport pathway for SYT1 and SYB2</title><p>To explore this seemingly novel SV protein trafficking pathway, we expanded our experiments to include a second SV protein, SYB2, and to analyze transport in both proximal and distal regions of both axons and dendrites. Proximal regions were defined as the first 20 µm of a neurite as it emerges from the cell body. Distal regions were defined as a secondary branching of a dendrite or, for axons, a distance of ~150 µm from the soma, which is beyond the axon initial segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The distal regions were imaged approximately 5 min after the proximal regions to allow time for transport vesicles to make their way farther down neurites (at an average transport rate of 1 µm/s, each transport vesicle has the potential to travel ~300 µm from the soma during this time period). With these selection criteria, transport was quantitatively assessed by generating and analyzing kymographs of post-Golgi vesicles carrying the SV protein of interest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). As was first seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, we again observed robust transport of the SYT1 reporter in proximal axons and extended these observations to distal axons; proximal and distal dendrites had little to no detectable trafficking of SYT1-containing transport vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). This trend was also observed for the SYB2 reporter, allowing us to generalize our findings to topologically distinct SV proteins that are transported by different kinesin motors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Furthermore, all neurites were observed for the exact same duration, so the volume of transport activity in each region can be directly compared, further supporting the idea that there is minimal transport of SV proteins in dendrites. Of the transport vesicles observed, both SYT1 and SYB2 reporters were preferentially transported in the anterograde direction in axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H and I</xref>). Again, few, if any, puncta were observed in dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J and K</xref>).

We repeated the minimal expression paradigm used above (0.1x viral titer), and compared the subcellular distributions of these reporters when expressed at intermediate (1x viral titer) and high (10x viral titer) levels. Western blot analysis confirmed the overexpression of each protein, as compared to their endogenous counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>); at lower virus titers, drastically fewer cells were transduced, so the exogenously expressed proteins escaped detection. We employed a quantitative ICC approach where the fluorescence intensity of antibodies against SYT1 or SYB2 were compared at synapses containing tagged and native protein, or just native protein. This analysis revealed that the low, intermediate, and high expression levels resulted in 1.14-, 1.22-, and 2.48-fold increases over the wild type (WT) SYT1 levels at the synapse, respectively, and 0.93-, 1.17-, and 1.87-fold changes for SYB2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). In addition to changes in expression at individual synapses, increasing virus titer also resulted in increased transduction coverage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the relatively modest overexpression observed at individual synapses, both the SYT1 and SYB2 reporters also appeared throughout the PM of cells and spilled over into internal structures in dendrites at high expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>). A similar trend was observed at intermediate expression levels, albeit with lower signals in dendrites. Only when expression levels were low—effectively indistinguishable from the endogenous protein—and the dimmest cells were selected, did we observe the polarized, presynaptic distribution of the SYT1 and SYB2 reporters, at steady state, that is characteristic of SV proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chapman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Südhof and Rothman, 2009</xref>). We note that, under this low-expression paradigm, neurons are quite dim and, thus, challenging to image (i.e., required sensitive microscopy and a concentrated release of protein via the RUSH assay to observe transport), which may explain why higher expression levels are often employed in axonal transport studies.</p><p>The spillover of exogenously expressed SV proteins into dendrites at high, and even intermediate expression levels, at steady state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, F and G</xref>) is likely due to indiscriminate transport when expression levels are not carefully controlled. Therefore, it is imperative to use a low-expression paradigm to study the native trafficking pathway utilized by these proteins. Indeed, a mere doubling of endogenous protein at synapses corresponded with the widespread mistargeting of SV proteins to dendrites and the PM. We note that a similar trend of protein mislocalization at high expression levels was observed using a transfection approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>); only when we ‘diluted’ the plasmid of interest, by mixing and co-transfecting it with a dummy plasmid, were we able to minimize overexpression artifacts (note: this approach was used in Figure 5, discussed below). Simply reducing the total amount of the plasmid of interest for transfection was not sufficient to mitigate the rampant mistargeting. Taken together, these data demonstrate the extent to which overexpression can cause SV proteins to be mistargeted, at moderately low levels of overexpression, to ultimately obscure their native transport pathway. Additionally, these results help to reconcile the discrepancies between the current study and previous studies reporting the trafficking of proteins, like SYB2, in both axons and dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nabb and Bentley, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sampo et al., 2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Molecular determinants that underlie the polarized transport of SYT1 to axons</title><p>Next, we sought to uncover how SYT1 is selectively sorted to axons.

Hereafter, this mutant is referred to as the SYT1 palmitoylation/glycosylation mutant, or SYT1-PGM. In parallel, we assessed the role of the tandem C2-domains of SYT1, which sense Ca<sup>2+</sup> and interact with a variety of effectors, in targeting this SV protein to nerve terminals.

The full-length SYT1 reporter was included as a positive control and was correctly targeted to synapses, as confirmed by its colocalization with the synaptic marker, synaptophysin (SYP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The SYT1-PGM construct accumulated in the soma as well as the axonal compartment, where it was colocalized with SYP; it was virtually undetectable in dendrites, similar to our findings using the WT SYT1 reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The truncated SYT1 protein, SYT1ΔC2AB, was present throughout axons, likely on the PM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Courtney et al., 2019</xref>), and was also observed in the somatodendritic compartment, indicating mistargeting of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p><p>Next, we studied the transport of the PGM and ∆C2AB mutants using the RUSH system. Each fusion protein was successfully sequestered in the ER and was released upon the addition of biotin. Notably, both mutants successfully left the Golgi in transport vesicles and did not immediately fuse with the somatic PM, but instead were trafficked into neurites. We also note that these experiments were conducted without the addition of ER-targeted GFP, because the RUSH assay workflow improved when cells only expressed the hook and the reporter (i.e., constructs released more reliably, and the post-Golgi vesicles were brighter and easier to visualize).</p><p>In knockout neurons, the WT SYT1 reporter was—again—trafficked in a polarized manner to axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and I</xref>). In contrast to previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Han et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atiya-Nasagi et al., 2005</xref>), but consistent with our findings under steady state, SYT1-PGM was selectively trafficked to axons, consistent with our observations of the WT protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G and I</xref>). Conversely, the SYT1ΔC2AB construct entered axons and dendrites at similar rates, with a non-significant trend toward preferential entrance into axons (p=0.49) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H and I</xref>). Interestingly, the C2AB deletion mutant resulted in increased dendritic transport as compared to the WT protein, while axonal transport remained unchanged, indicating these domains might play a role in targeting SYT1 to different subsets of transport vesicles with distinct destinations. Next, the movements of each transport vesicle in axons and dendrites, for each of the three constructs, were quantified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata3">Figure 4—source data 3</xref>). For all three constructs, the majority of transport vesicles proceeded in an anterograde direction in axons. In dendrites, the majority of mobile puncta carrying SYT1 and SYT1ΔC2AB moved in a retrograde direction, though a considerable fraction of SYT1ΔC2AB vesicles were stationary. These mobile vesicles either represent protein that is moving from the dendritic ER to toward the soma, or are transport vesicles that egressed prior to imaging and are moving in a retrograde direction at the time the imaging was conducted. Interestingly, SYT1-PGM overwhelmingly moved in an anterograde direction in dendrites under the non-equilibrium conditions of these experiments. However, the total number of transport vesicles carrying SYT1 and SYT1-PGM in dendrites was relatively low, so the observed differences should be interpreted with caution. Taken together, these experiments reveal that the tandem C2-domains play a role in the proper targeting of SYT1. In contrast, palmitoylation and glycosylation were dispensable for selective targeting of SYT1 to axons.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Transport vesicles deliver SV proteins to the presynaptic PM, creating a depot for SV biogenesis</title><p>Finally, we sought to visualize the immediate destination of newly delivered SV proteins after they are sorted to axons.

However, this idea stems from experiments done in PC12 cells and CHO fibroblasts, which do not contain SVs. Since some SYT1 and SYB2 molecules are present on the PM at steady state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sankaranarayanan and Ryan, 2000</xref>), and overexpressed protein also accumulates on the PM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), it is reasonable to postulate that SV precursors are initially trafficked through the PM of mammalian neurons as a necessary part of their life cycle.</p><p>We addressed this longstanding question by developing a novel HaloTag labeling approach to conduct pulse-chase experiments using permeant and non-permeant Janelia Fluor (JF) HaloTag ligands (HTL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grimm et al., 2015</xref>). To assess whether these SV proteins are delivered directly to the presynaptic PM, we appended a HaloTag to the intravesicular terminus of SYT1 and SYB2 (termed HaloTag-SYT1 and SYB2-HaloTag) so that the tag is exposed to the outside of the cell when the SV protein is incorporated into the PM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). These constructs were sparsely co-transfected with an SYP-GFP fusion protein to mark synapses. The ratios of SYT1, or SYB2, to the SYP plasmid in these co-transfection experiments were determined experimentally so that the HaloTagged protein could be visualized, but was minimally expressed via concurrent dilution with the SYP plasmid. Immediately after co-transfection, neurons were grown with or without JF549i, a non-permeant fluorescent HTL, in the culture media. Impermeability of the ligand, under our experimental conditions, was confirmed empirically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This HTL labeled any copies of tagged SYT1 or SYB2 that passed through the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Xie et al., 2017</xref>). If SYT1 and SYB2 were delivered to a presynaptic sorting compartment, rather than the PM, they would not be labeled with the non-permeant HTL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). After 6 days the degree of labeling with JF549i was assessed via imaging. Then, the neurons were challenged using a permeant ligand, JF549, which has nearly the same structure, and fluorescence properties, as JF549i. Subsequent incubation with the permeant HTL labeled, and hence revealed, any remaining unlabeled protein that did not pass through the PM.

Incubation with permeant ligand labels the remaining tagged protein and the resulting change in fluorescence denotes the efficiency of PM delivery. The signal from labeling with the non-permeant ligand was referred to as F<sub>initial</sub>, where the unlabeled control coverslips still yielded a small background signal, producing a reproducible non-zero value that allowed us to calculate ratios. The subsequent signal after labeling with permeant ligand was called F<sub>final</sub>. This labeling step included unbound ligand which, while weak and diffuse, results in a slight increase in the background signal.

Half of the coverslips were incubated in non-permeant HTL (JF549i) immediately after co-transfection to label any tagged protein that was delivered to the PM.

To minimize this potential confound, the light chain of tetanus toxin (TeTx-LC) was co-expressed, using lentivirus, to cleave endogenous SYB2 and inhibit synaptic activity and SV recycling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schiavo et al., 1992</xref>).

Cleavage of endogenous SYB2 by TeTx-LC did not affect the expression of other canonical SV proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><p>To quantify labeling of HaloTag-SYT1 and SYB2-HaloTag at the presynaptic PM, the co-transfected SYP-GFP was used to define individual synapses, and fluorescence intensity was measured at each synapse before and after addition of the permeant HTL, JF549. As expected, in cultures grown in the absence of JF549i, we observed a dramatic increase in the fluorescence intensity at synapses upon the addition of permeant JF549 for both SYT1 and SYB2. However, synapses cultured with JF549i for 6 days exhibited minimal changes in fluorescence after addition of permeant JF549. These findings reveal that the majority of tagged SYT1 and SYB2 were already labeled with the membrane impermeant HTL. Hence, the majority of newly delivered SYT1 and SYB2 molecules pass through the PM, independent of synaptic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>). We cannot rule out that some tagged protein was delivered to an internal compartment, however, the all-or-nothing labeling we observed with the non-permeant ligand gives no indication of an internal depot that was protected from the non-permeant dye. Additionally, it is unlikely that the residual minis that occur in the presence of TeTx-LC (5%) contribute significantly to labeling at the PM for two reasons. Namely, in the absence of activity, the SV cycle and SV reformation are stalled, so tagged protein is unlikely to be efficiently incorporated into newly produced, fusogenic vesicles that are able to participate in spontaneous or evoked release. Second, if tagged protein was delivered to an internal compartment, only to be subsequently labeled at the PM, this would require a fast and efficient pathway for incorporation into fusion-competent vesicles that undergo spontaneous release. However, we have conducted preliminary experiments using RUSH to rescue synaptic neurotransmission in SYT1 KO neurons and found that incorporation of tagged protein into functional vesicles takes days. This is consistent with the model, alluded to above, in which SV recycling drives incorporation of newly delivered proteins into SVs. While we cannot rule out that a small fraction of tagged protein could be labeled through the residual minis that occur in the presence of TeTx-LC, this is unlikely to contribute to a significant degree. Thus, we conclude the major pathway involves delivery of newly synthesized SV proteins to the PM. We emphasize that these results were readily apparent by eye, as shown in the representative images of cultures grown with and without the non-permeant ligand and chased with a permeant ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G–J</xref>). In light of these findings, we propose that delivery of SYT1 and SYB2 to the presynaptic PM creates a depot from which SV biogenesis can occur.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>A neuron’s ability to sort proteins and transport cargo to synapses underlies the function of the nervous system and is a process that is maintained throughout the lifespan of the cell. As such, several theories have been proposed for how transport occurs. For the past two decades, the leading model posits that axonal proteins are delivered indiscriminately to all neurites and are subsequently selectively retained in axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bentley and Banker, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sampo et al., 2003</xref>). In sharp contrast, the transport of dendritic cargos has been shown to be selective, and vesicles carrying dendritic cargo are trafficked directly to dendrites without entering axons. This presents an apparent paradox, because both dendritic and axonal arbors can have elaborate morphologies. Transporting the cargos, destined for axons, through another exceptionally complex compartment would further complicate this sorting process. Consequently, selective retention, and other variants of this non-selective transport theory, appeared to be a high-effort, low-reward method of establishing and maintaining polarity. While inefficient mechanisms cannot be ruled out, the development of a specific postal system for dendrites, but not axons, remained somewhat puzzling. Using modern approaches and—importantly—by carefully controlling protein expression levels, our data sharply contrast the selective retention model and reveal that members from two distinct families of SV proteins are directly and specifically routed to axons.</p><p>The establishment of neuronal polarity and its maintenance has been studied for years, which prompts the question of why the direct and selective transport of SV proteins is only now being characterized. As we show, without the careful control of expression levels, direct transport is obscured by the spillover and mistargeting of cargo into other compartments of neurons. We note that SV proteins seem to be particularly susceptible to this artifact, as the intentional overexpression of TfR did not appear to affect its selective transport to dendrites. In earlier studies, axonal proteins were likely delivered indiscriminately to axons and dendrites due to spillover and mistargeting, as a consequence of overexpression. Furthermore, there has been confusion in the field about what constitutes direct transport. Some groups defined direct transport according to where post-Golgi vesicles initially fuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nabb and Bentley, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sampo et al., 2003</xref>). By this definition, axonal cargo can leave the Golgi, traverse the entire neuron, including through dendrites, fuse in axons, and still be considered a direct transport pathway. So, although it has been considered a distinct model, this “direct” transport pathway remains a version of selective retention.</p><p>Prior to the current study, there were reports in the literature that suggested a direct and selective transport pathway for SV proteins. Namely, a rigorous study focusing on nematode DA9 bipolar neurons revealed that SYB2 was delivered directly to presynaptic boutons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li et al., 2016b</xref>). However, these neurons have a more simplified microtubule organization than mammalian hippocampal neurons, so further studies were necessary to confirm whether this pathway extended to the complex cytoskeleton of mammalian cells. Experiments using dorsal root ganglion cells from mouse and rat suggested MAP2-dependent selective cargo sorting and transport of axonal proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gumy et al., 2017</xref>), but these sensory neurons have a pseudounipolar morphology, meaning they have a single bifurcated axon and no dendrite, and they lack an axon initial segment, making them distinct from hippocampal neurons. A more recent study, using mouse neurons, indicated that axonal proteins do not enter dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Karasmanis et al., 2018</xref>). However, while dendritic exclusion was clearly established, entry into axons was not shown. Nevertheless, these papers began to question the idea of non-polarized transport.</p><p>Newer approaches have also made it possible to directly address the trafficking of axonal cargos as they egress from the soma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boncompain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Grimm et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Los et al., 2008</xref>). At the outset of the current study, we showed that when expression levels are carefully controlled, two topologically distinct SV proteins egressed from the soma directly to axons, thus uncovering a novel selective membrane transport pathway. A small fraction of mobile puncta were detected in dendrites, so it is possible that the fidelity of axonal targeting is not absolute. However, there are other possible explanations for this observation, namely, even very mild overexpression causes a small degree of spillover into dendrites, trafficking is altered by the addition of the fusion moiety, or these puncta represent protein in the dendritic ER that is moving toward the Golgi in the soma. Regardless, transport was highly selective for axons vs. dendrites. Another issue is that dendrites are larger than axons, so the number of transport vesicles are potentially under sampled and underestimated in this compartment. However, videos were analyzed such that activity across the full width of each neurite was included in the kymograph, to take—in part—differences in neurite size into account. We also argue that the few vesicles we observed in dendrites tend to move in the z-dimension, so we believe transport vesicles are not being missed, rather it is more likely that we are underestimating their displacement as they traffic in and out of the imaging plane. We also note that the selective targeting of SYT1 appears to be more precise than that of SYB2. Whether this is due to SYB2 being intrinsically more promiscuous or is an artifact resulting from its fusion to HaloTag or SBP remains unclear. Regardless, the findings reported here reveal strongly biased direct and selective transport of both SYT1 and SYB2 to axons.</p><p>We also used the RUSH assay to conduct structure-function studies of SYT1 and found that glycosylation and palmitoylation were dispensable for direct transport to axons. In contrast, removing the C2-domains of SYT1 did not affect axonal transport, but rather increased transport into dendrites, thereby disrupting the polarized distribution of this protein. As mentioned under Results, these findings suggest that the tandem C2-domains might act to suppress dendritic transport. This raises the possibility that these domains help to direct SYT1 to transport organelles that are specific to axons, while the truncated protein is targeted to vesicles that do not undergo polarized transport. Additionally, this deletion mutant was present throughout the plasmalemma of both axons and dendrites at steady state. Clearly, further study is needed; the deletion mutant impairs the polarized transport and distribution of SYT1, but there is still a trend toward axonal enrichment. Nevertheless, these initial findings point to a role for the C2-domains in polarized transport of this protein. We note that the HaloTag reporter was appended to the N-terminus of the truncation mutant but was on the C-terminus of the full-length protein and the PGM mutant. However, it is established that, after careful design, tags at either end of the full-length protein are tolerated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Diril et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Vevea and Chapman, 2020</xref>), so this is unlikely to affect localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>This study also addressed the first half of the life cycle of SV proteins by conducting pulse-chase HaloTag assays to answer the long-standing question of whether SYT1 and SYB2 are—in fact—first delivered to the synaptic PM or presynaptic endosomes. Our results strongly argue that both of these proteins are delivered to the presynaptic PM where they serve as a reservoir from which SVs are eventually created. This initial fusion reaction is potentially mediated via tetanus-insensitive VAMP, called VAMP7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Galli et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chaineau et al., 2009</xref>). Then, during normal recycling, SYT1 is internalized via its tandem C2-domains, potentially via mechanisms that mediate SV retrieval from the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Courtney et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jarousse et al., 2003</xref>), and efficient retrieval of SYB2 is mediated by its interaction with SYP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gordon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Harper et al., 2021</xref>). Retrieval may involve interactions with various adaptor proteins, but the emerging view is that these interactions are unlikely to occur at the PM, as clathrin-mediated endocytosis is no longer thought to mediate the internalization of SV proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Watanabe et al., 2013</xref>). Regardless, these pulse-chase experiments reveal the first step in the biogenesis of SVs: selective delivery and incorporation of SYT1 and SYB2 in the presynaptic PM, as proposed decades ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buckley et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Feany and Buckley, 1993a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hannah et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Régnier-Vigouroux et al., 1991</xref>).</p><p>A key issue moving forward is to understand the cargo selection process that underlies axon-specific transport, and to further understand how newly delivered proteins are incorporated into SVs. Finally, a complete picture will not emerge until the other half of the life cycle of SV proteins is understood, namely how aged proteins are selected for, and undergo, degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Birdsall and Waites, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cohen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hoffmann-Conaway et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Na et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sheehan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sheehan and Waites, 2017</xref>). New tools have made it possible to address these questions, including HaloTag pulse-chase approaches, in conjunction with organelle isolation and mass spectrometry.

By using a very-low-level expression paradigm to express fluorescently tagged reporter proteins in neurons, a method to allow their triggered and 'synchronous' exit from the endoplasmic reticulum (RUSH), and live cell imaging, the authors describe a specific axonal trafficking pathway for the synaptic vesicle proteins Synaptotagmin-1 and Synaptobrevin-2. The corresponding evidence is compelling, and, furthermore, the authors' observation that even slightly excessive expression levels of the fluorescently tagged reporters occlude the specific axonal trafficking so that proteins distribute indiscriminately into axons and dendrites, explains why previous studies often failed to detect specific axonal trafficking of synaptic vesicle proteins. This study will be of interest to cell biologists and neuroscientists alike because (i) it provides a major advance in our understanding of nerve cell development and function, (ii) it demonstrates the usefulness of the RUSH approach in nerve cell biology, and (iii) it stresses the importance of tight control of reporter (over)expression, which is important in many other contexts.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82568.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Brose</surname><given-names>Nils</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04a7f6w43</institution-id><institution>Max Planck Institute of Experimental Medicine</institution></institution-wrap><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Synaptic vesicle proteins are selectively delivered to axons in mammalian neurons&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions requiring new experiments or new analyses</p><p>1. Analogous to the data on Syt1, the authors should carefully document the co-localization of the Syb2 reporter with the ER prior to the RUSH trigger. These data seem to have been acquired but they are not documented.</p><p>2. Regarding the tagged TfR imaging experiments, the question arises as to whether the authors observed a correlation of the previously described pre-axonal exclusion zone (Farias 2015; doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2015.09.074). There might be a specialized compartment just before the axon initial segment where the entry of presynaptic cargo but not of postsynaptic cargo can be detected. Similarly, Song 2009 (doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2009.01.016) described a 'filter' due to which presynaptic cargo moves more slowly at the start of the initial segment, where postsynaptic cargo seems to be rejected. Here, the question arises as to whether the authors detected any corresponding transport speed differences match with this previous observation, and whether upon presynaptic cargo overexpression the saturation of such a choke point due to slow migration into the axon might explain the spill-over into the dendritic compartment. The reviewers do not expect additional experiments along these lines, but further analyses of the already available data might be useful in addressing these issues.</p><p>3. Aspects of the experiments designed to show that the tested vesicle proteins are first transported to the plasma membrane and subsequently built into proper synaptic vesicles are problematic. (i) It is unclear whether TeNT was present throughout the experiment and why ratios were calculated by dividing by background fluorescence in the absence of the non-permeable dye. (ii) It is unclear whether the expression of the Syb2 reporter can override the TeNT treatment. (iii) It is unclear how complete the block of synaptic secretion is upon TeNT treatment. The conclusions are based on the notion of a complete block, but this is not shown. Further, the possibility of a VAMP2-independent vesicle pool is not discussed, and neither is the fact that spontaneous vesicle fusion persists – at least to some degree – in Syb2 KO neurons. The reviewers acknowledge that dealing with these issues is not trivial. A possibility would be to stimulate (e.g. with high-KCl or field stimulation) and use TeNT, tagged SYT1, and staining with the JD549i dye to demonstrate that there is no (detectable) stimulated enhancement of surface SYT1 that could then be labeled. Without additional evidence, the text on the corresponding part of the study needs to be toned down substantially to reflect the preliminary character of the corresponding data.</p><p>Essential revisions requiring changes to text or figures</p><p>4. Labs that routinely image single fluorophore-tagged proteins (XFPs) observe that only 70-80% of the expressed protein is properly folded with productive fluorescence. This is usually established by bleaching multimers of known stoichiometry and then estimating the probability of a dark subunit required to fit the data.

Shouldn't the expression of the Syb2 reporter override this? In view of this, I think, based on the experiments shown, that the conclusion that Syt1 and Syb2 are first trafficked to the plasma membrane and then incorporated into synaptic vesicles is still premature. Also, in this context, one would like to see how effective the TeNT expression was in stopping the synaptic vesicle cycle in the cells analyzed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The efforts of the authors in addressing the concerns of this and the other reviewers are appreciated, and the revised manuscript is indeed improved by providing necessary controls and some new data (e.g. the new synaptobrevin data). Undoubtedly, the study addresses a relevant and still unresolved question of cellular neurobiology. Having said that, the authors still provide mainly sheer observational data, and the mechanistic level achieved remains rather shallow. I am not rigorously objecting publication of this study in <italic>eLife</italic>, but I am just still not fully convinced that their progress meets the necessary standards. I do see that using their methodology they can demonstrate preferential dendritic transport of TfR, but the absence of such behavior for their SV cargo does not a priori deliver sufficient evidence for an axon-selective selective delivery pathway, at least in my eyes.</p><p>Mechanistic depth in my eyes (and as suggested) could have been provided by genetically targeting SYT1 C2AB domains via single point mutation to address ca<sup>2+</sup> or lipid dependence of the proposed SYT1 selective axonal trafficking in mammalian neurons. I am sorry to say that I am still of the opinion that deleting the full C2AB domains of SYT1 is a rather rough approach and that my concern concerning truncating about two-thirds of SYT1 remains. Such an extended deletion in my eyes might just very principally affect the proteins trafficking/targeting into vesicles and particularly the cell-biological identity of the carrier it is transported by. I am prepared for the argument that this is what they wanted to demonstrate, however, in the absence of any further molecular information and manipulation concerning the nature of their suggested selective delivery pathway operating in mammalian neuron axons this reviewer stays unconvinced concerning a truly selective character here. This is also for another argument: while C2AB domain deletion seems to increase absolute amounts of dendritic trafficking estimated by counting trafficking vesicles (Figure 4I), although, with very high variance, absolute axonal trafficking rates for my understanding were unchanged. Isn't this more arguing for a role of the C2AB domains in blocking dendritic trafficking rather than selective axonal trafficking? C2AB domain deletion seems to increase the traffic altogether (see argument above), correct? Figure 4J: SYT1-PMG mutants display predominant anterograde trafficking in dendrites, arguing for the role of SYT1 palmitoylation/glycosylation in regulating dendritic traffic. Is this what the authors imply here?</p><p>Figure S1E: It is appreciated that the authors provide a colocalization analysis of SYT1-reporter with KDEL and GM130.

In response to this concern, we now include these data in Figure 1 —figure supplement 2 in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Regarding the tagged TfR imaging experiments, the question arises as to whether the authors observed a correlation of the previously described pre-axonal exclusion zone (Farias 2015; doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2015.09.074). There might be a specialized compartment just before the axon initial segment where the entry of presynaptic cargo but not of postsynaptic cargo can be detected. Similarly, Song 2009 (doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2009.01.016) described a 'filter' due to which presynaptic cargo moves more slowly at the start of the initial segment, where postsynaptic cargo seems to be rejected. Here, the question arises as to whether the authors detected any corresponding transport speed differences match with this previous observation, and whether upon presynaptic cargo overexpression the saturation of such a choke point due to slow migration into the axon might explain the spill-over into the dendritic compartment. The reviewers do not expect additional experiments along these lines, but further analyses of the already available data might be useful in addressing these issues.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question. We observed few vesicles in the pre-axonal exclusion zone (PAEZ), so our initial thought was that exclusion was not coming into play. More specifically, of the nine TfR transport vesicles observed in the proximal axon, seven passed through the PAEZ and became either stationary or moved in an anterograde direction within the AIS. Of the remaining two transport vesicles, one underwent retrograde movement within the PAEZ, while the other dithered back and forth within this region. These observations potentially indicate some exclusion of TfR cargo at a PAEZ but, again, this applied to only two vesicles out of a small pool of nine vesicles in total. To make this issue more transparent, we now provide a breakdown of these data in Figure 2 —figure supplement 4F of the revised manuscript.</p><p>Regarding filtering at the axon initial segment (AIS), we observed that SYB2-containing vesicles are transported more slowly in the proximal axon (which encompasses the AIS) as compared to the distal axon (which does not include the AIS). This was not the case for SYT1; there was no significant difference in the transport speed of this cargo in proximal or distal axons. This protein-specific difference suggests a role for the kinesin motors in proceeding through the AIS. These data are now included as Figure 2 —figure supplement 3 in the revised manuscript. The idea that a bottleneck at the AIS could cause axonal cargo to spill over into other compartments is interesting, but our thought is that with time, the bottleneck effect would likely dissipate, and polarization would be restored. This was not the case for SYT1 and SYB2; the overexpression artifact of dendritic localization of these synaptic vesicle (SV) proteins persisted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Aspects of the experiments designed to show that the tested vesicle proteins are first transported to the plasma membrane and subsequently built into proper synaptic vesicles are problematic. (i) It is unclear whether TeNT was present throughout the experiment and why ratios were calculated by dividing by background fluorescence in the absence of the non-permeable dye. (ii) It is unclear whether the expression of the Syb2 reporter can override the TeNT treatment. (iii) It is unclear how complete the block of synaptic secretion is upon TeNT treatment. The conclusions are based on the notion of a complete block, but this is not shown. Further, the possibility of a VAMP2-independent vesicle pool is not discussed, and neither is the fact that spontaneous vesicle fusion persists – at least to some degree – in Syb2 KO neurons. The reviewers acknowledge that dealing with these issues is not trivial. A possibility would be to stimulate (e.g. with high-KCl or field stimulation) and use TeNT, tagged SYT1, and staining with the JD549i dye to demonstrate that there is no (detectable) stimulated enhancement of surface SYT1 that could then be labeled. Without additional evidence, the text on the corresponding part of the study needs to be toned down substantially to reflect the preliminary character of the corresponding data.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this miscommunication. The tetanus toxin light chain virus (now abbreviated as TeTx-LC for clarity) was added to cultures at 5 DIV and we now clarify this in the Figure 5 legend, lines 636-637 of the revised manuscript. The western blot (Figure 5D), which shows the loss of SYB2 in cultures that were treated with the virus, was conducted at 15 DIV, which was the day the experiment concluded. So, TeTx-LC was expressed and active throughout the experiment. The change in fluorescence ratios were calculated by dividing the final fluorescence by the initial fluorescence. This ratio was only calculated at synapses, not the entire field of view, to reduce the influence of the unbound permeable dye. The control condition, where we did not add nonpermeant dye, was divided by the background fluorescence in synapses to rule out contributions from autofluorescence and to remain consistent with the ratios calculated for the experimental condition. The background, in the control and test conditions, was reproducible and was a non-zero value, enabling us to calculate ratios. Also, this background signal was present in both conditions, so our analysis ensures these two conditions can be rigorously compared. The approach also helped to control for variation between trials. These issues are now clarified in the revised manuscript:</p><p>“The signal from labeling with the non-permeant ligand was referred to as F<sub>initial</sub>, where the unlabeled control coverslips still yielded a small background signal, producing a reproducible non-zero value that allowed us to calculate ratios.” – Lines 727-729</p><p>Regarding the reviewer’s second point, it is unlikely the SYB2 reporter is overriding the action of TeTx-LC, as the SYB2 construct was sparsely transfected (~0.01% of cells were expressing the protein). So, while SV exocytosis in the transfected neurons might be restored to some extent (but please also see our further response, regarding this issue, below), we do not see how there could be any rescue of naturally occurring, action potential driven, recurrent activity throughout the coverslip. Moreover, our preliminary studies indicate it takes at least a few days for newly transported synaptic vesicle proteins to rescue release (when evoked release has been disrupted in, for example, SYT1 KO neurons, or neurons expressing TeTx-LC), further reducing the likelihood that transfected SYB2 would rescue mini frequency to a significant degree over the course of our 6-day experiments. The key point here is that the network formed by these cultured neurons is largely silent, as there is no evoked transmission (which we can infer from the ability of TeTx-LC to phenocopy the SYB2 KO, as shown in Figure 5 —figure supplement 2, which was added during revision), and few minis, in any of the cells in the network.</p><p>Further regarding the effect of TeTx-LC on synaptic activity, our lab has studied the effects of tetanus toxin for the past 26 years and, as was shown in the paper cited in our manuscript (Bao, et al., <italic>Nature</italic> 2019, PMID: 29420480) and in countless unpublished experiments, the addition of tetanus toxin eliminates nearly all evoked synaptic transmission and greatly diminishes spontaneous release. This experiment is routine in our lab, and we did a poor job of conveying how predictable and consistent the results are in the first version of the manuscript. Additionally, expressing TeTx-LC was the best option available to us, because it disrupts both evoked and spontaneous release. Knockout of Sec1/Munc-18 would have eliminated all SV release, however loss of this protein is lethal in neurons, so we proceeded with TeTx-LC.</p><p>We reiterate that we now include electrophysiology experiments in Figure 5 —figure supplement 2 of the revised manuscript to demonstrate the effect of the toxin in the experiments in our study. These experiments confirm that when SYB2 is undetectable by western blot, as shown in Figure 5D, spontaneous release events are low, approximately 0.19 Hz; this corresponds to a 95% reduction in mini frequency, which—again— phenocopies the SYB2 KO (Schoch et al., <italic>Science</italic> 2001, PMID: 11691998). Using the general assumption that each neuron makes ~10<sup>3</sup> connections (Gulati, <italic>Indian J Pharmacol</italic> 2015, PMID: 26729946; Azevedo et al., <italic>J Comp Neurol</italic> 2009, PMID: 19226510), the release frequency per synapse would be 0.19 x 10<sup>-3</sup> events/sec, which, over the course of 6 days, could result in 98 spontaneous fusion events per synapse. To put this in perspective, if each vesicle only fuses once, this value represents 23% of the SVs found in a nerve terminal, based on previous measurements of cultures in our lab (Liu et al., <italic>J Neurosci</italic> 2009, PMID: 19515907). This percentage is still a gross overestimate because newly delivered protein is unlikely to be incorporated into SVs in the absence of synaptic activity, as the SV cycle is largely quiescent in our experiments due to expression of TeTx-LC. Indeed, our preliminary experiments suggest that SYT1 does not make it on to fusogenic vesicles (that is, does not restore evoked fusion in SYT1 KO neurons) 24 hours after delivery to the presynapse. We estimate that it will take at least an additional 24 hours for functional incorporation of tagged proteins into SVs. So, in our labeling protocol, over 6 days, there is unlikely to be any functional rescue of SYT1 or SYB2 for at least 2 of those days; correcting for this yields 66 fusion events per synapse over the course of our experiments, which yields an upper limit of 16% of the SVs in a nerve terminal being labeled through activity, if each vesicle fuses only once. Not to speculate too much, but we believe that efficient, functional incorporation of SV proteins into SVs requires activity and SV recycling, which is a process that has been efficiently disrupted in our TeTx-LC experiments. We have added text to the revised manuscript to clarify this point:</p><p>“We cannot rule out that some tagged protein was delivered to an internal compartment, however, the all-or nothing labeling we observed with the non-permeant ligand gives no indication of an internal depot that was protected from the non-permeant dye. Additionally, it is unlikely that the residual minis that occur in the presence of TeTx-LC (5%) contribute significantly to labeling at the PM for two reasons. Namely, in the absence of activity, the SV cycle and SV reformation are stalled, so tagged protein is unlikely to be efficiently incorporated into newly-produced, fusogenic vesicles that are able to participate in spontaneous or evoked release. Second, if tagged protein was delivered to an internal compartment, only to be subsequently labeled at the PM, this would require a fast and efficient pathway for incorporation into fusion-competent vesicles that undergo spontaneous release. However, we have conducted preliminary experiments using RUSH to rescue synaptic neurotransmission in SYT1 KO neurons and found that incorporation of tagged protein into functional vesicles takes days. This is consistent with the model, alluded-to above, in which SV recycling drives incorporation of newly delivered proteins into SVs. While we cannot rule out that a small fraction of tagged protein could be labeled through the residual minis that occur in the presence of TeTx-LC, this is unlikely to contribute to a significant degree. Thus, we conclude the major pathway involves delivery of newly synthesized SV proteins to the PM.” – Lines 370-385</p><p>As the reviewer points out, there is still the potential for SYB2-independent release, likely mediated by tetanus-insensitive VAMP, also called VAMP7, which is expressed at low levels in axons after synaptogenesis (Coco et al., <italic>J Neurosci</italic> 1999, PMID: 10559389). We emphasize that, as our electrophysiology experiments demonstrate, the residual mini release rate is minimal (5% of the frequency observed in untreated neurons, a value that is consistent with the KO literature (Schoch et al., <italic>Science</italic> 2001, PMID: 11691998)) so our work suggests that the contribution of SYB2-independent release is minor, if there is any contribution at all. Please note that we mention tetanus-insensitive VAMP in lines 776-777 of the Discussion of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions requiring changes to text or figures</p><p>4. Labs that routinely image single fluorophore-tagged proteins (XFPs) observe that only 70-80% of the expressed protein is properly folded with productive fluorescence. This is usually established by bleaching multimers of known stoichiometry and then estimating the probability of a dark subunit required to fit the data. The authors should discuss this issue and corresponding knowledge in the literature regarding the Halo-fusion proteins – with respect to the probability of a dark protein (folding, failed labeling, etc.).

So, even under in vitro conditions, this protein has a strong intrinsic ability to fold, somewhat mitigating the concern that there is a large fraction of “dark protein” in eukaryotic cells. Regarding our study, we emphasize that the ratios of tagged to wild type protein were calculated using antibodies against the protein of interest, not the HaloTag, so the folding efficiency of HaloTag does directly not influence our calculations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. It seems that there is no directional transport of TfR in dendrites at all (Figure S5).

When we initially began these experiments, we had difficulties with the TfR construct, and it did not behave as well in our system as the axonal reporters did; mainly, we found that the TfR construct leaked prior to adding biotin. Thus, there is a considerable amount of stationary TfR already in dendrites. Regardless, this experiment still makes the point that at steady state, TfR is dendritically polarized. If it would be preferable to the reviewer, we can remove this figure from the paper, though we believe it supports our findings and have left it in the current version of our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The fact that the omission of ER-targeted GFP improves the RUSH readout is potentially concerning. If the overloading of transport pathways is an issue, the problem arises as to what the RUSH approach itself does to these processes. This issue should be clarified/discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point that we failed to explain clearly in the resubmission. In the early phases of this project, we routinely marked the ER with our GFP-KDEL construct to aid in our interpretation of the transport vesicles (i.e. whether they contained protein that was in transit to the Golgi). At the start of this project, we had concerns regarding ER stress. Specifically, the ER and reporter constructs were aggregating, and the transduced cells appeared somewhat unhealthy compared to the untransduced wild type cells. This is an issue our lab has experience with, as we have confirmed ER stress in our experiments before when necessary (Ruhl et al., <italic>Nat Comm</italic>. 2019, PMID: 31387992).</p><p>To minimize ER stress in our current study, we optimized our approach and titrated both our ER-targeted GFP construct and reporter proteins until the proteins no longer aggregated, the transduced cells had typical morphology, and biotin-triggered release occurred in our RUSH assay. Before this titration, we were unable to obtain efficient release from the ER/Golgi in our system. This indicated what we believe to have been significant ER stress (though our attempts to directly measure ER stress under these conditions were inconclusive). Once we used the ER marker to establish our findings in Figure 2, it was our preference to leave it out because, as the reviewer mentioned, there is always a concern of ER stress and we wanted to avoid expressing unnecessary proteins; in our view, the less “load” the better. Additionally, we found that leaving out the additional marker also made release via RUSH marginally more reliable (perhaps by mitigating low levels of ER stress, but this is somewhat speculative), so we chose to not include it in most of our experiments. In short, it is likely that low levels of ER stress were present when both the ER-targeted GFP and reporter proteins were expressed; however, once release was achieved, the transport results obtained with and without the addition of the ER marker were consistent between these two conditions, mitigating our concerns about the impact of ER stress on SV protein transport.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. It is unclear why the approach shown in Figure 4 (e.g. panel E) leads to less selective trafficking of the reporters. Further, the 'no-effect' of the C2AB deletion is borderline convincing. It seems that there is an effect – just not high enough n. This issue should be clarified*discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>To recap, our experiments using the C2AB deletion mutant had the highest n of all three conditions, and our statistical analysis indicates that this mutant traffics differently from the wild type and SYT1-PGM mutant. The trend toward some degree of polarization of the C2AB deletion mutant, as pointed out by the referee, suggests that all polarized trafficking might not be encoded entirely within the C2AB domain. In short, the referee’s point is well taken, and we clarify this issue in the revised manuscript:</p><p>“In contrast, removing the C2-domains of SYT1 did not affect axonal transport, but rather increased transport into dendrites, thereby disrupting the polarized distribution of this protein. As mentioned under Results, these findings suggest the tandem C2-domains might act to suppress dendritic transport. This raises the possibility that these domains help to direct SYT1 to transport organelles that are specific to axons, while the truncated protein is targeted to vesicles that do not undergo polarized transport. Additionally, this deletion mutant was present throughout the plasmalemma of both axons and dendrites at steady state. Clearly, further study is needed; the deletion mutant impairs the polarized transport and distribution of SYT1, but there is still a trend toward axonal enrichment. Nevertheless, these initial findings point to a role for the C2-domains in polarized transport of this protein.” – Lines 458-467</p><p>We are confident in the observed changes in polarized transport because we saw such a large number of C2AB deletion mutant transport vesicles in dendrites (40 vesicles), as compared to WT (21 vesicles) and the other syt1 mutant (15 vesicles). When normalized to the number of cells observed, these values become 3.6 vesicles for the C2AB mutant and 2.1 and 1.9 vesicles for the wild type and PGM mutants, respectively. Apparently, the removal of C2AB allows the SYT1 remnant to enter dendrites, which is now a new area of study in our lab that we hope will start to reveal the underlying mechanism for the polarized trafficking of this protein.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8.

We included these data because other labs have published that these posttranslational modifications are crucial for the transport of SYT1 (Han et al., <italic>Neuron</italic> 2004, PMID: 14715137; Kang et al., <italic>JBC</italic> 2004, PMID: 15355980; Atiya-Nasagi <italic>J. Cell Sci.</italic> 2005, PMID: 15755799). We had assumed the palmitoylation and glycosylation sites were going to be important, and we were surprised that mutating these sites had a negligible effect on transport. This is also in sharp contrast to SYT7, another isoform of the synaptotagmin family, which our lab showed heavily relies on PTMs for its processing and transport (Vevea et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2020, PMID: 34543184). With palmitoylation and glycosylation ruled out, we now start from square one to determine how SYT1 is sorted to axons. We did see some decrease in polarization without C2AB, so this is a place to start, but we agree that extensive study must now be done to reveal what motifs of SYT1 are responsible for its polarized transport, and to uncover other interactors in this transport pathway that selectively route SV proteins to axons. This is a topic we have immense interest in, and we will address it using chimeric proteins. As suggested by the referee, we clarify this matter and emphasize, in the revised manuscript, that we are only at the starting point concerning the underlying mechanism for the observed polarized transport.</p><p>“Clearly, further study is needed; the deletion mutant impairs the polarized transport and distribution of SYT1, but there is still a trend toward axonal enrichment.” – Lines 465-466</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9.

The fact that the omission of ER-targeted GFP improved the RUSH readout is confusing.

It is unclear why the approach shown in Figure 4 (e.g. panel E) leads to less selective trafficking of the reporters. Further, the 'no-effect' of the C2AB deletion is borderline convincing. It seems that there is an effect – just not high enough n. This issue should be clarified*discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the opportunity to address this issue.

Shouldn't the expression of the Syb2 reporter override this? In view of this, I think, based on the experiments shown, that the conclusion that Syt1 and Syb2 are first trafficked to the plasma membrane and then incorporated into synaptic vesicles is still premature. Also, in this context, one would like to see how effective the TeNT expression was in stopping the synaptic vesicle cycle in the cells analyzed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the referee for this question.

Undoubtedly, the study addresses a relevant and still unresolved question of cellular neurobiology. Having said that, the authors still provide mainly sheer observational data, and the mechanistic level achieved remains rather shallow. I am not rigorously objecting publication of this study in eLife, but I am just still not fully convinced that their progress meets the necessary standards. I do see that using their methodology they can demonstrate preferential dendritic transport of TfR, but the absence of such behavior for their SV cargo does not a priori deliver sufficient evidence for an axon-selective selective delivery pathway, at least in my eyes.</p><p>Mechanistic depth in my eyes (and as suggested) could have been provided by genetically targeting SYT1 C2AB domains via single point mutation to address ca<sup>2+</sup> or lipid dependence of the proposed SYT1 selective axonal trafficking in mammalian neurons. I am sorry to say that I am still of the opinion that deleting the full C2AB domains of SYT1 is a rather rough approach and that my concern concerning truncating about two-thirds of SYT1 remains. Such an extended deletion in my eyes might just very principally affect the proteins trafficking/targeting into vesicles and particularly the cell-biological identity of the carrier it is transported by. I am prepared for the argument that this is what they wanted to demonstrate, however, in the absence of any further molecular information and manipulation concerning the nature of their suggested selective delivery pathway operating in mammalian neuron axons this reviewer stays unconvinced concerning a truly selective character here. This is also for another argument: while C2AB domain deletion seems to increase absolute amounts of dendritic trafficking estimated by counting trafficking vesicles (Figure 4I), although, with very high variance, absolute axonal trafficking rates for my understanding were unchanged. Isn't this more arguing for a role of the C2AB domains in blocking dendritic trafficking rather than selective axonal trafficking? C2AB domain deletion seems to increase the traffic altogether (see argument above), correct? Figure 4J: SYT1-PMG mutants display predominant anterograde trafficking in dendrites, arguing for the role of SYT1 palmitoylation/glycosylation in regulating dendritic traffic. Is this what the authors imply here?</p></disp-quote><p>We note that mutant forms of SYT1 have been expressed in neurons since 2002, and point mutations in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> and lipid binding loops, or the polybasic motifs of each C2-domain (e.g. Fernandez-Chacon 2002 <italic>J Neurosci</italic> 2002, PMID: 12351718; Stevens &amp; Sullivan <italic>Neuron</italic> 2003, PMID: 12873386; Wu et al., <italic>J Neurosci</italic> 2022, PMID: 35701163), or in crucial residues (for release) at the “bottom” of the C2B domain (Xue et al., <italic>Nat Struct Mol Biol</italic> 2008, PMID: 18953334), as just a few examples, do not affect trafficking. The linker between the C2-domains has also been mutated extensively (Liu et al., <italic>Nat Neuro</italic> 2014, PMID: 24657966) and this did not alter vesicular targeting. In short, there are no specific residues to consider for mutagenesis and transport, and subtle deletions result in misfolding of the C2-domains. However, our lab has deleted each C2-domain individually and found much of the protein becomes stranded on the plasma membrane, with a fraction that is still targeted to SVs (Courtney et al., <italic>Nat Comm</italic> 2019, PMID: 31501440). Consequently, we started with this admittedly coarse experiment by deleting the entire C2AB domain. We were surprised that this deletion impaired the polarized transport of the protein; we had anticipated the N-terminal domain might encode all the information for axonal targeting. Hence, our finding sets the stage for chimeric analysis, which we are currently setting up.</p><p>Regarding the interpretation of the C2AB domain deletion data, we agree that are findings are somewhat coarse and could be viewed as somewhat preliminary. However, as alluded to in the previous paragraph, we also emphasize that the capability to affect polarized transport, at all, is an important first step and sets the stage for further structure-function experiments. As the referee mentioned, the total amount of axonal transport of the C2AB deletion mutant is relatively unchanged in comparison to the wild type, but this construct was now transported into dendrites. This suggests that the C2-domains may act by negatively regulating the incorporation of SYT1 into subsets of transport vesicles destined for dendrites, because, as the referee pointed out, we observed an increase in overall transport when these domains are removed. We have revised the manuscript to reflect these points, noting the increase in dendritic transport concurrent with normal levels of axonal transport.</p><p>“Interestingly, the C2AB deletion mutant resulted in increased dendritic transport as compared to the WT protein, while axonal transport remained unchanged, indicating these domains might play a role in targeting SYT1 to different subsets of transport vesicles with distinct destinations.” Lines 303-306</p><p>As for the dendritic transport of the SYT-PGM, we are hesitant to draw conclusions based on the low number of transport vesicles observed in dendrites. This point is clarified/addressed in lines 313-316 of the manuscript.</p><p>“Interestingly, SYT1-PGM overwhelmingly moved in an anterograde direction in dendrites under the nonequilibrium conditions of these experiments. However, the total number of transport vesicles carrying SYT1 and SYT1-PGM in dendrites was relatively low, so the observed differences should be interpreted with caution.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure S1E: It is appreciated that the authors provide a colocalization analysis of SYT1-reporter with KDEL and GM130. While 30 min after biotin addition the Pearson's coefficient for SYT1-reporter and GM130 increases, the Pearson's coefficient for SYT1-reporter and KDEL remains unchanged. How do the authors explain this observation?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the referee for the opportunity to clarify this point. Based on our observations, the ER is large enough that, in 30 minutes, not enough of the total SYT1 reporter has left the ER for a substantial reduction in the Pearson’s coefficient.</p></body></sub-article></article>
