degrading enzyme (SAMase) was discovered in bacteriophage T3, as a counter-defense against the bacterial restriction-modification system, and annotated as a SAM hydrolase forming 5’-methyl-thioadenosine (MTA) and L-homoserine. From environmental phages, we recently discovered three SAMases with barely detectable sequence similarity to T3 SAMase and without homology to proteins of known structure. Here, we present the very first phage SAMase structures, in complex with a substrate analogue and the product MTA. The structure shows a trimer of alpha–beta sandwiches similar to the GlnB-like superfamily, with active sites formed at the trimer interfaces. Quantum-mechanical calculations, thin-layer chromatography, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy demonstrate that this family of enzymes are not hydrolases but lyases forming MTA and L-homoserine lactone in a unimolecular reaction mechanism. Sequence analysis and in vitro and in vivo mutagenesis support that T3 SAMase belongs to the same structural family and utilizes the same reaction mechanism.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Bacteria can be infected by viruses known as bacteriophages. These viruses inject their genetic material into bacterial cells and use the bacteria’s own machinery to build the proteins they need to survive and infect other cells. To protect themselves, bacteria produce a molecule called S-adenosyl methionine, or SAM for short, which deposits marks on the bacteria’s DNA. These marks help the bacteria distinguish their own genetic material from the genetic material of foreign invaders: any DNA not bearing the mark from SAM will be immediately broken down by the bacterial cell. This system helps to block many types of bacteriophage infections, but not all. Some bacteriophages carry genes that code for enzymes called SAMases, which can break down SAM, switching off the bacteria’s defenses.</p><p>The most well-known SAMase was first discovered in the 1960s in a bacteriophage called T3. Chemical studies of this SAMase suggested that it works as a 'hydrolase', meaning that it uses water to break SAM apart. New SAMases have since been discovered in bacteriophages from environmental water samples, which, despite being able to degrade SAM, are genetically dissimilar to one another and the SAMase in T3. This brings into question whether these enzymes all use the same mechanism to break SAM down.</p><p>To gain a better understanding of how these SAMases work, Guo, Söderholm, Kanchugal, Isaksen et al. solved the crystal structure of one of the newly discovered enzymes called Svi3-3. This revealed three copies of the Svi3-3 enzyme join together to form a unit that SAM binds to at the border between two of the enzymes. Computer simulations of this structure suggested that Svi3-3 holds SAM in a position where it cannot interact with water, and that once in the grip of the SAMase, SAM instead reacts with itself and splits into two.</p><p>Experiments confirmed these predictions for Svi3-3 and the other tested SAMases. Furthermore, the SAMase from bacteriophage T3 was also found to degrade SAM using the same mechanism. This shows that this group of SAMases are not hydrolases as originally thought, but in fact ‘lyases’: enzymes that break molecules apart without using water.</p><p>These findings form a starting point for further investigations into how SAM lyases help bacteriophages evade detection. SAM has various different functions in other living organisms, and these lyases could be used to modulate the levels of SAM in future studies investigating its role.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>bacteriophage</kwd><kwd>S-adenosyl methionine</kwd><kwd>lyase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004063</institution-id><institution>Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Evolution of new genes and proteins</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Åqvist</surname><given-names>Johan</given-names></name><name><surname>Andersson</surname><given-names>Dan</given-names></name><name><surname>Selmer</surname><given-names>Maria</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017-03827</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Selmer</surname><given-names>Maria</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005416</institution-id><institution>Research Council of Norway</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>262695</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Isaksen</surname><given-names>Geir Villy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017–01527</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Andersson</surname><given-names>Dan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005416</institution-id><institution>Research Council of Norway</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>274858</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Isaksen</surname><given-names>Geir Villy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The first structure of a bacteriophage-encoded S-adenosyl methionine degrading enzyme was solved and demonstrated to catalyze a unimolecular lyase reaction occurring at the domain interface of a trimeric structure.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) plays many important roles in biology. It is an essential methyl donor for methyltransferases that act on nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, and small molecules, but is also involved in many other reactions, for example, as a substrate used in biosynthesis of polyamines and quorum sensing molecules (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Loenen, 2006</xref>).

In this type of RM system, SAM is essential for both methylation of host DNA and restriction of target sequences in the foreign DNA. Two potential mechanisms for how the RM system could be impaired were presented. First, the lowered SAM levels prevented methylation of the host genome and the SAM-dependent restriction of the phage genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Krueger et al., 1975</xref>). Second, inhibition was observed to be independent of SAM degradation and possibly linked to an interaction with the restriction enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Spoerel et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Studier and Movva, 1976</xref>).</p><p>Recently, three additional SAM degrading enzymes were identified in a screen for bacteriophage DNA that could rescue an auxotrophic <italic>E. coli</italic> mutant where the isoleucine biosynthetic <italic>ilvA</italic> gene was deleted. Investigations using proteomics and RNA-seq showed that the phage-encoded polypeptides induced up-regulation of the biosynthetic pathway for methionine by degradation of SAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jerlström Hultqvist et al., 2018</xref>), which together with the repressor protein MetJ acts as a co-repressor of the <italic>met</italic> regulon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Weissbach and Brot, 1991</xref>). Isoleucine biosynthesis was rescued through a promiscuous activity of one of the up-regulated enzymes, MetB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). One of the newly identified SAM degrading enzymes, Svi3-3, was cloned, expressed, and purified. In vitro activity assays demonstrated that Svi3-3 catalyzed conversion of SAM to MTA.</p><p>We herein present the first structure of a phage-encoded SAMase and explore the reaction mechanism using both computational and experimental biochemistry. Strikingly, the results unambiguously show that the phage-encoded SAMases are not hydrolases, as believed since the 1960s, but lyases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Structure determination of a SAM hydrolase enzyme</title><p>The Svi3-3 enzyme was originally expressed from a library of fragmented environmental phage DNA. For this reason, the exact size of the original open reading frame was unknown, but an N-terminally hexahistidine-tagged 162 amino acid construct including some vector-derived sequence was shown to have SAMase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jerlström Hultqvist et al., 2018</xref>). The phage-derived sequence was subcloned to allow proteolytic removal of the hexahistidine tag, and based on predictions of a disordered N terminus, truncated variants were made. Full-length and N-terminally truncated variants of Svi3-3 were expressed with an N-terminal hexahistidine tag and purified on a Ni-column for structural studies. When expressed from the T7-promoter expression plasmid, the proteins were highly toxic and the tightly regulated, arabinose-inducible BL21-AI cells had to be used to allow cell growth until induction. An N-terminally truncated 146 amino acid construct of Svi3-3, where the hexahistidine tag had been removed (Svi3-3_d19, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>-table 1), formed crystals in the presence of SAM or the analogue S-adenosyl homocysteine (SAH).

helices on the outside and a five-stranded anti-parallel beta sheet at the center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>). The subunits pack in a triangular manner, forming continuous beta sheets with their neighbors and are each in a ‘velcro-like’ topology where residues 2–6 at the N terminus of one subunit form beta-sheet interactions with residues 120–124 in β8 of another subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The long β5 forms beta-sheet interactions with both of the other monomers through interactions between the backbones around residues 51 and 55. In addition, the end of the β5–β6 hairpin packs against α1 of another monomer. The trimer interfaces are each stabilized by a single salt bridge, numerous hydrogen bonds, and by hydrophobic interactions at the center.</p><p>The substrate analogue SAH binds at the interface between two subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>), enclosed by the β5–β6 hairpin at the edge of the sheet. The adenosine base is recognized by interactions with the backbone carbonyl and amide of Ile77 and the side chain of Ser50. The ribose forms interactions with Ser50 from one subunit and Glu69 and Ser71 from the other subunit. The homoserine moiety forms interactions with backbone groups and the side chains of Glu69 and Gln104. In the structure from co-crystallization with SAM, catalysis has occurred and the product MTA is observed in identical position as the corresponding part of SAH, with the methyl group pointing away from Glu69 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>), while a proline molecule from the cryo buffer is bound in the second half of the active site, mimicking the second product. The protein structures are virtually identical in the presence of SAH and MTA (root mean square deviation [RMSD] of 0.16 Å over 129 C<sub>α</sub> atoms). To test if the structure contains all the elements needed for activity in vivo, and because the start and end of the native phage protein sequence remain unknown, constructs truncated to only contain the ordered parts were tested for their ability to rescue the <italic>ilvA</italic> knockout mutant. Indeed, the N-terminally truncated construct additionally lacking the disordered C terminus provided similar rescue to full-length Svi3-3, indicating that neither tail is needed for SAMase activity (data not shown). Based on this result, all further experiments were performed with the 146 amino acid Svi3-3_d19 construct (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>-table 1).</p><p>Crystallization in the absence of ligands led to a lower-resolution apo structure. The structure of Svi3-3 in apo state is overall very similar to the complex structures (RMSD of 0.84 Å over 124 C<sub>α</sub> atoms), but there is a shift of the N terminus, a conformational change of residues 7–9 to form a more extensive interaction with β9 and the preceding loop of the neighboring subunit, leading to a slight loosening of the trimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

The closest structural neighbors superpose with RMSDs above 2 Å over no more than 86 C<sub>α</sub> atoms.

Two possibilities would either be that the enzyme provides a catalytic base that by deprotonation activates a water molecule for nucleophilic attack on the γ carbon of SAM, or that a catalytic residue from the enzyme acts as nucleophile and attacks the γ carbon, forming a covalent intermediate with the substrate that subsequently gets hydrolyzed by reaction with a water molecule. In both scenarios, a catalytic amino acid in proximity to the site of hydrolysis would be needed.</p><p>Inspection of the active site shows that Glu69 is relatively close to the site of cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), making this residue the most likely candidate. Another possible residue that could act as a base or a nucleophile is Tyr58, which in such case would need to donate a proton to the nearby Glu105 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). To test these possibilities, Svi3-3 mutants Y58F, E69Q, E69A, and E105Q were constructed, expressed, and purified for in vitro activity assays. The Y58F mutant eluted mainly as monomer, indicating a de-stabilized trimer, while all other mutants migrated as trimers. The activity of wild-type (WT) and mutant Svi3-3 variants in conversion of SAM to MTA was determined at 1 mM substrate concentration. The WT truncated Svi3-3 construct showed an average turnover of 9.5 s<sup>−1</sup> at 25°C, nearly doubled compared to the full length, His-tagged construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jerlström Hultqvist et al., 2018</xref>), but with significant deviation between batches. The mutant enzymes all showed reduced activity compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). For the Y58F and E105Q mutants, activity was fivefold and threefold reduced, whereas for the E69Q and E69A mutants, activity was nearly abolished (4500- and 1500-fold reduction).

An initial complex of Svi3-3 with SAM was generated from docking calculations, which indicated a slight binding preference for SAM over SAH. A total of 100 ns of MD simulation was run for both apo Svi3-3 and the SAM complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The simulation of the complex revealed that the SAM conformation in the active site is very stable, particularly the methionine part (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). The time evolution of the backbone RMSD with respect to the initial structure is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and reaches stability in about 30 ns. In agreement with the experimental structure with SAH, the carboxylate group is strongly stabilized by the backbone amide hydrogens of Glu105 and Ser106, whereas the amino group is primarily stabilized by the side-chains of Glu69 and Gln104 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Moreover, the positively charged methionine S atom is consistently stabilized through a π-cation interaction with the Tyr58 side-chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

The simulations revealed one potential, but not optimally positioned, water molecule for hydrolysis that was stabilized by H-bonds between the backbone of Ser106 and Gln104, but there were no obvious residues within reach to activate this water by acting as a base.</p><p>Glu69 was initially suspected to either work as a catalytic base, activating a water molecule for hydrolysis, or as a nucleophile, attacking the γ-carbon of SAM.

Moreover, the observed SAM configuration relative to Glu69 was not optimal for attack on the γ-carbon of SAM. DFT geometry optimizations furthermore failed to locate any stationary point (transition state) for the attack, suggesting that the role as a nucleophile is also unlikely. Thus, it seems that the main role of Glu69 is to bind and orient the substrate in the active site by accepting H-bonds primarily from the amino group of SAM, but also from the 3’-hydroxyl group of the ribose ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). In fact, the only residue in the active site oriented properly for a potential hydrolase reaction mechanism is Tyr58. However, DFT calculations could exclude the possibility of Tyr58 acting as a nucleophile in such a mechanism.</p><p>Further DFT geometry optimization, however, revealed a completely different mechanism, a unimolecular reaction resulting in the formation of homoserine lactone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). The DFT optimized stationary points shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> indicate that Tyr58 is deprotonated and bridged by a water molecule to the protonated Glu105. Deprotonation of Tyr58 enhances its cation-π interaction with the S atom of SAM and the electrostatic preorganization weakens the bond to the ribose ring. Together with the amino group interaction with Glu69 this makes the configuration of SAM in the active site of Svi3-3 susceptible to intramolecular carboxylate oxygen attack on the γ-carbon. The activation energy for the formation of homoserine lactone in the DFT cluster model was calculated to be 16.8 kcal/mol with an exothermic reaction energy of −5.7 kcal/mol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). These values were rather insensitive to the choice of dielectric constant, as a change from ε = 4 to ε = 80 yields an energy barrier of 16.1 kcal/mol and a reaction energy of −6.3 kcal/mol. However, since our active site cluster model by necessity is limited in size, it seems possible that the predicted net proton transfer from Tyr58 to Glu105 could be caused by the DFT optimization disfavoring ion pairs with charge separation over a larger distance (Glu-…TyrOH…S+), and instead moving the proton from Tyr58 to Glu105 (the initial configuration had the proton on Tyr58). In order to examine this issue, the reaction energetics were recalculated with the proton constrained to remain on Tyr58, maintaining the standard protonation states of the tyrosine and Glu105. This, in fact, yielded very similar energetics with a barrier of 15.5 kcal/mol and a reaction energy of −6.1 kcal/mol (ε = 4), indicating that the proton relay is not a necessary feature of the reaction mechanism. In the product state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), Glu69 shares a proton with the amino group of SAM, and a water molecule makes strong hydrogen bonds with Tyr58 and Glu105, irrespective of protonation state at the start of the reaction. This water appeared to be a good candidate for nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon of homoserine lactone, thereby forming a tetrahedral intermediate which could break down to homoserine. The calculated barrier for this step is 17.5 kcal/mol, which is not unrealistically high, but the reaction energy for the tetrahedral intermediate is 25.2 kcal/mol relative to the homoserine lactone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Thus, the DFT calculations indicate that Svi3-3 forms homoserine lactone, but that further breakdown to homoserine does not occur in the active site.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Density functional theory (DFT) calculations on the S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) lyase reaction of Svi3-3.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Optimized DFT structures for the reactant (left), transition (middle), and product (right) state in the SAM lyase reaction mechanism.

There is no previously established reaction mechanism for these enzymes, and to our knowledge there are only two previous examples of enzymes that can cleave a trialkyl sulfonium substrate. A distinct type of SAM lyase, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase (ACC synthase, EC 4.4.1.14) exists in higher plants and some fungi. The products of this enzyme are MTA and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate that is used in the biosynthetic pathway for ethylene. The reaction is PLP-dependent and the enzyme is structurally and mechanistically unrelated to the phage encoded SAM lyases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Capitani et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Instead, Svi3-3 shows structural similarity to PII and PII-like proteins, many of which bind nucleotides or nucleotide-derived metabolites in the inter-subunit clefts. Despite very low levels of sequence identity within those families, they have been suggested to have arisen by divergent evolution from a common ancestor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Forchhammer and Lüddecke, 2016</xref>). Based on this similarity, we tested binding of ATP, ADP, and AMP to Svi3-3 by DSF, but detected no interaction. Still, these two families of enzymes may have a distant evolutionary relationship.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Substrate binding</title><p>Svi3-3 forms a trimer in solution both in the absence and in the presence of substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thermal shift binding experiments showed a major stabilization of Svi3-3 upon binding of MTA or SAH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Comparisons of the apo and ligand-bound structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) as well as MD simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) indicate that stabilization is caused by tightening of the trimer around the ligand. Results presented here show that E69 in Svi3-3 plays a critical role in the enzyme, and the failure in getting crystals of an E69Q mutant with SAM suggests that binding of SAM may be associated with conformational changes that are incompatible with crystal packing or with the crystallization conditions. The observation that the E69Q mutant binds SAM but does not bind SAH indicates that although SAH only lacks one methyl group compared to SAM, the complex structure of WT Svi3-3 with SAH may not fully mimic the substrate-bound state. Since MTA and SAH show a perfect overlap between the two structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), any such difference in binding mode between SAM and SAH is likely to involve the methionine end of the substrate, where MD indicates that Tyr58 forms a cation-π interaction with the positively charged sulfur. The reason why the E69Q mutant does not bind to SAH may be that two important interactions are lacking; Q69 cannot accept two hydrogen bonds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and there is no positive charge on the sulfur that can participate in the cation-π interaction with Tyr58 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Phage-encoded SAMases are lyases</title><p>Prompted by DFT calculations producing high energy barriers for a hydrolysis reaction within the active site of Svi3-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), the TLC assays and NMR show unambiguously that Svi3-3 is a SAM lyase forming homoserine lactone and MTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). The lactone is spontaneously converted to homoserine in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wu et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s3">Figure 9—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Previous attempts to set up a coupled SAM hydrolase activity assay for Svi3-3 using homoserine dehydrogenase or homoserine kinase failed to show homoserine production with the same rate as MTA production (data not shown). The observed rates were 1000-fold lower, and we can now explain that this is due to the slow and un-catalyzed formation of homoserine from the homoserine lactone that is enzymatically formed.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Mechanism of S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) degradation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The first step is catalyzed by the SAM lyase, releasing the products homoserine lactone and 5’-methyl-thioadenosine (MTA).

Thus, Svi3-3 increases the reactivity of the carboxylate group by excluding water from the corresponding part of the active site, while stabilizing a reactive conformation of the substrate. For this unimolecular reaction mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>), only very few strictly conserved residues are required, as illustrated in the multiple-sequence alignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Both hydrogen bond acceptors of Glu69 seem critical for stabilization of the reactive state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>), and Svi3-3 E69Q has nearly abolished activity. However, the effect of the corresponding mutation in T3 SAMase is not quite as dramatic. Since the level of sequence identity between the two enzymes is low, there will be many differences in the active site, and additional interactions may contribute to stabilizing the reactive state for the same mechanism in T3 SAMase.</p><p>The only previously partly characterized phage SAMase comes from phage T3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hausmann, 1967</xref>).

The first structure from the SAM lyase enzyme family that we present here clearly proves that they have no structural similarity to the OCR protein.

In the early literature, homoserine lactone was identified as an intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gold et al., 1964</xref>) but, perhaps due to the available methods at the time, it was not realized that homoserine was formed on a different time-scale from MTA, indicating a spontaneous and not enzyme-catalyzed reaction.

The docking grid was generated with the OPLS3 force field centered on the SAH inhibitor bound to the active site of the Svi3-3 crystal structure. Due to an error in our library file, the force field parameters of the base were taken from tubercidin instead of adenine, but the charge distributions of these two bases are almost identical. The Maestro system builder (Schrödinger, n.d.) was used to solvate the Svi3-3 trimer with TIP3P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jorgensen et al., 1983</xref>) water molecules in an orthorhombic box with buffer distances of 10 Å to the boundary on all sides. The system was neutralized by addition of Na<sup>+</sup> ions and the final simulation box consisted of 60,972 atoms. A total of 100 ns MD simulation at 298 K was run in the NPT ensemble using the reference system propagator algorithm (RESPA) time stepping scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tuckerman et al., 1991</xref>) with time steps of 2 fs for bonded terms, 2 fs for van der Waals and short-range electrostatic interactions, and 6 fs for long-range electrostatic interactions.

A cluster model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>) was generated from a snapshot of the equilibrated Svi3-3 X-ray structure taken from the MD simulation described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>). This snapshot is a typical representative displaying the key interactions shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>. The active site model was composed of the backbone atoms of Val17, Gly18, Leu19, Asn20, and Val21 chopped at the N and C termini, Tyr58 and Glu69 chopped at the CA position, and Gln104, Glu105, and Ser106 (with backbone) chopped at the N and C-termini. A smaller substrate mimicking SAM was used for the DFT calculations. Here, adenosine was deleted from SAM, resulting in 2-ammonio-4-((R)-ethyl(methyl)sulfonio)butanoate, or S-ethylmethionine (SEM). In addition, a total of six water molecules from the MD snapshot were included in the cluster model, which includes the first two solvation shells of the reaction center. To account for the steric effect of the surrounding parts of the protein, atoms in the chopped positions were kept fixed to their original positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). The final model after addition of methyl groups to the chopped protein positions consisted of 194 atoms (716 electrons). In general, cluster models comprising ~200 atoms have been found to be sufficiently reliable for mechanistic investigations, provided they include all key protein residues involved in the reaction, and have also been shown to be relatively insensitive to dielectric effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Siegbahn and Himo, 2009</xref>). However, as noted above, ion-pair configurations with charge separation over a large distance may be disfavored, and we thus also recalculated the reaction energetics with the system constrained to the standard protonation state of Tyr58 and Glu105, which was also the initial configuration for the optimization.</p><p>All DFT calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Frisch et al., 2009</xref>) package. Geometry optimizations and frequency calculations were computed with the B3LYP functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Becke, 1993</xref>) and the 6-31G(d,p) basis set.

Intrinsic reaction coordinate calculations were performed in both directions from the transition state to verify that the correct minima are connected. Solvent effects were obtained by single-point calculations on the optimized stationary points with the solvent model based on density (SMD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marenich et al., 2009</xref>). Electronic energies were calculated from single-point calculations on the optimized geometries (RS, TS, and PS) at the b3lyp/6-311G+(2d,2p) level of theory.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Cynthia Wolberger as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Vincent Moliner (Reviewer #2); Inaki Tunon (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>In general, all reviewers found that the study is comprehensive and convincing. The combination of structural, biochemical and computational studies consistently supported that the enzyme is, in fact, a lyase rather than a hydrolase. The finding is significant and should be published in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>However, there are some concerns about the specific cluster model used in the computational analysis. In particular, there is the question of whether the unusual protonation pattern observed in the DFT calculations reflects the small size of the cluster, and to what degree does this specific protonation pattern contribute to catalysis. If the contribution is significant, then it is important to conduct additional calculations for the relevant mutant (E105Q) to explain why its catalytic activity was found to be only slightly reduced as compared to the WT enzyme.</p><p>The reviewers also suggest to clarify several computational details and the experiment with the decarboxylated SAM (dcSAM).</p><p>Finally, several typos in the manuscript have been noted.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this study, the authors combined a range of experimental and computational approaches to analyze the structure and function of a phage-encoded SAM lyase. The prediction from DFT study was confirmed by experimentally analyzing the product of the enzyme and use of a SAM analog without the key carboxyl group. All the evidence combined supports the notion that the enzyme is actually a lyase, rather than a hydrolase as historically annotated.</p><p>Overall, I find the study to be quite comprehensive and convincing; it is a nice demonstration of integrated computational and experimental mechanistic investigation. The only question I have is that the DFT cluster analysis seems to indicate a deprotonated Tyr58 and protonated Glu105. To what degree this is due to the neglect of the protein environment? How important is it to catalysis? If this &quot;reverse protonation&quot; is in fact important to catalysis, how do we explain the minor effect of the E105Q mutation found experimentally? It would be informative to analyze the effect of mutation computationally with both DFT and MD simulations.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript reports the first phage S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) degrading enzyme (SAMase) structure, in complex with a substrate analogue and the product 5'-methyl-thioadenosine (MTA). Authors use molecular dynamics simulations, quantum-mechanical calculations, thin-layer chromatography and NMR spectroscopy to study the mechanism of action and to propose that this family of enzymes are not hydrolases (as believed from 1960s!) but lyases. In addition, sequence analysis, in vitro and in vivo mutagenesis support that T3 SAMase belongs to the same structural family and utilizes the same reaction mechanism.</p><p>In all, the subject of the study is of interest, the calculations are well performed and complement the experiments (which I cannot review) that support the conclusions. Moreover, the manuscript is well structured and written. This reviewer has just a few concerns that authors should address before the manuscript was recommended for publication. These are as follows:</p><p>1) A total of 100 ns of MD simulation was run for both apo and holo Svi3-3 to equilibrate the systems. I wonder if the time dependence of the RMSD can be reported in the SI. Also, I wonder if structures after the MD simulations can be compared in deep with the X-ray structure?</p><p>2) I have detected some typo errors that should be polished (i.e. &quot;…Svi3-3 is most flexible in the regions…&quot;.</p><p>3) I would suggest to change the title of the section &quot;Computational studies….&quot; to &quot;quantum-mechanical studies…&quot; because the previous section of molecular dynamics is also a computational study.</p><p>4) QM study of the mechanism was carried out with a reduced cluster model, and the effect of the protein environment is mimicked with a continuum model. Authors should comment on the limitations of this method.</p><p>5) Regarding the previous comment, isn't the reduced model too small? According to Figure 6A, the QM atoms (including the reacting breaking and forming bonds) look to be too close to the interface with the continuum model they use to treat the protein environment effects.</p><p>6) A reference is missing in the third paragraph of the subsection “Phage-encoded SAMases are lyases”.</p><p>7) I would suggest to add more information in the setting up of the model for the MD simulations.

The work unequivocally characterizes this protein as a SAM lyase. The set of structural, kinetic, mutational and theoretical experiments carried out on this protein are convincing. Results are also nicely presented, being easy to follow the reasoning of the authors. I am thus happy to support the publication of this nice study.</p><p>As is almost always the case, there are a number of issues that should be considered by the authors in order to improve the manuscript. Being myself a computational chemist, I will limit most of my comments to that part of the work.</p><p>1) I am not really a fan of cluster model calculations because one is limited to a single structure and then to a single reaction path. However, I must admit that this can be enough for the purpose of identifying a reasonable reaction mechanism. However, a critical point in this approach is the selection of the starting point. In this case the authors took an unusual protonation state for the reactants. If that state is not the most stable then the barrier could be artificially reduced, resulting in a reasonable value for an enzymatic reaction, as it is the case here. In my opinion, the authors need to explore other protonation states (with a neutral Tyr58 and an unprotonated Glu105) as possible reactants states and must show that their choice is the adequate one. One must take into account that the use of truncated models could bias the selection of the protonated state.</p><p>2) Related to my previous comment, did the authors carry out molecular dynamics simulations in the selected protonation state? Is that state stable too?</p><p>3) How did the authors select the initial geometry for DFT calculations? Can the results depend on this choice?</p><p>4) I have some doubts regarding the experiments carried out with decarboxylated SAM (dcSAM). Can the authors discern if the observed lack of lyase activity is due to the fact that dcSAM doesn't bind to the enzyme or to the absence of reactivity after binding?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.61818.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] Overall, I find the study to be quite comprehensive and convincing; it is a nice demonstration of integrated computational and experimental mechanistic investigation.

The problem with ion-pairs with charge separation over a relatively large distance is now discussed in detail in the Results. As a check of the effect of the proton relay, we now recalculated the reaction energetics with the proton constrained to remain on Tyr58. It turns out that this has very little effect on the barrier and reaction energy, so that the location of the proton is not really relevant for the overall unimolecular mechanism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] This reviewer has just a few concerns that authors should address before the manuscript was recommended for publication.

However, they are very useful for exploring different mechanisms since those that are too high in energy can be confidently excluded. This is now clarified in the Materials and methods. The initial structure for the DFT optimizations had the standard protonation states. We now also examine the effect of the proton relay in the Results (see response to reviewers 1 and 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Related to my previous comment, did the authors carry out molecular dynamics simulations in the selected protonation state? Is that state stable too?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not do any MD with the deprotonated Tyr58. The Tyr-H2O-Glu-substrate hydrogen bonding pattern is very stable and involves strong H-bonds, so moving the hydrogen from donor to acceptor will not change this pattern and is not expected to cause any significant structural effects in the active site.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) How did the authors select the initial geometry for DFT calculations? Can the results depend on this choice?</p></disp-quote><p>It is now clarified in the Materials and methods that the initial structure is a representative snapshot that obeys the H-bond populations in Figure 6—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) I have some doubts regarding the experiments carried out with decarboxylated SAM (dcSAM). Can the authors discern if the observed lack of lyase activity is due to the fact that dcSAM doesn't bind to the enzyme or to the absence of reactivity after binding?</p></disp-quote><p>Most probably this is caused by dcSAM not binding to the enzyme. Addition of the SAM-dcSAM mixture that was tested in activity assays (Figure 8—figure supplement 1 in the revised manuscript) does not increase the thermal stability of Svi3-3 beyond what the remaining SAM+MTA does. Since even binding of the smaller ligand MTA leads to thermal stabilization, this suggests that dcSAM does not bind to Svi3-3. We have modified the title of this paragraph to “The carboxyl group of SAM appears essential for Svi3-3 binding” and re-written the last sentence of the corresponding paragraph to make this as clear as possible:</p><p>“However, in a DSF assay, dcSAM does not induce a thermal stabilization of Svi3-3, suggesting that the carboxyl group of SAM may be required for binding to Svi3-3.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
