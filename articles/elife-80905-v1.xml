The National Board of Health and Welfare decided in 2015 that screening of 30- to 70-year-old women should primarily be performed with an HPV test and screening of 23- to 29-year-old women with cytology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">National Board of Health and Welfare, 2015</xref>). However, 5 years later when surveyed during the autumn of the pandemic, 5/21 regions in Sweden had still not implemented the national program. Self-sampling targeting long-term non-attenders as a method to increase population coverage was recommended but was rarely used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Swedish National Cervical Screening Registry, 2021</xref>). There was school-based vaccination of both girls and boys (with high population coverage) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">National Board of Health and Welfare, 2022</xref>) but no consideration of strategies for an even faster strategy to eliminate cervical cancer by concomitant screening and vaccination of young women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dillner et al., 2021</xref>). Although HPV testing has been shown to have higher sensitivity in all age groups and higher specificity for women aged 30 or older compared to cytology-based screening, it was previously not recommended below 30 years of age largely because of the high prevalence of HPV infections, most of which will be cleared without causing cellular lesions or cancer, leading to overdiagnosis and overtreatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arbyn et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Leinonen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ronco et al., 2014</xref>). However, an increasing proportion of young women that are entering the screening program have been vaccinated, resulting in lower HPV prevalences and lower predictive values of screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Lei et al., 2020b</xref>). Cellular abnormalities among young, vaccinated women are still seen, but typically contain only non-progressive HPV types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kann et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In April of 2020 all non-emergency healthcare was stopped in the capital region of Sweden because of a severe COVID-19 outbreak. Consequently, 192,000 cervical cancer screening invitations with appointments were canceled. In June the same year, the screening program was allowed to restart but the midwife clinics could not be used for screening as usual, to avoid crowding. The Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare enacted a temporary regulation that (1) allowed for primary self-sampling instead of clinician-based sampling and (2) allowed for primary HPV-based screening in all ages between 23 and 70 years of age. It is well known that when self-samples are analyzed using an HPV assay based on polymerase chain reaction, the sensitivity is not inferior to samples taken by medically trained staff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arbyn et al., 2018</xref>) and that self-sampling can be used to increase population coverage of screening, with improved attendance among under-screened and hard-to-reach women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Elfström et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Winer et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Study population and data collection</title><p>Most data in this report derive from publicly available data on new Swedish regulations and strategies used during the pandemic (major official websites <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.socialstyrelsen.se">https://www.socialstyrelsen.se</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.regeringen.se">https://www.regeringen.se</ext-link>). Results on population coverage and number of screening invitations/self-sampling kits sent are derived from the website of the Swedish National Cervical Screening Registry of Sweden (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nkcx.se/">https://www.nkcx.se/</ext-link>). The registry collects all data on cervical screenings and invitations in Sweden and compares the data to aggregated data from the population registry to calculate the population test coverage of screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Elfström et al., 2016</xref>). To evaluate the contribution of clinician taken samples or self-samples on the population test coverage of the organized screening program, the population coverage was calculated stratified by mode of sampling (self-sampled or clinician sampled) by year, age group, and calendar year.</p><p>The registry linkages using the NKCx were approved by the National Ethical Review Agency of Sweden (decision number 2023-00289-02). The agency is appointed directly by the government of Sweden, chaired by a senior judge and has the authority to determine requirements for consent, was not required for this study. Key factors in the ethical consideration include whether the integrity risks were minimal (strong security measures and limited access to data) and benefits and disadvantages of the research. In this case, population-based estimates were sought, which by definition means that the entire population is studied.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The number of cervical screening invitations sent per month in the Stockholm region during 2019 and 2020 is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. The formal decision to cancel all screening was effective April–June 2020, during which time there was a severe COVID-19 outbreak in the Stockholm region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Pimenoff et al., 2021</xref>). When screening was re-initiated in the second half of 2020, only a limited number of invitations were allowed per screening station in order to avoid crowding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). During the second half of 2020, only women invited for their first cervical screen and women due for follow-up after abnormal screening results were invited to clinician sampling. Clinician-based sampling was also recommended for women who were pregnant when they received their invitation to self-sampling. There were preparations for a switch to primary self-sampling as the prime screening modality, which was launched in March 2021. Except for women at first cervical screen, pregnant women and follow-up after abnormal screens, self-sampling kits were mailed to all eligible women in the population (direct send instead of invitation to maternity care clinic – no requirement of having to order the kit). A detailed description of the self-sampling kits and their use can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Elfström et al., 2019</xref>.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Number of invitations to cervical cancer screening in Stockholm by month and year.</title><p>LabID 088 is Karolinska University Hospital (Stockholm region).

This is assessed by importing of files with tests performed from all laboratories (both public and private) in the region and comparing the sampling dates and the personal identification numbers with the population registry of resident women (3) checking that they did not opt out of the screening program. This is not common, but out of the 732,276 resident women in the eligible target ages, 2655 women (0.4%) had opted out of the program. In the switch that was implemented in March 2021, the previous policy of sending an invitation letter with an appointment time for cervical screening at a local Maternity Care clinic was for most women (see above) replaced by sending of a self-sampling kit (including instructions and a pre-paid return envelope). During 2021, approximately 320,000 self-sampling kits were mailed. There was an increase in the population coverage of the organized cervical screening program, from 54% to 60% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The improvement was seen in most age groups and the population test coverage levels approached the test coverage levels in the year before the COVID-19 outbreak when the program was canceled (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). There has been a steady increase in population test coverage over the past decade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

testing. Although HPV testing had been mandated from age 30 and upwards already in 2015, in 2020 there were still 5 counties that did not use it. This changed and since autumn 2021 all counties in Sweden now use primary HPV screening. In the age groups below 30, HPV screening had not previously been recommended because of concerns about over-screening in an age where HPV infections were common. However, HPV prevalences are dropping because of vaccination and the emergency interim guidelines had now allowed HPV screening in all ages.</p><p>After the pandemic, permanent regulations were issued that came into effect on 2022-07-01. These allow choice between primary self-sampling and sampling by a clinician and have also changed the age for HPV screening to be mandated between 23 and 70 years of age. In other words, the changes that were required because of the pandemic have resulted in that huge and permanent improvements could be implemented.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Launch of an even faster cervical cancer elimination campaign</title><p>The EVEN FASTER concept for rapid cervical cancer elimination is based on concomitant HPV vaccination and HPV screening targeting the age groups where the HPV infection is spread (have an effective reproductive number &gt;1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dillner et al., 2021</xref>). HPV vaccination without concomitant testing is most effective among subjects before sexual debut, as they are HPV negative and the vaccine does not prevent infections that have already occurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Lei et al., 2020a</xref>). However, among women after sexual debut who test HPV negative, the vaccine is equally effective as among subjects before sexual debut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Apter et al., 2015</xref>). By concomitant vaccination and HPV screening, HPV negative women will reap the full benefit of protection by vaccination and the HPV-positive women can be followed up as usual in the screening program (and are thus also protected against cervical cancer). Although the first version of the concept of concomitant screening and vaccination was published 7 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bosch et al., 2016</xref>), there had been no consideration of whether to actually implement it.</p><p>After the acute phase of the epidemic, the setting changed. There was a large screening deficit and multiple strategies were needed in order to ensure that it could be managed without adverse effects for the women. Also, very effective mass vaccination campaigns against COVID-19 had been successfully launched and the switch to self-sampling resulted in that Maternity Care Clinics were interested in advancing their offer for in-person visits by providing both vaccination and screening to women coming for their first screening visit.</p><p>It is expected that if there is a strong reduction in the circulation of cancer-causing HPV types, the screening and follow-up efforts can be concentrated to those few women who still test positive for oncogenic HPV types thus greatly improving the ability to cope with the screening deficit and enabling Sweden to faster reach the WHO target of elimination of cervical cancer.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>A large COVID-19 outbreak in the Stockholm region necessitated concentration of healthcare to emergency care and cancer screening was canceled. We describe that the major measures taken to mitigate the screening deficit (organized primary self-sampling and an even faster campaign with concomitant screening and vaccination) resulted in several important and lasting improvements of the cervical cancer prevention program in Sweden.</p><p>The roll-out of primary self-sampling was done in the context of routine screening which means that decisions were made consecutively and the program was adapted as needed to meet the changing dynamics of the pandemic. Therefore, this analysis of the response was completed post hoc. Given that Sweden has a comprehensive registry of all invitations (including mailing of self-sampling materials) and all cervical tests performed in the country, it was possible to perform a detailed description and evaluation of the switch retrospectively. The national even faster campaign with concomitant screening and vaccination was launched as a formal Phase IV trial with the protocol registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> where everyone interested can read the details.</p><p>In the US, there was a 94% reduction of cervical cancer screenings during the initial phase of the pandemic compared to the same period the previous years, and although the screening has partially recovered since then, the cervical cancer screening rates are still 10% below pre-pandemic levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Mast et al., 2022</xref>). Likewise, in England a 43–91% drop per month of received screening samples was observed during the period April to June 2020 and by April 2021 there was still 6.4% fewer samples than expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Castanon et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, although there was a prompt re-initiation of screening through re-opening of screening services and catch-up screening during the period following the initial phase of the pandemic, the impact of the disruption was significant. This contrasts with our findings where the disruption was used as an opportunity to advance the program, with lasting improvements already materializing as a greatly improved screening coverage, lower costs of sample taking and increased use of HPV vaccines.</p><p>Self-sampling in cervical screening is well known to improve participation among women who seldom or never attended screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Sultana et al., 2016</xref>). The increase in population coverage seen is at least in part due to that the sending of self-sampling kits resulted in improved attendance in particular among previously non-attending women.</p><p>As the cancellation of non-emergency healthcare also involved canceling of follow-up and treatment of newly detected screen-positive women, it has been speculated that a rise in cervical cancer would result (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Castanon et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Daniels et al., 2021</xref>). We could, however, not see any such effect in incidence data from the Swedish Cancer Registry (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.socialstyrelsen.se/">https://www.socialstyrelsen.se/</ext-link>), probably because non-emergency healthcare was allowed again in June 2020 after a less than 3 months disruption.</p><p>In summary, the major COVID-19 outbreak necessitated several emergency changes to the cervical screening program. These have resulted in several major and lasting improvements of the cervical cancer prevention strategy that are likely to promote an accelerated elimination of HPV and cervical cancer.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>The publication of official statistics by the National Cervical Screening Registry is supported by these ethical permissions: Swedish Ethical Review Authority.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Cervical cancer screening improvements with self- sampling during the COVID-19 pandemic&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Johannes Berkhof as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Kate Cuschieri (Reviewer #3).</p><p>As is customary in <italic>eLife</italic>, the reviewers have discussed their critiques with one another. What follows below is the Reviewing Editor's edited compilation of the essential and ancillary points provided by reviewers in their critiques and in their interaction post-review. Please submit a revised version that addresses these concerns directly. Although we expect that you will address these comments in your response letter, we also need to see the corresponding revision clearly marked in the text of the manuscript. Some of the reviewers' comments may seem to be simple queries or challenges that do not prompt revisions to the text. Please keep in mind, however, that readers may have the same perspective as the reviewers. Therefore, it is essential that you attempt to amend or expand the text to clarify the narrative accordingly.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) This paper has strong points and uses a rich data set but all three reviewers agree that the conclusion about the effect of primary HPV self-sampling on screening coverage, in particular among underscreened women, is too strong. The authors do not convincingly show that coverage under self-sampling is better than before the pandemic nor that self-sampling has led to improved participation in previously non-attending women. Conclusions should be in line with the presented data and all requests for more detailed information about self-sampling coverage data should be carefully addressed by the authors. The paper would benefit from characterizing the population of HPV self-sampling participants, in particular by showing data on the time to previous screen.</p><p>2) With regard to the HPV EVEN FASTER concept, this approach is interesting and novel but may be difficult to understand. A few more details on the concept would be helpful for the reader as well as more information on the implementation status of the national campaign (reviewer #1 and #2).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The data are interesting, but the analysis and presentation are rather crude. The scientific value of the paper in its current form is limited.</p><p>1. Data in figure 1 and Table 1 seem to come from different sources, but do not match. Why was the reduction in screening coverage only 4% when there were only a small number of invitations in April 2020 – Dec 2020?</p><p>2. The most obvious reason that the screening coverage in 2021 was back at pre-pandemic levels is that the number of invitations was normal again. Please add monthly figures of year 2021 to Figure 1 to illustrate this.</p><p>3. In the abstract, the claim is made that a strategy with organized primary self-sampling has resulted in a major improvement of population test-coverage. The increase was only 4% compared to year 2020 (which is not a major improvement), was not observed in the age range 51-60, and levels did not exceed pre-pandemic screening coverage levels. Therefore, it seems fair to conclude that the improvement was achieved because women were re-invited for screening again. Other countries probably showed similar screening coverage patterns without primary self-sampling when there was no concern anymore about crowding (because of availability of vaccines). Please tone down the claim in the abstract.</p><p>4. The authors also indicate in the discussion that self-sampling may reach underscreened women. The paper would benefit from showing year 2021 coverage data stratified by time to previous screen.</p><p>5. To gain insight into the acceptance of primary self-sampling, please present year 2021 data on the number of women that sent in a self-sampling kit and the number of women indicating that they preferred a provider-collected test.</p><p>6. The authors compare their coverage results with other countries (UK and US) where screening rates remained lower than expected. It is questionable whether this has anything to do with primary self-sampling as countries strongly differ in culture, attitude, trust in authorities, health systems etc. It is imaginable that in some countries, the introduction of self-sampling would actually lead to a decrease in screening coverage because of a low trust in the accuracy of a self-collection test. Please elaborate on this in the discussion.</p><p>7. A big concern about the Covid19 pandemic is that women who received an invitation in the first year of the pandemic did not show up at all. Were some of these women re-invited for self-sampling in 2021?</p><p>8. The authors describe the launch of a concomitant vaccination and screening campaign. No data are presented to show that this campaign was successful. The statement that Maternity Care Clinics expressed interest seems to indicate that this strategy has not yet been implemented and/or endorsed by the health authorities.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>My detailed comments are below.</p><p>Methods</p><p>Perhaps worth stating the formula used to calculate coverage in the methods for clarity.</p><p>Some of the methods mentioned in the abstract are in the results in the main manuscript.</p><p>Results</p><p>In March 2021 when self-sampling was launched as the primary test was that excluding first attenders, those on follow-up and pregnant? If so worth clarifying as currently not clear.</p><p>Further ahead you state the self-sample strategy was implemented in February 2021, is this a discrepancy?</p><p>It was not clear whether the strategy to test and vaccinate at the same appointment was implemented or whether there is evidence that maternity clinics would like to do this but it has not been implemented. I think a bit more background on EVEN FASTER is needed in the methods (or result), I didn't realise it was part of a trial till the discussion.</p><p>Also perhaps clarify whether you wait for the HPV result prior to vaccinating or whether you vaccinate regardless of the HPV results.</p><p>How did laboratories 1 to 3 manage to maintain invitation levels similar to pre-covid but the others did not?</p><p>Discussion</p><p>There was not enough evidence presented in the manuscript to conclude that &quot;The most likely explanation for the large increase in population coverage seen is that the sending of self-sampling kits resulted in improved attendance in particular among previously non-attending women.&quot;</p><p>The fact that coverage was very similar to that observed pre-pandemic suggests that the roll-out of self-sampling may have brought in those that were due to attend in 2020 but were either not invited or were not keen to go in person due t COVID. No evidence is presented on previous screening history of people returning a self-sample.</p><p>Similarly, no evidence was presented on cervical cancer rate, could the authors at least reference national cancer registration? Also, I would worry that the increase in cancer will come in 2023 onwards among women who missed a whole screening round.</p><p>Figure 1 title includes &quot;Laboratory_ID==088&quot; – please delete or add footnote to explain.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I enjoyed reading this manuscript – some comments are below.</p><p>Re &quot;It is well known that when self-samples ……can be used to increase population coverage of screening, with improved attendance among under-screened and hard-to-reach women&quot;.</p><p>I think this is a slight generalisation/overstatement – the magnitude of increase in coverage v much varies according to geography/setting; there have been some exercises/programmes where offering self sampling vs status quo (ie reminder letter) has been modest at best e.g. [The STRATEGIC trial. J Med Screen. 2018 Jun;25(2):88-98].</p><p>Re &quot;Although HPV-testing has been shown to have higher sensitivity in all age groups and higher specificity for women aged 30 or older compared to cytology-based screening.&quot; Again, this is a nitpick but historically the specificity of cytology in women over 30 has exceeded that of HPV testing in countries that had national, organised cytology based programmes with investment in EQA, training mandates etc.</p><p>I appreciate this is a concise manuscript and that one could revert to (15), but as a standalone piece, I was a little unclear on who exactly was eligible/invited for self sampling- I have mentioned this in the public commentary.
