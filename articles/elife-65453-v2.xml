We sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes for patients and healthcare workers (HCWs) across multiple geographically distinct UK hospitals, obtaining 173 high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genomes. We integrated patient movement and staff location data into the analysis of viral genome data to understand spatial and temporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. We identified eight patient contact clusters (PCC) with significantly increased similarity in genomic variants compared to non-clustered samples. Incorporation of HCW location further increased the number of individuals within PCCs and identified additional links in SARS-CoV-2 transmission pathways. Patients within PCCs carried viruses more genetically identical to HCWs in the same ward location. SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing integrated with patient and HCW movement data increases identification of outbreak clusters. This dynamic approach can support infection control management strategies within the healthcare setting.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>genome</kwd><kwd>sequencing</kwd><kwd>healthcare worker</kwd><kwd>healthcare-associated</kwd><kwd>nosocomial</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Health Education England</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ellingford</surname><given-names>Jamie M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Manchester NIHR Biomedical Research Centre</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ISâBRCâ1215â20007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Newman</surname><given-names>William G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Characterisation of SARS-CoV-2 genomic divergence in healthcare-associated outbreaks demonstrates that the inclusion of healthcare workers in contact networks identifies additional links in SARS-CoV-2 transmission pathways.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The severeÂ acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic continues to place a significant burden on healthcare services worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Miller et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Propper et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Maringe et al., 2020</xref>). Reducing the spread and outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infections is particularly important in hospitals and care homes where individuals at high risk of developing severe responses to infection are vulnerable to transmission due to close and regular contact between patients and healthcare workers (HCWs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Clark et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nguyen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rivett et al., 2020</xref>). Whilst the recent development of promising SARS-CoV-2 vaccines may reduce risk to individuals in hospitals who receive the vaccine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Walsh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Keech et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lodge, 2020</xref>), risk of infection will not be completely mitigated. Standard methods of infection control will continue to be required to ensure patient and HCW safety. Regular and iterative testing for SARS-CoV-2, in both patients and HCWs, underpins approaches that quantify and control nosocomial transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Black et al., 2020</xref>) but will not provide insights into how the virus may have spread throughout an institution, alone. Since the degree to which different groups (patients, HCW) propagate SARS-CoV-2 transmission remains uncertain, the utility of screening approaches to prospectively prevent nosocomial spread is difficult to evaluate. It is well established that HCWs are an important component in pathogen outbreak investigations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Peacock et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wenger et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Swart et al., 2000</xref>). Here, we have integrated viral genome sequencing with patient admissions records and staff workplace information to investigate SARS-CoV-2 nosocomial outbreaks. We demonstrate that such an approach can be used to identify highlyÂ likely nosocomial transmission events of SARS-CoV-2 between HCWs and the patients in their care.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sample demographics</title><p>We generated high-quality sequencing datasets for 173 samples that had been collected from inpatient wards, accident and emergency departments (A and E) and from HCWs across geographicallyÂ distinct hospitals. All samples were collected between calendar week 11 (commencing 8 March 2020) and calendar week 23 (ending 6 June 2020). Of the 173 high-quality sequenced samples, 39 (23%) were HCW samples. The remaining 134 samples were collected from patients admitted to a total of 31 wards and units situated across the five hospitals. Forty-fourÂ (25%) of the 173 high-quality samples were from three hospital locations, which had seen sudden rises in SARS-CoV-2-positive cases; an additional 35 samples from these locations failed to meet our quality criteria for sequencing quality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Forty-seven (35%) of 134 patient samples were from A and E departments.

Where RT-qPCR cycle threshold (Ct) values were provided, we found samples with Ct values of 31 or more resulted in lower amplicon yield and frequently failed to meet sequencing coverage thresholds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). In the 173 high-quality samples, we identified 268 genomic variants in comparison to MN908947.3, of which 86 were recurrent variants across samples (rangeÂ =Â 2â126 samples) and 182 were unique to single samples.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Global lineage assignment</title><p>We utilised Pangolin for placement of the 173 high-quality viral genome sequences within the global SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic tree. Eight-seven percent (151/173) of sequenced genomes were confidently assigned to an existing lineage (SH-alrtÂ &gt;Â 80%, UFbootstrapÂ &gt;Â 90%). We identified 11 distinct lineages in our cohort, with a bias towards viral genomes assigned to lineage B.1.1 (71%, 122/173; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). There were no samples assigned to lineage A. Incorporating the calendar week of sample collection into this analysis suggested a constant relative frequency of viral lineage B.1.1 over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Viral lineage B.1.1 was present in samples collected from 29 different wards, including A and E, and in HCWs, and was present in our cohort between calendar weeks 12â23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Local phylogenetic networks implicate nosocomial transmission within hospital wards</title><p>To understand how the viral genomes collected from different areas across hospital sites related to one another we created a local phylogenetic tree rooted to a SARS-CoV-2 genome originally sequenced in Wuhan, China (MN908947.3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Minh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). We overlaid locational origins of the samples (i.e. ward and units from which samples were collected) onto the phylogenetic tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>). We observed clusters within the phylogenetic tree that were formed predominantly from viral genome sequences taken in individual wards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>). For example, 19/31 of the samples in one of these identified clusters were collected from a single hospital ward (<italic>H2_W7</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>).

We adopted national guidelines for definition of nosocomial infection to identify contacts between individuals relative to the date of sample collection for a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Using a contact window of 3â7 days prior to a positive SARS-CoV-2 test (termed herein as <italic>likely</italic> period of infection), we developed a network of patientâpatient contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We identified eight significant clusters of individuals (patient contact clustersÂ [PCCs]), defined by multiple potential contacts between two or more individuals within the likely period of infection for each individual (AâH, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We assessed the pairwise similarity of viral genomes in identified clusters, demonstrating significantly higher viral genetic similarity within clusters compared to non-clustered samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, p&lt;0.001). This trend was further supported by overlaying the PCCs onto the local phylogenetic tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4</xref>). We identified areas of the phylogeny where there was a 20-fold increase, than expected by chance, in potential contacts between a patient and six or more patients with the most closest genetically related viral genome samples. Consecutive windows of increased (20-fold) patientâpatient contacts were merged to identify seven distinct clusters of individuals defined by high level of genetic relatedness of the viral genome sequence and a high degree of potential patientâpatient contacts during the likely period of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Incorporating healthcare worker (HCW) and patient admissions data into the analysis of viral genetic relatedness improves certainty of nosocomial outbreaks.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Network of direct and indirect potential patientâpatient contacts within the window of likely infection (3â7 days prior to positive SARS-CoV-2 test) defines eight significant patient contact clusters (PCCs, <italic>overlaid boxes</italic>); (<bold>b</bold>) network including HCW interactions one week prior to positive SARS-CoV-2 test and patient infection classification.

This was inferred through the presence of patients in the direct workplace of staff members for at least one calendar day in the 7 days prior to a patient testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. We identified 49 potential contacts between HCWs and patients, including 10 HCWs and 18 patients. Incorporating this information onto the local phylogeny expanded the density of contacts within hotspots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4</xref>) and altered the structure of the PCCs within the likely period of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

Moreover, we observed greater genetic similarity within each of the PCCs with HCW interactions incorporated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, p&lt;0.001). For example, HCW_A illustrates that the addition of HCWs created a previously hidden link between PCC_A and PCC_C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>); these newly identified connections increased the number of individuals within viral clusters (VCs), defined as clusters of identical viral samples or viral samples that differed by just a single genomic variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Within the newly defined contact clusters including HCWs and patients, we identified six genetically identical VCsÂ including 18 individuals, and 24 individuals with viral sequences differing by a single genomic variant. The number of individuals in VCs was expanded by including patientâHCW contact networks, over and above those identified using patients alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Temporal patterns within identified patient and HCW contact clusters</title><p>In order to establish the most likely SARS-CoV-2 transmission pathways, we examined temporal patterns within proposed nosocomial outbreaks. We created a median joining network for each of the patient and HCW contact networks and incorporated time of sample collection. As multiple entry points into the outbreaks may complicate inference, we cleaned the data to create median joining networks for the 10 most genetically related viral samples within each cluster (inferred from position in local phylogeny, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>). This identified trends in the datasets that further reinforced the likelihood of nosocomial infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We observed that all identified contact clusters could be rooted back to potential âfounderâ viral samples that occurred early during the suspected outbreak. For example, in PCC_B and PCC_D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), which occurred on the same hospital ward at different time points, the original âfounderâ viral samples contained the novel (at time of sample collection) genomic variant MN908947.3â3228-T-G. EighteenÂ (95%) of 19 viral samples subsequently collected from this hospital ward also contained the same novel variant, at least 16 of these cases were probable or definite hospital-acquired infections. Reducing the quality threshold for sequencing datasets (â¥50% coverage atÂ â¥10ÃÂ coverage) identified the MN908947.3â3228-T-G variant in an additional five samples collected from this hospital location (83%, nÂ =Â 6 additional samples included with modified criteria). These data highlight that samples excluded from our analyses due to sequencing quality criteria may be missing links within SARS-CoV-2 transmission pathways.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Temporal patterns in SARS-CoV-2 genomic similarity identify potential viral transmission pathways within patient contact clusters (PCCs) including healthcare worker (HCW) interactions.</title><p>For each of the highlighted contact clusters, a median joining network is presented with <italic>size</italic> of nodes representing number of samples and <italic>numbers</italic> indicating day of nasal or throat swab collection.

Both of these trends would be expected if single ancestral SARS-CoV-2 sequences were original founders of an outbreak.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we obtained high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences for 173 individuals across five hospitals in the North West of the UK, including both patients and HCWs. We incorporated potential contacts between the two groups into a phylogenetic analysis and comparison of pairwise genetic similarity. Overall, this demonstrated that inclusion of contact data increased confidence in the characterisation of nosocomial outbreaks.</p><p>This work was undertaken across multiple, geographically separate hospitals in the UK with responsibility for the care of large numbers of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients. At the time of analysis, there was no routine SARS-CoV-2 screening of asymptomatic HCWs. Similar to other UK hospitals, the different locations within the hospitals were assigned as either green (SARS-CoV-2-negative) or red (SARS-CoV-2-positive) zones. This strategy, in combination with additional infection control measures such as staff bubbles, is widespread as a method to reduce nosocomial infection. However, as patients tested positive after spending prolonged periods of time in green areas, it became apparent that there were unrecognised transmission events between the two areas or from the community into green zones.</p><p>Viral genome sequencing offers a realistic possibility to track and identify rootÂ causes of nosocomial transmissions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lucey et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Meredith et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we applied genome sequencing to throat and nasal swabs obtained from HCWs and patients. We identified 268 unique genomic variants in the 173 high-quality samplesÂ and placed our samples within recognised global lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). The predominance of a single SARS-CoV-2 lineage meant that precise differentiation of viral samples from individual hospital wards was not possible at this level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). We therefore created a local phylogeny for our sequenced genomes rooted to MN908947.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>) and calculated pairwise similarity in the genomic variants identified in each of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes. It has been previously noted that the low genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 causes complexity in the identification of nosocomial outbreaks, as samples may be genetically identical by chance rather than through transmission between individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Meredith et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gudbjartsson et al., 2020</xref>). Our data reemphasise this low genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2, with a median number of 11 (rangeÂ =Â 2â16) variants identified per sample, and an average pairwise similarity of 61.5% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Integrating our analyses with patient admissions record (available for 104/134 patients for at least one day prior to SARS-CoV-2-positive test) and location of staff workplaces (available for 31/39 HCWs) identified clusters of individuals who had interacted during their most likely periods of infection. These analyses confirmed that individuals who had been in contact during this period were more likely to have genetically more similar viral samples than individuals who had not been in contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>While we cannot exclude that viral samples are genetically identical or similar by chance due to the low genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2, the spatial and temporal patterns of viral genetic relatedness that we observe provide strong evidence for nosocomial transmission amongst both patients and HCWs. These trends are observed in at least five distinct clusters, across three geographicallyÂ distinct hospitals. These are further reinforced by the presence of novel genomic variants (at the time of analysis) transmitting through identified clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>). We suggest these data support the widespread adoption of iterative screening strategies for HCWs who may be pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic shedders of SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Black et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arons et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buitrago-Garcia et al., 2020</xref>). Pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals have been demonstrated to be important contributors to SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rivett et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kasper et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Letizia et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Others have shown that comprehensive characterisation of outbreak clusters can be hindered by the existence of hidden links between individuals, even where all individuals within clusters are known and completely isolated from external contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sekizuka et al., 2020</xref>). In our data, we observed the presence of cohort-specific genomic variants shared between individuals but without a known connection between the sampled individuals. Here, it is likely that missing individuals or connections between surveyed individuals are adding complexity to our analyses. While the use of digital contact tracing is difficult in hospital environments, track and tracing smartphone software could be useful to extend the characterisation of contacts between individuals and to understand the accuracy of the assumptions enforced in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Firth et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ferretti et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we infer contacts between individuals through their presence on the same hospital ward on the same calendar day. This approach identifies individuals within our cohort that are likely to have been in face-to-face contact. We note that this approach has imperfect assumptions but is likely to dilute rather than inflate the statistical significance of the investigations reported in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>).</p><p>Future work may enable additional co-factors to be considered in models for network creation such as infection control measures in place on hospital wards (e.g. personal protective equipment utilised), symptomatic status of individuals, and the length, type, and the proximity of physical contacts between individuals. These approaches are supported by recent data demonstrating that over half of SARS-CoV-2 transmissions occur when individuals are pre-symptomatic and that transmission likelihood increases with the duration and proximity of contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sun et al., 2021</xref>). Collecting data to incorporate these factors into network models in the healthcare setting may enable the generation of more precise binary contact clusters according to specified parameters or the development of weighted networks biased by the relative importance placed on co-factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Firth et al., 2020</xref>). Understanding the concordance of empirical datasets of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, as reported here, and computational models of transmission is an important avenue for future work to identify the most influential factors to decrease the likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in both healthcare and community settings.</p><p>Our data demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing alongside patient admission and staff workplace information can identify transmission events within the healthcare setting. Looking forward, we expect that the adoption of genomic approaches in realÂ time, forÂ exampleÂ within 48 hr, alongside consideration of patient movement datasets will enable rapid identification of linked hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2 infections. Such approaches could optimise infection control management strategies, lead to targeted interventions, reduce nosocomial transmission, and ultimately prevent avoidable harm to vulnerable individuals who acquire COVID-19 whilst in the healthcare setting.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Sample selection</title><p>Throat and nasal swab samples were collected from patients and healthcare professionals based at MFT hospital sites.

For each patient, we identified other individuals within the cohort who were present on the same hospital wards on the same calendar day, leading to potential indirect or direct contacts between patients. This method for defining contacts assumes that close face-to-face contact is the most likely method for SARS-CoV-2 transmission between individuals and aims to identify individuals within our cohort who are most likely to have had such interactions. This assumption is supported through recent meta-analyses concluding that physical distancing of less than 1Â m increases likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 transmission between individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chu et al., 2020</xref>). We assessed all potential contacts for each patient in relation to the calendar day that the positive SARS-CoV-2 nasal or throat sample was collected from the patient. The windows of contacts are defined in accordance with national guidelines for SARS-CoV-2 nosocomial outbreak: community-acquired infection (positive test within 2 days of hospital admission); possible hospital-acquired infection (positive test 3â7 days after hospital admission); probable hospital-acquired infection (positive test 8â14 days after hospital admission); andÂ definite hospital-acquired infection (positive testÂ &gt;14 days after hospital admission). For patientâpatient contacts, we identified any potential contacts within the possible hospital-acquired infection period (3â7 days) and developed a binary matrix. We made additional assumptions for including HCWs in the contact networks, specifically, we assumed that HCWs had direct or indirect contacts with all patients who had been present in their workplace (hospital ward) and assumed interaction between HCWs and patients were constant up to the day of positive SARS-CoV-2 tests for patients â this extended the contact window incorporated into the binary matrix to include any interactions between patients and HCWs in the 1â7 days prior to a patient testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. Networks of potential patientâpatient and HCW contacts were constructed using the ggnet and ggplot packages in R. PCCs were identified as discrete areas of the contact networks that included three or more interconnected nodes where the density of edges outnumbers the number of nodes. Outliers connected to the PCCs were also included if they were not connected to any other PCC. Nodes acting as connecting hubs between distinct clusters were assigned to one of the otherwise mutually exclusive PCCs. Pairwise viral similarity was compared between clusters of the network using a two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Supervision, Investigation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Supervision, Investigation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Supervision, Investigation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Investigation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: The study was conducted to investigate hospital outbreak investigation/surveillance; individual patient consent or ethical approvals were not required.

SARS-CoV-2 transmission in healthcare settings. This work is of importance to health professionals in charge of tracking nosocomial infections and monitoring infection control strategies.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Genomic sequencing and healthcare dynamics track nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 transmission&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, including Niel Hens as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Josh Firth (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) In their study the authors analyse data from 173 high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genomes. They identified eight patient contact clusters based on these 173 SARS-CoV-2 genomes and compare their results with an analysis taking into account patient and HCW movement data which impacts the identification of individuals belonging to the contact clusters.

They identified eight patient contact clusters based on these 173 SARS-CoV-2 genomes and compare their results with an analysis taking into account patient and HCW movement data which impacts the identification of individuals belonging to the contact clusters. It is based on these differences that the authors conclude that the patient and HCW movement data improve the understanding of the role of patient-HCW interactions. I believe the authors should provide a more thorough assessment of this claim.

We have amended the statement to clarify the impact of our findings more explicitly. We believe that the claims in our updated impact statement have been thoroughly investigated in our manuscript, and hope that this clarification also further highlights the novelty of our work. Moreover, we have altered the title and the Abstract of the manuscript to better reflect these clarifications and to more clearly define the emphasis of the investigations in our manuscript.

Patients within PCCs carried viruses more genetically identical to HCWs in the same ward location and improved understanding of the role of patient-HCW interactions.â</p><p>We also acknowledge that other approaches to identify pathogen outbreaks exist, and that healthcare workers have been known to contribute to nosocomial outbreaks. We have added information to the Introduction to reflect this (see below). We also note that the rate of mutation / sequence divergence and the mechanism of transmission is specific to individual pathogens, and therefore investigations in the context of SARS-CoV-2, as described in our study, adds to the current literature and will provide informative knowledge for the accurate tracking and prevention of SARS-CoV-2 nosocomial outbreaks.</p><p>âSince the degree to which different groups (patients, HCW) propagate SARS-CoV-2 transmission remains uncertain, the utility of screening approaches to prospectively prevent nosocomial spread is difficult to evaluate.

How (un)likely is the exclusion of data on patients and HCW that were not sequenced and what impact might be expected from their omission?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point for clarification. We have added some additional text to the Materials and methods section to clarify this:</p><p>âRT-qPCR positive samples were selected for SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome analyses at the Manchester Centre for Genomic Medicine (MCGM; Manchester, UK). We attempted to sequence all available SARS-CoV-2 positive samples from hospital wards highlighted by infection control surveillance officers as potential outbreaks within our sample collection period due to sudden rises in positive cases.â</p><p>Of note, some of the samples that we attempted to sequence failed to fulfil the sequencing quality criteria for inclusion in other analyses. The quality criteria is defined as ââ¥75% of the MN908947.3 reference genome covered by â¥10 high quality reads with at least 50 aligning nucleotidesâ. Samples not matching this criteria included 35 samples collected from individuals on wards highlighted as potential nosocomial outbreaks. We have added some text to the manuscript to further elaborate this point.</p><p>â44 (25%) of the 173 high-quality samples were from three hospital locations which had seen sudden rises in SARS-CoV-2 positive cases; an additional 35 samples from these locations failed to meet our quality criteria for sequencing quality (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1.â</p><p>Moreover we have added additional analyses to the manuscript. These data demonstrate how these restrictions of sample inclusion in subsequent analyses may impact the reported results.</p><p>âReducing the quality threshold for sequencing datasets (â¥50% coverage at â¥10x coverage) identified the MN908947.3-3228-T-G variant in an additional 5 samples collected from this hospital location (83%, <italic>n</italic>=6 additional samples included with modified criteria). These data highlight that samples excluded from our analyses due to sequencing quality criteria may be missing links within SARS-CoV-2 transmission pathways.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors indicate that their work can lead to better tracking and infection control which I believe to be true but they do not provide any specific guidance on how this can be done.

We have added a new paragraph discussing these issues in depth and provided further details in the final paragraph.</p><p>âFuture work may enable additional co-factors to be considered in models for network creation such as infection control measures in place on hospital wards (e.g. personal protective equipment utilized), symptomatic status of individuals, and the length, type and the proximity of physical contacts between individuals. [â¦] Such approaches could optimise infection control management strategies, lead to targeted interventions, reduce nosocomial transmission, and ultimately prevent avoidable harm to vulnerable individuals who acquire COVID-19 whilst in the healthcare setting.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Subsection âPatient Admissions and Movementâ. Some additional mention of the assumptions made here (in terms of inferring contacts in this way) would be useful.

We note there are a number of assumptions that are included in our approach for creating patient contact networks, including the assumption that the presence of two individuals on the same hospital ward on the same calendar day is indicative of close face-to-face contact. We note that this assumption is likely to dilute the statistical signals identified in our analyses (Figure 2) as it is likely that the inclusion of individuals that havenât truly been in contact within contact networks would decrease the similarity in genomic variants between individuals within the same contact clusters. We acknowledge that developing systems to better characterise such contacts would increase the accuracy of the contact networks created, and potentially enable the construction of networks weighted by the types, lengths and proximity of contacts. We have added content to the manuscript to clarify and extend our discussion for all of these points.</p><p>Materials and methods:</p><p>âFor each patient we identified other individuals within the cohort who were present on the same hospital wards on the same calendar day, leading to potential indirect or direct contacts between patients. [â¦] This assumption is supported through recent meta-analyses concluding that physical distancing of less than 1 metre increases likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 transmission between individuals.

(Firth et al., 2020; Ferretti et al., 2020 [â¦] We note that this approach has imperfect assumptions but is likely to dilute rather than inflate the statistical significance of the investigations reported in this study (Figures 1-3).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The text reads &quot;Pairwise viral similarity was compared between clusters of the network&quot; but there is no mention of how âclustersâ within the network were defined/found.
