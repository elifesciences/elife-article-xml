which make them useful in biological research and therapeutic applications. However, traditional nanobody generation methods rely on camelid immunization, which can be costly and time-consuming, restricting their practical feasibility. In this study, we present a phage-displayed synthetic library for nanobody discovery. To validate this approach, we screened nanobodies targeting various <italic>Drosophila</italic> secreted proteins. The nanobodies identified were suitable for applications such as immunostaining and immunoblotting, supporting the phage-displayed synthetic library as a versatile platform for nanobody development.

These features make nanobodies ideal for applications beyond traditional in vitro assays, including live-cell imaging and functional studies. For example, when fused to fluorescence proteins or functional domains, intracellularly expressed nanobodies enable real-time visualization and manipulation of proteins within living cells, providing a useful approach to study cellular dynamics in native environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Rothbauer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Caussinus et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Harmansa and Affolter, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Schnider et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>Traditional methods for nanobody generation, which rely on animal immunization, can be costly and time-consuming and are also limited by immunologic tolerance to conserved antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Banik et al., 2023</xref>). To overcome these challenges, in vitro technologies such as yeast, phage, and ribosome display have emerged as valuable alternatives, enabling the generation of synthetic nanobody libraries for direct antigen selection without animal immunization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Moutel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Zimmermann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">McMahon et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The yeast-display platform, as demonstrated by Kruse and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">McMahon et al., 2018</xref>), has proven exceptionally useful for screening nanobodies that recognize distinct conformational states of target proteins, such as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), facilitating structural studies and functional assays. While yeast display offers benefits such as robust expression and efficient cell-based screening, it also demands substantial antigen quantities and incurs high costs due to the need for magnetic- or fluorescence-activated cell sorting (MACS/FACS). These factors can limit the accessibility of yeast display for high-throughput or resource-limited applications. Moreover, due to limitations in yeast cell transformation efficiency, yeast display libraries have relatively low diversity (10<sup>8</sup> variants in the Kruse yeast library), potentially limiting the chances of identifying high-affinity nanobodies.</p><p>Phage display, meanwhile, is a well-established technology in antibody discovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Smith and Petrenko, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Nagano and Tsutsumi, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Hutchings and Sato, 2024</xref>). Phage display generally requires less antigen, enables precise control over screening conditions (e.g. temperature, pH, chemical composition), and supports rapid, iterative rounds of selection. Given these benefits, we sought to create a phage-displayed synthetic nanobody library to leverage the diversity of a well-designed synthetic library with the added flexibility of phage display, providing an alternative platform for nanobody discovery.</p><p>Here, we describe the construction of a phage-displayed synthetic nanobody library using DNA templates originally used to create a yeast display library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">McMahon et al., 2018</xref>). We validate the platform by screening for nanobodies against a panel of <italic>Drosophila</italic>-secreted proteins, with applications in immunostaining and immunoblotting analysis. This phage display-based platform offers a streamlined, cost-effective solution for nanobody discovery, broadening access to synthetic libraries for biological research and biomedical applications.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Design and construction of phage-displayed synthetic nanobody library</title><p>To adapt the previously developed yeast-displayed nanobody library to a phage display platform, we used existing DNA templates originally reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">McMahon et al., 2018</xref> to construct a phage-displayed nanobody library. In this library, the nanobody sequences include constant framework and designed position-specific variations of three complementarity-determining regions (CDRs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). CDRs form the binding interface between nanobodies and antigens, and thus are crucial for nanobody diversity and specificity. The partial randomization in the residues flanking CDRs recapitulates the observed variations at these positions of 93 unique nanobodies deposited in the Protein Data Bank. The more thorough randomization in highly variable positions within CDRs reflects the high diversity of the library. Moreover, the CDR3 region was designed with varying lengths (7, 11, or 15 residues) to promote diverse binding modes and increase the potential for high-affinity binders, providing an additional dimension of diversity and complexity to the nanobody library.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Design of synthetic nanobody library and antigen-expressing vector.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of synthetic nanobody library design.

The randomization in highly variable positions is indicated as asterisks (*). The frequencies of amino acids in the variable positions are indicated in the bar chart. Cysteine and methionine were eliminated from design to avoid chemical reactivity. The CDR3 region was designed with varying lengths (7, 11, or 15 residues).

M13 bacteriophage contains single-stranded DNA genome packaged within a protein capsid formed by the major coat protein pVIII and the minor coat proteins pIII, pVI, pVII, and pIX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Jia and Xiang, 2023</xref>). To construct a phage-displayed nanobody library, the DNA sequences were inserted into 5' end of pIII sequence in a phagemid vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Next, the phagemid library was introduced into bacteria by massive electroporation. This resulted in a yield of 2.4×10<sup>10</sup> individual clones, suggesting a high level of diversity in the phage library. Following helper phage infection, the phages were packaged in the bacteria periplasm and secreted into the culture medium, producing a phage library with nanobodies displayed on the phage surface via fusion to the pIII coat protein.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Purification of <italic>Drosophila</italic> secreted proteins as antigens for nanobody screening</title><p>Cell-cell communication is primarily mediated by secreted and transmembrane proteins, which is of significant research interest and has therapeutic potential.

The antigen-expression module includes an inducible metallothionein promoter to prevent potential toxicity from constitutive expression, along with a BiP signal peptide for secretion, a FLAG-tag for detection, and a human Immunoglobulin G (hIgG) Fc domain for purification. The second module contains GFP-T2A-PuroR under constitutively active Copia promoter, enabling both GFP-based labeling and puromycin selection in serum-free ESF921 media.</p><p>Following transfection, puromycin selection was used to establish stable cell lines. Initial adherent cultures were adapted to suspension culture to increase cell density for efficient antigen production. Antigen expression was induced with CuSO<sub>4</sub>, after which conditioned media was harvested and the proteins were purified from conditioned medium using Protein A resin.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Nanobody screening with phage-displayed nanobody library</title><p>To screen for nanobodies that bind these antigens, we first coated 96-well MaxiSorp plates with mCherry-hIgG for negative selection and antigen-hIgG for positive selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Then, the phage-displayed nanobody library was incubated with a mCherry-hIgG-coated plate to remove phages with affinity to the plate or the hIgG domain. Next, unbound phages were transferred to antigen-hIgG-coated plates to select phages with affinity to the antigen. After stringent washing, the phages that remained bound to the antigen-coated plate were eluted by infecting bacteria in an ‘elution by infection’ manner. The infected bacteria were used to amplify the selected phages in the presence of helper phages to generate phages used in subsequent iterative selection steps. To enrich for nanobodies with high affinity, in the next rounds of selection, we reduced the antigen amount coated on the plate and increased the number of washing cycles to gradually increase the selection stringency (see Materials and methods).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Nanobody screen for CARPB.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of nanobody screening.

Furthermore, we successfully identified nanobodies against various <italic>Drosophila</italic> secreted proteins using this platform. Our current phage display library has higher diversity compared with yeast display library (10<sup>10</sup> vs 10<sup>8</sup>), potentially increasing the likelihood of identifying high-affinity binders. Additionally, whereas the yeast screening platform requires expensive and tedious MACS/FACS for each round of selection, the phage screening platform has much simpler selection steps and a faster turnaround time, making the phage screening platform a streamlined, cost-effective solution for nanobody discovery.</p><p>The Kruse nanobody library design, which served as the foundation for our work, incorporates optimized randomization within complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) while maintaining a robust framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">McMahon et al., 2018</xref>). We further adapted this design for phage display, enabling greater scalability and access. Unlike many existing libraries that are commercially restricted or require expensive licensing, we have democratized access to our platform by making it openly available for non-profit use to address the field’s broader challenge of limited accessibility to high-quality synthetic libraries.</p><p>Despite its advantages, our library and approach still face challenges. For example, we screened nanobodies against eight <italic>Drosophila</italic> secreted proteins and successfully identified nanobodies for five of them. For the remaining three antigens, we did not observe any monoclonal phage with specific affinity to the antigens after 3 or 4 rounds of selection. Further increasing library diversity, optimizing the screening strategy, and/or improving antigen quality might increase the success rate. Moreover, for these hits we identified, some nanobodies (e.g. Nesfatin-1 nanobodies in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) only showed binding affinity in ELISA and failed to recognize membrane-tethered forms of the antigens, possibly due to low affinity. Further affinity maturation by random mutagenesis or directed evolution might increase affinity of these antibodies to the antigens.</p><p>Overall, we show that our phage-displayed nanobody library provides a highly efficient, cost-effective platform for nanobody discovery. By making this resource openly accessible to the academic and non-profit research community, we hope to foster innovation and collaboration across the scientific community, overcoming financial and technical barriers that have limited the use of synthetic libraries. Our library represents a step forward in addressing the diverse and complex needs of nanobody discovery, offering a valuable alternative to other existing platforms.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

In the past few years, novel approaches have been proposed to gain easier access to such reagents. This manuscript describes an important step forward toward the rapid and widespread isolation of antibody reagents. Via the refinement and improvement of previous approaches, the Perrimon lab describes a novel phage-displayed synthetic library for nanobody isolation. They used the library to isolate nanobodies targeting Drosophila secreted proteins. They used these nanobodies in immunostainings and immunoblottings, as well as in tissue immunostainings and live cell assays (by tethering the antigens on the cell surface).</p><p>Since the library is made freely available, it will contribute to gaining access to better research reagents for non-profit use, an important step towards the democratisation of science.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) New design for a phage-displayed library of high content.</p><p>(2) Isolation of valuble novel tools.</p><p>(3) Detailed description of the methods such that they can be used by many other labs.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for these supportive comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>My comments largely concentrate on the representation of the data in the different Figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made adjustments according to the reviewer’s recommendations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, the authors propose an alternative platform for nanobody discovery using a phage-displayed synthetic library. The authors relied on DNA templates originally created by McMahon et al. (2018) to build the yeast-displayed synthetic library. To validate their platform, the authors screened for nanobodies against 8 Drosophila secreted proteins. Nanobody screening has been performed with phage-displayed nanobody libraries followed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to validate positive hits.

Data are convincing and the manuscript is well-written, clear, and easy to read.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these supportive comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>On the eight Drosophila secreted proteins selected to screen for nanobodies, the authors failed to identify nanobodies for three of them. While the authors mentioned potential improvements of the protocol in the discussion, none of them have been tested in this manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We prepared all eight antigens by single-step IgG purification (see Materials and Methods) without additional biophysical quality control (e.g., size-exclusion chromatography). Consequently, we cannot definitively determine whether the three “no-binder” cases resulted from the aggregation or misfolding of the antigens, versus gaps in our naive library’s sequence space. While approaches such as additional purification steps or affinity maturation of weak binders would likely rescue these difficult targets, comprehensive pipeline optimization is beyond the scope of establishing and validating the phage-displayed nanobody platform. We have clarified this limitation and suggested these strategies in third paragraph of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The same comment applies to the experiments using membrane-tethered forms of the antigens to test the affinity of nanobodies identified by ELISA. Many nanobodies fail to recognize the antigens. While authors suggested a low affinity of these nanobodies for their antigens, this hypothesis has not been tested in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We observed that several nanobodies with strong ELISA signals showed reduced binding to membrane-displayed antigens. This discrepancy may result from low affinity of the nanobodies or differences in post-translational modifications (e.g., glycosylation) and antigen context between secreted IgG-fusion proteins (used for panning/ELISA) and GPI- or mCD8-anchored proteins. In an ongoing work, we have performed affinity maturation of the nanobodies and successfully increased the affinity toward the target antigen. These results will be reported separately.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Improving the protocol at each step for nanobody selection would greatly increase the success rate for the discovery of nanobodies with high affinity.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree that systematic optimization—from antigen preparation (e.g., additionalpurification steps) through screening conditions (e.g., buffer composition, additional affinity-maturation steps)—could substantially increase the success rate and nanobody affinity. These represent important directions for future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Figure 3. The merge of two GFP channels does not make much sense. Can the authors not use artificial colours? And show the panels at higher resolution, such that a viewer can really see and judge what they are seeing? The same comments apply to all Supplementary Figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment. In the revised Figure 3, we have replaced the cyan/green overlay with red/green overlay and used enlarged pictures so that GFP-positive cells and corresponding nanobody staining are clearly visible. We applied the same layout to all relevant Supplementary Figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Figure 4. Also, in this Figure, it is not really possible to see what the authors say one should see. The resolution should be higher, and arrows or arrowheads should point to important structures.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment. In the revised Figure 4A, we have added arrows to point to the immunostaining signal in cells with smaller nuclei and added inset panels to show a closer view of representative NbMip-4G staining.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Images are sometimes quite small and difficult to interpret. For example, Figures S2C-D.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. In the revised figures, we have replaced the cyan/green overlay with red/green overlay and used enlarged pictures that clearly show GFP-positive cells alongside their corresponding nanobody staining.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Supplemental figures are not always cited in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment. To eliminate this misunderstanding, we have updated the Nesfatin1 nanobody screen data as Supplementary Figure 1 and Mip nanobody screen data as Supplementary Figure 2. We have made the corresponding changes in the Results section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
