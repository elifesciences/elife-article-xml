the cell membrane is widely presumed to have functional consequences for subsequent signal transduction. However, it is experimentally challenging to selectively manipulate receptor clustering without altering other biochemical aspects of the cellular system. Here, we develop a microfabrication strategy to produce substrates displaying mobile and immobile ligands that are separated by roughly 1 µm, and thus experience an identical cytoplasmic signaling state, enabling precision comparison of downstream signaling reactions. Applying this approach to characterize the ephrinA1:EphA2 signaling system reveals that EphA2 clustering enhances both receptor phosphorylation and downstream signaling activity. Single-molecule imaging clearly resolves increased molecular binding dwell times at EphA2 clusters for both Grb2:SOS and NCK:N-WASP signaling modules. This type of intracellular comparison enables a substantially higher degree of quantitative analysis than is possible when comparisons must be made between different cells and essentially eliminates the effects of cellular response to ligand manipulation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>EphA2</kwd><kwd>micropattern</kwd><kwd>single molecule imaging</kwd><kwd>receptor clustering</kwd><kwd>supported membrane</kwd><kwd>phase separation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Zhongwen</given-names></name><name><surname>Groves</surname><given-names>Jay T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001381</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation Singapore</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRP001-084</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Zhongwen</given-names></name><name><surname>Oh</surname><given-names>Dongmyung</given-names></name><name><surname>Zaidel-Bar</surname><given-names>Ronen</given-names></name><name><surname>Groves</surname><given-names>Jay T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003399</institution-id><institution>Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZJLab (2018SHZDZX01)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Zhongwen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009708</institution-id><institution>Novo Nordisk Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Challenge Grant Center for Geometrically Engineered Cellular Systems</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Groves</surname><given-names>Jay T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>EphA2 receptor clustering enhances signaling transductions by increasing receptor phosphorylation and binding dwell time of downstream molecules in living cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The cell membrane surface is studded with a broad array of receptor proteins that interact with numerous ligands, which can be soluble, membrane-bound on an apposed cell surface, or associated with the extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Casaletto and McClatchey, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Downward, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Groves and Kuriyan, 2010</xref>). Ligand binding is followed by activation of elaborate signal transduction pathways in the cell, which ultimately mediate cellular decision-making. In the case of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), initial receptor activation after ligand binding involves phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues on the receptors, followed by recruitment of adaptor proteins which mediate activation of additional signaling molecules. The membrane receptors, adaptors, and signaling molecules form complexes to induce immediate local responses, such as actin polymerization, or transduce signals into nucleus, such as through mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade. Assembly of cell surface receptors into clusters or organized arrays is a common feature of cell membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dustin and Groves, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Garcia-Parajo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Janes et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mossman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Salaita et al., 2010</xref>), and has long been implicated as an important factor for modulating signaling activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bray et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cebecauer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jadwin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Oh et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>More recently, receptor clustering in some cases has also been found to involve downstream signaling molecules that appear to undergo protein condensation phase transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Banjade and Rosen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Case et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Huang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huang et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Su et al., 2016</xref>). For example, in the T cell receptor signaling system, linker for activation of T cells (LAT) phosphorylation results in the recruitment of the adaptor protein Grb2 through binding to multiple phosphorylated tyrosine sites on LAT. Grb2 additionally possesses two SH3 domains that bind the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Son of Sevenless (SOS), with the latter also serving as a crosslinking molecule to bridge multiple Grb2 and LAT molecules. The resulting LAT:Grb2:SOS assembly can form a two-dimensional bond percolation network, or protein condensate, on the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Su et al., 2016</xref>). Recent experimental investigations have revealed that the physical form of this network prolongs the dwell time of SOS molecules on membrane, which ultimately establishes a kinetic proofreading mechanism to modulate the activation of SOS and its downstream effector Ras GTPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Huang et al., 2019</xref>). In a similar fashion, the nephrin receptor crosslinks the adaptor proteins NCK and neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP) to form a protein condensate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2012</xref>), which is crucial for N-WASP activation by a similar mechanism as observed with SOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Case et al., 2019</xref>). These discoveries advance a mechanistic understanding of how the spatial assembly of signaling molecules can modulate the chemical outcomes of the system. Furthermore, it is becoming increasingly clear that such signaling assemblies likely play an instrumental role in defining the organization of the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chung et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Freeman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kalappurakkal et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Although receptor assembly and phase transition processes are evident in cellular systems, it remains difficult to precisely define their functional consequences on signaling itself in living cells. A major reason for this is that chemical perturbation of assemblies, such as those achieved with pharmacological agents or mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bugaj et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bugaj et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Davis et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schaupp et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Seiradake et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Su et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wu et al., 2015</xref>), are likely to produce side effects on the cell other than modulating molecular assembly itself. For example, phosphorylation at multiple tyrosine sites on the LAT protein mediates multivalent binding of Grb2 and SOS. Altering the number of these tyrosine sites by point mutations changes LAT clustering levels and subsequent signaling responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Houtman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huang et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Su et al., 2016</xref>). In such experiments, however, the contribution of clustering itself can not generally be separated from effects of the total copy number of involved signaling molecules (which is also changing) as well as other overall changes in cellular responses stemming from altered signaling activity. In fact, this problem is universal in biophysical studies of protein organization in living cells: any perturbation that alters biological function will tend to produce a cascade of cellular effects, which can be very difficult to disentangle. An additional factor that compounds the complexity of signaling outcomes in studies involving a population of cells is the inherent cell-to-cell heterogeneity. These mandate studying individual cells in order to draw robust conclusions on quantitative aspects of signaling.</p><p>To address these issues, we seek to modulate receptor spatial organization by controlling ligand mobility, instead of perturbing intracellular components such as by creating genetic mutations or pharmacological treatments. In this respect, we have previously developed a microfabrication strategy to produce micropatterned hybrid substrates displaying ligands on both immobile, surface adsorbed polymers and mobile supported lipid membranes to simultaneously reconstitute cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions in individual cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). The multicomponent, micropatterned supported membrane substrates also allow for spatially segregated functionalization of different ligands to dissect crosstalk between different RTKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biswas et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biswas et al., 2018a</xref>), in a way that is not feasible with non-patterned supported membrane substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Biswas, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Biswas and Groves, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Biswas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Biswas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vafaei et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yu et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we extend this method to display a ligand of interest in both mobile and immobile configurations, spatially juxtaposed on length scales small enough to enable a side-by-side comparison within an individual living cell. The immobile ligands are displayed on a functionalized poly L-Lysine-poly ethylene glycol (PLL-(<italic>g</italic>)-PEG) scaffold; while the mobile ligands are displayed on supported lipid membrane corrals which allows cluster formation. We employ an in situ UV-ozone lithographic process to selectively remove regions of the PLL-(<italic>g</italic>)-PEG substrate and subsequently replace these with supported lipid membranes.</p><p>Key to this strategy is that the clustered and non-clustered receptors are separated by a few microns and thus experience an identical cytoplasmic signaling state, enabling precision comparison of downstream signaling reactions. In this work, we utilize the micropatterned hybrid substrates to study the ephrinA1:EphA2 signaling system in living cells. EphA2 is a member of the Eph RTK family which is often overexpressed in aggressive breast cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fox and Kandpal, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Macrae et al., 2005</xref>). Clustering is thought to be integral to the ligand-mediated activation of EphA2 and downstream signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Davis et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Salaita et al., 2010</xref>). When ephrinA1 is displayed on a mobile supported membrane surface, clustering upon interaction with EphA2 expressed on the surface of a living cell is readily observed. Here, we reconstituted ephrinA1:EphA2 interactions in both mobile and immobile configurations in individual cells to study the effects of receptor clustering on signaling transductions. Using a series of live-cell imaging and single-molecule tracking experiments, we monitored local signaling events in a spatially resolved manner. The results show that clustering significantly increases EphA2 signaling efficiency by inducing greater receptor phosphorylation and subsequent Erk activation and actin polymerization. Both Grb2:SOS and NCK:N-WASP assemblies were observed in EphA2 clusters. Importantly, the receptor clustering consistently increases molecular binding dwell times, which results in a modulation of their functions. Thus in accordance with other in vitro reconstitution studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Case et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Huang et al., 2019</xref>), our results provide further evidence to support the kinetic proofreading mechanism of molecule activation in biomolecular condensates.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>EphrinA1 displayed on micropatterned membrane corrals are clustered by cells</title><p>With the ultimate goal of elucidating the role of receptor clustering in cellular signaling, we started by microfabricating substrates containing micron-scale supported membrane corrals displaying mobile ephrinA1 to reconstitute ephrinA1:EphA2 juxtacrine complexes on synthetic substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). For this, biotinylated poly-l-(lysine)-grafted-polyethylene (glycol) polymer (PLL-(<italic>g</italic>)-PEG-Biotin) was first coated on a glass coverslip, followed by selective deep UV lithography with a photomask (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The deep UV-exposed PLL-(<italic>g</italic>)-PEG-Biotin was efficiently degraded and washed away, as ascertained by atomic force microscopy measurement after this step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Supported membranes were then assembled on the cleared glass area by vesicle fusion method, and subsequently functionalized with Alexa680-labeled ephrinA1 via Ni-NTA:poly-histidine interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nye and Groves, 2008</xref>). In addition, biotinylated cyclic RGD peptide was functionalized to the PLL-(<italic>g</italic>)-PEG-biotin through Dylight405-labeled NeutrAvidin conjugation. RGD can engage integrins to allow cell spreading, during which cells can interact with multiple ephrinA1-functionalized supported membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). Fluorescent images confirmed successful functionalization of the supported membranes with ephrinA1, and their spatial segregation from RGD areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

In our living cell system, the simultaneous presentation of clustered and non-clustered EphA2 in a single cell enables a precise comparison of Grb2 dwell time (or off-rate, K<sub>off</sub>=1/dwell time) by single-molecule imaging. Grb2-tdEos fluorescence emission spectrum can be photo-switched by UV excitation. A short UV (405 nm) exposure resulted in the illumination of a small amount of Grb2-tdEos in the red channel, which was then imaged at a rate of 20 frames per s (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>).

The apparent diffusion of Grb2-tdEos molecules was largely confined due to restricted EphA2 receptors either through clustering on mobile areas or by the fixed ligands on immobile areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The coordinates of every Grb2 molecule in a continuous movie were then assembled to generate a high-resolution localization image (also termed single-particle tracking Photo-Activation Localization Microscopy; sptPALM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Manley et al., 2008</xref>), which clearly showed clustering of Grb2 in mobile ephrinA1 corrals while relatively uniformly distributed in immobile corrals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). By mask-separating these two regions, we found that Grb2 has a longer dwell time distribution on clustered ephrinA1:EphA2 complexes, in comparison to the non-clustered ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). A membrane localized CAAX-tdEos control was used to measure the photobleach rate under the same experimental condition, which was significantly slower than the apparent Grb2 binding dynamics.

On average it increased Grb2 dwell time from 451 ms in immobile areas to 508 ms in mobile areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Notably, the cell-to-cell variations of dwell time are in a similar level to the mobile-to-immobile differences; therefore, only a side-by-side comparison of each individual cell made it possible to detect the increase of Grb2 membrane dwell time induced by clustering. By counting molecule appearances in mobile or immobile regions, we found that clustering increases Grb2 association rate (Kon) by about 60%, a value commensurate with the increase of phosphorylated EphA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

In this respect, lateral diffusion of membrane receptors is critical in controlling their clustering and thus the assembly of signaling complexes. The microfabrication technology described here provides a straightforward way to produce synthetic substrates displaying mobile and immobile ligands for monitoring clustering-dependent receptor signaling in individual cells. The utility of this technology was clearly demonstrated by the observation of increased phosphorylation of clustered EphA2 compared to the non-clustered ones. Our results indicate that ephrinA1 ligand binding alone, without subsequent clustering, is not sufficient to induce or maintain EphA2 receptor phosphorylation. The increased local density of ephrinA1:EphA2 complexes, within clusters as occurs on mobile membrane corrals, is likely to promote trans-phosphorylation and activation of the receptor kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wiesner et al., 2006</xref>). It is also possible that the clustered receptors could much more rapidly and efficiently re-phosphorylate each other after dephosphorylation. Additionally, phosphatases may be physically excluded from EphA2 clusters, in a manner similar to that observed in the immunological receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Davis and van der Merwe, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">James and Vale, 2012</xref>). Possibly a combination of these mechanisms gives rise to the amplified EphA2 activation when they are clustered. While these concepts have been previously considered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Davis et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Janes et al., 2012</xref>), the methods we present here enable quantification of the effects of clustering on various aspects of the signaling pathway.</p><p>Two recent studies on LAT:Grb2:SOS and Nephrin:NCK:N-WASP systems proposed a kinetic proofreading model in biomolecular condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Case et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Huang et al., 2019</xref>). The key principle is that there is a time lag between molecule recruitment and activation. Therefore, molecular timing functions as an important gating mechanism to drive non-equilibrium signaling responses: the long-dwelled molecules in phase-separated clusters are likely to be more productive in multi-step enzymatic reactions. This model was primarily inferred from simplified in vitro reconstitution experiments. Here, we found that both Grb2:SOS and NCK:N-WASP signaling molecules are condensed in EphA2 clusters in living cells, possibly forming a two-dimensional network. Importantly, these molecules dwelled longer inside the clusters, which is in agreement with the kinetic proofreading model. Only side-by-side comparison of mobile and immobile receptors made it possible to detect such differences in living cells.</p><p>However, the live cell results still differ from reconstitutions to some extent. The increase of molecular dwell times measured here in the receptor clusters in cells is smaller than observed in similar reconstitution studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Case et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huang et al., 2016</xref>). There are several possible reasons for this. (1) EphA2 clusters may not be directly comparable with LAT/Nephrin clusters. EphA2 also has multiple phosphotyrosine sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fang et al., 2008</xref>), but the physical organization of molecules inside the clusters remains to be elucidated. (2) It is possible that other factors, such as phosphatases, present in the live cell modulate the overall kinetic behavior. (3) The most likely explanation, perhaps, is that the average dwell time simply fails to capture the relevant aspect of the system. In the case of Ras activation by SOS, signaling activity is predominantly driven by a small number of activated molecules and is not reflective of the average (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Huang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huang et al., 2016</xref>). Small numbers of very long dwelling molecules would not likely be observed in these live-cell experiments due to photobleaching and other imaging noise sources. The absolute dwell time is almost impossible to be deconvolved from photobleaching effects in current live-cell measurements, given the fact that the optical performance of fluorescent proteins cannot match organic dyes used in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2021</xref>). Higher spatial and temporal resolution is still needed to delineate more detailed mechanisms of how biomolecular condensation modulates signaling efficiency.</p><p>In conclusion, EphA2 clustering enhances both receptor phosphorylation and binding dwell time of downstream signaling molecules in living cells, providing further evidence to support the kinetic proofreading mechanism of molecular activation in biomolecular condensates. While we have investigated EphA2 receptors in the current study, the technology described here could be extended to investigate other membrane-localized receptor systems. Further, the substrates developed here could be directly utilized in the screening of pharmacological agents to target diseases that involve clustering-dependent receptor signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lohmüller et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Salaita et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">MDA-MB-231</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">ATCC Cat# CRL-12532, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0062">CVCL_0062</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">PC-3</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">ATCC Cat# CRL-7934, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0035">CVCL_0035</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Chlorocebus aethiops</italic>)</td><td valign="top">COS-7</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">ATCC Cat# CRL-1651, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0224">CVCL_0224</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Provided by UCB Cell Culture Facility</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-EphA2 (Rabbit monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Cell Signaling Technology</td><td valign="top">Cat# CST 6997 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10827743">AB_10827743</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IF(1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2) <break/>(Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Cell Signaling Technology</td><td valign="top">Cat# CST 9101 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_331646">AB_331646</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IF(1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-phospho-EphA2 (Tyr588) (D7X2L) (Rabbit monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Cell Signaling Technology</td><td valign="top">Cat# CST 12677 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2797989">AB_2797989</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IF(1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">Grb2-tdEos (plasmid)</td><td valign="top">DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1203397109">10.1073/pnas.1203397109</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">SOS-tdEos (plasmid)</td><td valign="top">DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1203397109">10.1073/pnas.1203397109</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">CAAX-tdEos (plasmid)</td><td valign="top">DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1203397109">10.1073/pnas.1203397109</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">F-tractin-EGFP (plasmid)</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Maintained in Ronen Zaidel-Bar lab</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">NCK-mEos3.2 (plasmid)</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Cloned in Mechanobiology Institute Core facility, National University of Singapore</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">N-WASP-mEos3.2 (plasmid)</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Cloned in Mechanobiology Institute Core facility, National University of Singapore</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Patterned substrate of mobile and immobile ligands</title><p>Phospholipid vesicles were prepared using previously published methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Galush et al., 2008</xref>). 96% of DOPC (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) was mixed with 4% of Ni-NTA-DOGS (1,2-dioleoylsn-glycero-3-[(N-(5-amino-1-carboxypentyl)iminodiacetic acid)-succinyl]) (Avanti lipids) to form supported membranes. The pattern is fabricated by UV lithography. Briefly, clean coverslips were incubated with PLL-(<italic>g</italic>)-PEG-biotin (50%, Susos) for at least 2 hr. The polymer-coated coverslips were then etched by deep UV (UVO-cleaner 342-220, Jelight) with a designed photomask to generate patterns. Lipid vesicles were then deposited on the coverslips to form supported membranes on the etched surface only. Later, the substrates were blocked by 0.05% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 hr, and then incubated with 1 µg/ml of DyLight-405 NeutrAvidin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 30 min to bind biotin. After rinse, the substrates were then incubated with a solution of 5 nM of ephrinA1-Alexa 680 and 1 µg/ml of RGD-PEG-PEG-biotin (Peptides International) for 60 min for surface functionalization.

To increase tracking accuracy, the density of individual molecules was controlled by 405 nm laser illumination to be about ~0.5/µm<sup>2</sup>. Far-red channel (ex=647 nm, em&gt;655 nm) were acquired before single-molecule recording to localize mobile and immobile ephrinA1 corrals. The autofluorescence on the red channel was completely photobleached before photo-switching Eos by a 405 nm beam. After photo-switching, a small amount of Eos molecules were visualized and recorded by EMCCD with 20 frames per s video rate. Each movie contains 1000 frames for further analysis.

The regions of mobile and immobile ephrinA1 were outlined to generate masks, so the average intensity of different channels can be measured in the same corral and the ratios were calculated after subtraction of noises.</p><p>For live-cell single-particle tracking, a cross-correlation single particle tracking method was used to determine the centroid positions of tdEos or mEos3.2 single molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Oh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Oh et al., 2014</xref>). A trajectory was created by connecting the subsequent xy coordinates through the frames using the nearest neighbor method. The first positions of each trajectory were assembled to generate a localization image. By using pre-acquired ephrinA1 image as a mask, single-molecule signals coming from mobile or immobile ephrinA1 regions were separated to calculate spatially resolved binding kinetics. The dwell time distributions of molecules in the two different regions were fitted with a two-order exponential decay function y=y0+A1e<sup>−t/τ1</sup>+A2e<sup>−t/τ2</sup>, providing two characteristic time constants τ1 and τ2. We noticed the data points become noisy for longer dwell time but this population represents less than 0.5% of the total molecules. We applied this model to fit the vast majority of the data. To be consistent τ2 was used for pairwise comparison of each cell. It is inevitable to avoid short-lived fluorescence events in single-molecule imaging due to the intrinsic power law of fluorescence on/off time. Furthermore, the non-bound cytoplasmic molecules may enter into the evanescent field and go out very quickly. These factors contribute to the short decay time. The second order of exponential decay function is not perfect to estimate the off-rate but it represents the statistic value in our system.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title> <p>The authors thank Professor Michael Sheetz for stimulating discussions.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) More detailed quantification of patch behavior and molecules within patches: Given the variability between patches of clusters in behavior between cells, please provide more detailed quantification of patches within a single cells. Ideally, this would include further analyses including a clustering estimate (as suggested by reviewer 1), tracking particles to estimate diffusivity (as outlined by reviewer 2).</p><p>2) Magnitude and mechanism of effects via phase separation: The reviewers all felt that the effects of clustering on dwell times were more modest than might have been expected based on in vitro systems and also that it isn't definite that the impacts are due to a phase change/physiochemical effects. We suggest bolstering the conclusion that changes in physiochemical properties result in changes to dwell time and signal transduction, by starting with immobile substrates that are approximately equal to the density of the clusters formed with mobile substrates. If a difference remains, then there would be more weight to the authors' claim that a change in physiochemical properties contributes to changed behavior of signaling molecules. Please also more directly discuss the implications of the discrepancy of the impact of clustering on dwell times compared to previous in vitro experiments.</p><p>3) Downstream-signaling impacts: Ideally, we would like to see some read-out of of the downstream signaling pathways such as Erk nuclear localization. This may involve new experiments where single cells are on mobile vs immobile substrates at similar densities as in the patterned substrates reported here. We think these experiments could substantially strengthen the revision but will consider a revision without these if they are too involved. If however you have data that addresses the downstream activity of signaling, we strongly encourage you to incorporate it.</p><p>4) Please address all figure-related and textual issues outlined and suggested by all reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Point 1: In Figure 1, clustering of ephrinA1 by the cell in mobile corrals is certainly visually apparent. However, some quantification of clustering within these regions would also be beneficial. Can the authors perform some simple image analysis to provide a clustering metric, like the one in panel 3C, for example, and use it to compare ephrinA1 clustering in mobile and immobile regions?</p><p>Point 2: Similar to point 1, EphA2 appears clearly clustered in mobile regions in panel 2A. Please provide some clustering quantification of EphA2 in mobile vs. immobile regions. Also, it appears that ephrinA1 and EphA2 are nearly perfectly co-localized in the upper images, while ephrinA1 and pY588-EphA2 are not necessarily as co-localized. Specifically, it appears that pY588-EphA2 occasionally shows some clusters that do not overlap with the ephrinA1 clusters. Why is this? Is this an artifact of the fixing/immunostaining procedure, or can pY588-EphA2 cluster via other mechanisms? Please also provide merged images of the ephrinA1 and EphA2 or pY588-EphA2 channels to show co-localization. Since the merged images will be shown, please adjust the colors to magenta/green for colorblind readers.</p><p>Point 3: In panel 3F, the assembled SOS image seems to show a ring of SOS around the edge of the mobile corrals, while Grb2 forms clusters that seem to more clearly co-localize with ephrinA1 clusters. Why does Grb2 form clusters while SOS forms a different structure? Also, the ephrinA1 mobile corrals corresponding to the SOS image do not appear strongly clustered in 3F, though these corrals do appear clustered in the Grb2 image set. Why is ephrinA1 not clustered with SOS in these images?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The description on p. 9 of the effect of clustering on Grb2 recruitment seems somewhat overstated-if the increase in receptor autophosphorylation is 60% in clustered vs. unclustered patches, the difference in Grb2 binding of 80% is not very &quot;remarkable,&quot; and whether this difference is meaningful or significant deserves some discussion. In other words, could all of the binding differences be explained by differences in receptor autophosphorylation?</p><p>2. in Figure 3F (spt-PALM imaging of Grb2 recruitment), it is interesting to me that the sites of binding appear in many cases to be ring-shaped (that is, concentrated on the outer periphery of the patch), while the clustered receptor itself does not show the same pattern. Some discussion of this and possible mechanisms to explain it would be helpful.</p><p>3. The authors should also mention why two decay constants are used to fit dwell time distributions (p. 16) and why only one of these is used in Figure 3H.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) As constructed, the experiments start with an equal density of ephrinA1 on mobile and immobile substrates. However, upon clustering, the density of ephrinA1:Eph2A in mobile clusters becomes higher in the clustered region than in the immobile region. This clearly illustrates the importance of the rearrangement of Eph receptors on the cell membrane to drive cellular signal transduction. In lines 184-185, the authors claim that there is a physiochemical change (phase separation?) brought about by clustering that contributes to the different results observed between mobile and immobile receptors. However, a direct link between physiochemical properties and signaling is not evident from the experiments performed. The reported differences reported in the ensuing experiments could simply be due to changes in density of receptors attached to mobile substrates. To confirm that there are indeed changes in physiochemical properties that result in changes to dwell time and signal transduction, the authors should start with immobile substrates that are approximately equal to the density of the clusters formed with mobile substrates. If a difference remains, then there would be more weight to the authors' claim that a change in physiochemical properties contributes to changed behavior of signaling molecules. This is important because of the differences in valency between previously investigated clusters, as both LAT and nephrin are multivalent with 3 binding sites for adaptor proteins, and Eph2A which only has a single site. Eph2A clusters may simply be oligomers that share physiochemical properties with the surrounding environment with downstream changes arising from density changes while LAT and nephrin are bona fide phase separated condensates with unique physiochemical properties.</p><p>2) The comparison in Figure 5 is a bit strange because the observed molecules are not analogous. Grb2 and Nck both bind to Eph2A while SOS and N-WASP bind to the adaptor proteins. It would be better to compare the behaviors of either Grb2 and Nck or SOS and N-WASP.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.67379.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) More detailed quantification of patch behavior and molecules within patches: Given the variability between patches of clusters in behavior between cells, please provide more detailed quantification of patches within a single cells.

Specifically, we have now included nuclear Erk activation data comparing mobile and immobile ephrinA1 substrates. Immunostaining of the PC-3 cells with a phospho-specific anti-Erk antibody revealed ~50% increase in the levels of activated nuclear Erk in cells seeded on mobile ephrinA1 substrates compared to the immobile ones.</p><p>The reviewers also raise a much deeper question, of broad significance across the entire field of signal transduction, concerning how much of a physical modulation (e.g. changes in dwell time distribution in this case) is necessary to alter a signal. The newly added experiments mentioned above at least establish that the physical changes induced by mobility restriction propagate downstream to Erk activation. However, it was never our intention to assert that changes in dwell time distribution were uniquely responsible for this. Rather, we are relating the cellular experimental observations here to recent reconstitution experiments that have shown how rare, long dwelling SOS molecules may be primarily responsible for transmitting signals to Ras (<italic>Science</italic> 2019, 363: 1098; <italic>PNAS</italic> 2016, 29: 8218). The point is that the cellular results are consistent with the reconstitution results, but we believe far more work—spanning many aspects of the field of signal transduction and protein condensates—is required to establish proven causal relationships. We have clarified text in the discussion on our interpretation of this data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Please address all figure-related and textual issues outlined and suggested by all reviewers.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed all figure-related and textual issues carefully.

When initially contact by the cell, almost all ephrinA1 molecules inside each membrane patch will come together to form a big cluster. Later, the big cluster is also dynamic, moving from one side to another, or divide into several smaller clusters and moving around. Because of the spatial confinement, those clusters tend to distribute in the periphery of the membrane corral. To better present the dynamic nature of ephrinA1 clustering in our system, we have included snapshots of an ephrinA1 membrane corral before and after cell contact for 30mins (Figure 1C). We also included a quantification of ‘average’ and ‘standard deviation’ of ephrinA1 intensity of each membrane corral underneath the cell (Figure 1 —figure supplement 1D). The standard deviation indicates pixel-to-pixel variation of ephrinA1 intensity. Because of the variation of ephrinA1 clusters, the standard deviation shows a large fluctuation among different corrals compared with uniform distribution in un-contact (un-clustered) corrals, although they all have the same average intensity.</p><p>In immobile regions, the ephrinA1 intensity and distribution won’t change after cell contact.</p><p>Text revision: ‘The cluster is also dynamic, moving from one side to another, or divide into several smaller clusters and moving around, resulting in a great degree of variability as shown by the large fluctuation in the standard deviations of ephrinA1 intensity in each membrane corral (Figure 1 —figure supplement 1D).

The ephrinA1 clusters tend to locate in the periphery of the mobile patch because of the spatial confinement. EphrinA1 and pY588-EphA2 still largely co-localize in mobile regions, especially around the bilayer ring. One thing to notice is that ephrinA1 intensity correlates very well with EphA2 in immunostaining, but it does not necessarily linearly correlate with pY588-EphA2 in the images, which may suggest the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation dynamic of EphA2 receptors. We are not aware of any knowledge of pY588-EphA2 clustering by other mechanisms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point 3: In panel 3F, the assembled SOS image seems to show a ring of SOS around the edge of the mobile corrals, while Grb2 forms clusters that seem to more clearly co-localize with ephrinA1 clusters.

To address the difference between receptor phosphorylation (~60%) and Grb2 recruitment (~80%), we have included Grb2 single molecule on-rate measurement in Figure S6D. The results show that clustering increases Grb2 association rate (Kon) by about 60% compared with immobile ephrinA1, a value commensurate with the increase in the level of phosphorylated EphA2. As a result, the increase of 80% Grb2 total recruitment is a combination of increased receptor phosphorylation and elongated dwell time.</p><p>Text revision: ‘By counting molecule numbers in mobile or immobile regions, we found that clustering increases Grb2 association rate (Kon) by about 60%, a value commensurate with the increase of phosphorylated EphA2 (Figure 3 —figure supplement 1D).
