neural circuitry. However, the detailed mechanism is far from understood. Here, we found that glutamic acid decarboxylase 67-positive GABAergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA<sub>Gad67+</sub>) are a key regulator of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep in mice. VTA<sub>Gad67+</sub> project to multiple brain areas implicated in sleep/wakefulness regulation such as the lateral hypothalamus (LH). Chemogenetic activation of VTA<sub>Gad67+</sub> promoted NREM sleep with higher delta power whereas optogenetic inhibition of these induced prompt arousal from NREM sleep, even under highly somnolescent conditions, but not from REM sleep. VTA<sub>Gad67+</sub> showed the highest activity in NREM sleep and the lowest activity in REM sleep. Moreover, VTA<sub>Gad67+</sub> directly innervated and inhibited wake-promoting orexin/hypocretin neurons by releasing GABA. As such, optogenetic activation of VTA<sub>Gad67+</sub> terminals in the LH promoted NREM sleep. Taken together, we revealed that VTA<sub>Gad67+</sub> play an important role in the regulation of NREM sleep.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ventral tegmental Area</kwd><kwd>non-rapid eye movement sleep</kwd><kwd>glutamic acid decarboxylase 67</kwd><kwd>chemogenetics</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>fiber photometry</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002241</institution-id><institution>Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JPMJCR1656</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yamanaka</surname><given-names>Akihiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17H05563</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yamanaka</surname><given-names>Akihiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18KK0223</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yamanaka</surname><given-names>Akihiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18H05124</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yamanaka</surname><given-names>Akihiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16H01271</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yamanaka</surname><given-names>Akihiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18H02523</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yamanaka</surname><given-names>Akihiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19H05016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yamanaka</surname><given-names>Akihiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Functional identification of GABAergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area as a important neuronal subpopulation regulating non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep in mice.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sleep or sleep-like behavioral quiescence is known to be one of the most ubiquitously observed phenomena across the animal kingdom, from nematodes to primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Joiner, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Siegel, 2008</xref>). Broadly, sleep consists of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and REM sleep in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Siegel, 2008</xref>). While the physiological functions of either NREM sleep or REM sleep, or sleep as a whole, are intriguing and shrouded in mystery, sleep deprivation in humans and experimental animals causes severe cognitive impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Siegel, 2008</xref>). Pioneering studies discovered certain physiological functions of sleep that include clearing metabolic waste products and toxins from the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Xie et al., 2013</xref>), memory encoding, consolidation and erasure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rasch and Born, 2013</xref>), synaptic homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bushey et al., 2011</xref>), and energy conservation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schmidt, 2014</xref>). However, a universal function of sleep that is relevant to all animals is yet to be revealed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Joiner, 2016</xref>). As animals remain largely isolated from sensory processing and goal-oriented activity during sleep, it is expected that the regulation of sleep, both NREM and REM, as well as arousal should be controlled by the central nervous system. Many brain areas and residing cellular subtypes have been shown to be critical in regulating sleep-wakefulness. For instance, orexin/hypocretin-producing neurons (orexin neurons) in the lateral hypothalamus (LH) project to and activate monoaminergic, cholinergic, and other peptidergic neurons as well as other orexin neurons to induce and maintain wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Inutsuka and Yamanaka, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sakurai, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Scammell et al., 2017</xref>). Subsequently, these monoamine neurons inhibit sleep-active γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic neurons in the ventrolateral preoptic area (VLPO) in the hypothalamus to induce wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Saito et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Saper et al., 2010</xref>). It is reported that some wake-active neurons also display activity during REM sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Scammell et al., 2017</xref>). Comparatively, NREM sleep is regulated by neurons that release classical fast neurotransmitters, including GABA. For example, circadian rhythms and/or homeostatic sleep pressures activate GABAergic neurons in the VLPO and median preoptic nucleus (MnPO), which in turn inhibit wake-promoting orexin/hypocretin, monoaminergic, and cholinergic systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Scammell et al., 2017</xref>). While this flip-flop switch model of sleep-wake regulation is well established, recent studies have demonstrated a critical involvement of other brain areas and neuronal subtypes in regulating the transformations and subsequent maintenance of specific vigilances states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Oishi et al., 2017b</xref>).</p><p>Reinforcement learning, motivation, and locomotion, as well as the adaptation of responses to salient stimuli, all of which demand behavioral arousal, are critically regulated by a midbrain structure called the ventral tegmental area (VTA) in both rodents and primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arsenault et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fields et al., 2007</xref>). While one could also expect a critical role for VTA in the regulation of sleep/wakefulness, it is only recently that VTA dopamine (DA) neurons have been reported to have a fundamental role in the maintenance of the awake state as well as in the consolidation of arousal in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eban-Rothschild et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Oishi et al., 2017a</xref>). However, the VTA contains considerable heterogeneity among the neuronal subtypes, which include GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons alongside DA neurons. Studies have reported that about 60–65% of VTA neurons are dopaminergic, whereas 30–35% are GABAergic, and 2–3% are glutamatergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nair-Roberts et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pignatelli and Bonci, 2015</xref>).</p><p>As GABAergic neurons provide strong inhibition to the wake- and REM-active DA neurons in the VTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eban-Rothschild et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">van Zessen et al., 2012</xref>), it is probable that these GABAergic neurons in the VTA may also participate in sleep/wakefulness regulation. Moreover, GABA-mediated responses have been implicated in the modulation of the sleep/wakefulness cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Scammell et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we examined the role of glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (Gad67)-positive neurons in the VTA on sleep/wakefulness by using AAV-aided whole-brain anterograde tracing, neural manipulations by chemo- and optogenetics, fiber photometry, as well as slice electrophysiology. Gad67 (encoded by <italic>Gad1</italic> gene) is an isomer of an enzyme that synthesizes GABA from glutamic acid, suggesting that Gad67+ neurons are GABAergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Erlander et al., 1991</xref>). We revealed that Gad67+ neurons in the VTA (VTA<sub>Gad67+</sub> neurons) are highly active during NREM sleep and send their axons to multiple brain areas that were previously reported to regulate sleep/wakefulness. Bidirectional manipulations of neuronal activity and fiber photometry recordings revealed that VTA<sub>Gad67+</sub> neurons are active in and promote NREM sleep. Part of the NREM sleep-promoting effect of VTA<sub>Gad67+</sub> is mediated through inhibition of wake-promoting orexin/hypocretin neurons in the LH.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>GABAergic neurons in the VTA project to brain areas involved in the regulation of sleep/wakefulness</title><p>Glutamatergic, GABAergic, and dopaminergic (DA) neurons are intermingled in the VTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nair-Roberts et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pignatelli and Bonci, 2015</xref>). Here, we focused on the GABAergic neurons and tried to identify relevant projection areas. To specifically target GABAergic neurons in the VTA (VTA<sub>GABA</sub> neurons), Gad67-Cre mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Higo et al., 2009</xref>) were unilaterally injected with a Cre-inducible AAV virus carrying humanized renilla green fluorescent protein (hrGFP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Many hrGFP-positive neurons were observed in the VTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b–d</xref>). These hrGFP-positive neurons were Gad67-positive but tyrosine hydroxylase-negative (TH, an enzyme and marker of DA neurons in the VTA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, n = 4 mice) confirming that these hrGFP-positive neurons were GABAergic. At least 3 weeks after unilateral injection of AAV aimed at the VTA to express hrGFP, we prepared coronal brain sections at 40 µm thickness and counted all labeled cells on every fourth section. Within the VTA, we counted a total of 636 ± 122 neurons per animal (n = 4 mice). Among them, 63.5 ± 1.8% were TH-positive neurons (DA neurons) and 36.1 ± 1.8% were hrGFP-positive neurons. Only 0.4 ± 0.1% were co-labeled with hrGFP and TH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). hrGFP was distributed not only in the soma, but also in the axons. We could even anterogradely trace axons to reveal projection sites since hrGFP emits a strong fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d–f</xref>). Along with local innervations, we found long-range projections of Gad67+ neurons in the VTA (VTA<sub>Gad67+</sub> neurons) throughout the brain. Among these sites, the lateral hypothalamus (LH) and the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) were densely innervated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e–f</xref>). Moderate projections were found in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), ventral pallidum (VP), parafascicular thalamic nucleus (PF), periaqueductal gray (PAG), ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (VLL), dorsal raphe nucleus (DR), and pontine reticular nucleus (PnO). These brain areas are also reported to be involved in the modulation of sleep/wakefulness, suggesting that VTA<sub>Gad67+</sub> neurons might play a role in this regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown et al., 2012</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>VTA<sub>Gad67+</sub> neurons project to multiple areas in the brain.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic of AAV injection to express Cre-inducible hrGFP in Gad67-Cre mice.

After recovery from the surgery and behavioral habituation (see Materials and methods), either saline or CNO (1 mg/kg) were administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) just before the onset of the dark period (at 8:00 pm).

To test this, we used an acute inhibition strategy with optogenetics. An inhibitory anion channel, anion channelrhodopsin-2 (ACR2, Genbank accession no. KP171709) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mohammad et al., 2017</xref>), was expressed in VTA<sub>Gad67+</sub> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a–b</xref>). We first confirmed the function of ACR2 employing in vitro electrophysiology. Three weeks after injection of AAV (expressing either ACR2-2A-mCherry or mCherry) into the VTA of Gad67-Cre mice, we prepared acute brain slices including the VTA and performed cell-attached recordings from mCherry-expressing neurons. Blue light (6.8 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>) was able to completely silence the spontaneous activity of ACR2-2A-mCherry-expressing VTA<sub>Gad67+</sub> neurons (n = 10 cells), whereas light irradiation on mCherry alone-expressing neurons had no such effect (n = 7 cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1d–f</xref>). Next, using these two groups of mice, we implanted fiber optics at a diameter of 400 µm into the VTA along with EEG and EMG electrodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a and b</xref>). After recovery and habituation, continuous blue light for 5 s was illuminated every 15 min for 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Interestingly, blue light illumination immediately induced wakefulness from NREM sleep, but not from REM sleep, in mice expressing ACR2-2A-mCherry (n = 6 mice, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d–f</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). No such effect was observed in mice expressing mCherry alone (n = 5 mice, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). However, as the light-induced influences on NREM sleep and wakefulness showed an extended effect after the cessation of light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d–e</xref>), with behaviors taking around 60 s to return to the basal state, we sought to identify whether optogenetic inhibition of VTA<sub>Gad67+</sub> neurons also causes prolonged wakefulness. We, therefore, isolated the trials depending on sleep-wakefulness states just before light illumination in the cases of wakefulness, NREM, or REM sleep (with the same state lasting ≥30 s before light illumination). Surprisingly, we found that optogenetic inhibition of VTA<sub>Gad67+</sub> neurons in the state of wakefulness prolonged the time spent in wakefulness in all sorted trials compared to behavior of the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>, ACR2: 35 ± 5 s, mCherry: 8 ± 8 s; p=0.02, unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test). Again, REM sleep was not affected. Therefore, these data showed that in vivo optogenetic inhibition of VTA<sub>Gad67+</sub> neurons promoted and sustained wakefulness in mice.

Next, activity recordings were performed in vivo by a fiber optic inserted into the VTA area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2b</xref>). Offline determination of vigilance states was aided by signals from EEG-EMG electrodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a–b</xref>).

We performed whole-cell voltage clamp recordings from orexin neurons at −60 mV holding potential (mV<sub>hold</sub>) to record post-synaptic currents. Activation of nerve terminals of VTA<sub>Gad67+</sub> neurons in the LH (blue light pulse, duration of 5 ms) induced a post-synaptic current (PSC) in 8 out of 11 cells. These light-induced PSCs were blocked by gabazine (10 μM), a GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a–c</xref>, aCSF: −253 ± 70 pA, gabazine: −9 ± 3 pA, n = 8 cells, p=1.6e-10, paired <italic>t</italic>-test). This result suggests that GABA is involved in generating the light-induced PSCs in LH<sub>orexin</sub> neurons. The average synaptic delay from light onset was recorded as 6.2 ± 1.0 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>). To rule out the effect of glutamate, we blocked both AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid) and NMDA (N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid) type glutamate receptors by applying CNQX (20 μM) and AP5 (50 μM), respectively, in the extracellular bath solution. CNQX and AP5 could not block light-induced PSCs, while the combination of CNQX, AP5, and gabazine could inhibit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e–g</xref>. AP5 +CNQX: −188 ± 38 pA, with gabazine: −6 ± 2 pA, n = 7 cells, p=3.1e-9, paired <italic>t</italic>-test). Again, a delay of 6.7 ± 0.3 ms was found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7h</xref>). Finally, to confirm whether light-induced PSCs were indeed driven by monosynaptic release of GABA from VTA<sub>Gad67+</sub> neurons, we performed an additional set of experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7i–l</xref>). We found that tetrodotoxin (TTX, 1 μM), a blocker of voltage-gated sodium channels, inhibited the light-induced PSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7i–k</xref>. aCSF: −340 ± 73 pA, TTX: −2 ± 0.6 pA, n = 6 cells). However, combined application of TTX along with 4-aminopyridine (4-AP, 1 mM), a voltage-gated potassium channel blocker that prolongs depolarization of axon terminals and enables ChR2-mediated release of neurotransmitter in the absence of action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Petreanu et al., 2009</xref>), could rescue the light-induced PSCs, suggesting a monosynaptic connection between VTA<sub>Gad67+</sub> neurons and LH<sub>orexin</sub> neurons (−291 ± 131 pA). Again, the rescued current was blocked by adding gabazine (−6 ± 2 pA), but not by CNQX (−295 ± 121 pA). Finally, to further confirm that Cl<sup>-</sup> channels are involved in this GABAergic input, we changed mV<sub>hold</sub> to +90 mV. The calculated reversal potential of Cl<sup>-</sup> under recording conditions were near 0 mV (2.2 mV). As expected, we found that the current direction of light-induced PSCs was opposite at +90 mV<sub>hold</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7j–k</xref>, 237 ± 115 pA).

GABAergic neurons constitute a significant part of the VTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nair-Roberts et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pignatelli and Bonci, 2015</xref>) and help to regulate the function of DA neurons residing nearby (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">van Zessen et al., 2012</xref>). Dysregulation of signaling pathways in the VTA is associated with drug abuse and several other psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Winton-Brown et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wulff et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, irregular sleep-wake timing and architectures are recognized as common co-morbidities in many neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wulff et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, the relationship between neurochemical signaling in the VTA and the regulation of sleep/wakefulness poses an interesting point of study. However, classical lesioning experiments suggest that cats with reduced dopamine levels exhibit decreased behavioral arousal but no significant change in electro-cortical waking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jones et al., 1973</xref>). It is only very recently that investigators have shown an interest in understanding the role of the VTA in the regulation of sleep/wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eban-Rothschild et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Oishi et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). However, not much scientific literature has been published focusing on the functional importance of GABAergic neurons in the VTA. Therefore, our findings on the role of these neurons in sleep/wakefulness regulation will provide a conceptual and systematic framework for the association between sleep and psychiatric disorders and will generate opportunities to study VTA-related dysregulation in mental disorders.</p><p>van Zassen and colleagues reported that in vivo optogenetic activation of GABAergic neurons in the VTA in mice disrupts reward consummatory behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">van Zessen et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, Shank <italic>et al.</italic> reported that dose- and time-related selective ablation of GABAergic neurons in the VTA in rats increased spontaneous locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shank et al., 2007</xref>). These studies are consistent with the hypothesis that GABAergic neurons in the VTA play an important role in the regulation of behavior. We now argue that one reason for such disruption in behavior might be promotion of NREM sleep by selective activation of GABAergic neurons in the VTA.</p><p>Using bidirectional chemogenetic manipulations as well as neurotoxic lesions in rats, a recent study found that neurons in the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg), also known as the GABAergic tail of the VTA, are essential for physiological NREM sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). Although Yang <italic>et al.</italic> did not identify neuronal subtypes involved in the RMTg, their results might be related to our findings. Interestingly, VTA<sub>Gad67+</sub> neurons in our study are located throughout the VTA, but at a somewhat higher density toward the caudal parts of the VTA. More recently, Takata <italic>et al.</italic> reported that GABA neurons in the ventral medial midbrain/pons, which includes the VTA region, regulate sleep/wake cycles by modulating DA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Takata et al., 2018</xref>). These GABA neurons should include VTA<sub>Gad67+</sub> neurons. Indeed, GABAergic neurons regulating NREM sleep might be distributed across both VTA and RMTg.</p><p>Chemogenetic activation of VTA<sub>Gad67+</sub> neurons induced NREM sleep accompanied by higher delta power (slow wave) compared with control conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>), suggesting that VTA<sub>Gad67+</sub> neurons might play a critical role in the generation of slow wave in NREM sleep. Recently, Oishi <italic>et al.</italic> reported that activation of either the cell bodies of GABAergic neurons in the core of NAc or their axonal terminals in the VP evoked slow wave sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Oishi et al., 2017b</xref>). In addition, activation of GABAergic neurons in the basal forebrain, which includes the VP, produced wakefulness, whereas their inhibition induced sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anaclet et al., 2015</xref>). These facts suggest that inhibition of GABAergic neurons in the VP is a critical pathway to generate slow waves in NREM sleep. We also found that VTA<sub>Gad67+</sub> neurons moderately project to the VP. Therefore, we reasoned that VTA<sub>Gad67+</sub> neurons projecting to the VP might be involved in the generation of slow wave sleep.</p><p>Population activity recordings across vigilance states shows that DA neurons in the VTA exhibit higher activity in REM sleep versus either wake or NREM sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eban-Rothschild et al., 2016</xref>). On the contrary, VTA<sub>Gad67+</sub> neurons exhibit a completely opposite activity pattern from that of DA neurons across vigilance states, with highest activity during NREM sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This suggests an existing functional interaction between DA and Gad67+ neurons in the VTA. Using in vivo single unit recordings in rats, Lee <italic>et al.</italic> found wake- and REM-active VTA<sub>GABA</sub> neurons, suggesting that there might be several types of VTA<sub>GABA</sub> neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2001</xref>). Our fiber photometry data showed that VTA<sub>Gad67+</sub> neurons exhibit weak activity even during wakefulness. This might suggest that VTA<sub>Gad67+</sub> neurons are also comprised of several subtypes. However, most VTA<sub>Gad67+</sub> neurons are predominantly active in NREM sleep. Therefore, additional research is needed to clarify any electrophysiological, anatomical, and/or functional variations of GABAergic neurons in the VTA. Very recently, Yu <italic>et al.</italic> reported that coordinated interaction between GABA and glutamate neurons in the VTA regulates sleep/wakefulness in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yu et al., 2019</xref>). Although this study similarly found a NREM-sleep promoting role of VTA<sub>GABA</sub> neurons, the in vivo activity of VTA<sub>GABA</sub> neurons was quite different from our observations with the highest activity observed during wake and REM sleep. One difference between studies was that Yu <italic>et al.</italic> used Vgat-Cre mice (Cre recombinase is targeted to the <italic>slc32a1</italic> gene) and we used Gad67-Cre mice to target GABAergic neurons. Our in situ hybridization results showed that Gad67-positive neurons represent a small subset of Vgat-positive neurons in the VTA. Again, this difference further indicates the existence of different populations of GABAergic neurons in the VTA.</p><p>Optogenetic inhibition of VTA<sub>Gad67+</sub> neurons induced immediate wakefulness from NREM sleep, but not from REM sleep, suggesting the importance of uninterrupted neuronal activity of VTA<sub>Gad67+</sub> neurons for the maintenance of NREM sleep. Both chemogenetic activation and optogenetic inhibition data suggest that VTA<sub>Gad67+</sub> neurons might not play a decisive role in the physiological regulation of REM sleep. Interestingly, inhibition of VTA<sub>Gad67+</sub> neurons prolonged wakefulness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>). This result might suggest that VTA<sub>Gad67+</sub> neurons also regulate levels of wakefulness. This is consistent with data showing that VTA<sub>Gad67+</sub> neurons displayed weak activity in wakefulness in terms of population activity. This idea is also supported by observed increases in spontaneous locomotor activity following selective ablation of VTA<sub>GABA</sub> neurons in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shank et al., 2007</xref>). These facts might suggest that an improvement in alertness and ability to maintain wakefulness require the suppression of activity of VTA<sub>GABA</sub> neurons.</p><p>One possible cellular mechanism underlying NREM sleep promotion by VTA<sub>GABA</sub> neurons is via inhibition of DA neurons residing in the VTA. In addition to this, our results showed that direct inhibition of wake-promoting LH<sub>orexin</sub> neurons might contribute to the induction of NREM sleep. Projection-specific activation of VTA<sub>GABA</sub> neuron nerve terminals using optogenetics indicated that VTA<sub>GABA</sub>-to-LH represents a pathway responsible for inducing NREM sleep. It will also be fascinating to study how VTA<sub>GABA</sub> neurons are regulated. Using an optimized trans-synaptic retrograde tracing approach, Faget and colleagues recently labeled afferent neurons to DA, GABA, or glutamate neurons in the VTA and found that these populations receive qualitatively similar inputs, with dominant and comparable projections from three brain areas known to be critical for sleep/wakefulness regulation: LH, raphe, and ventral pallidum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Faget et al., 2016</xref>). Here we report that VTA<sub>Gad67+</sub> neurons project to those areas, suggesting the existence of a mutual interaction with these brain areas to regulate sleep/wakefulness. Moreover, while many brain areas including the cholinergic basal forebrain and brain stem, histaminergic posterior hypothalamus, serotonergic raphe nucleus, as well as the noradrenergic locus coeruleus are important in sleep/wake regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown et al., 2012</xref>), we speculate a critical role for VTA<sub>Gad67+</sub> neurons in sleep/wakefulness-regulating circuitry as these neurons modulate diverse targets, including DA neurons in the VTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tan et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, our study elucidated that VTA<sub>GABA</sub> neurons regulate NREM sleep in mice.

Briefly, the fiber photometry system (COME2-FTR/OPT, Lucir, Tsukuba, Japan) utilizes a custom-made single silica fiber of 400 μm diameter to deliver excitation light and to detect fluorescence from GCaMP6f, simultaneously. Blue excitation light (465 nm, 0.5 mW at the tip of the silica fiber) was produced by a high-power LED system (PlexonBright OPT/LED Blue_TT_FC, Plexon, Dallas, TX). The LED-emitted excitation light was reflected by a dichroic mirror and coupled to the silica fiber (400 μm diameter) through an excitation bandpass filter (path 472 ± 35 nm). GCaMP6f-emitted green fluorescence was collected by the same silica fiber passed through a bandpass emission filter (path 525 ± 25 nm) and guided to a photomultiplier (PMTH-S1M1-CR131, Zolix instruments, Beijing, China). The fiber photometry signal was recorded by Vital Recorder (Kissei Comtec Co., Ltd, Japan) along with the EEG/EMG signals.

We recorded the signals in the light period as nocturnal animal mice usually show multiple transitions among different vigilance states during the light period. All mice were subjected to at least two recording sessions with at least a 2 day interval in between each session to allow photobleaching recovery. We separated all sleep-state transitions that last at least for 1 min before and after the state change.

interests of transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;GABA neurons in the ventral tegmental area regulate non-rapid eye movement sleep in mice&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Yang Dan as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Catherine Dulac as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, the authors investigated the effect of GAD67-positive GABAergic neurons in the VTA in regulating sleep. They showed that chemogenetic activation of these neurons promote NREM sleep and optogenetic inhibition of them promptly awakens the mice from NREM but not REM sleep. Fiber photometry showed that these GABAergic neurons show highest activity during NREM sleep. Slice recording showed that these neurons provide GABAergic inhibition of orexin neurons, a pathway that could contribute to the sleep promoting effect.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>An important difference between this study and a recently published study (Yu et al.) is the activity profile of the VTA GABAergic neurons. The authors discussed that notable difference is the use of VGAT-Cre vs. GAD67-Cre, but this point needs to be strengthened. The counting results of overlap between hrGFP and <italic>Gad67</italic> is not provided, and there seems to be hrGFP+; <italic>Gad67</italic>- cells in Figure 1B. Perhaps this is because <italic>Gad67</italic> IHC does not give a clear image of the soma in VTA. Please conduct double staining of <italic>Gad67</italic> ISH and hrGFP IHC and provide the counting data. In addition, as some neurons express <italic>Gad67</italic> but not <italic>Vgat</italic>, please also conduct double staining of <italic>Vgat</italic> ISH and hrGFP IHC and provide the counting data. In each case, please provide both (Marker gene+ &amp; hrGFP+ cells)/(marker gene+ cells) and (Marker gene+ &amp; hrGFP+ cells)/(hrGFP+ cells).

The authors discussed that notable difference is the use of VGAT-Cre vs. GAD67-Cre, but this point needs to be strengthened. The counting results of overlap between hrGFP and Gad67 is not provided, and there seems to be hrGFP+; Gad67- cells in Figure 1B. Perhaps this is because Gad67 IHC does not give a clear image of the soma in VTA. Please conduct double staining of Gad67 ISH and hrGFP IHC and provide the counting data. In addition, as some neurons express Gad67 but not Vgat, please also conduct double staining of Vgat ISH and hrGFP IHC and provide the counting data. In each case, please provide both (Marker gene+ &amp; hrGFP+ cells)/(marker gene+ cells) and (Marker gene+ &amp; hrGFP+ cells)/(hrGFP+ cells). Please also provide number of mice used for each analysis in the figure legend.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this point. To address this, we performed in situ RNA hybridization assays using RNAscope technology (added as Figure 1—figure supplement 1). We injected Cre-inducible AAV (AAV(9) CAG-FLEX-mCherry) into the VTA of Gad67-Cre mice (n = 4 mice) to label Gad67-expressing neurons (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A). <italic>Gad67, Vgat</italic> (vesicular GABA transporter), and <italic>mCherry</italic> mRNA were visualized by multicolor in situ hybridization (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B).</p><p>Regarding <italic>Gad67</italic> and <italic>Vgat</italic> expression, we revealed three different types of neurons: <italic>Vgat</italic>-only (66.8 ± 2.0%), <italic>Gad67</italic>-only (1.1 ± 0.1%), and <italic>Vgat</italic> and <italic>Gad67</italic> double-positive neurons (32.1 ± 2.1%) (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C). Whereas 96.5 ± 0.5% of <italic>Gad67</italic>-positive neurons co-expressed <italic>Vgat</italic> mRNA, only 32.4 ± 2.1% of <italic>Vgat</italic>-positive neurons co-expressed <italic>Gad67</italic> mRNA in the VTA (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C). Consistent with these findings, 94.8 ± 1.5% of mCherry-positive neurons in the VTA of <italic>Gad67-Cre</italic> mice co-expressed <italic>Gad67</italic> and <italic>Vgat</italic> mRNA (Figure 1—figure supplement 1D). Together, these data clearly indicate that <italic>Gad67</italic>-positive neurons represent a small subset of <italic>Vgat</italic>-positive neurons in the VTA. Therefore, this data well supports our assumption that different populations of GABAergic neurons were labelled in Gad67-Cremice and Vgat-cre mice in the VTA. This difference might result in alterations of in vivo activity profiles across vigilance states recorded by fiber photometry.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other points:</p><p>Figure 1: legends should list abbreviations alphabetically.</p></disp-quote><p>Abbreviations are now listed alphabetically in the legends of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results, subsection “GABAergic neurons in the VTA project to brain areas involved in the regulation of sleep/wakefulness”:</p><p>“We counted a total of 636 ± 122 neurons per animal.” Are these serial sections with all neurons counted?

Aiming at the VTA, we performed bilateral intracranial microinjection of AAV in the Gad67-Cre mice to express diphtheria toxin A fragment (DTA) in the VTA<sub>Gad67+</sub> neurons. However, to our surprise, we found that all injected mice (n = 3 male mice) died within 4 weeks of injection. Although we cannot conclude the exact reasons for such mortality of the AAV-injected Gad67-Cre mice, we did not continue this line of experimentation to investigate the long-term effects of removal of VTA Gad67 neurons due to ethical concerns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors claim that &quot;VTA<sub>Gad67+</sub> neurons play a crucial role in the regulation of NREM sleep.&quot; They assert that arousal is &quot;critically regulated&quot; by the VTA.
