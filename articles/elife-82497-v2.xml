In a typical procedure, a cue is paired with foot shock, and subsequent cue presentation elicits freezing, a behavior theoretically linked to predator detection. Studies have since shown a fear conditioned cue can elicit locomotion, a behavior that – in addition to jumping, and rearing – is theoretically linked to imminent or occurring predation. A criticism of studies observing fear conditioned cue-elicited locomotion is that responding is non-associative. We gave rats Pavlovian fear discrimination over a baseline of reward seeking. TTL-triggered cameras captured 5 behavior frames/s around cue presentation. Experiment 1 examined the emergence of danger-specific behaviors over fear acquisition. Experiment 2 examined the expression of danger-specific behaviors in fear extinction. In total, we scored 112,000 frames for nine discrete behavior categories. Temporal ethograms show that during acquisition, a fear conditioned cue suppresses reward seeking and elicits freezing, but also elicits locomotion, jumping, and rearing – all of which are maximal when foot shock is imminent. During extinction, a fear conditioned cue most prominently suppresses reward seeking, and elicits locomotion that is timed to shock delivery. The independent expression of these behaviors in both experiments reveals a fear conditioned cue to orchestrate a temporally organized suite of behaviors.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Knowing that an animal is fearful is crucial for many psychology and neuroscience studies. For instance, this knowledge allows researchers to examine the brain pathways involved in processing and responding to fear.</p><p>Typically, researchers consider that a rodent is experiencing fear if it ‘freezes’ – a response which, in the wild, helps to evade detection by predators. In Pavlovian fear conditioning experiments, for example, rats and mice freeze when exposed to a stimulus (often a specific sound) previously associated with unpleasant sensations. However, rodents can also respond more actively to threats, for instance by running or jumping away. It remains unclear whether the ‘fearful stimuli’ used in Pavlovian approaches specifically elicits only freezing, or other fear-related behaviors as well.</p><p>To investigate this, Chu et al. used high-speed cameras to record rats’ responses to a sound cue they had ‘learned’ to associate with a mild foot shock. In addition to freezing, the animals ran, jumped, stood on their hind legs and stopped their usual reward-seeking behavior in response to the cue. Crucially, these reactions were absent when the rats were exposed to sound cues not associated with pain.</p><p>Overall, these experiments demonstrate that Pavlovian conditioning can elicit a full range of fear-related behaviors beyond freezing. Understanding the neural activity behind these diverse responses could lead to more targeted therapies and interventions addressing the various ways stress and anxiety manifest in people.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Pavlovian</kwd><kwd>threat</kwd><kwd>ethogram</kwd><kwd>fear</kwd><kwd>freezing</kwd><kwd>jumping</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH117791</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McDannald</surname><given-names>Michael A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Comprehensive behavioral ethograms reveal a fear conditioned cue to elicit a temporally organized suite of behaviors spanning freezing, locomotion, rearing, and jumping.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Animals evolved defensive systems to detect and avoid predation. The predatory imminence continuum (PIC), a prominent theory of defensive behavior, identifies three defensive modes based on the proximity to predation: pre-encounter (leaving the safety of the nest), post-encounter (predator detected), and circa-strike (predation imminent or occurring) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fanselow and Lester, 1988</xref>). Pavlovian fear conditioning has been extensively used to reveal the behavioral and neural underpinnings of defensive systems in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bolles and Collier, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fanselow, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Killcross et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McNally et al., 2011</xref>). In a typical Pavlovian fear conditioning procedure, a rat is placed in a neutral context, and played an auditory cue whose termination coincides with foot shock delivery. Each PIC mode is characterized by a unique set of behaviors and, critically, each mode is thought to be captured by a unique epoch of a Pavlovian fear conditioning trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fanselow et al., 2019</xref>). The post-encounter mode is characterized by freezing, and is captured by cue presentation. Circa-strike is characterized by locomotion, jumping, and rearing, and is captured by shock delivery.</p><p>Freezing to a fear conditioned cue may be the most ubiquitous finding in all of behavioral neuroscience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blanchard and Blanchard, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bolles and Collier, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maren et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anagnostaras, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wilensky et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Quirk, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rogers and Kesner, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Iordanova et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shumake et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Foilb et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Furlong et al., 2016</xref>). The relationship between freezing and Pavlovian fear conditioning is so strong that failing to observe freezing in defensive settings has been used to support assertions that Pavlovian fear conditioning did not occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zambetti et al., 2021</xref>). Cued fear as freezing has been further entrenched by historical observations that locomotion, jumping, and rearing (theorized circa-strike behaviors) are not elicited by fear conditioned cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fanselow et al., 2019</xref>). Instead, activity-promoting defensive behaviors are restricted to shock delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fanselow, 1982</xref>) or to other sudden changes in stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fadok et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Totty et al., 2021</xref>). Yet, locomotion, jumping, and rearing all readily occur in defensive settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blanchard et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Holland, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dielenberg and McGregor, 2001</xref>). Most relevant, a fear conditioned cue can elicit locomotion, rapid forward movements termed ‘darting’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gruene et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mitchell et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The ability of a fear conditioned cue to elicit locomotion has been called into question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Trott et al., 2022</xref>). Trott et al. noted that in prior studies locomotion was greatest at cue onset – the time point most distal from shock delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gruene et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fadok et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, prior studies did not use associative controls (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Totty et al., 2021</xref>) – essential to making claims that cue-elicited behaviors were due to a predictive relationship with foot shock. Using between-subjects designs in mice, Trott et al. ascribe the majority of cue-elicited locomotion to non-associative cue properties. The foundational study demonstrating the need for proper associative controls in <italic>any</italic> form of conditioning used Pavlovian fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rescorla, 1967</xref>). Not just all-or-none, the magnitude of a fear conditioned, cue-elicited response can scale with foot shock probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rescorla, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ray et al., 2020</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rescorla, 1968</xref> many foundational associative learning studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kamin, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rescorla and Wagner, 1972</xref>), relied on experiments that did not measure ‘fear’ with freezing, but with suppression of operant responding for reward (now termed conditioned suppression) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Estes and Skinner, 1941</xref>). Drawing from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rescorla, 1968</xref>, our laboratory has devised a robust, within-subjects Pavlovian fear conditioning procedure in which three cues predict unique foot shock probabilities: danger (p = 1), uncertainty (p = 0.25), and safety (p = 0). Measuring conditioned suppression, we consistently observe complete behavioral discrimination: danger elicits greater suppression than safety, and uncertainty elicits suppression intermediate to danger and safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wright et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DiLeo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Walker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ray et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The goal of Experiment 1 was to construct comprehensive, temporal ethograms of rat behavior during discriminative Pavlovian fear conditioning, consisting of a danger, uncertainty, and safety cue. This would allow us to determine what behaviors come under the control of a fear conditioned cue, and how these behaviors are temporally organized. We had the ability to reveal freezing as the exclusive conditioned behavior, as prior studies have found positive relationships between conditioned freezing and conditioned suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bouton and Bolles, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mast et al., 1982</xref>). Yet, we also had the ability to detect additional behaviors, as brain manipulations that impair conditioned freezing can have little or no impact on conditioned suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McDannald, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McDannald and Galarce, 2011</xref>). A subgoal was to compare behaviors elicited by the deterministic danger cue, and the probabilistic uncertainty cue. The goal of Experiment 2 was to reveal which of these danger-elicited behaviors transferred to an extinction context in which shock and reward were not present. For Experiment 2, we simplified the discrimination procedure to include only the danger and safety cues.</p><p>Twenty-four rats (12 females; Experiment 1) and sixteen rats (8 females, Experiment 2) received Pavlovian fear discrimination. TTL-triggered GigE cameras were installed in behavioral boxes and programmed to capture frames at subsecond temporal resolution prior to and during cue presentation. 86,400 frames (Experiment 1) and 25,600 frames (Experiment 2) were hand scored for nine discrete behaviors reflecting reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Holland, 1977</xref>), activity-suppressing fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blanchard and Blanchard, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fanselow, 1982</xref>), and activity-promoting fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blanchard et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dielenberg and McGregor, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gruene et al., 2015</xref>). Complete temporal ethograms were constructed during early, middle, and late conditioning sessions (Experiment 1), and for the two types of extinction tests (Experiment 2). Danger responding was compared to baseline and to safety, which served as an unpaired control cue. Behaviors elicited by the danger cue were considered associative (due to pairing with foot shock) if they differed both from baseline and from the safety cue. The temporal profile of responding was determined by tracking behavior change over cue presentation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experiment 1</title><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>Conditioned suppression reveals complete discrimination</title><p>Twenty-four Long Evans rats (12 females) were trained to nose poke in a central port for food reward.

Suppression ratios are calculated using baseline and cue nose poke rates: (baseline − cue)/(baseline + cue). Suppression ratios provide a continuous behavior measure, from no suppression (ratio = 0) to total suppression (ratio = 1). To determine if we observed complete behavioral discrimination in these 24 rats, we performed analysis of variance (ANOVA) for suppression ratios [factors: cue (danger vs. uncertainty vs. safety), session (17 total: 1 pre-exposure and 16 discrimination), and sex (female vs. male)]. Complete behavioral discrimination emerged over testing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D</xref>). ANOVA found a significant main effect of cue and a significant cue × session interaction (<italic>F</italic>s &gt; 6, ps &lt; 0.0001; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for specific values).

Female suppression ratios were higher to each cue across all discrimination sessions: danger (<italic>t</italic><sub>22</sub> = 3.36, p = 0.003), uncertainty (<italic>t</italic><sub>22</sub> = 7.14, p = 3.67 × 10<sup>−7</sup>), and safety (<italic>t</italic><sub>22</sub> = 4.40, p = 0.0002).</p><p>Sex differences in body weight and baseline nose poke rate existed prior to and throughout discrimination, with males weighing more and poking more than females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). It is therefore possible that sex indirectly moderates conditioned suppression through effects on body weight or baseline nose poke rate. To determine this, we performed analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) for suppression ratios [factors: cue (danger vs. uncertainty vs. safety) and session (17 total: 1 pre-exposure and 16 discrimination)] using body weight or baseline nose poke rate as the covariate. ANCOVA with body weight found neither a significant body weight × cue interaction (<italic>F</italic><sub>(2,44)</sub> = 2.97, p = 0.062) nor a significant body weight × cue × session interaction (<italic>F</italic><sub>(32,704)</sub> = 1.40, p = 0.074). However, ANCOVA with baseline nose poke rate found a significant baseline × cue interaction (<italic>F</italic><sub>(2,44)</sub> = 5.49, p = 0.007) but not a significant baseline × cue × session interaction (<italic>F</italic><sub>(32,704)</sub> = 0.79, p = 0.79). Irrespective of sex, higher baseline nose poke rates predicted greater discrimination of danger and uncertainty (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Constructing behavioral ethograms for all 16 discrimination sessions would have required hand scoring 460,800 frames.

We first performed MANOVA for the 5 s baseline period [factors: cue (danger vs. uncertainty vs. safety), time (5, 1 s bins), and sex (female vs. male)]. As expected, MANOVA returned no main effect of cue, time, nor a cue × time interaction (<italic>F</italic>s &lt; 1.5, ps &gt; 0.1). Univariate ANOVA results were subjected to Bonferroni correction (p &lt; 0.0055, 0.05/9 = 0.0055) to account for the nine separate analyses.

We constructed 95% BCIs for each cue/behavior. 95% BCIs for %∆ danger did not contain zero for each of the five behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), meaning that levels of behavior during cue presentation differed from baseline.

To demonstrate danger specificity, we subtracted %∆ safety from %∆ danger. We then constructed 95% BCIs for the difference score for each behavior. Confirming danger specificity (greater changes for danger than for safety), 95% BCIs did not contain zero for each of the five behaviors.

It is possible that danger-specific control of multiple behaviors was only observed in session 16 because rats received far more cue–shock pairings than a typical Pavlovian conditioning procedure employs. Session 2 provided a comparison to numbers of cue–shock pairings more typical of fear conditioning studies; rats had received 12 total foot shocks by session’s end. The key question was whether pattern of danger-elicited behaviors in session 2 resembled the pattern in session 16, or if a fundamentally different pattern was observed. To determine this, we performed univariate ANOVA for danger [factors: session (2 vs. 16) and time (15, 1 s bins)] for each of the five behaviors showing session 16 selectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Confirming near identical temporal patterns of behavior expression during sessions 2 and 16, ANOVA found no significant session × time interaction for any behavior [port (<italic>F</italic><sub>(14,322)</sub> = 0.45, p = 0.96), cup (<italic>F</italic><sub>(14,322)</sub> = 0.61, p = 0.86), locomote (<italic>F</italic><sub>(14,322)</sub> = 1.09, p = 0.37), jump (<italic>F</italic><sub>(14,322)</sub> = 1.23, p = 0.25), and rear (<italic>F</italic><sub>(14,322)</sub> = 0.92, p = 0.54)]. Thus, danger orchestrated a suite of behaviors even early in discrimination. Recall that early discrimination (session 2) was marked by non-specific cue control of behaviors. This would mean that associatively acquired behaviors initially generalized to uncertainty and safety – and that discrimination consisted of restricting behavior to danger. In support, univariate ANOVA for session 2 [factors: cue (danger vs. uncertainty vs. safety), time (15, 1 s bins), and sex (female vs. male)] found no cue × time interaction for any of the five, danger-specific behaviors (all <italic>F</italic>s &lt; 1.2, all ps &gt; 0.3).</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-5"><title>Sex informs the temporal pattern of freezing</title><p>We return to the case of freezing; the most measured overt fear conditioned behavior.

Consistent with virtually all studies of Pavlovian fear conditioning (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amorapanth et al., 1999</xref>), we observed danger-elicited freezing over the course of acquisition (Experiment 1) and during extinction testing (Experiment 2). Yet, freezing was not the dominant danger-elicited behavior. Instead, danger orchestrated a suite of behaviors. During Experiment 1, danger suppressed reward behavior directed toward the site of food delivery and the location of the rewarded action. Even more, danger-elicited locomotion, jumping, and rearing. During Experiment 2, danger again suppressed rewarded action and continued to elicit locomotion. During both experiments, freezing was most prominent at danger cue onset. Locomotion was most prominent toward danger cue offset (Experiment 1), and when shock would have occurred in extinction (Experiment 2).</p><p>Before discussing our results further, an important limitation should be raised. 40–50% of frames could not be assigned to a specific behavior and were labeled as background. This was due to three main factors. First, in order to objectively hand score many behaviors, we developed mutually exclusive, specific definitions. Our strict definitions meant erring on the side of labeling a behavior background if there was uncertainty in judgment. Second, use of a single, side view camera meant the observer could not view a rat’s forelimbs or face when the rat was turned away from the camera. If forelimb and face position could not be determined the frame was labeled background. Finally, transition behaviors (e.g., switching from rearing to locomotion) and other behaviors (e.g., sniffing and turning) that did not fit into one of the nine behavior definitions were labeled background. The upside of this limitation is high confidence in behavior judgments and high inter-rater reliability for those judgments.</p><p>Studies assessing auditory fear conditioning in a neutral context routinely report freezing to account for &gt;80% of behavior during cue presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bolles and Collier, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maren et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anagnostaras, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wilensky et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Quirk, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rogers and Kesner, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Iordanova et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shumake et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Foilb et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Furlong et al., 2016</xref>). The sheer number of demonstrations, and number of groups independently observing dominant freezing, puts us firmly in the minority. Placing us further in the minority, we observe danger-elicited locomotion, jumping, and rearing. These behaviors are characterized by lateral and vertical movements, polar opposites to the immobility that characterizes freezing. A commonality of the studies above was use of contexts in which only cues and shocks were delivered, with shocks being more intense than shocks used in our studies. These experimental settings favor freezing. It is likely that our inclusion of competing, reward behaviors and use of lower shock intensities permitted a broader range of danger-elicited behaviors to be observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Holland, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mitchell et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Indeed, we are not the first group to observe locomotion, jumping, or rearing in defensive settings in rats. Using more traditional Pavlovian fear conditioning designs, Shansky and colleagues have observed ‘darting’, rapid forward movements across the test chamber, to a fear conditioned cue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gruene et al., 2015</xref>). While more readily observed in female rats, darting can be observed in males under certain experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mitchell et al., 2022</xref>). Our definition of locomotion aligns well with the Shansky lab definition of darting. We found that danger-elicited locomotion was equally apparent during extinction, and more robust than freezing. While locomotion was observed across all rats, female locomotion was better timed to shock delivery. Our results join previous studies in demonstrating a fear conditioned cue promotes movement in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bolles and Collier, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Totty et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Jumping is elicited in rats by hypoxia (decreasing oxygen levels in the air) – a life-threatening condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Spiacci et al., 2015</xref>). More relevant to our study, the Blanchards observed jumping in defensive settings in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blanchard et al., 1986</xref>). In their procedure, a rat was placed at the end of an inescapable hallway, then a human experimenter slowly approached. Rats initially froze when the experimenter was distant (1–2 m away), but switched from freezing to jumping as the experimenter drew near (&lt;1 m). Our observation of danger-elicited jumping during fear acquisition, and its preferential expression at the end of danger presentation, mirrored the defensive jumping pattern observed in the Blanchard’s study.</p><p>Rearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lever et al., 2006</xref>) is elicited by visual cues predicting moderate foot shock. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Holland, 1979</xref> found that a mix of rearing and freezing are acquired to a visual cue paired with low intensity foot shock. A visual cue paired with intense foot shock exclusively produces freezing. The foot shock intensity we used in both experiments (0.5 mA) is more consistent with the low intensities in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Holland, 1979</xref> experiment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dielenberg and McGregor, 2001</xref> found that rats exposed to a recently worn cat collar, with an opposing box to hide in, show ‘vigilant rearing’ to the cat collar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dielenberg and McGregor, 2001</xref>). Rearing was never observed in a control condition. While we cannot claim vigilance, we find that danger promotes rearing during fear acquisition.</p><p>Temporal ethograms revealed that during fear acquisition, jumping and rearing were most prevalent at the end of cue presentation – when foot shock was imminent. This was in contrast to freezing which was prominent during early danger presentation for both females and males, but only shown by males at the end of cue presentation. Though unlike Experiment 1, in which foot shock was present, we found no evidence of danger-elicited jumping and rearing during fear extinction. Because jumping and rearing are vertical behaviors, they may be avoidant or escape responses. The rat is trying to leave the floor before the shock comes on. This interpretation is supported by the finding that these responses peaked just before shock presentation in Experiment 1. Removing foot shock in Experiment 2 may have removed the impetus for avoidance and escape. However, it could be equally likely that these behaviors are more sensitive context change. Experiment 2 also found that freezing transferred less well to the extinction context in which reward was absent.</p><p>Our findings accord well with the PIC theory of defensive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fanselow and Lester, 1988</xref>). PIC theory identifies three defensive modes: pre-encounter (e.g., leaving the safety of the nest to forage), post-encounter (predator detected), and circa-strike (predation inevitable or occurring). Analogs to PIC modes are identified in a Pavlovian fear conditioning trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fanselow et al., 2019</xref>). Pre-encounter mode may correspond to leaving the home cage and being placed in the experimental chamber where foot shocks occur. Post-encounter mode corresponds to presentation of the fear conditioned cue. Circa-strike mode is said to correspond to foot shock delivery. It is argued that circa-strike behaviors (locomotion, jumping, and rearing) are not observed toward the end of danger presentation because rats do not time shock delivery. In support, extending cue duration in traditional cued fear conditioning paradigms does not result in shifts from freezing to locomotion, jumping, and rearing toward cue offset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fanselow et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Here, we find expected patterns of defensive behavior in unexpected epochs of Pavlovian conditioning trials. Early danger freezing by all rats (females and males) gives way to a late mix of danger-elicited behaviors that included locomotion, jumping, and rearing (Experiment 1) or late locomotion (Experiment 2). Why do we observe late danger control of circa-strike behaviors? Hunger and the availability of a rewarded action may provide an impetus for shock timing. Timing would allow rats to minimize the display of defensive behaviors and maximize reward seeking. In support, presenting long duration danger cues in a conditioned suppression setting results in timing of fear responding. With experience, rats show little suppression of reward seeking to danger onset, which ramps toward shock delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rosas and Alonso, 1996</xref>). Supporting the minimization of defensive behavior in reward settings, foot shocks signaled by danger will strongly suppress reward seeking only early in fear conditioning. Shock-induced suppression quickly wanes and with experience, shock delivery will paradoxically facilitate reward seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">LaBarbera and Caul, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Strickland et al., 2021</xref>). Shock timing information is readily apparent in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray, a brain region central to defensive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fanselow, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carrive et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mobbs et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McDannald, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tovote et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arico et al., 2017</xref>). Populations of ventrolateral periaqueductal gray neurons show little responding upon danger presentation, but ramp firing toward shock delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ozawa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wright and McDannald, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wright et al., 2019</xref>). Our results support the PIC theory of defensive behavior but demonstrate that the relationship between defensive mode and Pavlovian conditioning trial epoch is not fixed, but depends on the experimental setting.</p><p>A secondary goal of Experiment 1 was to compare defensive behaviors elicited by a deterministic, danger cue and a probabilistic, uncertainty cue. In our setting, uncertainty is not simply a diminished version of danger. Indeed, uncertainty only promoted a subset of danger-elicited behaviors: locomotion and jumping. Most surprising was the inability of uncertainty to suppress reward behaviors directed toward the food cup and port. This is particularly puzzling because using suppression ratios, we found uncertainty to produce robust suppression of nose poking. What is going on here? Food cup, port, and poke behavior lie on a rewarded action continuum. Food cup means the rat is in the area of food delivery – but is most distal from the rewarded action. Port means the rat is around or in the site of the rewarded action, but only poke requires the rat to be fully engaged in performing the rewarded action (nose all the way into the port). Danger suppresses all reward behavior regardless of proximity to rewarded action. In contrast, uncertainty selectively suppresses reward behavior most proximal to the rewarded action.</p><p>By comprehensively quantifying behavior and constructing temporal ethograms, we found a fear conditioned cue to independently control at least six distinct behaviors during fear acquisition and three distinct behaviors during fear extinction. Though our study was exclusively behavioral, we feel our results have implications for investigations into the neural basis of fear learning and the organization of defensive behavior. Most important is that a fear conditioned cue does not simply elicit freezing. Behaviors elicited by a fear conditioned cue are the product of many factors: species, sex, age, behavioral setting, and experimenter-determined parameters (CS/US type, duration, and intensity; trial number, inter-trial interval [ITI], and more). In our view, freezing is a common – not dominant – defensive behavior because the field has favored behavioral settings and experimenter-determined parameters that maximize the expression of ‘fear’ through freezing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McDannald, 2023</xref>). Here, we show that a relatively simple modification of the rat’s behavioral setting – access to a rewarded action – is sufficient to de-emphasize freezing and promote the expression of many additional behaviors. Most prominent of these is locomotion. Even more, Pavlovian fear conditioning over a baseline of reward seeking reveals a temporally organized sequence of cue-elicited defensive behaviors predicted by PIC theory. The independent expression of these behaviors is appealing for studies attempting to link discrete behavioral sequelae of ‘fear’ to distinct neural circuits, breathing new life into a classic Pavlovian fear conditioning procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Estes and Skinner, 1941</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All procedures were performed in the Boston College Animal Care Facility in accordance with NIH and Boston College guidelines.

Rats were single-housed on a 12-hr light cycle (lights off at 6:00 pm) and maintained at their initial body weight with standard laboratory chow (18% Protein Rodent Diet #2018, Harlan Teklad Global Diets, Madison, WI). Water was available ad libitum in the home cage. For Experiment 2, sixteen adult Long Evans rats (eight females) were housed and maintained as described above. All protocols were approved by the Boston College Animal Care and Use Committee and all experiments were carried out in accordance with the NIH guidelines regarding the care and use of rats for experimental procedures.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Behavior apparatus</title><p>The apparatus for Pavlovian fear discrimination consisted of four individual chambers with aluminum front and back walls, clear acrylic sides and top, and a grid floor. LED strips emitting 940 nm light were affixed to the acrylic top to illuminate the behavioral chamber for frame capture. 940-nm illumination was chosen because rats do not detect light wavelengths exceeding 930 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nikbakht and Diamond, 2021</xref>). Each grid floor bar was electrically connected to an aversive shock generator (Med Associates, St. Albans, VT). An external food cup, and a central port equipped with infrared photocells were present on one wall. Auditory stimuli were generated with an Arduino-based device and presented through two speakers mounted on the ceiling.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Pellet exposure and nose poke shaping</title><p>Rats were food restricted and specifically fed to maintain their body weight throughout behavioral testing. Each rat was given 4 g of experimental pellets in their home cage in order to overcome neophobia. Next, the central port was removed from the experimental chamber, and rats received a 30-min session in which one pellet was delivered every minute. The central port was returned to the experimental chamber for the remainder of behavioral testing. Each rat was then shaped to nose poke in the central port for experimental pellet delivery using a fixed ratio schedule in which one nose poke into the port yielded one pellet. Shaping sessions lasted 30 min or until approximately 50 nose pokes were completed. Each rat then received six sessions during which nose pokes into the port were reinforced on a variable interval schedule. Session 1 used a variable interval 30-s schedule (poking into the port was reinforced every 30 s on average). All remaining sessions used a variable interval 60-s schedule. For the remainder of behavioral testing, nose pokes were reinforced on a variable interval 60-s schedule independent of cue and shock presentation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Cue pre-exposure</title><p>Each rat was pre-exposed to the three cues to be used in Pavlovian discrimination in one session. Auditory cues consisted of repeating motifs of broadband click, phaser, or trumpet. This 37-min session consisted of four presentations of each cue (12 total presentations) with a mean ITI of 2.5 min. Trial type order was randomly determined by the behavioral program and differed for each rat, each session.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Pavlovian fear discrimination</title><sec id="s4-5-1"><title>Experiment 1</title><p>Each rat received 16, 48-min sessions of fear discrimination. Each session consisted of 16 trials, with a mean ITI of 2.5 min. Auditory cues were 10 s in duration. Each cue was associated with a unique foot shock probability (0.5 mA, 0.5 s): danger, p = 1.00; uncertainty, p = 0.25; and safety, p = 0.00. Foot shock was administered 2 s following the termination of the auditory cue on danger and uncertainty-shock trials. Auditory identity was counterbalanced across rats. Each session consisted of four danger trials, two uncertainty-shock trials, six uncertainty-omission trials, and four safety trials. Trial type order was randomly determined by the behavioral program and differed for each rat, each session.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-2"><title>Experiment 2</title><p>Each rat received 12, 48-min sessions of fear discrimination. Each session consisted of eight trials, with a mean ITI of 3.5 min. Auditory cues were 10 s in duration. Each cue was associated with a unique foot shock probability (0.5 mA, 0.5 s): danger, p = 1.00 and safety, p = 0.00. Foot shock was administered 2 s following the termination of the auditory cue on danger trials. Auditory identity was counterbalanced across rats. Each session consisted of four danger trials and four safety trials. Trial type order was randomly determined by the behavioral program and differed for each rat, each session.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Fear extinction</title><p>For Experiment 2, each rat received two types of extinction test: one with the port and food cup present and one with the port and food cup absent. Test type order was counterbalanced across rats with half receiving the port and cup present first. Extinction sessions were 48 min in duration, and consisted of four danger and four safety trials, with a mean ITI of 3.5 min. Auditory cues were 10 s in duration. Foot shocks were not delivered. Auditory identity of danger and safety were maintained from discrimination, which was counterbalanced. Trial type order was randomly determined by the behavioral program and differed for each rat.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Calculating suppression ratio</title><p>Time stamps for cue presentations, shock delivery, and nose pokes (photobeam break) were automatically recorded by the Med Associates program. Baseline nose poke rate was calculated for each trial by counting the number of pokes during the 20 s pre-cue period and multiplying by 3. Cue nose poke rate was calculated for each trial by counting the number of pokes during the 10 s cue period and multiplying by 6. Nose poke suppression was calculated as a ratio: (baseline poke rate − cue poke rate)/(baseline poke rate + cue poke rate). A suppression ratio of ‘1’ indicated complete suppression of nose poking during cue presentation relative to baseline. A suppression ratio of indicated ‘0’ indicates equivalent nose poke rates during baseline and cue presentation. Gradations in suppression ratio between 1 and 0 indicated intermediate levels of nose poke suppression during cue presentation relative to baseline. Negative suppression ratios indicated increased nose poke rates during cue presentation relative to baseline.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Frame capture system</title><p>Behavior frames were captured using Imaging Source monochrome cameras (DMK 37BUX28; USB 3.1, 1/2.9″ Sony Pregius IMX287, global shutter, resolution 720 × 540, trigger in, digital out, C/CS-mount). Frame capture was triggered by the Med Associates behavior program. The 28 V Med Associates pulse was converted to a 5-V TTL pulse via Adapter (SG-231, Med Associates, St. Albans, VT). The TTL adapter was wired to the camera’s trigger input. Captured frames were saved to a PC (OptiPlex 7470 All-in-One) running IC Capture software (Imaging Source). For Experiment 1, frame capture began precisely 5 s before cue onset and continued throughout 10 s cue presentation. Frames were captured at a rate of 5 per second, with a target of capturing 75 frames per trial (5 frames/s × 15 s = 75 frames), and 1200 frames per session (75 frames/trial × 16 trials = 1200 frames). For Experiment 2, frame capture began 5 s before cue onset and continued throughout 10 s cue presentation and 5 s after cue termination. Frames were captured at a rate of 5 per second, with a target of capturing 100 frames per trial (5 frame/s × 20 s = 100 frames), and 800 frames per session (100 frames/trial × 8 trials = 800 frames).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Post-acquisition frame processing</title><sec id="s4-9-1"><title>Experiment 1</title><p>We aimed to capture 1200 frames per session, and selected sessions 2, 8, and 16 for hand scoring.

For Experiment 2, a total of 256 trials were scored from 16 rats over the 2 extinction sessions (8 trials per session). We anonymized trial information in order to score behavior without bias. The numerical information from each trial (session #, rat #, and trial #) was encrypted as a unique number sequence. A unique word was then added to the front of this sequence. The result was that each of the trials was converted into a unique word + number sequence. For example, trial ac01_02_07 (rat #1, session #2, and trial #7) would be encrypted as: abundant28515581. The trials from Experiment 1 were randomly assigned to five observers. 256 trials from Experiment 2 were randomly assigned to seven observers. The result of trial anonymization was that observers were completely blind to subject, trial type, and session number. Furthermore, random assignment meant that the 16 or 8 trials composing a single session were scored by different observers.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Behavior categories and definitions</title><p>Frames were scored as one of ten mutually exclusive behavior categories, defined as follows:</p><sec id="s4-11-1"><title>Background</title><p>Specific behavior cannot be discerned because the rat is turned away from the camera or position of forepaws is not clear, or because the rat is not engaged in any of the other behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11-2"><title>Cup</title><p>Any part of the nose above the food cup but below the nose port.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11-3"><title>Freeze</title><p>Arched back and stiff, rigid posture in the absence of movement, all four limbs on the floor (often accompanied by hyperventilation and piloerection). Side-to-side head movements and up and down head movements that do not disturb rigid posture are permitted. Activity such as sniffing or investigation of the bars is not freezing. Freezing, as opposed to pausing, is likely to be 3 or more frames (600+ms) long.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11-4"><title>Groom</title><p>Any scratching, licking, or washing of the body.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11-5"><title>Jump</title><p>All four limbs off the floor.

Frames were first watched in real time in Microsoft PowerPoint by setting the slide duration and transition to 0.19 s, then playing as a slideshow. Behaviors clearly observed were noted. Next, the observer went through all the frames scoring one behavior at a time. A standard scoring sequence was used: port, cup, rear, scale, jump, groom, freeze, locomote, and stretch. When the specific behavior was observed in a frame, that frame was labeled. Once all behaviors had been scored, the video was re-watched for freezing. The unlabeled frames were then labeled ‘background’. Finally, all background frames were checked to ensure they did not contain a defined behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Inter-observer reliability</title><sec id="s4-13-1"><title>Experiment 1</title><p>To assess inter-observer reliability, we selected 12 trials from outside sessions 2, 8, and 16, six from females and six from males.

Sex was used as a factor for all analyses. Cue, session, and time were used as factors when relevant. Univariate ANOVA following MANOVA used a Bonferroni-corrected p value significance of 0.0055 (0.05/9) to account for the nine quantified behaviors. MANOVA was performed for the nine quantified behaviors with factors of sex, cue, and time. Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used to examine the relationship between baseline nose poke rate and body weight, baseline nose poke rate and cue discrimination, as well as the relationship between danger cue-elicited behaviors during early and late cue presentation in session. Within-subject comparisons were made using 95% BCIs with the Matlab bootci function. Comparisons were said to differ when the 95% BCI did not contain zero.

male and female rats exhibit during the acquisition of Pavlovian fear conditioning in a conditioned suppression procedure. The data are compelling and provide an exhaustive analysis of behavior in a complex associative learning paradigm that blends aversive Pavlovian and appetitive instrumental elements. The generalizability of these findings to other paradigms could be enhanced, however, with the inclusion of tests of cue responses in a neutral environment. These findings are likely to be of interest to those who study fear conditioning and associative learning more broadly in rodents.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82497.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Hill</surname><given-names>Matthew N</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03yjb2x39</institution-id><institution>University of Calgary</institution></institution-wrap><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Maren</surname><given-names>Stephen</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01f5ytq51</institution-id><institution>Texas A&amp;M University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.08.05.502178">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.05.502178v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

In the discussion, the authors attempt to make apples-to-oranges comparisons with far simpler associative learning paradigms. Partially replicating those paradigms with an additional off-baseline test in a neutral environment conducted after the differential conditioning/instrumental suppression procedure would give great insight into how these data relate to those collected by other groups. The good thing about the inclusion of this experiment is that it is interesting no matter how it works out. If there are lots of locomotor reactions to the danger cue in the off-baseline context, that would suggest overall learning history is key, whereas if the animals snap into a strategy dominated by freezing it would suggest that the associative load of the testing context plays the crucial role.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82497.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>The reviewers all agree that the inclusion of an off-baseline test would be a necessary addition for this manuscript and would really increase the scope and impact of the paper (the other cues would be interesting to test in this way, as well, but the fully reinforced danger cue seems to produce the most counterintuitive result).
