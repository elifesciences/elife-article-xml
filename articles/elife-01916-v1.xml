Although the network underlying this process has been studied extensively, we do not yet have an end-to-end understanding of chemotaxis. Specifically, how the rotational states of a cell’s flagella cooperatively determine whether the cell ‘runs’ or ‘tumbles’ remains poorly characterized. Here, we measure the swimming behavior of individual <italic>E. coli</italic> cells while simultaneously detecting the rotational states of each flagellum. We find that a simple mathematical expression relates the cell’s run/tumble bias to the number and average rotational state of its flagella. However, due to inter-flagellar correlations, an ‘effective number’ of flagella—smaller than the actual number—enters into this relation. Data from a chemotaxis mutant and stochastic modeling suggest that fluctuations of the regulator CheY-P are the source of flagellar correlations. A consequence of inter-flagellar correlations is that run/tumble behavior is only weakly dependent on number of flagella.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01916.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01916.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01916.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p><italic>Escherichia coli</italic> is a rod-shaped bacterium commonly found in the lower intestines of humans and other warm-blooded animals. While most strains of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> are harmless, including most of those found in the human gut, some can cause diseases such as food poisoning. Due to its close association with humans and the fact that it is easy to grow and work with in the laboratory, <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> has been intensively studied for over 60 years.</p><p>Many bacteria are capable of ‘swimming’ by using one or more flagella. These rotating whip-like structures are each driven by a reversible motor, and they act a bit like a propeller on a boat. While some bacteria have only a single flagellum, others, such as <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, have multiple flagella distributed over the cell surface. Rotating all their flagella in a counterclockwise direction allows the bacterium to swim—and it has been proposed that the clockwise movement of at least one flagellum will cause the bacterium cell to stop swimming and start tumbling.</p><p><italic>E. coli</italic> is able to control the time it spends swimming or tumbling to move towards a nutrient, such as glucose, or away from certain harmful chemicals. However, the details of how the number of flagella and the direction of rotation (clockwise or counterclockwise) influence the motion of the bacterium are not fully understood.</p><p>Now, Mears et al. have used ‘optical tweezers’ to immobilize individual <italic>E. coli</italic> cells under a microscope, and then track both their swimming behavior and the movements of their flagella. This revealed that the individual flagella on the same cell tend to move in a coordinated way. Therefore, whilst tumbling could be caused by a single flagellum stopping swimming behavior, it often involved a concerted effort by many of the cell’s flagella.</p><p>After observing that <italic>E. coli</italic> cells with more flagella spent less time tumbling than would be predicted if a single flagella always ‘vetoed’ swimming, Mears et al. propose a new mathematical relationship between the number of flagella on the cell, the direction of rotation, and the resulting probability that the cell will tumble. This work shows that swimming behavior in bacteria is less affected by variations in the number of flagella than previously thought—and this phenomenon may provide evolutionary advantages to <italic>E. coli</italic>. The next step is to explore the mechanism by which bacteria coordinate their flagella.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01916.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01916.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>bacterial chemotaxis</kwd><kwd>optical tweezers</kwd><kwd>single-cell studies</kwd><kwd>flagella</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PHY-082265</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Golding</surname><given-names>Ido</given-names></name><name><surname>Chemla</surname><given-names>Yann R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chemla</surname><given-names>Yann R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Alfred P.

A typical <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cell is propelled by a bundle composed of multiple flagella. Each flagellum is controlled by a rotary motor that can switch between clockwise (CW) and counter-clockwise (CCW) rotation. When flagella on a cell rotate CCW, the cell swims along an approximately straight path called a ‘run’. When some of the flagella rotate CW, the bundle is disrupted causing an abrupt change in direction called a ‘tumble’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Macnab and Ornston, 1977</xref>). <italic>E. coli</italic> modulates the probability of being in one of these two swimming states in response to its environment, allowing it to navigate chemical, temperature, and light gradients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berg and Brown, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berg, 2004</xref>). At any point in time, the probability that a flagellar motor rotates CW is determined by the concentration of phosphorylated signaling protein CheY (CheY-P). Coupling CheY phosphorylation to chemicals from the environment allows the cell to bias its random walk and migrate towards more favorable conditions. This biased random walk is called chemotaxis, and serves as a model for understanding how living organisms process information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berg and Brown, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wadhams and Armitage, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shimizu et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Tremendous progress has been made towards elucidating the mechanism of bacterial chemotaxis. The relationship between the chemotaxis signaling network and the CCW/CW rotational bias of the individual flagellar motor is now well mapped ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Block et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cluzel et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sourjik and Berg, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yuan et al., 2012</xref>]; for a review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berg, 2004</xref>), and has also been described using detailed mathematical models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Emonet et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jiang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shimizu et al., 2010</xref>). Despite this wealth of knowledge, how the CCW/CW states of individual motors collectively determine the run/tumble swimming behavior of the whole, multi-flagellated cell remains poorly understood. The number of flagella on an individual swimming cell can vary greatly, from one to more than ten (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cohen-Ben-Lulu et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), yet very few studies are available to indicate how flagellar number affects swimming behavior. The only direct measurements of flagellar dynamics in swimming cells have been limited to short durations (∼1 s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Turner et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Darnton et al., 2007</xref>). The absence of long-term observations has precluded the development of a detailed mapping between flagellar state and cell swimming behavior. As a result, most theoretical models of bacterial chemotaxis are limited to treating an individual motor, or simply assume that all cells have a single flagellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bray et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kalinin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Matthaus et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jiang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Flores et al., 2012</xref>). Quantifying the mapping from single-flagellum state to whole-cell swimming behavior thus remains a missing link to developing an end-to-end picture of bacterial chemotaxis.</p><p>A number of theoretical models have been put forward in an attempt to describe this mapping. One such model invokes a ‘voting’ mechanism, in which cells tumble only if a majority of flagella rotate CW (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ishihara et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Spiro et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrews et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vladimirov et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jiang et al., 2010</xref>). However, by observing fluorescently labeled flagella during individual tumbles, Turner et al. established that CW rotation of a single flagellum is sufficient to ‘veto’ a run (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Turner et al., 2000</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Refined versions of this ‘veto model’ were recently developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vladimirov et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sneddon et al., 2012</xref>), based on careful, slow-motion observations of tumbles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Darnton et al., 2007</xref>). However, the extent to which these details are relevant for modeling swimming behavior is unknown, because no measurements have directly correlated long-term swimming behavior with flagellar activity in the same cell.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01916.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> cells deviate from the ‘veto’ model.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The mapping relating the run/tumble state of the cell to the CCW/CW state of its flagella according to the veto model.

Using an optical trap to hold a swimming cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Min et al., 2009</xref>) while simultaneously imaging its fluorescently labeled flagella, we relate directly the number and state of each flagellum on a cell to its swimming behavior. Our measurements establish a simple mapping between CCW/CW flagellar rotation and run/tumble bacterial swimming state for cells with arbitrary numbers of flagella. Surprisingly, we find that <italic>E. coli</italic> cells wild-type for chemotaxis do not strictly comply with the veto model, because the states of individual flagella in the same cell are strongly coupled. Flagella do not switch independently, and as a result, tumbles typically involve many of the flagella on the cell. The behavior of multi-flagellated cells can still be mapped to the simple veto model by renormalizing the flagellar number to a lower effective number of independent flagella. As for the cause of inter-flagella coupling, our data strongly favor a mechanism involving fluctuations of the signaling network rather than direct, physical interactions between flagella. This model is supported by the observation that mutant cells in which flagellar switching is decoupled from the chemotaxis network do obey the simple veto model, as well as by stochastic simulations of the swimming behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The tumble bias of wild-type cells deviates from the predictions of the veto model</title><p>According to the veto model, a cell tumbles whenever any one flagellum rotates CW (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Thus, the probability that a cell runs equals the probability that all of its flagella remain CCW. As a consequence, cells with more flagella are expected to tumble more, since there is a higher chance that at least one flagellum will deviate from the consensus and ‘veto’ the run. These predictions can be stated mathematically, under the assumption that the rotational direction of each flagellum is independent of the other flagella.

The instrument allowed us to measure simultaneously run/tumble behavior and flagellar dynamics in the same cell. The optical trap was used to hold each end of a single cell in place and the light scattered by the cell was utilized to monitor its swimming behavior, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Min et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">2012</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> (<xref ref-type="other" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>), cell runs were identified from oscillatory time signals due to cell body rotation at a frequency of ∼10 Hz. Cell tumbles were identified as periods of erratic motion during which the flagellar bundle was disrupted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Min et al., 2009</xref>). Flagella were fluorescently labeled using the method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Turner et al. (2010)</xref>. High speed, epi-fluorescent, stroboscopic imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Turner et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) was used to resolve individual flagella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Since the trapped cell remained in the field of view for a prolonged period, flagella were observed through multiple runs and tumbles (typically ∼5 events), limited by the time until flagella became too dim to discern due to photobleaching (∼8 to 40 s). The rotational direction of each flagellum was determined by observing its shape during 100-ms time windows. As shown by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Darnton et al. (2007)</xref>, flagella may take on different helical waveforms depending on their rotational state. These waveforms, termed ‘<italic>normal</italic>’, ‘<italic>semi-coiled</italic>’, ‘<italic>curly-1</italic>’, and ‘<italic>curly-2</italic>’, can be visually identified based on their pitch and wavelength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). CCW rotating flagella were identified based on the <italic>normal</italic> conformation, which they have been shown to adopt exclusively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Darnton et al., 2007</xref>), while CW rotating flagella were identified by their <italic>curly-1</italic> or <italic>semi-coiled</italic> shape. From the identification of CCW and CW intervals, the cell’s mean CW bias was determined by averaging the fraction of time that all the flagella on the cell spent CW (‘Materials and methods’).<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01916.009</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Strains and plasmids used in this work</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01916.009">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01916.009</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Strain</th><th>Genotype</th><th>Comments</th><th>Source</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>HCB1660</td><td><italic>fliC::</italic>Tn5 (Kan<sup>R</sup>)</td><td>‘wild type’ Contains plasmid pBAD33-fliC<sup>S219C</sup></td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Turner et al., 2010</xref>) Gift of H Berg</td></tr><tr><td>PM87</td><td><italic>cheBYZ::</italic>FRT<italic>, fliC::</italic>Tn5 (Kan<sup>R</sup>)</td><td>‘CheY*’ Contains plasmids pMS164 and pPM5</td><td>This study</td></tr><tr><td>RP437</td><td/><td>Wild-type for chemotaxis</td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Parkinson and Houts, 1982</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td>SK109</td><td><italic>cheBYZ::</italic>Cm</td><td/><td>This study</td></tr><tr><td>SK110</td><td><italic>cheBYZ::</italic>FRT</td><td/><td>This study</td></tr><tr><td>SK112</td><td><italic>cheBYZ::</italic>FRT<italic>, fliC::</italic>Tn5 (Kan<sup>R</sup>)</td><td/><td>This study</td></tr><tr><td>Plasmids</td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td> pBAD33 fliC<sup>S219C</sup></td><td><italic>fliC</italic><sup><italic>S219C</italic></sup> under P<sub>araBAD</sub> promoter, Cm<sup>R</sup>, p15a origin</td><td>Expresses mutant version of FliC for fluorescent labeling</td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Turner et al., 2010</xref>) Gift of H Berg</td></tr><tr><td> pPM5</td><td><italic>fliC</italic><sup><italic>S219C</italic></sup> under P<sub>araBAD</sub> promoter, Amp<sup>R</sup>, colE1 origin</td><td>Expresses mutant version of FliC for fluorescent labeling</td><td>This study</td></tr><tr><td> pMS164</td><td><italic>cheY</italic><sup><italic>D13K</italic></sup> under P<sub>lacOP</sub> promoter, Cm<sup>R</sup>, pSC101 origin</td><td>Expresses constitutively active version of CheY</td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alon et al., 1998</xref>) Gift of P Cluzel</td></tr><tr><td> pDK46</td><td/><td>Helper plasmid</td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Datsenko and Wanner, 2000</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td> pKD3</td><td/><td>Template for Cm<sup>R</sup> cassette</td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Datsenko and Wanner, 2000</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td> pCP20</td><td/><td>Helper plasmid</td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cherepanov and Wackernagel, 1995</xref>)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="video1" mime-subtype="mov" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-01916-media1-v1.mov"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01916.010</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Video of trapped wild-type cell with three labeled flagella as it runs and tumbles.</title><p>Slow motion video of the wild-type cell in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> with three long, fluorescently labeled flagella.

In the context of the veto model, the cells behaved as if they had a smaller number of flagella than what they actually had.</p><p>We first considered the possibility that a more detailed version of the veto model might explain the observed behavior and reconcile this discrepancy. A recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sneddon et al. (2012)</xref> used the observations of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Darnton et al. (2007)</xref> to refine the veto model. Specifically, the Sneddon model states that a cell with a minimum of <italic>X</italic> CCW flagella will run rather than tumble, provided the remaining (<italic>N</italic><sub><italic>flag</italic></sub>–<italic>X</italic>) CW flagella are in the <italic>curly-1</italic> conformation only (<italic>X</italic> is a parameter in the model, with possible values in the range [1, <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>flag</italic></sub> − 1]). Thus, the simple veto model considered above corresponds to <italic>X</italic> = <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>flag</italic></sub>, and the least perturbative refinement to the model corresponds to <italic>X</italic> = <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>flag</italic></sub> − 1, in which a cell with a single <italic>curly-1</italic> flagellum still runs. However, in our measurements we observed that cells with a single CW flagellum in the <italic>curly-1</italic> state still tumbled 82% of the time (44 s of cumulative time in which one flagellum was in the <italic>curly-1</italic> state; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). Modifying the Sneddon model to allow runs 18% of the time was not sufficient to reproduce the trend observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Wild-type tumbles typically involve multiple flagella</title><p>To investigate the discrepancy between our data and the veto model, we next examined individual tumble events in greater detail. In agreement with the original observation of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Turner et al. (2000)</xref>, we found that CW rotation of a single flagellum was indeed sufficient to cause a tumble in multi-flagellated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>, samples A, D and E). However, we also observed that more than half of tumbles in multi-flagellated cells (56%, 117/210 events) actually involved multiple CW flagella. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> shows a representative trace from a wild-type cell with three flagella. There are times during each tumble in the trace where all three flagella are in a CW state. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, the number of CW flagella ‘participating’ in a tumble (black circles) was significantly larger than would be expected if flagella were independently switching (gray dashed line, obtained from simulations of a cell with independent flagella; see ‘Materials and methods’). Our results thus suggest that while a single CW flagellum is sufficient to induce a tumble (in agreement with a simple veto model), flagella are also coupled and may thus switch in groups, in a correlated fashion. Further evidence for inter-flagella coupling was obtained by calculating the cross-correlation between pairs of flagella on a given cell. We found a significant correlation between the rotational directions of pairs of flagella on the same cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, black data points). This correlation persisted for ∼1 s, the average duration of a tumble. Our findings are consistent with previous observations by Terasawa et al. on surface-immobilized cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Terasawa et al., 2011</xref>). There, correlations between individual motors on the same cell were detected by monitoring beads attached to flagellar stubs, as opposed to complete flagella on swimming cells in our present work.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01916.011</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Tumbles in wild-type cells involve multiple CW flagella.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A typical time trace from a wild-type cell with 3 flagella.

Terasawa et al. observed that mutant cells, in which the concentration of CheY-P was decoupled from the chemotaxis network, displayed no correlations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Terasawa et al., 2011</xref>). This led us to likewise investigate the behavior of a strain, PM87, expressing a constitutively-active CheY (CheY<sup>D13K</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alon et al., 1998</xref>], denoted CheY*, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>). The protein was exogenously expressed, with the expression level chosen such that the population-averaged tumble bias matched that of wild-type cells (‘Materials and methods’). A representative trace from a CheY* cell with three flagella is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="other" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). Upon inspection, flagellar switching appears far less correlated than in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, compare black and gray data points). Comparing 54 wild-type and 24 CheY* cells with the same mean CW biases (0.11 ± 0.07 vs 0.11 ± 0.07, mean ± SD) we found that, on average, fewer CW rotating flagella participated in tumbles in the CheY* strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, open circles). Moreover, the number of participating flagella in the CheY* strain closely matched the expectation for cells with independently switching flagella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, dashed line). (This number deviates from unity and trends upwards with number of flagella simply because of the finite probability that two tumbles overlap by chance.) Our results indicate that when the signal for flagellar motors to switch their rotational state is decoupled from the chemotaxis network, the motors switch independently. Based on our interpretation of the wild-type data, we thus expect CheY* cells to adhere to the simple veto model. As shown in the plot of <italic>η</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> (open circles), CheY* cells indeed match the veto model closely (<italic>η</italic> = −0.08 ± 0.15, mean ± SEM). The existence of correlations between flagella states in wild-type cells may thus explain why cells with multiple flagella deviate from the veto model.<table-wrap id="tbl2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01916.014</object-id><label>Table 2.</label><caption><p>Primers used in this work</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01916.014">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01916.014</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Primer</th><th>Sequence</th><th>Comments</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>SK140F</td><td>TGCGTGGTCAGACGGTGTATGCGCTAAGTAAGGATTAACG GTGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTC</td><td><italic>cheBYZ</italic> deletion forward</td></tr><tr><td>SK140R</td><td>GCCTGATATGACGTGGTCACGCCACATCAGGCAATACAAA CATATGAATATCCTCCTTAG</td><td><italic>cheBYZ</italic> deletion reverse</td></tr><tr><td>SK141F</td><td>CCTTAAACCCGACGGATTGC</td><td><italic>cheBYZ</italic> deletion check forward</td></tr><tr><td>SK141R</td><td>TTGCTGCCACACATCAAGC</td><td><italic>cheBYZ</italic> deletion check reverse</td></tr><tr><td>SK163F</td><td>AGGGTTATTGTCTCATGAGC</td><td>pZE11 sequencing forward</td></tr><tr><td>SK163R</td><td>GTTTTATTTGATGCCTCTAG</td><td>pZE11 sequencing reverse</td></tr><tr><td>PM7F</td><td>GGG GACGTC ATCGATGCATAATGTGCCTG</td><td>amplify P<sub>araBAD</sub> <italic>fliC</italic><sup><italic>S219C</italic></sup> forward</td></tr><tr><td>PM7R</td><td>GGG GTCGAC TTAACCCTGCAGC</td><td>amplify P<sub>araBAD</sub> <italic>fliC</italic><sup><italic>S219C</italic></sup> reverse</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="video2" mime-subtype="mov" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-01916-media2-v1.mov"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01916.015</object-id><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>Video of trapped CheY* cell with two labeled flagella as it runs and tumbles.</title><p>Slow motion video, similar to <xref ref-type="other" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>, of a trapped CheY* cell with two fluorescently labeled flagella.

What is the source of these flagellar correlations? The absence of correlations in the CheY* strain and its adherence to a simple veto model provide an important clue to understanding the mechanism of inter-flagellar coupling. In wild-type cells, CheY-P levels are subject to phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation reactions by chemotaxis network components and are believed to fluctuate in time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Korobkova et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sneddon et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, in the mutant strain, CheY* levels are decoupled from the network and are thus expected to be constant over the timescales of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Korobkova et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Min et al., 2009</xref>). Terasawa et al. proposed that fluctuations in CheY-P levels may thus provide a mechanism by which the CW biases of multiple flagella on a cell can be coupled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Terasawa et al., 2011</xref>). To test whether such a mechanism could account for the different features of bacterial swimming observed in our study, we performed simulations of whole-cell swimming driven by the chemotaxis network. In particular, we investigated how fluctuations in CheY-P concentration could produce differences in inter-flagellar correlations between wild-type and CheY* cells and consequent differences in their respective mappings of CW bias to tumble bias.</p><p>We performed stochastic simulations of the chemotaxis network and resulting flagellar motor activity and then applied the veto rule that CW rotation of a single flagellum leads to cell tumbling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>; ‘Materials and methods’). For wild-type cells, we incorporated fluctuations in CheY-P concentration using the approach of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sneddon et al. (2012)</xref>.

We found that, consistently, simulations with CheY-P fluctuations were able to duplicate the observed wild-type behavior, while simulations without fluctuations matched CheY* data and the predictions of the ‘naïve’ veto model. Specifically, using only two parameters—the amplitude and the characteristic timescale for CheY-P fluctuations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>)—as fitting parameters, our simulations simultaneously reproduced (i) the relation between flagellar number and flagellar participation in tumbles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>); (ii) temporal correlations between flagella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>); (iii) the effective number of flagella in multi-flagellated wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>); and (iv) the degree of deviation from the veto model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01916.018</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>A theoretical model incorporating CheY-P fluctuations reproduces wild-type data.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Simulated time trace for a wild-type cell.

By imaging many individual tumbles (<italic>N</italic> = 203 in wild-type cells), we are able to describe in great detail the underlying structure of a tumbling event. For instance, we can follow the sequence of flagellar waveforms that occurs when motors switch from CCW to CW rotation and back to CCW. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> shows the distribution of possible sequences of flagellar waveforms during tumbles. In particular, the sequence of states from <italic>normal</italic> to <italic>semi-coiled</italic> to <italic>curly-1</italic> that we observed was described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Darnton et al. (2007)</xref> as a ‘canonical tumble’. Although we cannot rule out that runs and tumbles in the optical trap are different in some ways than those in free swimming cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Min et al., 2009</xref>), our results are in qualitative agreement with these previous observations.</p><p>Our measurements also reveal the relationship between the cell’s run/tumble state and the CCW/CW rotational state of its flagella. In a multi-flagellated wild-type cell, a single CW flagellum (either <italic>semi-coiled</italic> or <italic>curly-1</italic>) is sufficient to induce a tumble, in agreement with the simple veto model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Turner et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Darnton et al., 2007</xref>). However, the number of CW flagella during a tumble typically exceeds that expected from a cell with independently switching flagella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The high fraction of CW flagella during tumbles in wild-type cells is in qualitative agreement with previous measurements by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Turner et al. (2000)</xref>, who observed that a majority of tumbles involved multiple flagella leaving the bundle. Our measurements using the CheY* strain provide an important piece of evidence linking inter-flagellar coupling to the chemotaxis network. We propose that fluctuations in the concentration of CheY-P are at the heart of wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> behavior. In our theoretical analysis, the existence of temporal fluctuations was sufficient to explain all of our data. Stochastic simulations with and without CheY-P fluctuations (representing wild-type and CheY* cells, respectively) reproduced all of the observed differences between our two strains. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> summarizes how CheY-P fluctuations could lead to correlated flagellar switching. A well-known feature of the chemotaxis network is the sigmoidal relation between CW bias and CheY-P concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cluzel et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yuan and Berg, 2013</xref>). A consequence of this non-linearity is that the probability of CW rotation is highly sensitive, and can respond dramatically to fluctuations in CheY-P levels, provided their amplitude is sufficiently large. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, when CheY-P concentration is high, the cell experiences a near-100% probability of CW rotation and multiple motors switch CW at approximately the same time. In contrast, when CheY-P concentration is low, the probability of any motor rotating CW is essentially zero. This mechanism can explain the elevated number of CW flagella involved in tumbles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and correlation between flagella states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). By contrast, in simulations where CheY-P level was held constant, flagellar switching was not as correlated and the majority of tumbles involved only a single CW flagellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p>Despite the success of this model in reproducing our data, we must acknowledge that there is no direct experimental evidence to-date for the CheY-P fluctuations depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>. Fluctuations in CheY-P have been inferred from experimental observations of CW bias in tethered-bead assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Korobkova et al., 2004</xref>). However, the fluctuations described in that study are different in their time scale and amplitude from what we found required to produce the observed correlations in flagellar rotational direction (‘Materials and methods’). Future investigation will be essential to resolving this issue and will likely have to involve direct measurements of CheY-P temporal dynamics in individual cells. Such measurements are challenging, but the development of intra-cellular fluorescence sensors for kinase activity in the network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sourjik and Berg, 2002</xref>) provides a promising approach.</p><p>As an alternative mechanism for the inter-flagellar correlations observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Terasawa et al. (2011)</xref> (and in the present work), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hu and Tu (2013)</xref> proposed that hydrodynamic interactions between nearby flagella could also generate correlations in their rotational direction. One consequence of their model is that the flagellar switching rates in a cell with a single flagellum will be different than those in multi-flagellated cells. However, this prediction is not borne out by our data. In our experiments, the number of flagella per cell did not have a significant effect on the switching rates between CCW and CW states, nor on the switching rates between different flagellar waveforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1 fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 1 and 2</xref>). While we cannot rule out the presence of hydrodynamic interactions between flagella, these must satisfy the strict requirement that switching rates remain independent of flagellar number. In light of these constraints, we believe a mechanism in which chemotaxis network fluctuations engender inter-flagella correlations to be more plausible. For cells with <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>flag</italic></sub> &gt; 4, we note that both strains appear to deviate from the generalized veto model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). It is possible that hydrodynamic effects must be taken in consideration in cells with many flagella. Hydrodynamic coupling in the Hu model leads to a lower <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>eff</italic></sub>, in the direction of the deviation.

Finally, we must consider the possibility that the apparent deviation is due to systematic experimental error, since it is more difficult to determine visually the state of each flagellum on cells with many flagella.</p><p>While a large number of studies have elucidated mathematical relationships between many of the components of the chemotaxis network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Block et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cluzel et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sourjik and Berg, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shimizu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yuan et al., 2012</xref>), there have been few experimental studies devoted to the relationship between individual flagella and whole-cell swimming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Turner et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Darnton et al., 2007</xref>). As a result, existing models of bacterial chemotaxis have made drastically different assumptions in order to describe the swimming behavior of the whole cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bray et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jiang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vladimirov et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sneddon et al., 2012</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, the current study provides the first experimentally-derived mathematical relation between flagellar and whole-cell-swimming states.</p><p>We propose that the details of this mapping are crucial for fully understanding bacterial chemotaxis. Results from recent theoretical models suggest that the details of flagellar mechanics can have significant effects on chemotactic drift. Turner et al. observed that, on average, the angular change in swimming direction upon tumbling increases as a function of the number of flagella that leave the bundle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Turner et al., 2000</xref>). Vladimirov et al. showed that when this effect is incorporated into a theoretical model of bacterial chemotaxis, the chemotactic drift is nearly doubled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vladimirov et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Our observations that multi-flagellated wild-type cells tumble significantly less than expected also implies that the cell’s swimming behavior (and presumably its chemotactic response) is robust against variations in the number of flagella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). We hypothesize that this phenomenon may confer evolutionary advantages, in light of the large fluctuations in flagellar numbers within a cell population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). If cells with many flagella did not behave like cells with fewer flagella, then they would spend the majority of their time tumbling, a behavior that would inhibit chemotaxis. <italic>E. coli</italic> thus appears to have developed a mechanism to achieve similar tumble biases with a wide range of flagellar number.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Microbiology</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Cell preparation</title><p>Experiments were performed using two <italic>E. coli</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

The instrument design is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>. The optical trap was constructed following a previously described design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Comstock et al., 2011</xref>). A 5-W, 1064-nm diode-pumped solid-state laser (BL-106C, Spectra-Physics, Santa Clara, California) was used to produce two optical traps via timesharing, by intermittently deflecting the laser with an acousto-optic deflector, AOD (DTD-274HD6, IntraAction, Bellwood, Illinois). The separation between the two traps was controlled by modulating the two deflection angles of the beams emanating from the acousto-optic deflector via the RF signal frequency driving the AOD. The IR beams were tightly focused to generate two optical traps by a 60×, water-immersion (1.2 NA) microscope objective (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). An identical objective lens collected transmitted light for position detection and bright-field imaging, as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Min et al. (2009)</xref>. The flow chamber was positioned between the two objective lenses and was moveable relative to the two traps in all directions by a motorized three-axis translational stage (ESP301; Newport, Irvine, California). Cell motion was detected directly by the optical traps themselves, using back-focal plane interferometry, in which trap light scattered by an object relays the object’s position relative to the trap in all three directions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gittes and Schmidt, 1998</xref>). All devices and timing were controlled using custom LabVIEW (National Instruments, Austin, Texas) code (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Comstock et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2"><title>Fluorescence imaging</title><p>Epi-fluorescence imaging of trapped cells was achieved by excitation with a 532-nm laser (TECGL-30, World Star Tech, Toronto, Canada) and collecting backwards emitted photons with an EMCCD camera (iXon3 860 EMCCD, Andor, Belfast, Ireland). The beam size at the sample plane was approximately 20 microns in diameter. To obtain clear images of the flagella as they rotated at angular frequencies ∼100 Hz, it was necessary to take short exposures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). To this end, we used stroboscopic illumination similarly to previous experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Darnton et al., 2007</xref>). This was achieved by intermittently deflecting the 532-nm laser beam with a second acousto-optic modulator (AOM-802AF1, IntraAction), so as to generate short-duration excitation pulses (20 µs). The EMCCD recorded 128 × 128-pixel images (∼10 × 10 µm) synchronized with each excitation pulse (see timing in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, images <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Additionally, we pulsed the IR trapping laser out of phase with the fluorescence excitation at a rate of 16 kHz, a technique which has been shown to significantly reduce photo-bleaching, with minimal consequence to the trapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brau et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Comstock et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). The results were high speed movies showing sharp images of all the flagella on a cell as it runs and tumbles for many seconds (typically &gt;10 s), along with synchronous signal traces from the optical traps. Fluorescence movies were saved using Solis software (Andor), and subsequently analyzed manually using Matlab (Mathworks, Natick, Massachusetts). When played back in slow-motion, flagella could be reliably counted by eye during tumbles.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-3"><title>Fluidics</title><p>Experiments were performed in a custom-built microfluidic chamber.

The flow channel pattern was cut out from Nescofilm (Karlan, Phoenix, Arizona) using a laser engraver (Versa Laser, Scottsdale, Arizona) and placed between two coverslips, one of which had custom-drilled holes (0.05-inch diameter) for inlets and outlets. The Nescofilm flow channel pattern was bonded to coverslips by melting on a hot plate for 4 min. The completed flow chamber was inserted into a custom metal frame where inlet and outlet tubing (ABW00001; Tygon, Saint-Gobain, Paris, France) were screwed on for a tight seal. The two channels of the flow chamber were continuously injected with appropriate buffers using a syringe pump (PHD2000; Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, Massachusetts) at a linear speed of 30 μm/s, which is approximately equal to the swimming speed of a healthy cell. The upper channel was injected with TMB (see above), while the bottom channel contained cells in TMB.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Michael Laub (Reviewing editor); Howard Berg (peer reviewer).</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In general, all three reviewers enjoyed reading this manuscript and the consensus was that it should ultimately be published in <italic>eLife</italic>; we thought it was a well-executed and important study with broad appeal. We had only a few minor issues to address in a revised manuscript:</p><p>1) Change the title to something that better captures the big picture, take-home message of the paper. The current title seems tailored for chemotaxis aficionados. Perhaps something along the lines of what was submitted as the “Impact Statement” which was “The swimming behavior of <italic>E. coli</italic> is surprisingly robust against natural variations in the number of flagella per cell”. Maybe just remove the word ‘surprisingly’ and it would be a title that captures the major conclusion of the paper and might appeal to a broader audience.</p><p>2) It was noted that the generalized veto model holds only up to 4 flagella per cell. It would be prudent to note this and discuss the disagreement when there are 5 or more flagella.</p><p>3) One reviewer thought it would be useful to provide a simple empirical formula for calculating <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>eff</italic></sub> from <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>flag</italic></sub> so that modellers in particular could implement the conversion as needed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01916.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Change the title to something that better captures the big picture, take-home message of the paper.

We have changed our title to capture the big-picture message of the paper better. The new title is “<italic>Escherichia coli</italic> swimming is robust against variations in flagellar number.”</p><p><italic>2) It was noted that the generalized veto model holds only up to 4 flagella per cell. It would be prudent to note this and discuss the disagreement when there are 5 or more flagella</italic>.</p><p>This is a good point. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, both strains deviate from the generalized veto models for cells with more than 4 flagella. We have added a discussion of the possible explanations for this deviation in the text.</p><p>It is possible that hydrodynamic effects must be taken in consideration in cells with many flagella. Hydrodynamic coupling in the Hu model leads to a lower <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>eff</italic></sub>, in the direction of the deviation. Alternatively, a mechanism as described by Sneddon et al. in which cells with many flagella can run while some of its flagella rotate CW in the <italic>curly-1</italic> state, could lead to a similar deviation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1–figure supplement 5</xref>). Finally, we must consider the possibility that the apparent deviation is due to systematic experimental error, since it is more difficult to determine visually the state of each flagellum on cells with many flagella.</p><p><italic>3) One reviewer thought it would be useful to provide a simple empirical formula for calculating N</italic><sub><italic>eff</italic></sub> <italic>from N</italic><sub><italic>flag</italic></sub> <italic>so that modellers in particular could implement the conversion as needed</italic>.</p><p>We performed a fit to the wild-type data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> to provide a simple empirical formula for calculating <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>eff</italic></sub> from <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>flag</italic></sub>. The power law <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>eff</italic></sub> = 1.27 x <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>flag</italic></sub><sup>0.5</sup> provides a reasonable match to the data and is provided in the Results section as part of the description of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>.
