This process promotes extracellular matrix production and accelerates the pathological progression of fibrotic diseases. Alternative splicing plays an important role in multiple disease development, while U2 small nuclear RNA auxiliary factor 2 (U2AF2) is an essential factor in the early steps of pre-mRNA splicing. However, the molecular mechanism underlying abnormal <italic>CCN2</italic> expression upon TGF-β stimulation remains unclear. This study elucidates that SIRT4 acts as a master regulator for CCN2 expression in response to TGF-β by modulating U2AF2-mediated alternative splicing. Analyses of renal biopsy specimens from patients with CKD and mouse fibrotic kidney tissues revealed marked nuclear accumulation of SIRT4. The tubulointerstitial fibrosis was alleviated by global deletion or tubular epithelial cell (TEC)-specific knockout of <italic>Sirt4</italic>, and aggravated by adeno-associated virus-mediated SIRT4 overexpression in TECs. Furthermore, SIRT4 was found to translocate from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm through the BAX/BAK pore under TGF-β stimulation. In the cytoplasm, TGF-β activated the ERK pathway and induced the phosphorylation of SIRT4 at Ser36, which further promoted its interaction with importin α1 and subsequent nuclear translocation. In the nucleus, SIRT4 was found to deacetylate U2AF2 at K413, facilitating the splicing of CCN2 pre-mRNA to promote CCN2 protein expression. Importantly, exosomes containing anti-SIRT4 antibodies were found to effectively mitigate the UUO-induced kidney fibrosis in mice. Collectively, these findings indicated that SIRT4 plays a role in kidney fibrosis by regulating CCN2 expression via the pre-mRNA splicing.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>kidney fibrosis</kwd><kwd>pre-mRNA splicing</kwd><kwd>U2 snRNP</kwd><kwd>SIRT4</kwd><kwd>U2AF2</kwd><kwd>CCN2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82370876</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Shu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82170842</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liang</surname><given-names>Zhen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82371572</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liang</surname><given-names>Zhen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82171556</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kang</surname><given-names>Lin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Key Program Topics of Shenzhen Basic Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JCYJ20220818102605013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kang</surname><given-names>Lin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>SIRT4 regulates cellular communication network factor 2 expression through U2 small nuclear RNA auxiliary factor 2-mediated pre-mRNA splicing, presenting a potential therapeutic target for kidney fibrosis.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the kidney and other organ systems, the overexpression (OE) of cellular communication network 2 (CCN2), also known as connective tissue growth factor, is widely recognized as a marker of fibrotic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gupta et al., 2000</xref>). Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is a master regulator of tissue growth, regeneration, remodeling, and fibrosis, Most TGF-β responses involve CCN2 stimulation at some level, such as the stimulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components and fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kinashi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tampe and Zeisberg, 2014</xref>). Numerous signaling molecules are involved in the crosstalk and integration of TGF-β and CCN2 effects and vary depending on the cell type and the physiological or pathological process involved. For instance, TGF-β-stimulated SMADs are necessary for the induction of CCN2 expression in normal fibroblasts and basal CCN2 induction in scleroderma fibroblasts, while the maintenance of CCN2 expression is independent of SMADs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Holmes et al., 2001</xref>). However, it remains unknown whether TGF-β1 regulates CCN2 expression via non-transcriptional pathways.</p><p>Sirtuins (Sirts), mammalian Sir2 orthologs, are a highly conserved family of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent protein deacetylases and act as important regulators of the aging process, inflammation, cancer, and metabolic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Morigi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chalkiadaki and Guarente, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baur et al., 2012</xref>). Among the seven known mammalian Sirts, SIRT4 possesses ADP-ribosyltransferase, lipoamidase, and deacylase activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haigis et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mathias et al., 2014</xref>). The inhibition of SIRT4 expression has been shown to increase the fat-oxidation capacity of the liver and mitochondrial function in the muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nasrin et al., 2010</xref>). As loss of fatty acid β-oxidation in the proximal tubule is a critical mediator of acute kidney injury and eventual fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gu et al., 2022</xref>), we hypothesize that SIRT4 may act as a pro-fibrotic factor. However, other studies have demonstrated that SIRT4 OE inhibits glutamine metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Csibi et al., 2013</xref>), which is necessary for collagen protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stegen et al., 2019</xref>). This suggests a potential protective role of SIRT4 in the context of fibrosis. However, the specific mechanism by which SIRT4 regulates renal fibrosis remains unclear. Therefore, research is needed to further explore the role and mechanisms of SIRT4 in renal fibrosis, as well as potential therapeutic strategies.</p><p>An estimated 60% of all human genes undergo alternative splicing, a highly regulated process that produces splice variants with different functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sazani and Kole, 2003</xref>). There are five small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs)—U1, U2, U5, and U4/U6. The status of these proteins helps in maintaining sufficient proteomic diversity for the functional requirements of cell fates and body homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maniatis and Tasic, 2002</xref>). U2 small nuclear RNA auxiliary factor 1 (U2AF1), together with U2AF2, forms the U2AF complex that recognizes and binds to the 3′ splice site of pre-mRNA and recruits U2 snRNPs, thereby facilitating the assembly of the spliceosome, a large RNA-protein complex responsible for the splicing of pre-mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zorio and Blumenthal, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Merendino et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agrawal et al., 2016</xref>). The SF3B complex, which is the core of the U2 snRNP, comprises SF3B1, SF3B2, SF3B3, SF3B4, SF3B5, SF3B6, and PHF5A/ SF3B14b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Will et al., 2002</xref>). Dysregulation of U2AF2 can lead to the disruption of splicing events, which may contribute to the development and progression of kidney fibrosis. Accordingly, understanding the role of U2AF2 in kidney fibrosis may provide valuable insights into its underlying molecular mechanisms.</p><p>Here, we demonstrated that TGF-β1 induced SIRT4 nuclear translocation, resulting in the deacetylation of U2AF2 and recruitment of U2 snRNP, subsequently contributing to pre-mRNA splicing and enhanced protein expression of CCN2. Overall, our study revealed that SIRT4 inhibition can alleviate the progression of renal fibrosis by suppressing CCN2 expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Nuclear localization of SIRT4 increases in fibrotic kidney</title><p>The application of mitochondrial SIRT4 tripartite abundance reporter, a tripartite probe for visualizing the distribution of SIRT4 between mitochondria and the nucleus in single cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ramadani-Muja et al., 2019</xref>), proved the importation of SIRT4 into the mitochondrial matrix and demonstrated its localization in the nucleus under mitochondrial stress conditions.

We employed rapid immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry of endogenous proteins (RIME), which is an efficient and unbiased proteomic approach for identifying interacting proteins. Human TECs were treated with TGF-β1 or the control (DMSO) for 24 hr, followed by protein-DNA crosslinking in 1% formaldehyde. Cells were sonicated, followed by immunoprecipitation with an SIRT4 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Mass spectrometry identified a total of 1081 unique proteins that copurified with SIRT4. We only considered SIRT4-associated proteins that occurred in three of three independent replicates and excluded any proteins that appeared in any one of the IgG control RIMEs. As a result, we selected of 22 SIRT4-associated proteins. Notably, the SIRT4 interaction involved numerous specific nuclear localization proteins, such as PUF60, U2AF2, RPS2, TSR1, ZC3H15, and SART1. Of these, U2AF2 and PUF60 function cooperatively in pre-mRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hastings et al., 2007</xref>). The levels (normalized) of PUF60 and U2AF2 are shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>. We next determined whether PUF60 or U2AF2 was recruited to SIRT4 in TECs stimulated with TGF-β1. Immunoblotting of immunoprecipitated SIRT4 with anti-PUF60 and -U2AF2 antibodies showed that TGF-β1 treatment resulted in an interaction among SIRT4, PUF60, and U2AF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, left panel). Whole-kidney tissue lysates consistently showed an interaction among SIRT4, PUF60, and U2AF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, middle panel). As U2AF2 has been shown to interact with PUF60 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hastings et al., 2007</xref>), we tested whether SIRT4 interacts with either of the two proteins via the U2AF2-PUF60 interaction. The interaction between SIRT4 and PUF60 was abolished in U2af2-knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). However, the interaction of SIRT4 and U2AF2 was not affected in <italic>Puf60</italic> knockdown cells (data not shown). Furthermore, exogenous co-IP revealed an interaction between SIRT4 and U2AF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, right panel).

Our results showed that <italic>Sirt4</italic> OE reduced the levels of acetylated U2AF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). However, the ADP-ribosylation of U2AF2 was extremely low in both SIRT4 OE and control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). According to the database Compendium of Protein Lysine Modifications 4.0, lysine (K) 70, 276, 292, 413, 453, and 462 on U2AF2 can be acetylated. Hence, we mutated all six K residues to arginine (R), which mimics the deacetylated state of the protein. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, the U2AF2-K413R mutant showed reduced acetylation compared to U2AF2 WT.

Next, we examined whether U2AF2 K413 is the key acetylation site in response to TGF-β1 stimulation. TGF-β1 treatment reduced the levels of acetylated U2AF2 in WT but had little effect in the K413R mutant U2AF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). Consistently, U2AF2 acetylation decreased in the kidney following injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). Interestingly, U2AF2 acetylation was also remarkably reduced in the cells subjected to serum starvation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (induced by tunicamycin), viral infection [poly (I:C)], or DNA damage stress (induced by cisplatin) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>). These results collectively demonstrate that U2AF2 deacetylation occurs universally in response to cellular stress.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>U2AF2 acetylation affects the interaction of U2AF and SF3B complexes</title><p>Next, we investigate the effect of U2AF2 acetylation at K413 on the formation of the U2AF complex and recruitment of the SF3B complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>). The expression of K413R did not regulate the stability of the SF3B and U2AF components. Next, we performed an immunoprecipitation assay to detect the interaction between the U2AF and SF3B complexes using U2AF2-WT- and U2AF2-K413R-expressing cells. Interestingly, U2AF2 K413R interacted strongly with components of the SF3B complex and with U2AF1 compared to that with U2AF2 WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>). Notably, the interaction of U2AF2 and U2AF1 was not obviously regulated after RNAase treatment, while the interaction of U2AF2 and SF3B complex was reduced following RNase treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>). These findings implied the interactions between U2AF1 and U2AF2 were independent of RNA binding, while the interaction of U2AF2 and SF3B complex were dependent on RNA binding. As a component of the U2AF complex, U2AF2 interacts with U2AF1 to form the U2AF complex, which recognizes the 3′ splice site (3' SS) of U2 introns and recruits U2 snRNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zorio and Blumenthal, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L</xref>).

Accordingly, these phenotypes induced by SIRT4 OE were restricted when an enzyme-defective SIRT4 (SIRT4 H161Y) was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Molecular docking simulations showed that U2AF2 Lys413 was present at the contact surface between SIRT4 and U2AF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), further demonstrating that SIRT4 can interact with U2AF2 to promote its deacetylation.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>U2AF2 deacetylation under TGF-β1 is SIRT4 dependent.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) WT TECs were transfected with Flag-<italic>U2af2</italic> WT, Ad-<italic>Sirt4</italic> or Ad-sh<italic>Sirt4</italic> under Ac-CoA treatment.

Hence, we hypothesized that the SIRT4-mediated deacetylation of U2AF2 participates in the regulation of these processes. RNA-sequencing was performed to identify the changes in gene expression and alternative splicing in adenovirus-mediated SIRT4<sup>OE</sup>-transfected cells or adenovirus-Ctrl-transfected cells after TGF-β1 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Surprisingly, SIRT4 stimulation upregulated several genes (p&lt;0.01; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>) that are involved in mRNA processing and the TGF-β signaling pathway. A total of 142 differentially expressed genes (p&lt;0.0005) were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Meanwhile, 248 genes showed differential intron retention (FDR &lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This analysis revealed four genes that were common between the differentially expressed genes and the differentially spliced genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). <italic>Ccn2</italic>, one of these four genes, ranked third among the all upregulated genes (p&lt;0.0005) after SIRT4 overexpression. Given that intron retention due to abnormal splicing can trigger nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, gene expression could be affected by a change in splicing pattern. The mRNA levels of <italic>CCN2</italic> were remarkably increased in SIRT4<sup>OE</sup> cells but reduced in <italic>Sirt4-</italic>knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

This finding prompted us to investigate the role of specific lysine residues within U2AF2 that may be critical for the regulation of CCN2 expression. To this end, we introduced the K453Q mutation as a control to discern the distinct effects of lysine acetylation at different sites. Our results showed that SIRT4 OE significantly elevated the protein levels of CCN2 in U2AF2 WT or U2AF2 K453Q-transfected cells but not in U2AF2-K413Q or K413R-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>), suggesting that only the U2AF2 acetylation at K413 is efficient to regulate CCN2 expression.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Acetylation of U2AF2 at K413 regulates CCN2 gene expression and pre-mRNA splicing.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The crosstalk of differences of the gene expression profiling analysis and splicing analysis.

Thus, we examined whether SIRT4 induced CCN2 expression through transcription co-activator function. An analysis of the promoter region of <italic>Ccn2</italic> (including Sp1 binding site) showed that there was no increase in the promoter activity following overexpression of U2AF2 WT, U2AF2-K413R or U2AF2-K413Q upon TGF-β1 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), implying that the SIRT4-induced CCN2 expression is not transcription dependent. According to the RNA sequencing data, SIRT4 stimulation increased the efficiency of <italic>Ccn2</italic> pre-mRNA exon2/intron2 and exon3/intron3 splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Upon analyzing the gene sequence of <italic>Ccn2</italic>, we found that both <italic>Ccn2</italic> introns 2 and 3 contain a TGA stop codon, implying that they could trigger the degradation of abnormal mRNAs. Furthermore, we confirmed that SIRT4 knockdown or U2AF2 K413Q increased the retention index of <italic>Ccn2</italic> introns 2 and 3, whereas SIRT4 OE or U2AF2 K413 reduced the retention index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G and H</xref>). U2AF2 K413R or K413Q impeded the changes in intron 2 and 3 retention indices of <italic>Ccn2</italic> caused by SIRT4 OE or <italic>Sirt4</italic> knockdown, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G and H</xref>). Next, we assessed whether U2AF2 regulates CCN2 expression by regulating mRNA stability. We treated SIRT4 OE or <italic>Sirt4</italic> knockdown cells with Actinomycin D to block transcription and measured <italic>Ccn2</italic> mRNA stability over time. The mRNA stability of <italic>Ccn2</italic> was significantly enhanced in SIRT4 OE cells, whereas it was reduced in <italic>Sirt4</italic> knockdown cells compared to that in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>).

In addition, K413R and K413Q repressed the changes in the stability of <italic>Ccn2</italic> mRNA caused by SIRT4 OE or <italic>Sirt4</italic> knockdown, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). Next, a RiboIP experiment was performed wherein U2AF2 was immunoprecipitated to determine whether it can bind endogenous <italic>Ccn2</italic> transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>). SIRT4 OE enhanced the interaction between U2AF2 and <italic>Ccn2</italic> pre-mRNA (indicated by the PCR product containing intron 2 and exon 3 or intron 3 and exon 4) in U2AF2 WT-transfected cells but had little effect on their interaction in U2AF2 K413R-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>).

A previous study showed that SIRT4 translocates from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm upon Wnt stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). Hence, we conducted an immunofluorescence assay and organelle separation experiment to compare the localization of SIRT4 before and after TGF-β1 treatment. Interestingly, SIRT4 localization changed from mitochondria to the cytoplasm or even nucleus at after 12 hr of TGF-β1 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–C</xref>). Moreover, TGF-β1 stimulation did not induce U2AF2 release from the nucleus into the cytoplasm, even after 24 hr (data not shown). Other stimulations such as serum starvation, tunicamycin, poly (I: C), and cisplatin also induced this translocation of SIRT4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). It is well known that BAX and BAK are two key molecules of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. They form polymers on the mitochondrial outer membrane and mediate the release of mitochondrial contents such as mtDNA, mitochondrial dsRNA, and cytochrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ma et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McArthur et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, we tested whether the TGF-β1-induced release of SIRT4 is dependent on the BAX/BAK oligomeric pore. Notably, BAX or BAK deficiency or MSN-125 (an effective oligomeric inhibitor of Bax and Bak) treatment almost abolished the release of SIRT4 from mitochondria to the cytoplasm as well as the upregulation of <italic>Ccn2</italic> under TGF-β1 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E and F</xref>). As expected, the in vivo results showed that MSN-125 inhibited the translocation of SIRT4 from mitochondria to the cytoplasm in the kidneys of mice following UUO surgery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>).

MAP kinases bind to their substrates through a docking groove comprising an acidic common docking (CD) domain and glutamic acid-aspartic acid (ED) pockets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lu and Xu, 2006</xref>). Our results showed that mutation of either the ERK2 CD domain (D316/319 N) or the ED pocket (T157/158E) reduced the binding to endogenous SIRT4 compared to that in the WT ERK2 control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). Combined mutations at both the CD domain and ED pocket (T/E-D/N) abrogated the binding of ERK2 to SIRT4 entirely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>), indicating that ERK2 binds SIRT4 through its docking groove. Furthermore, the server provided docking information regarding SIRT4–ERK2, indicating SIRT4 and ERK2 CD domain and ED pocket interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). ERK substrates often have a docking domain characterized by a cluster of basic residues, followed by an LXL motif (L represents Leu, but can also be Ile or Val; X represents any amino acid) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lu and Xu, 2006</xref>). An analysis of the docking information of SIRT4 - ERK2 and the amino acid sequence of SIRT4 revealed the putative ERK-binding sequence 77-EKVGLYARTDRR-88 and 203-GDVFLSE-209, which contain LXL motifs at V79/L81 and V205/L207, respectively. Immunoblotting of the immunoprecipitated Flag-SIRT4 proteins with an anti-ERK1/2 antibody showed that a SIRT4 V205/L207 mutant, but not a SIRT4 V79/L81 mutant, markedly reduced its binding to ERK1/2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>). These results indicate that the ERK2 docking groove binds to a CD domain in SIRT4 at V205/L207. Sequence analysis of SIRT4 revealed that it contains an ERK consensus phosphorylation motif (Ser-Pro) at the S36/P37 residues. Notably, S36A mutation completely abrogated the TGF-β1-dependent phosphorylation of SIRT4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>). Consistently, pretreatment with U0126 blocked the TGF-β1-induced S36 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of SIRT4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>). In addition, expression of constitutively active MEK1 Q56P with WT ERK2, but not of ERK2 K52R, induced SIRT4 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8J</xref>). These results indicate that ERK2 specifically phosphorylates SIRT4.</p><p>Notably, we found that SIRT4 contains a potential nuclear localization signal (NLSs), a single type containing 3–5 basic amino acids with the weak consensus Lys-Arg/Lys-X-Arg/Lys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Miyamoto et al., 1997</xref>), 248-KRVK-251. We mutated the K248/251 and R249 residues in the putative NLS sequences of SIRT4 to alanine (named as mNLS). Cell fractionation and immunofluorescence analyses showed that Flag-SIRT4-mNLS, unlike the WT SIRT4, was unable to translocate into the nucleus upon TGF-β1 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8K and L</xref>). These results indicate that the NLS in SIRT4 is essential for TGF-β1-induced nuclear translocation of SIRT4. Importin α functions as an adaptor and links NLS-containing proteins to importin β, which then docks the ternary complex at the nuclear-pore complex to facilitate the translocation of these proteins across the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cingolani et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Goldfarb et al., 2004</xref>). Six importin α family members (α1, α3, α4, α5, α6, and α7) have been identified in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Goldfarb et al., 2004</xref>). We found that the endogenous SIRT4 only binds importin α1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8M</xref>). Importin a1/Rch1 is barely detectable in the glomeruli of normal SD rat kidneys but is highly expressed in tubular cells, and the importin α1/Rch1 staining is significantly enhanced in the kidneys of diabetic rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Köhler et al., 2001</xref>). Depletion of importin α1 with <italic>Rch1</italic> (coding for importin α1) shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8N</xref>) largely blocked the TGF-β1-induced nuclear translocation of SIRT4 and resulted in the accumulation of phosphorylated SIRT4 in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8N</xref>). In vivo, U0126 restrained the <italic>Sirt4<sup>OE</sup></italic>-induced nuclear translocation of SIRT4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Furthermore, SIRT4 S36A or SIRT4 mNLS overexpression failed to accumulate SIRT4 in the nucleus and aggravated renal fibrosis in S4KO UUO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8O–R</xref>). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that TGF-β1-induced SIRT4 nuclear translocation is mediated by SIRT4 phosphorylation at S36, which is regulated by the ERK1/2 signaling pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2-13"><title>Exosomes containing anti-SIRT4 antibodies alleviate renal fibrosis in UUO mice</title><p>SIRT4 is necessary for maintaining mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haigis et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Csibi et al., 2013</xref>). Since knockout or complete inhibition of SIRT4 may not be an advisable therapeutic strategy, we constructed exosomes containing anti-SIRT4 antibodies (αSRIT4) to treat UUO mice. Exosomes containing αSRIT4 effectively inhibited renal fibrosis in UUO mice, accompanied by a decrease in SIRT4 expression in the nucleus, with little effect on mitochondria SIRT4 content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>).</p><p>Reportedly, the initial stage of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway in which SIRT4 translocates from mitochondria into the cytoplasm leads to β-catenin protein accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). To determine whether the β-catenin accumulation is involved in the SIRT4-mediated kidney fibrosis in vivo, we generated mice expressing SIRT4<sup>OE</sup> TECs and subjected them to UUO surgery with or without MSAB treatment (MSAB binds to β-catenin and promotes its degradation). Our results showed that SIRT4 OE remarkably aggravated renal fibrosis under MSAB treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3A–C</xref>). Moreover, downregulation of β-catenin accumulation by MSAB can inhibit renal fibrosis in WT mice, but not the SIRT4<sup>OE</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3A–C</xref>). These findings suggest that SIRT4-mediated the pathogenesis of renal fibrosis is independent of β-catenin accumulation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Renal fibrosis, especially tubulointerstitial fibrosis, is an inevitable common pathway of progressive chronic kidney disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Humphreys, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Venkatachalam et al., 2015</xref>). However, there is a lack of information regarding the pathogenesis of renal fibrosis, which hampers the development of effective therapeutics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu, 2006</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that the nuclear translocation of SIRT4 is a prime initiator of kidney fibrosis. SIRT4 significantly accumulates in the nucleus during fibrosis following obstructed nephropathy and renal ischemia reperfusion injury. Global knockout or target deletion of <italic>Sirt4</italic> in TECs attenuated UUO-induced kidney fibrosis, whereas TEC-specific SIRT4<sup>OE</sup> aggravated the fibrosis. Mechanistically, we found that TGF-β1 promoted SIRT4 release from mitochondria through the BAX/BAK pore. Furthermore, TGF-β1 activation resulted in the nuclear translocation of SIRT4, which was mediated by the ERK1/2-dependent phosphorylation of SIRT4 at S36, and consequently the binding of SIRT4 to importin α1. Nuclear SIRT4 deacetylates U2AF2 and promotes U2 snRNP formation, which promotes the <italic>Ccn2</italic> pre-mRNA splicing, ultimately leading to the increased CCN2 expression. In vivo, SIRT4 S36 or NLS mutants blocked SIRT4<sup>OE</sup>-aggravated kidney fibrosis in UUO mice, which implied that SIRT4 nuclear translocation plays a significant role in the progression of kidney fibrosis.</p><p>Acetyl-CoA is an important energy-rich metabolite for homeostasis. In normal states, abundant acetyl-CoA in the cytosol shuttles freely in the nucleus or mitochondria to modulate the acetylation of histone or non-histone proteins. A rapid reduction in total acetyl-CoA levels in renal cells is observed after TGF-β1 stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Smith et al., 2019</xref>). Non-enzymatic acetylation levels are strongly reduced by acetyl-CoA. Under such circumstances, few exceptional hyperacetylated proteins can function as key regulators of kidney fibrosis development. In accordance with this hypothesis, we found that U2AF2 acetylation decreased and U2 snRNP formation increased after deacetylation of U2AF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H–K</xref>). Strikingly, U2AF2-K413, the deacetylation form, promotes the pre-mRNA splicing and expression of <italic>Ccn2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>), supporting the idea that acetylation of U2AF2 is responsible for fibrotic reaction under TGF-β1. Additionally, a recent study showed that U2AF2 can directly bind and stabilize circNCAPG, which participates in the nuclear translocation of ras responsive element binding protein 1, thereby activating the TGF-β pathway and promoting glioma progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2023</xref>). Taking this into consideration, we speculate that U2AF2 may be a positive feedback regulator of TGF-β1, although further investigations are required to ascertain this.</p><p>SIRT4 is mainly located in the mitochondria and participates in various mitochondrial metabolic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Csibi et al., 2013</xref>). Some studies have revealed a potential role of SIRT4 in fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Luo et al., 2017</xref>). In heart, loss of SIRT4 has been found to result in the development of fibrosis. These studies indicated the protective role of SIRT4 in mitochondria. In recent research, the authors found that SIRT4 abolishment can ameliorate CCl4-induced hepatic encephalopathy phenotypes, which was mediated by downregulating and detoxifing ammonia through the urea cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hu et al., 2023</xref>). In our study, we indicated that SIRT4 translocates from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm, a process caused by TGF-β induced mitochondrial damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Furthermore, the cytoplasmic SIRT4 was phosphorylated by ERK2, which is a downstream of TGF-β signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–J</xref>). The phosphorylated SIRT4 further translocated to the nuclear for promoting CCN2 expression by regulating the alternative splicing, then accelerated the kidney fibrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Our study introduces a novel concept in the field, demonstrating the nuclear translocation of SIRT4 is a key initiator of kidney fibrosis. This finding diverges from previous studies that have primarily focused on SIRT4’s mitochondrial roles, highlighting a new dimension of SIRT4’s function in renal pathophysiology.</p><p>Some studies have shown that SIRT4 exerts a protective effect on podocytes. SIRT4 OE prevents glucose-induced podocyte apoptosis and ROS production, thereby alleviating diabetic kidney disease (DKD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shi et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, FOXM1 transcriptionally activates SIRT4 and inhibits NF-κB signaling and the expression of the NLRP3 inflammasome to alleviate kidney injury and podocyte pyroptosis in DKD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Xu et al., 2021</xref>). In the present study, we suggest a profibrotic role of SIRT4 in TECs, which was contributed by upregulated expression of CCN2. Although these are complicatedly related to one another in CKD pathophysiology, injury to TECs is considered a core element that initiates progressive fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Friedman et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, we suggested that SRIT4 may perform different roles in different types of cells or subcellular organelles. Moreover, further studies on the role of SIRT4 in DKD are needed to evaluate the safety of anti-SIRT4 therapy.</p><p>Overall, our study reveals that TGF-β1 activation resulted in the nuclear translocation of SIRT4, mediated by the ERK1/2-dependent phosphorylation of SIRT4 at S36, and consequently the binding of SIRT4 to importin α1. In the nucleus, SIRT4-mediated U2AF2 deacetylation at K413, a key protein for the spliceosome, acts as a responder under TGF-β1 stimulation. SIRT4 promotes CCN2 expression through alternative pre-mRNA splicing by deacetylating U2AF2, which contributes to the progression of kidney fibrosis. These findings expand the field of epigenetic regulation of fibrogenic gene expression and provide a potential therapeutic target for kidney fibrosis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Studies in animals</title><p>All animal care and experimental protocols for in vivo studies conformed to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the National Institutes of Health (NIH; NIH publication no.:85–23, revised 1996).

The mechanism is described as this: mitochondrial SIRT4 transport into the cytoplasm in response to TGF-β stimulation, phosphorylated by ERK in the cytoplasm, and pathway and then undergo nuclear translocation by forming the complex with importin α1. In the nucleus, SIRT4 can then deacetylate U2AF2 at K413 to facilitate the splicing of CCN2 pre-mRNA to promote CCN2 protein expression.

We appreciate your recommendation to include an in vitro deacetylation assay employing recombinant SIRT4 and U2AF2 to support our conclusion regarding the deacetylase activity of SIRT4 on U2AF2.</p><p>We would like to clarify that the data demonstrating the effect of SIRT4 on U2AF2 acetylation were already included in our original submission. Specifically, Figure 5C illustrates that the TGF-β1-caused decreased acetylation of U2AF2 is attenuated by Sirt4 knockdown. Conversely, overexpression of SIRT4 (SIRT4 OE) enhances the deacetylation process of U2AF2 in the presence of TGF-β1.

U2AF2-K453Q is another site mutation to mimic a hyperacetylated state of U2AF2, our results indicated that U2AF2 acetylation at K413 had little effects on CNN expression. Therefore, we found that only the U2AF2 acetylation at K413 can regulate CCN2 expression, not acetylation at other sites.

The mechanism is described as this: mitochondrial SIRT4 transport into the cytoplasm in response to TGF-β stimulation, phosphorylated by ERK in the cytoplasm, and pathway and then undergo nuclear translocation by forming the complex with importin α1. In the nucleus, SIRT4 can then deacetylate U2AF2 at K413 to facilitate the splicing of CCN2 pre-mRNA to promote CCN2 protein expression. Moreover, they used exosomes to deliver Sirt4 antibodies to mitigate renal fibrosis in a mouse model. TGF-beta has been widely reported for its role in fibrosis induction.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>TGF-beta induction of SIRT4 translocation from mitochondria to nuclei for epigenetics or gene regulation remains largely unknown. The findings presented here that SIRT4 is involved in U2AF2 deacetylation and CCN2 expression are interesting.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>SIRT4 plays a critical role in mitochondria involved in respiratory chain reaction. This role of SIRT4 is critically involved in many cell functions. It is hard to rule out such a mitochondrial activity of SIRT4 in renal fibrosis. Moreover, the major concern is what kind of message mitochondrial SIRT4 proteins receive from TGF-beta. Although nuclear SIRT4 is increased in response to TNF treatment, it is likely de novo synthesized SIRT4 proteins can also undergo nuclear translocation upon cytokine stimulation. TGF-beta-induced mitochondrial calcium uptake and acetyl-CoA should be evaluated for calcium and acetyl-CoA may contribute to the gene expression regulation in nuclei.</p><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) SIRT4 overall is a mitochondrial enzyme that indeed can undergo shuttling between mitochondria and cytoplasm. Renal fibrosis is a process of complex, SIRT4 deacetylates U2AF4 at K 413.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment highlighting the known mitochondrial localization of SIRT4 and its role in renal fibrosis.</p><p>We concur with the literature that SIRT4 is predominantly a mitochondrial enzyme. However, our study expands upon this understanding by demonstrating a novel shuttling mechanism of SIRT4 between mitochondria and the nucleus in the context of renal fibrosis. Specifically, we observed that under conditions of obstructive nephropathy and renal ischemia reperfusion injury, SIRT4 significantly accumulates in the nucleus, which is a critical event in the fibrotic response.</p><p>Our findings reveal that upon TGF-β stimulation, a known inducer of fibrosis, SIRT4 is released from the mitochondria through the BAX/BAK pore and subsequently translocates to the nucleus. This translocation is mediated by the ERK1/2-dependent phosphorylation of SIRT4 at serine 36, which enhances its interaction with importin α1, a key component in nuclear import processes.</p><p>Once in the nucleus, SIRT4 exerts its effects on the alternative splicing of CCN2 pre-mRNA by deacetylating U2AF2 at lysine 413. This deacetylation event promotes the formation of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U2 snRNP) and facilitates the splicing of CCN2 pre-mRNA, leading to increased expression of the profibrotic protein CCN2.</p><p>Our study, therefore, not only confirms the mitochondrial association of SIRT4 but also uncovers its nuclear function in the regulation of gene expression during renal fibrosis. These findings underscore the complexity of SIRT4's role in cellular processes and its potential as a therapeutic target for fibrotic diseases.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Figure 2 and Figure 3 should be combined.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion to combine Figures 2 and 3 for potential improvement in presentation.</p><p>After careful consideration, we have found that merging these figures is not feasible due to space constraints on a standard A4 page, which is necessary to maintain the clarity and detail of the data presented in both figures.
