patients who have high risk of exposure to these bacteria. However, few such vaccination strategies exist due to a shortage of knowledge supporting their rapid effect. Here, we demonstrated that a single intranasal immunization of inactivated whole cell of <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> elicits rapid protection against broad <italic>A. baumannii</italic>-infected pneumonia via training of innate immune response in <italic>Rag1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. Immunization-trained alveolar macrophages (AMs) showed enhanced TNF-α production upon restimulation. Adoptive transfer of immunization-trained AMs into naive mice mediated rapid protection against infection. Elevated TLR4 expression on vaccination-trained AMs contributed to rapid protection. Moreover, immunization-induced rapid protection was also seen in <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> pneumonia models, but not in <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> model. Our data reveal that a single intranasal immunization induces rapid and efficient protection against certain Gram-negative bacterial pneumonia via training AMs response, which highlights the importance and the possibility of harnessing trained immunity of AMs to design rapid-effecting vaccine.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>multidrug-resistant bacteria</kwd><kwd>vaccine</kwd><kwd>alveolar macrophage</kwd><kwd>Trained immunity</kwd><kwd>Acinetobacter baumannii</kwd><kwd>rapid effect</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Multidrug-resistant bacteria</kwd><kwd>Vaccine</kwd><kwd>Rapid effect</kwd><kwd>Alveolar macrophage</kwd><kwd>Trained immunity</kwd><kwd><italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81971561</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shi</surname><given-names>Yun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Intranasal immunization of inactivated whole cell of some Gram-negative bacteria induces very rapid and efficient protection against bacterial pulmonary by training alveolar macrophage response, which can be harnessed to design rapid-effecting vaccine against multidrug-resistant bacteria infection.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria, including <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus,</italic> pose a great threat to global public health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Tacconelli et al., 2018</xref>). Pneumonia caused by MDR bacteria is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, especially in hospitalized patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gonzalez-Villoria and Valverde-Garduno, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Micek et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Zilberberg et al., 2016</xref>). The continuing spread of antimicrobial resistance has made treating MDR bacterial pneumonia extremely difficult. Vaccination has been proposed as a promising strategy for controlling MDR bacterial infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Jansen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rappuoli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Williams, 2007</xref>). Current vaccination strategies usually require multiple injections weeks or months apart, which limit them to rapidly prevent infections for inpatients. However, hospitalized patients have an especially high risk for exposure to MDR bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Pachón and McConnell, 2014</xref>). Therefore, rapid efficacy induced by vaccination is vital for vaccine development against MDR bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Pachón and McConnell, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Induction of immunological memory is the central goal of vaccination. Immunological memory protects against infections by enabling a quicker and stronger immune response to a previously encountered antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Farber et al., 2016</xref>). Classically, immune memory is thought to be exclusively mediated by adaptive T and B cell responses. These responses are highly specific to antigen, but take days or weeks to become effective. Another part of the immune system, innate immune response, provides an initial, relatively nonspecific response to infection within hours to days without immunological memory. However, in the past decade, evidence has emerged showing that innate immune cells such as monocytes, macrophage, and NK cells can also build long-term memory through epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming of cells. This memory termed ‘trained immunity’ or ‘trained innate immunity’’ produces hyperresponsiveness upon restimulation in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Netea et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Netea and Joosten, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Netea et al., 2011</xref>). The rapidity of innate immune response leads us to speculate that trained innate immunity might effectively serve as the underlying mechanism for vaccination-induced rapid protection.</p><p>Here, we demonstrated that a single intranasal immunization of inactivated whole cell (IWC) induced rapid, efficient, and broad protection against certain Gram-negative bacterial pneumonia, which was dependent on trained innate immunity mediated by alveolar macrophages (AMs). These findings highlight the possibility to harness the trained immunity of AMs to design a vaccine with rapid efficacy against pulmonary infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Rapid protection against <italic>A. baumannii</italic> pneumonia by a single intranasal vaccination</title><p>To evaluate whether vaccination can elicit rapid protection, mice were immunized intranasally (i.n.) with an IWC of <italic>A. baumannii</italic> strain LAC-4 and infected intratracheally (i.t.) with a lethal dose of LAC-4 2 days or 7 days later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

To assess whether the IWC-induced rapid protection is a result of immunological memory or a result of the persistent activation of innate immune responses, we measured the dynamic immune response after immunization of IWC from day 0 to day 7. In response to intranasal immunization of IWC, levels of TNF-α and IL-6 in lungs increased from day 1 to day 4 and completely declined to baseline by day 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), indicating that the host response rapidly primed and rest 5 days later. Then we challenged the mice with <italic>A. baumannii</italic> on day 7 after vaccination and assessed the cytokine levels in lungs early at 2 hpi. We found that TNF-α but not IL-6 and IL-1β levels was significantly higher in lungs from IWC-immunized mice than those from control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), suggesting that IWC-induced rapid TNF-α production might be responsible for the rapid protection.

Currently, only some vector-based virus vaccines are reported to be able to elicit rapid protection by a single dose, such as Ebola and Zika virus vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Marzi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Pardi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wong, 2019</xref>). Here, we showed that a single intranasal immunization of IWC of <italic>A. baumannii</italic> elicits a very rapid and complete protection against <italic>A. baumannii</italic> infection 2 or 7 days after vaccination, supported by 100% survival, reduced bacterial burdens, alleviated lung injury, and reduced inflammatory cytokines expression after challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In addition, the IWC vaccination-induced rapid protection is broad against different clinical strains including different antibiotic-sensitive or -resistant strains.</p><p>The development of immunological memory by vaccination is a central goal in fighting against infections. <italic>A. baumannii</italic> IWC-induced fast protection leads us to suspect whether it is a result of sustained and activated immune response elicited by vaccination. Dynamic response to intranasal immunization of IWC of <italic>A. baumannii</italic> shows that host response rapidly undergoes the priming, resting, and results in memory stage 5 days later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4F</xref>). The innate immune response 2 days post vaccination might be an activated innate immune response reflected by increase IL-6 and TNF-α response to vaccination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), which provides the host resistance to <italic>A. baumannii</italic> infection. The host response to vaccination completely recovered to baseline level at day 5 post vaccination. However, IWC still induces protection against <italic>A. baumannii</italic> infection at day 7 after immunization, which represents a recall response to vaccination. Upon reexposure to <italic>A. baumannii</italic> 7 days after vaccination, IWC-vaccinated mice recalls a rapid, heightened TNF-α secretion and chemokine production at 2 hr post challenge and subsequently increased neutrophils infiltration earlier at 4 hr post challenge in lungs of vaccinated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>). It is well known that neutrophil, macrophage, and monocytes play essential roles in host defense against <italic>A. baumannii</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Qiu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">van Faassen et al., 2007</xref>). So, vaccination-induced rapid recall responses to infection lead to a rapid elimination of bacteria, thereby limit the uncontrolled inflammation at 24 hpi in vaccinated mice, eventually prevent lung damage and efficiently improve the survival of mice.</p><p>For mechanisms study, we highlight the role of trained innate immunity in vaccination-induced rapid protection. Traditionally, immune memory is thought to be an exclusive feature of adaptive immune response of T cells and B cells, which is harnessed to design the vaccine extensively, whereas the role of innate immune response to vaccination is recognized as modulation of adaptive immunity. Recently, trained immunity has been proposed to describe the enhanced immune response of innate cells to second stimuli via epigenetic, metabolic, and functional reprogramming by initial stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Mulder et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Netea et al., 2016</xref>). Our study in <italic>Rag1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (which lack mature T and B cells) further showed innate immune responses can be trained by vaccination to mediate rapid protection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). A hallmark characteristic of trained immunity is that trained immunity is nonspecific and thus theoretically effective against all types of pathogens. Our data showed that intranasal immunization with IWC of <italic>A. baumannii</italic> can confer broad cross-protection against other bacteria except <italic>A. baumannii</italic> although at a relative lower protective rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The rapidity of innate response with the trained feature enables it as a good target to design the vaccine to induce rapid protective response against MDR bacteria.</p><p>AMs are the predominant cells in the airway mucosa and play important roles for infection controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hussell and Bell, 2014</xref>). The embryonic origin and the ability of self-renewal in steady state of AMs make them be able to store immune memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hussell and Bell, 2014</xref>). In this study, we found that AMs could be trained by IWC of <italic>A. baumannii</italic> with functional reprogramming, showing increased TNF-α production upon restimulation with the same IWC. More importantly, adoptive transfer of <italic>A. baumannii</italic> IWC-trained AMs into naive recipient mice enhanced the bacteria clearance after lethal challenge with <italic>A. baumannii</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), confirming that IWC-trained AMs mediate rapid protection. Currently, there are limited reports about trained immunity of AMs. It has been reported that AMs could be trained to gain the memory phenotype in an adenovirus-infected models, which is dependent on IFN-γ production from effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Yao et al., 2018</xref>). This data, together with our findings, supports the trained immunity of AMs. However, the training of AMs with IWC of bacteria has distinct feature from virus-trained AMs. Training of AMs with IWC of bacteria in this study is independent on adaptive T cells since AMs could be trained by IWC directly in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) and vaccination-induced protection is still efficient in <italic>Rag1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The trained feature of AMs can be manipulated to combat MDR bacterial pneumonia and also the respiratory virus infection.</p><p>As for how AMs are trained, a range of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2), and dectin-1 might be engaged to promote trained immunity. Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) and its main component muramyl dipeptide induce trained immunity through NOD2-ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kleinnijenhuis et al., 2012</xref>) and β-glucan through dectin-1 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Quintin et al., 2012</xref>). Some studies have implicated that TLRs are upregulated to BCG or β-glucan training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kleinnijenhuis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Quintin et al., 2012</xref>); however, how TLRs are involved in trained immunity is not clear. In this study, we demonstrate that TLR4 is elevated on IWC-trained AMs. Enhanced TNF-α production of vaccine-primed AMs upon restimulation is impaired in <italic>Tlr4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, which results in reduced protective effect of vaccination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). These data suggest that elevated TLR4 expression on AMs might be a trained marker, which can sense the pathogen-associated molecular pattern more efficiently and results in rapid activation of trained AMs compared to naïve AMs. TNF-α is critical for an effective antibacterial host defense against bacterial infection by regulating downstream cytokine response and activating immune cells. TNF-α is one of the main cytokines that has been thoroughly used as a functional cytokine marker indicating trained immunity along with IL-6 and IL-1β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arts et al., 2018</xref>). In this study, we found that vaccination-trained immune response produces heightened TNF-α, but not IL-6 and IL-1β, when encountered with the infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In addition, blocking TNF-α with specific antibody before challenge significantly reduces vaccine-induced rapid protection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). These data collectively indicate that enhanced production of TNF-α from AMs is a functional indicator of trained AMs and is responsible for vaccine-elicited rapid protection.</p><p>What’s more important in this study, we found that the vaccination-induced rapid protection is also observed in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>-infected pneumonia models but not in <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>-infected pneumonia models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Since limited data of how AMs were trained are reported, we do not know why some Gram-positive bacteria cannot train AMs to exert rapid protection. We guess that the different cell wall component in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria may account for the different vaccination effect of different bacteria. In addition, it might involve the different host response to different infection. Some cytokines like human IL-37 have been reported as an inhibitor of trained immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cavalli et al., 2021</xref>). Further studies are needed to explore the different host response to different vaccination.</p><p>The limitation of this study is that we could not test the vaccination-induced rapid protection in more MDR bacterial pneumonia models due to the lack of more bacterial pneumonia models in our hands. Also, our study also leaves open many questions, such as how AMs are trained by vaccination, what ligand-receptor pairs are responsible for training AM, and what molecular mechanism is involved. Further investigation is needed to better understand the trained immunity of AMs, which in turn will pave the way for improved vaccine design.</p><p>In summary, in this study we demonstrate that intranasal immunization of IWC of certain bacteria induces a rapid, sufficient, and broad protection against lethal respiratory infection through inducing trained immunity of AMs. Our study highlights the importance and the possibility of harnessing trained immunity of AMs to design rapid-effecting vaccine against MDR bacterial pneumonia for inpatients. Even for long-lasting effect of vaccine, exploiting the classical adaptive memory and trained innate immunity in an integrated fashion seems plausible for a potential good design of vaccination strategies against bacterial infection.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental design and ethical approval</title><p>This study was designed to determine whether intranasal immunization of IWC could elicit rapid protection against bacterial pneumonia and explore the underlying mechanisms.

revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>The development and spread of resistance against most antibiotics makes the management of bacterial infections a challenging issue. Here, Gu et al. describe the use of intranasal immunization of IWC of <italic>A. baumannii</italic>, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>K. pnemoniae</italic> against infection by <italic>A. baumannii</italic>, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>K. pnemoniae</italic>, respectively. These findings build on our understanding of immunity to bacterial pathogens and may be used to contribute to future vaccine strategies.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Vaccination-induced rapid protection against bacterial pneumonia via training alveolar macrophage in mice&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. More clarity is required to determine how numbers of animals were chosen and whether the studies are powered to determine significant differences. Repeats of experiments should be performed and noted to allow for evaluation of reproducibility.</p><p>2. Additional experiments involving cross-protection (non-specific protection) are required to evaluate the role for trained innate immunity. As part of this, the authors should discuss why immunization with IWC of <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> did not induce effective protection against <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>.</p><p>3. It has been reported that memory alveolar macrophages required T cell help for trained immunity, the authors should expand on the mechanism in their work that makes it distinct from these previous findings.</p><p>Although the article is well presented, there are a number of pieces of information that are required to support the authors' interpretations and conclusions. Specifically:</p><p>1. The authors should compare the transcriptional profiles/inflammatory responses and histopathology of vaccinated wt and Rag1<sup>-/-</sup> mice.</p><p>2. Figure 4E. The authors should determine the survival of mice with or without i.t. AM transfer and challenged by <italic>A. baumannii</italic>.</p><p>3. The authors need to discuss why immunization with IWC of <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> did not induce effective protection against <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>.

In this study, we did IWC immunization in <italic>Rag1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice to find out whether adaptive immune response or innate immune response is responsible for the rapid protection against <italic>A. baumannii</italic> infection. The results showed that IWC also induced good protection in <italic>Rag1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, indicating that adaptive immune response is not required for the rapid protection. So in the further study, we explored the transcriptional profile of host response to immunization and infection in <italic>Rag1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice with RNAseq to exclude the effect of adaptive immune response. We did not do the same transcriptional profile in WT mice, since we think that comparing the difference of transcriptional profile of vaccinated WT and <italic>Rag1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice is to find out the effect of adaptive immune response, which is not the purpose of this study. The RNAseq results from <italic>Rag1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice showed genes associated with inflammatory response (including <italic>Il6</italic>, <italic>Cxcl1</italic>, <italic>Cxcl2</italic>,<italic>Cxcl10</italic>, <italic>Ccl2</italic>) were significantly downregulated in vaccinated mice at 24 hour post infection (Figure 4D and E), which is consistent with what we observed in WT mice detected by real-time PCR (Figure 1), indicating that the vaccination induced similar protection in WT and <italic>Rag1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

We also care about the broad protection of IWC immunization. We have the data about protection of immunization of IWC of <italic>A. baumannii</italic> strain of LAC-4 to some clinical isolates. Due to the less virulence of clinical isolates, we also immunized mice with IWC of different <italic>A. baumanni</italic> clinical isolates and test their protection to LAC-4 infection. Clinical isolate SJZ24 is an extremely antibiotic resistant clinical isolate (Zeng et al., 2019), LAC-4 is a multidrug resistant stain, and ATCC17978 is a reference strain which is an antibiotic sensitive strain (Harris et al., 2013). Together, these data suggested that intranasal immunization of IWC of <italic>A. baumannii</italic> can elicit broad protection against different clinical isolates independent of drug resistance. We added these data into the revised manuscript as Figure 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The authors should provide the rationale for challenging the vaccinated animal on day 1 and 7</p></disp-quote><p>In this study, we focused the rapid effect of vaccination against bacterial infection. At the beginning of this project, we just try to reduce the immunization does from 3 doses to 2 does or 1 dose to evaluate the effect of vaccination. We found that intranasal immunization of neither 3 doses, 2 doses, or 1 dose all elicit 100% protection against <italic>A. baumannii</italic> infection evaluated 7 days after last immunization. So we focused on the single immunization, then we tried to shorten the days of evaluation to detect how fast the vaccination can exert protective effect. Further we evaluated the effect on day 2, day 1 after immunization of IWC and also found the protective effect against <italic>A. baumannii</italic> challenge. We added these rationales in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

IL-6, TNF-α, and IL1-β are analyzed, the authors should explain how they concluded that TNF-α was specifically responsible for protection?</p></disp-quote><p>In SFigure 1. we measured the inflammatory cytokine of IL-6, TNF-α, and IL1-β in IWC-immunized or control mice at 24 hr post infection, and found that IL-6 in lungs and blood were both significant reduced in IWC-immunized group compared to control group. Whereas TNF-α in blood showed significant reduction, but there is no big difference in lungs. These data suggest IWC immunization can reduce bacterial infection-induced inflammatory response consistent with reduced bacterial burdens and alleviated lung injury. As here IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β were used as the indicators of inflammatory cytokine to reflect inflammation induced by bacterial infection. As for the cytokines responsible for protection, we reasoned that vaccination-induced earlier and stronger response to infection can combat the bacteria at early stage of infection. So we detected the early stage of cytokine response (2 hr post infection) and found that IWC-immunized mice has enhanced TNF-α, but not IL-6 and IL-1β release in response to infection (Figure 3B). In addition, we isolated alveolar macrophages from IWC-immunized mice and stimulated ex vivo with IWC and found elevated TNF response, but not IL-6 and IL-1β response (Figure 5). Further blocking TNF-α effect in IWC-immunized mice reduced IWC-induced protection. All these data lead us to make a conclusion that IWC-immunization induced rapid TNFα response is responsible for the rapid protection against infection. We have added some discussion of these in revised manuscript in results and Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10.

It has been reported that IL-37 is an inhibitor of trained immunity, IL-37 could be measured in the Gram positive experiments to investigate why protection does not occur.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the suggestion. This is another good question to illustrate the mechanisms of why there is a big difference of trained immunity induced by Gram-positive versus Gram-negative bacteria. There might be many underlining mechanisms such as different components of cell wall in Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. Also, it might involve the different host response to infection, such as different anti-inflammatory cytokine responses like IL-37. We have did reference research that there is no homolog gene for human IL-37 in the mouse and it was thus not possible to directly measure IL-37 response in our mouse model to Gram positive bacterial infection (Cavalli et al., 2021; Nold et al., 2010; Cavalli, &amp; Dinarello, 2018).This is constructive suggestion for ongoing study to detect whether the different cytokine response to different bacteria might be responsible for the different protective effects. We make a little bit discussion of this question in Discussion section and will test the role of IL-37 on IWC-induced protection using supplement with human IL-37 or human IL-37 transgenic mice in future.</p><p>References</p><p>1.
