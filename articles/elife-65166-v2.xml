Plant growth is a coupled process involving deposition of extracellular matrix material – the cell wall – around individual cells and cell expansion. Precise regulation of the composition of this matrix ensures where a particular cell can expand. To control cell shape throughout a tissue, polarity cues at the cellular and tissue level ensure coordination ultimately patterning whole organs, such as correctly oriented roots and stems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blilou et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kania et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">van Dop et al., 2020</xref>), as well as specialized structures including stomata and root hairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gilroy and Jones, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Houbaert et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mansfield et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). Positioning the cell division plane contributes to cell shape and provides polarity information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhang and Dong, 2018</xref>). For example, in root and shoot tissue in seed plants, the cell division plane is perpendicular to the growth axis and creates polygonal cells that are aligned longitudinally with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ambrose et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Galjart, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schaefer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Smith et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Walker et al., 2007</xref>), ensuring that expansion is aligned uniformly with the overall plant growth axis. For specialized cell types, polarized cell wall deposition and cell plate positioning cooperate to determine cell morphology. In the leaf epidermis, asymmetric cell divisions define the stomatal guard cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dong et al., 2009</xref>), and restricted expansion in cells defines the jigsaw-shaped epidermal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sapala et al., 2019</xref>). In filamentous cells such as pollen tubes and root hairs in seed plants, polarized secretion of flexible wall material to the cell apex leads to cell expansion occurring only at the apex of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bascom et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dehors et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Orr et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Using forward genetics, many studies have identified mutations that alter plant morphogenesis and have provided insights into the regulation of expansion and polarity, demonstrating that plants regulate cell wall deposition in a myriad of ways. The <italic>sabre</italic> mutant, which has short fat roots, was first identified in Arabidopsis in the early 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benfey et al., 1993</xref>). The increased root diameter resulted from exaggerated radial expansion primarily in root cortex cells, suggesting that SABRE plays a role in regulating expansion of diffusely growing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aeschbacher et al., 1995</xref>). A second copy of <italic>SABRE</italic>, named <italic>KINKY POLLEN</italic> (<italic>KIP</italic>), which is expressed most strongly in roots, pollen, and developing seeds, was identified in a screen for abnormal pollen tube and root hair morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Procissi et al., 2003</xref>). Plants lacking KIP form defective pollen tubes that exhibit periods of relatively normal growth interspersed with periods of slow or arrested growth. Recovery from these growth arrests often led to growth initiating in new directions, ultimately leading to the kinky or twisty phenotype. In addition, root hairs were shorter and thicker in <italic>kip</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Procissi et al., 2003</xref>). These data suggested that SABRE contributes to diffuse growth while KIP contributes to polarized growth. However, the homozygous <italic>kip/sab</italic> double mutant exhibited enhanced phenotypes in both diffuse and polarized growing tissues, indicating overlapping function of these two closely related genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Procissi et al., 2003</xref>). More recent studies have found that in <italic>sabre</italic> mutants cell plate positioning in the root meristem was variable, resulting in cells that were not cylindrically aligned. Furthermore, root hair emergence was no longer restricted to the basal portion of the trichoblast cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pietra et al., 2013</xref>). In the <italic>sabre</italic> mutant, transcription factors that initiate root hair cell fate were also altered, resulting in the formation of root hairs from ectopic sites. Collectively these studies have pointed to a critical role for <italic>SABRE</italic> in regulating plant polarity at both cell and tissue levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pietra et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Zea mays</italic>, <italic>ABERRANT POLLEN TRANSMISSION 1</italic> (<italic>APT1</italic>) gene was identified as the <italic>SABRE/KIP</italic> homolog, whose mutation also resulted in short and meandering pollen tubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Xu and Dooner, 2006</xref>). Consistent with predictions of a Golgi localization sequence at the C-terminus of SABRE homologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pietra et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Xu and Dooner, 2006</xref>), expressing C-terminal fragments of APT1 fused with fluorescent proteins in tobacco pollen tubes resulted in localization to the Golgi. However, full-length SABRE stably expressed in Arabidopsis exhibited punctate localization in the cytosol of root epidermal cells that did not obviously represent any known endomembrane compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pietra et al., 2013</xref>). More detailed localization studies are needed to help reconcile these apparently contradictory findings.</p><p>Among plants, the moss <italic>Physcomitrium</italic> (formerly <italic>Physcomitrella</italic>) <italic>patens</italic> is an excellent cell biological model system and ideal for studying how cell shape affects developmental patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rensing et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rounds and Bezanilla, 2013</xref>). Moss juvenile tissue, protonemata, is haploid and comprises a filamentous two-dimensional branching network that is a single-cell layer thick, making it readily amenable to high-resolution microscopy. Coupled with recent advances in CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing allowing for rapid generation of null alleles and functional fluorescent fusion alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Collonnier et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lopez-Obando et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mallett et al., 2019</xref>), <italic>P. patens</italic> provides an opportunity to perform a detailed analysis of SABRE localization and function. Furthermore, in contrast to seed plants, <italic>P. patens</italic> has a single copy of <italic>SABRE</italic> and plants can be propagated asexually, avoiding potential problems resulting from defects in sexual reproduction.</p><p>Here, we generated a null <italic>sabre</italic> mutant and functional fluorescent fusions at the native genomic locus to investigate <italic>SABRE</italic> localization and function in <italic>P. patens</italic>. We found that <italic>∆sabre</italic> plants are stunted, exhibiting defects in polarized growth, diffuse cell expansion, and dramatic cell division failures accompanied by deposition of brown material into the cytoplasm often resulting in cell death. Surprisingly, even with the polarized growth and division defects, SABRE did not localize to the cytoskeleton. Instead, SABRE localized to a fraction of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) near the tip of the cell, at the cell cortex, and in the phragmoplast during cell division. These results indicate that SABRE regulates plant cell expansion and division via its interaction with the ER, pointing to a fundamentally important role for the ER in plant cell and tissue morphogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Loss of SABRE function inhibits polarized growth and diffuse cell expansion</title><p>The <italic>P. patens</italic> genome has one <italic>SABRE</italic> gene that encodes for a 2736 aa protein. To disrupt <italic>SABRE</italic>, we used CRISPR-Cas9-mediated homology-directed repair (HDR) to insert a 363 bp cassette with stop codons in all three possible frames into exon 2 of the <italic>SABRE</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The mutant allele results in a frame shift starting at amino acid 38 followed by a premature stop codon after amino acid 47. For consistency, all <italic>∆sabre</italic> lines generated in this study contained the same mutation. To ensure that the mRNA expressed from the genome-edited allele was altered as predicted, we amplified the 5′ end of the <italic>SABRE</italic> cDNA isolated from wild type and ∆<italic>sab</italic> plants. We found that the cDNA from <italic>∆sabre</italic> was larger due to insertion of the stop codon cassette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Sequencing revealed that the transcript contained the expected in-frame stop codon.</p><p><italic>P. patens</italic> protonemal tissue expands exclusively by polarized growth with cell division occurring in the apical cell of the filament. Subapical cells re-enter the cell cycle once a protrusion emerges generating a new filament, with the branching cell dividing at the base of the emerging protrusion. Compared to wild type, <italic>∆sabre</italic> plants had smaller and more compact protonemata (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To quantify this difference, we regenerated plants from single protoplasts and measured the overall size 7 days after protoplasting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Compared to protonemata in control plants, we found that <italic>∆sabre</italic> protonemata were 60% smaller (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). As protonemata age, some of the protrusions switch fates to bud-like structures that expand in three dimensions, ultimately resulting in the development of leafy shoots, known as gametophores, the adult tissues. While protonemal filaments increase in size exclusively by polarized expansion at the tip of the apical cell, gametophores expand by diffuse growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We also observed that <italic>∆sabre</italic> gametophores are 36% shorter than wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, E</xref>). The phyllids, leaf-like structures that emanate from the gametophore, were 22% smaller than wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Rhizoids are polarized-growing filaments that grow from the base of the gametophore anchoring it in the soil. <italic>∆sabre</italic> rhizoids were 70% shorter than wild type rhizoids, a decrease in size comparable to the polarized-growing protonemata (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Time-lapse imaging demonstrated that while early developmental patterning of <italic>∆sabre</italic> gametophores was not altered, cell expansion was significantly delayed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Together, these data demonstrate that the single <italic>SABRE</italic> gene regulates both polarized and diffuse growth in <italic>P. patens</italic>.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>SABRE</italic> influences both polarized cell expansion and diffuse growth.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Example images of 2-week-old wild type and <italic>∆sabre</italic> plants regenerated from single protoplasts.

During protonemal development, the apical stem cell divides, leaving behind a subapical cell that does not elongate anymore. Thus, we measured the length of protonemal subapical cells. While <italic>∆sabre</italic> cells were 30% shorter than wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), the decrease of overall plant size was 60% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This discrepancy could be due to defects in the rate of growth or how often a particular filament is actively growing. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we measured cell expansion rates in actively growing apical cells as determined by time-lapse imaging. While on average actively growing <italic>∆sabre</italic> cells grew only 20% slower than control cells, the reduction in growth was not statistically significant. In contrast, time-lapse imaging revealed that over the same time period <italic>∆sabre</italic> protonemal filaments often grew significantly less than a comparable wild type filament due to the fact that for a large portion of the time-lapse acquisition the <italic>∆sabre</italic> cell was not growing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>).

Both actin and microtubules contribute to maintaining the direction of polarized growth. Cytoplasmic microtubules polymerize towards the cell tip where their plus ends then focus onto an apically localized actin spot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hiwatashi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). When actin filaments are disrupted, microtubules no longer focus below the tip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wu and Bezanilla, 2018</xref>) and growth is inhibited. When microtubules are disrupted, the actin spot randomly appears and disappears throughout the cell, with expansion occurring in areas that accumulate actin, ultimately resulting in a loss of directional growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wu and Bezanilla, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yamada and Goshima, 2018</xref>). Since defects in growth directionality in <italic>∆sabre</italic> cells resembled wild type cells lacking microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Doonan et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wu and Bezanilla, 2018</xref>), we wondered if SABRE influenced the apical microtubule focus. We found that similar to wild type, the actin and microtubule foci in <italic>∆sabre</italic> cells were persistently present at the tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Thus, the observed defects in growth directionality and rate appear to be independent of actin and microtubules. Actin and microtubules also form dynamic networks at the cell cortex in protonemal cells. Using variable angle epifluorescence microscopy (VAEM), we imaged microtubules and actin in wild type and <italic>∆sabre</italic> plants and quantitatively compared the global dynamics of these networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>). We measured the correlation coefficient of the intensity of the GFP-tubulin and Lifeact-GFP (labeling the actin cytoskeleton) signal at all pixel locations for all temporal intervals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>). As the microtubule and actin filaments change their position due to polymerization, depolymerization, and translocation, the correlation coefficient decreases with larger temporal increments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vidali et al., 2010</xref>). A fast decay in the correlation coefficient is indicative of very rapid changes in global filament dynamics. Using this analysis, we did not observe obvious changes in microtubule organization or dynamics at the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). However, cortical actin exhibited a slight increase in dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>Diffuse growing tissues in the <italic>P. patens ∆sabre</italic> mutants were stunted similar to what was observed in the Arabidopsis <italic>sabre</italic> mutant. Time-lapse imaging of expanding phyllids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>) revealed that due to defective cell expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, yellow and orange lines), <italic>∆sabre</italic> grew significantly less within the same time window compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, magenta and blue lines and dashes). In mature phyllids, the final cell size was also smaller in <italic>∆sabre</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, brown lines). We quantified cell size in fully expanded phyllids and discovered that cell area at the base and tip of phyllids was reduced in <italic>∆sabre</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–F</xref>), consistent with the overall stunted gametophore stature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>).

In protonemata, the phragmoplast forms between the two daughter nuclei, expanding perpendicular to the axis of the filament and eventually fusing with the plasma membrane. Phragmoplast microtubules are a dense bipolar array of microtubules that direct late secretory vesicles to the midzone where they fuse to form a membrane-encapsulated cell plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Smertenko et al., 2018</xref>). During the early stage known as the disc phragmoplast, interdigitated microtubules with their plus ends at the cell equator are arranged in a spindle-like structure to establish the phragmoplast. As the cell plate grows, the microtubules label the outer edge of the expanding cell plate, known as the ring phragmoplast. Eventually the developing cell plate reaches the existing side wall and fuses with it, at which point the microtubule array dissipates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boruc and Van Damme, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Smertenko, 2018</xref>). In <italic>∆sabre</italic> protonemata, we discovered that while mitosis is unaltered (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, 0–12 min), phragmoplast microtubules were present for significantly longer than in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>).

However, for all <italic>∆sabre</italic> cells (N = 10), microtubules were still present for at least 50 min after disc phragmoplast establishment.

We used numerous dyes for cell wall components to attempt to stain the brown material to get a hint of its composition, but none of these dyes stained.

Cell death suggests that defects in cell plate formation resulted in loss of cell integrity. Interestingly, brown material appeared more frequently in cells with a large diameter, characteristic of the first few cells in plants regenerated from protoplasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B, C</xref>). Cells with a large diameter have inherently more degrees of freedom for orienting the phragmoplast. Furthermore, phragmoplast expansion and insertion occurs over a longer distance in these cells. We also noticed that <italic>∆sabre</italic> protoplasts regenerated inefficiently compared to wild type, likely because many protoplasts died during the first cell division, with brown material deposited at the cell division site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, yellow arrow).

We demonstrated that tagging SABRE at its C terminus with either three tandem mEGFPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vidali et al., 2009</xref>)﻿ or mNeonGreens did not influence its function as we observed no growth defects in plants carrying only the tagged SABRE allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). We focused on imaging the mNeonGreen fusion protein (hereafter, SAB-3mNG) because it was brighter than the GFP fusion. Confocal microscopy revealed that SAB-3mNG formed small puncta at the cell cortex, whose density was highest near the tip of the apical cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Even with mNeonGreen, the SAB-3mNG signal was weak and acquiring Z-stacks was challenging.

Pearson’s correlation coefficients were highest between ER and SABRE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3D</xref>). Since the Pearson’s correlation coefficient measures the correlation between signal intensities, these measurements were sensitive to overexpression and all correlation coefficients uniformly increased when SABRE was overexpressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3E</xref>). To quantify co-localization independent of signal intensity, we measured the SABRE fraction that did not overlap with the ER, actin, or microtubules in the first 50 frames of a time-lapse acquisition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3C</xref>). We derived the overlapping SABRE fraction by subtracting the non-overlapping fraction from 1. Using this method, we found that on average 57% of SABRE puncta area overlapped with cortical ER tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). To determine if this overlap fraction occurs by chance, we measured the overlap using a flipped ER image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3C</xref>). The average overlap fraction plummeted to 29% when the ER image was flipped. Notably, 23% was the overlap measured with actin and was independent of whether the actin image was flipped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), suggesting that overlap with actin is coincidental. There was even less overlap with microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), which increased to the same level as the overlap with actin when the microtubule image was flipped. Overexpression of SABRE increases the number of SABRE puncta at the cortex. However, importantly overexpression did not significantly affect the ER overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). With a higher density, the overlap with actin and microtubules increased to 25–30% and was the same even with flipped actin and microtubule images, suggesting that this degree of overlap occurs by chance.</p><p>Since <italic>∆sabre</italic> exhibited serious defects in cell plate maturation and associated with the ER at the cell cortex, we further investigated the timing of SABRE and ER localization during cell division. After mitosis, the disc phragmoplast was labeled with thin strands of ER parallel to the microtubules and very little ER was present in the phragmoplast midzone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>, first time point). In the ring phragmoplast, microtubules were shorter and expanded with the phragmoplast edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), while the ER strands parallel to the microtubules became more defined and the ER accumulated in the midzone perpendicular to the microtubules lining the future cell plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Cell plate maturation occurs during the late phragmoplast stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Smertenko et al., 2017</xref>), coincident with an increase in the ER signal (third and later time points of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, B, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Confocal time-lapse imaging revealed that OE-SAB-3mNG localized to the midzone of the ring phragmoplast weakly, and the signal strengthened as the phragmoplast fully expanded and inserted into the side wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

In control cells, basal migration (phase II) was often subtle or sometimes even appeared to be a stationary phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yamada and Goshima, 2018</xref>). In contrast, <italic>∆sabre</italic> basal (phase II) nuclear movement was extreme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video11">Video 11</xref>). In many cases, the nucleus migrated so far back that it appeared to deform as it smashed up against the new cell plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video11">Video 11</xref>). To quantify the defect in basal movement, we measured the distance between the nucleus and the cell plate when the nucleus was closest to the cell plate (basal position), normalizing the basal position to the apical cell length at that time point. Despite shorter cells in <italic>∆sabre</italic>, the relative basal nuclear position was significantly smaller than in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Beyond the immediate nuclear migration defects after cytokinesis, we also observed less consistent velocity and directionality during interphase in <italic>∆sabre</italic>, represented by the zigzagging trajectory in the kymograph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, yellow arrows, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video11">Video 11</xref>).

We observed the ER signal transition from defined tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, 40 min) in the phragmoplast to a diffuse signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, 50 min), correlating with the onset of division failure. As the brown material accumulated, it was outlined by the ER signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video12">Video 12</xref>). Both Lifeact-GFP and GFP-tubulin signals were relatively normal up until the phragmoplast had expanded to the parental cell membrane. However, at that point Lifeact-GFP became uneven around the phragmoplast with large gaps appearing near the presumptive cell plate. Lifeact-GFP lingered near the cell plate as the brown material generated a gap in the fluorescence gradually ‘invading’ the cytoplasm, which was accompanied by flashes of Lifeact-GFP fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, 50 min and after). In young plants regenerating from protoplasts, phragmoplasts labeled with GFP-tubulin expand across a larger distance, often finishing insertion on one side of the cell and then extending to the other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). In <italic>∆sabre</italic> cells that accumulated brown material, phragmoplast microtubules on the outer edge became disoriented once they reached the parental plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, 160 min). Later, deposition of brown material formed a gap between the remaining phragmoplast microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Sometimes cell plate defects resulted in immediate death. These cells lysed quickly after division and exhibited similar trends to cells that accumulated brown material; phragmoplast expansion was normal until it reached the side wall, at which point the cell lysed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Taken together our data suggest that phragmoplast expansion is normal in <italic>∆sabre</italic>.

In these lines, loss of GFP fluorescence from the nucleus signaled nuclear envelope break down and the onset of prometaphase. In contrast to FM4-64, SNAP-TM-mCherry did not accumulate on the nascent cell plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video11">Video 11</xref>). Instead, SNAP-TM-mCherry appeared at the cell plate 30 min after nuclear envelope break down, the timing of which coincides with the end of phragmoplast expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). At the same time, SNAP-TM-mCherry disappeared from the plasma membrane adjacent to the cell plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>, white arrowheads), suggesting that SNAP-TM-mCherry accumulates at the cell plate by diffusing into the cell plate membrane from the parental plasma membrane once membrane fusion has occurred, rather than by delivery to the cell plate via exocytosis. By measuring the intensity of SNAP-TM-mCherry at the plasma membrane adjacent to the cell plate and in the middle of the cell plate, we quantified the kinetics of SNAP-TM-mCherry as it disappeared from the plasma membrane and appeared in the cell plate. Within 20 min after nuclear envelope break down, SNAP-TM-mCherry fluorescence decreased at the plasma membrane accompanied by an increase in the cell plate SNAP-TM-mCherry fluorescence. Interestingly <italic>∆sabre</italic> cells exhibited the same SNAP-TM-mCherry kinetics as wild type, suggesting that diffusion from the parental plasma membrane was not impaired and thus membrane fusion is unaffected in <italic>∆sabre</italic>.</p><p>To determine why cells that accumulated brown material often lysed, we used aniline blue staining to image accessible callose in cells with brown material. We found that compared to normal cell plates, which exhibited donut-shaped callose enrichments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>), cells with brown material could be grouped into three categories: 27% stained weakly with aniline blue, 20% had a partial aniline blue ring, and 53% had large chunks of aniline blue staining near the brown material (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>; N = 15 cells).

In the intervening time, SABRE has been found to influence cell growth and polarity in plants. Despite the rich phenotypic analyses of mutants in seed plants, understanding the subcellular structures that <italic>SABRE</italic> localizes to and functions through has remained elusive. Here, we used a combination of genetics and live-cell imaging to study <italic>SABRE</italic> in the model bryophyte <italic>P. patens</italic>. Similar to <italic>sabre</italic> phenotypes in roots and shoots in Arabidopsis, <italic>∆sabre</italic> plants in moss were stunted as a result of defects in cell expansion. Both polarized-growing protonemata and diffusely expanding cells in the phyllids of gametophores were smaller in <italic>∆sabre</italic> plants. Similar to defects in pollen tubes from mutants of <italic>KIP</italic>, a second <italic>SABRE</italic> gene in Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Xu and Dooner, 2006</xref>), we observed twisty protonemata that also had periods of normal growth interspersed with pauses. However, unlike pollen tubes or root hairs, moss protonemata also undergo cell division, which was dramatically affected in <italic>∆sabre</italic> plants. In extreme cases, defects during cell division led to failure characterized by loss of cell integrity and subsequent cell death. Interestingly, failures in cell division were readily detected in protonemata, but not in gametophores, suggesting possible tissue-specific SABRE functions during cell division.</p><p>Current models of cell plate formation posit that Golgi- and trans-Golgi-derived vesicles accumulate at the phragmoplast midzone where they fuse to each other to form a tubular network whose lumen accumulates callose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Smertenko et al., 2017</xref>). As the phragmoplast expands, more vesicles are added to the edge and the tubular network enlarges. During expansion, clathrin-mediated endocytosis remodels the membrane transforming the tubular network into a fenestrated sheet, which coincides with the peak of callose accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Samuels et al., 1995</xref>). Ultimately this sheet fuses with the parental cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boruc and Van Damme, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Keijzer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Smertenko, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Smertenko et al., 2017</xref>). Once fusion occurs, the lumen of the cell plate becomes continuous with the apoplast, the extracellular environment of the plant, and the cell plate matures into a primary wall accompanied by changes in carbohydrate composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Drakakaki, 2015</xref>). The exact mechanisms that dictate carbohydrate maturation are unclear, but throughout cell plate formation numerous components of vesicle trafficking and endocytosis have been shown to influence cell plate formation with distinct spatiotemporal contributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chow et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lauber et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rybak et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Smertenko et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Steiner et al., 2016</xref>). Microtubules and actin in the phragmoplast are hypothesized to direct vesicle trafficking as well as influencing cell plate positioning and structural stabilization of the nascent cell plate.</p><p>Our data demonstrate that SABRE plays a role in cell plate maturation influencing the timing of callose deposition. For <italic>∆sabre</italic> cells that accumulated brown material, we observed a range of different callose staining behavior and time-lapse imaging revealed that large callose aggregates were not static, suggesting that cells lacking SABRE exhibit unregulated callose deposition and remodeling. In seed plants, callose begins to accumulate during the ring phragmoplast stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Park et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Samuels et al., 1995</xref>), coincident with the timing of SABRE and ER recruitment along the cell plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). EM studies have shown that the ER accumulates parallel to either side of the developing cell plate once the fenestrated sheet has fully expanded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Seguí-Simarro et al., 2004</xref>). However, whether ER in this region simply repopulates a new cortical ER domain or whether it plays a role in cell plate maturation has been unclear. Here, we provide striking evidence that the ER domains decorated with SABRE at the nascent cell plate play a critical role during cell plate maturation. Without SABRE, the ER still accumulates, but in a fully expanded phragmoplast, the ER parallel to the cell plate invariably buckles in the middle of the cell. In <italic>∆sabre</italic> cells, we observed delayed/unregulated callose deposition. Perhaps to lend structural support to the nascent cell plate lacking uniform callose, both actin and microtubules were retained at the expanded phragmoplast. Taken together our data suggest that the SABRE-decorated ER domains contribute to regulating callose deposition. Whether this regulation is direct or via secretion of callose synthase proteins to the nascent cell plate remains to be determined.</p><p>Beyond cell division, we found that SABRE influences the directionality and persistence of polarized growth and nuclear migration by altering ER function, not the cytoskeleton. Using a combination of confocal microscopy and VAEM, we discovered that SABRE co-localizes to regions of the ER and does not impact cytoskeleton localization or dynamics. In comparison to confocal, the increased signal-to-noise ratio afforded by VAEM revealed that at the cortex SABRE puncta associated with and moved along ER tubules. These results differ from previous work in Arabidopsis that had indicated <italic>SABRE</italic> influences microtubule cortical organization and preprophase band positioning and does not localize to the ER, Golgi, or TGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pietra et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast to Arabidopsis cells, protonemata do not have an organized cortical microtubule array or a microtubule-based preprophase band, suggesting that these differences could result from cell type variability. Furthermore, without the benefit of increased sensitivity enabled by VAEM, it would be very difficult to identify SABRE association with just a fraction of the ER, raising the possibility that SABRE may also associate with the ER subdomains in Arabidopsis.</p><p>We discovered that <italic>∆sabre</italic> cells exhibited exaggerated basally directed nuclear movement during and after cell division. Nuclei in the apical cell also oscillated backwards as they moved apically towards the cell tip in <italic>∆sabre</italic> cells. Microtubule motor proteins that mediate these nuclear movements during cell division have been identified in <italic>P. patens</italic>. Kinesin-14 drives basal movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yamada and Goshima, 2018</xref>), and kinesin-13 drives apical nuclear movement during prophase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Leong et al., 2020</xref>). Mutations in these motor proteins resulted in exaggerated movements in the opposite direction rather than a stationary nucleus, indicating that nuclear movement results from a balance of forces. The exaggerated basal nuclear migration in <italic>∆sabre</italic> could either be the enhancement of basal moving forces or inhibition of the apical moving force, possibly generated by the ER or ER-localized proteins.</p><p>How the ER might influence polarized growth persistence via <italic>SABRE</italic> is an interesting question. The ER accumulates just below the cell tip where both actin and microtubules drive and steer polarized growth, respectively in protonemata. However, in <italic>∆sabre</italic>, both the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons were not affected, suggesting that SABRE’s impact on cell expansion is independent of the cytoskeleton. Of note, a recent study demonstrated that protonemata with impaired COPII function, which mediates ER to Golgi transport, exhibited aggregated ER and polarized growth defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chang et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting that SABRE’s influence on the ER might alter ER secretory function. In contrast to defects in COPII function, which generally reduces secretion, <italic>∆sabre</italic> defects appear to specifically influence a subset of secretory cargo. We discovered that delivery of the plasma membrane protein SNAP-TM-mCherry, which was affected in COPII mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chang et al., 2020</xref>), was unaffected in <italic>∆sabre</italic>. In a surprising connection, a study in <italic>Drosophila</italic> discovered hobbit, a protein that the authors report is conserved broadly across eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Neuman and Bashirullah, 2018</xref>). <italic>SABRE</italic> is the putative plant hobbit homolog albeit with significant sequence divergence. Even with the vast evolutionary distance between flies and plants, hobbit localizes to the ER when overexpressed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and hobbit mutants are stunted similar to <italic>sabre</italic> null mutants in both Arabidopsis and <italic>P. patens</italic>. In <italic>Drosophila,</italic> mutants in hobbit accumulated proteins required for membrane fusion in endosomal compartments and were defective specifically in insulin secretion, manifesting in stunted growth. If hobbit and SABRE function are conserved, then in plants SABRE may regulate a subset of secretory cargos critical for cell expansion and division.</p><p>Alternatively, SABRE might influence the composition of regions of the ER membrane. Altered distribution or activity of ER resident membrane proteins, such as ethylene receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ji and Guo, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yang et al., 2015</xref>), could impact growth and development. Previous studies in Arabidopsis provide a link between ethylene, a gaseous phytohormone involved in a variety of developmental processes and stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Binder, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Binder and Eric Schaller, 2017</xref>), and SABRE since inhibition of ethylene biogenesis partially rescued the <italic>sabre</italic> mutant in Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aeschbacher et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yu et al., 2012</xref>). To distinguish between altered ethylene responses versus secretory defects, comparative RNA-seq and proteomic studies in <italic>∆sabre</italic> versus wild type could provide future research directions to narrow down SABRE’s influence on ER function. Another intriguing possibility is based on SABRE’s impact on callose deposition. Perhaps during cytokinesis SABRE is recruited to the cell plate membrane via ER–plasma membrane contact sites, and there SABRE regulates callose synthase activity ensuring uniform deposition of callose.</p><p>Our results have revealed that the ER does not simply repopulate at the daughter plasma membranes during cell division. Instead, the ER, together with SABRE, is critical for cell plate maturation and is involved in regulating callose deposition. Furthermore, the ER via SABRE ultimately impacts cell expansion and nuclear migration. Future studies will investigate the interactions between SABRE and ER-localized proteins involved in protein trafficking, ethylene sensing, and cell wall synthesis. Results from these studies will importantly unravel whether the ER influence on cell division, cell expansion, and nuclear migration results from defective secretion or altered ER membrane composition and function.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

In brief, two plasmids were generated: a CRISPR plasmid that contains the protospacer(s) and Cas9 ultimately generating the double-stranded break(s) at the designated genomic site(s) and a homology plasmid that provides the template in addition to the sequence being inserted (knockout cassette, fluorescent protein sequence, or promoter) for DNA repair. The two plasmids were co-transformed into moss protoplasts and transformants were regenerated from single protoplasts. All plasmids were constructed using the methods and modular vectors described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mallett et al., 2019</xref>. Primers used to generate these plasmids along with the corresponding plasmid products and primers used for subsequent genotyping are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. Plasmids were transformed into a variety of moss lines stably expressing fluorescently labeled markers. These lines and the corresponding new lines generated in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. Note that for generating SABRE-3mNG tag we initially transformed pMH-SAB-C and pGEM-SAB-3mNG into moss lines expressing Lifeact-mRuby and mCherry-tubulin. To introduce ER labeling, we used CRISPR-mediated HDR to swap Lifeact-mRuby into mCherry-KDEL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). All other fluorescent labeled lines are as described before: GFP-tubulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wu and Bezanilla, 2018</xref>), Lifeact-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">van Gisbergen et al., 2012</xref>), SP-GFP-KDEL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chang et al., 2020</xref>), NLS-GFP-GUS/SNAP-TM-mCherry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van Gisbergen et al., 2018</xref>, p. 10), mCherry-tubulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burkart et al., 2015</xref>), and Lifeact-mRuby (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">van Gisbergen et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>To generate the three tandem mNeonGreen (3mNG) tag, we amplified mNG codon optimized for budding yeast with DC625 and DC626 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) incorporating a BamHI site just upstream of the ATG. This PCR product was introduced into pDONR221-P4rP3r using BP reaction (Invitrogen) generating pENTR-R4R3-mNG. A second mNG codon optimized for <italic>P. patens</italic> was amplified without the stop codon and incorporating BamHI upstream and BglII downstream. This product was ligated into pENTR-mNG in-frame upstream using the BamHI site to create pENTR-R4R3-2XmNG. The third mNG codon optimized for budding yeast was similarly amplified and ligated into pENTR-R4R3-2XmNG. The resulting pENTR R4R3 Cterm BamHI 3xSc_Pp_Sc_mNeon plasmid (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) was used to create the homology plasmid pGEM-SAB-3mNG according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mallett et al., 2019</xref>. Similarly, to knock-in the stronger constitutive maize ubiquitin promoter, pENTR-R4R3-Ubiquitin-pro was generated by inserting the ubiquitin promoter into pDONR221P4rP3r with BP reaction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), and the resulting entry clone was used to make the homology plasmid for moss transformation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Plant culture and transformation</title><p>Moss tissue was cultured on PpNH<sub>4</sub> medium (1.03 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1.86 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 3.3 mM Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, 2.72 mM (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>-tartrate, 45 μM FeSO<sub>4</sub>, 9.93 μM H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub>, 220 nM CuSO<sub>4</sub>, 1.966 μM MnCl<sub>2</sub>, 231 nM CoCl<sub>2</sub>, 191 nM ZnSO<sub>4</sub>, 169 nM KI, and 103 nM Na<sub>2</sub>MoO<sub>4</sub>) supplied with 0.7% agar, plated on Petri dishes. After propagation by blending, 5–7-day-old tissue was protoplasted and then transformed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu and Vidali, 2011</xref>). For all the HDR transformations, 7.5 µg of the CRISPR/protospacer plasmid and 7.5 µg of the homology plasmid were co-transformed into 150 µL protoplasts at a concentration of 2,000,000 protoplasts/mL. Transformed protoplasts were resuspended in liquid plating medium (PpNH<sub>4</sub> plus 8.5% mannitol and 10 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>), plated and regenerated on PRM-B media (PpNH<sub>4</sub> plus 6% mannitol and 10 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>) with 0.8% agar. A layer of cellophane was placed on top of the PRM-B plates, and protoplasts were plated on top of the cellophane. After 4 days on PRM-B, the cellophane was transferred to PpNH<sub>4</sub> supplied with antibiotic for selection. Then, 15 µg/mL hygromycin was used for selection of transformed protoplasts. Plants were grown on selection for a week before moving to PpNH<sub>4</sub> media for subsequent culturing and genotyping.</p><p>Growth assays were used to quantify protonemal area. Tissue regenerated from protoplasts was used to synchronize plant growth. Protoplasts were isolated, plated, and regenerated as described above. After 4 days on PRM-B, they were transferred to PpNH<sub>4</sub> and allowed to grow for another 3 days. Seven days after protoplasting, plants were imaged with a Nikon SMZ25 stereomicroscope equipped with a color camera (Nikon digital sight DS-Fi2). Plants were transferred from the plate to a slide and stained with 0.1 mg/mL calcofluor. Calcofluor fluorescence was imaged with a violet filter cube (excitation 420/25, dichroic 455, emission 460 longpass). Subapical cell length was measured manually using these images. Quantification of plant area was carried out using the methods modified from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vidali et al., 2007</xref>. In brief, colored images were converted to a single red color image. Single plants were selected and highlighted by cropping and thresholding above a certain intensity value. Plant area was calculated based on the thresholded images. For each experiment, plant area was normalized to the average area of control plants.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Cloning transcript sequences</title><p>Total mRNA was extracted from fresh tissue of both wild type and <italic>∆sabre</italic>. Total cDNA was generated with oligo-dT primers using extracted mRNA as the template. Primers DC65 and DC191 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) were used to amplify the CDS encoding the N terminal portion of the SABRE protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Amplified fragments were cloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega) after A tailing. The cloned fragments were then confirmed with Sanger sequencing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Brightfield microscopy</title><p>Brightfield time-lapse microscopy was performed using a Nikon Ti microscope equipped with a 0.8 NA ×20 objective. Plants were cultured in continuous light in PDMS microfluidic devices with liquid Hoagland’s medium as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bascom et al., 2016</xref>). For imaging protonemal tissue, ground tissue was loaded into microfluidic devices and allowed to grow at least 2–3 days before imaging. Gametophores emerged from protonemata naturally 2–3 weeks after loading ground tissue. Multiple XY positions were acquired, and a either a single focal plane or a Z-stack was acquired for each position. Between each time point, white light remained on to provide light for plant growth. Mono-color brightfield images were acquired with Nikon DS-Qi2 camera. Colored brightfield images were acquired with Nikon DS-Vi1 camera. Extended-depth-of-focus (EDF) images were created for the Z-stacks with NIS-Elements (Nikon). Protonemata growth rate was measured by manually tracing the growing tip during active growing period in NIS-Elements software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Laser scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy</title><p>For short-term imaging, moss protonemal tissue was mounted on an agar pad on a slide, submerged in Hoagland’s medium, and sealed with a coverslip. For protonemata staining, FM4-64 (15 µM), aniline blue (20 µg/mL), and Fast Scarlet (50 µg/mL) were dissolved in Hoagland’s medium used for tissue mounting. For imaging tissue regenerated from protoplasts, regenerating protoplasts were removed from the cellophane, loaded into microfluidic devices, and immediately imaged. To synchronize cell divisions, ground tissue was loaded into microfluidic devices and allowed at least 4 days to grow. The microfluidic device was placed in far red light for 3–4 days before exposure to white light and imaging. Confocal imaging was performed using a Nikon A1R laser scanning confocal with a 1.3 NA ×40 or 1.49 NA ×60 oil immersion objective (Nikon). Laser illumination at 405 nm was used for exciting aniline blue dye, 488 nm was used for exciting mNeonGreen, GFP, and chlorophyll autofluorescence; 561 nm for mRuby2, mCherry, FM4-64, Fast Scarlet, and propidium iodide. Emission filters were 525/50 nm for mNeonGreen/GFP and aniline blue; 595/50 nm for mRuby2, mCherry, FM4-64, Fast Scarlet, and propidium iodide. For chlorophyll autofluorescence emission, light passed through a long-pass filter allowing wavelengths larger than 640 nm to pass. Image acquisition was controlled by Nikon NIS-Elements software (Nikon). In between each time point, transmitted white light was on providing light for plant growth. 3D reconstruction was done using 3D volume viewer with maximum projection rendering method in NIS-Elements, and contrast for slices at different Z positions was adjusted individually to compensate for loss of signal in tissue further away from the objective using 3D lookup table function. Deconvolution was carried out with NIS-Elements (Nikon) with the 2D deconvolution default settings.</p><p>To quantify cell size in gametophores, mature phyllids were removed from gametophore and mounted in a droplet of staining solution (15 µg/mL propidium iodide dissolved in liquid Hoagland’s medium) between a slide and coverslip. Confocal images were captured for quantification. In Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>), fluorescent images were processed using enhance contrast, subtract background, and smooth and median filter. The processed images were then converted to a binary mask and put through binary process, Close&gt;Dilate&gt;Close&gt;Skeletonize&gt;Dilate, to outline the edges of the cells. Images were then inverted to highlight the cell area and subsequently quantified using the analyze particle function. After quantification, incorrect cells (fused or broken) were manually removed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Variable angle epifluorescence microscopy</title><p>VAEM microscopy was performed using a Nikon Ti-E inverted microscope equipped with a TI-TIRF-PAU illuminator, using a Nikon 1.49 NA ×100 oil immersion TIRF objective. Also, 6–8-day-old plants regenerated from protoplasts were mounted between a coverslip and an agar pad on top of a slide, prepared right before imaging. GFP and mNeonGreen were illuminated with a 488 nm laser, while mRuby2 and mCherry were excited with a 561 nm laser, the emission passed through a 525/50 filter for GFP/mNeonGreen and 610/75 for mRuby2/mCherry. Images were simultaneously captured with two Andor 897 EMCCD cameras. Image acquisition was controlled by Nikon NIS-Elements software. All data was processed with enhanced contrast (0.1% pixel saturation), subtract background and smoothing in Fiji using default settings.</p><p>To analyze SABRE co-localization with either ER, actin, or microtubules, Pearson’s correlation coefficients were calculated using established algorithms in the NIS-Elements software package. To measure co-localization using an intensity-independent method, we measured the fraction SABRE area overlapping with the either ER, actin, or microtubules. Time-lapse images were processed as described above and as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3C</xref>. Specifically, using Fiji, the SABRE channel was thresholded with the MaxEntropy method uniformly to select area with intensity between 36,000 and 65,535, then converted to a binary mask. The total SABRE area was acquired by measuring the white area of this mask. The ER, actin, or microtubule channel was filtered using unsharp mask with a radius = 3 and mask = 0.6, thresholded with the Otsu method between 28,000 and 65,535, and converted to a binary mask. The binary mask image was skeletonized and dilated to create the ER, actin, or microtubule skeleton. The skeletonized image was then flipped vertically. Then original or flipped skeleton was subtracted from the SABRE binary mask to extract the proportion of SABRE area not overlapping with ER, actin, or microtubules. These processes were done for the first 50 frames of the time-lapse video with 120 ms interval, and the average of each frame was calculated as a data point for each cell. The area of SABRE that did overlap was derived from the above number, which equals to one minus the fraction that did not overlap.</p><p>Cortical actin and microtubule dynamics were quantified by measuring the decay of the correlation coefficient over time, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vidali et al., 2010</xref>). Briefly, two frames within the time-lapse video that were 1, 2, 3 … to N (largest frame number present in the video) frames apart were paired, and the correlation coefficient between every pixel position in those two images was calculated. The numbers for the same frame numbers apart were then averaged between different cells to generate the data point, and standard error of the means was calculated to generate the error bar. The quicker the decrease in the correlation coefficient as the temporal spacing between the frames increased indicates more dynamic movement of the fluorescence signal.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching</title><p>Phragmoplast microtubule photobleaching experiments were conducted using a Nikon A1R laser scanning confocal microscope with 1.49 NA ×60 oil immersion objective. Actively growing plant tissue was mounted on an agar pad between the slide and coverslip, then imaged immediately with a 488 nm laser to identify actively dividing cells at the phragmoplast expansion stage. A 3 µm × 3 µm square region of interest (ROI) was placed in the center of phragmoplast, ensuring the entire ROI was filled with phragmoplast microtubules. Photobleaching was carried out using a 405 nm laser at 10% power for 1 s, after six frames (5 s) of normal imaging. Imaging continued after photobleaching for 2 min to capture fluorescence recovery. The average intensity in the ROI was measured for each frame, then normalized to the average of the value from the first six frames.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Nuclear migration trajectory analysis</title><p>A moss line with the nuclear marker NLS-GFP-GUS and the plasma membrane marker SNAP-TM-mCherry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van Gisbergen et al., 2018</xref>) was imaged with time-lapse confocal microscopy. A Z-stack was taken every 5 min for the apical cells of several filaments. A segmented line was drawn manually along the axis of growth to generate the kymograph. To make the trends on the kymograph easier to label (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), we stretched the kymograph image by increasing the Y axis twofold. To measure the basal nuclear position, using the straight-line tool in Fiji we measured the distance between the middle of the cell plate and the basal edge of the nucleus when it was closest to the cell plate in the kymograph. The distance was divided by the cell length at the same time point, to generate the relative basal nuclear position. To analyze nuclear migration, we isolated movie fragments of nuclear apical migrating periods, tracked the nuclear GFP signal with the TrackMate plugin in Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tinevez et al., 2017</xref>), with a spot diameter of 10 µm. Displacement, distance, and velocity were calculated. Nuclear migration displacement was defined as the straight-line distance between the initial and final positions of the nucleus. Total migration distance was calculated as the sum of displacement between each frame. Average instantaneous velocity was calculated between each frame.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Charles Barlowe lab (Dartmouth College) and Gohta Goshima lab (Nagoya University) for sharing mNeonGreen gene template with two different codon usages.

proteins act were previously unknown. Functional genetic and live cell imaging approaches in the moss Physcomitrium enabled the authors to gather data that change our current view of <italic>SABRE</italic> activity. Rather than a role regulating the cytoskeleton (specifically microtubules), they show that <italic>SABRE</italic> influences membrane trafficking. Additionally this work implicates the ER in ensuring cell plate integrity in plant cell divisions.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;<italic>SABRE</italic> populates ER domains essential for cell plate maturation and cell expansion influencing cell and tissue patterning&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Christian Hardtke as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The work here describes new localization and roles for a plant <italic>SABRE</italic> protein, and attempts to define the cellular mechanisms that underlie the defects observed upon loss of the protein in Physcomitrium. While it was appreciated that the authors touched on many different aspects of potential <italic>SABRE</italic> functions, the result is a somewhat diffuse manuscript, and the expectation that you would make sense of the phenotypes by explaining molecular functions of the <italic>SABRE</italic> protein. There are several ways to address this. One solution would be to investigate one hypothesis for <italic>SABRE</italic> function more in depth. For example, reviewer 1 suggests testing whether the author's hypothesis that <italic>SABRE</italic> may be the link to motors for nuclear migration. The other acceptable route would be to modify the text to highlight the findings in a way that people would appreciate the careful and comprehensive cellular analysis rather than expecting the molecular mechanism of <italic>SABRE</italic>.</p><p>2) The colocalization of <italic>SABRE</italic> with the ER are based on Pearson correlation coefficients (relative to other compartments) but details of the calculation are missing from the Materials and methods. Because localization is a major finding of the paper, and is in contrast to previous work, additional details on how this was measured should be included. Specific places to revise include: (1) “the correlation coefficient between images over all possible temporal spacings” to show actin/microtubule dynamics. Please explain more about the quantification data in Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and D in the main text. (2) The authors conclude that <italic>SABRE</italic> is ER-localized, but since <italic>SABRE-3mNG</italic> is detected in punctae, whereas ER-mCherry is shown as tubules and sheets, morphologically they are different. More evidence (biochemical or cell biological evidence) is required here to support the conclusion of ER-localization. In general, the authors should make sure their colocalization claims here are supported, as historically, there may have been over-confidence in imaging-based analyses.(see Aaron JS, Taylor AB, Chew TL. Image co-localization-co-occurrence versus correlation. Journal of cell science. 2018 Feb 1;131(3).</p><p>3) Additional information about the genome-edited lines of <italic>SABRE</italic> is required, as beyond the genotyping data, no other confirmation evidence is provided. For instance, is it possible to check the gene expression at mRNA level or protein level? It was unclear to the reviewers if a complementation experiment was done to test the C-terminal tagged reporter lines. If it was, please alter the text to make this clearer. If not, what other evidence can the authors provide to make the case that <italic>SABRE-3mNG</italic> reflects endogenous localization?</p><p>4) Because the results here differ from previous work (e.g. Pietra et al), some discussion about how much the difference may reflect different cell types and organisms, rather than fundamental <italic>SABRE</italic> activities should be added. Specific cases to address are noted in the comments from the reviewers, below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors (required)):</italic></p><p>This manuscript does a good job of explaining why the function of <italic>SABRE</italic> is worth pursuing, and it does reveal an unexpected behavior of the ER during cell division. With the caveat that this was studied in a different plant, it also brings into question previous ideas that <italic>SABRE</italic> is a MT regulator. But upon considering the manuscript as a whole, I did feel that there wasn't quite as much of an advance in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of <italic>PpSABRE</italic> action as the Abstract lead me to expect.</p><p>One solution to this is some more examination of one clear phenotype. For example, the observation that <italic>sabre</italic> mutants have unusual nuclear migration patterns lead to the hypothesis that &quot;<italic>SABRE</italic> may provide a link between the nuclear envelope and motors responsible for nuclear migration (Leong et al., 2020; Yamada and Goshima, 2018).&quot; given the existence of reagents to monitor and inactivate these motors, it seems straightforward to test this model. Because the other functions of <italic>SABRE</italic> are more implied by localization than shown outright, this would be an experiment that would satisfy my concern about defining function.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors (required)):</italic></p><p>I am a bit uneasy about the sentence indicating &quot;strong spatial correlation&quot; of the ER and <italic>SABRE</italic> (specifically the word “strong”, and the implications). All that is said is &quot;Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated in NIS elements.&quot; I'd appreciate a few more details, since the finding is in contrast to the previous finding in Arabidopsis (Pietra et al., 2013) and image correlations can be fraught (e.g., Aaron et al., 2018). The temporal movement with the ER is convincing, but a few more details are warranted regarding the correlation, and I advise removing the subjective word &quot;strong&quot; as it appears to me that the puncta are associated with the ER (and <italic>SABRE</italic> is not an ER-resident protein).</p><p>Much of the data here is in contrast to Pietra et al., 2013, and it is not clear (to me, at least) if this is due to differences in cell types and possible multiple functions, vs. potential issues with interpretation of results. More experiments are not warranted, but a more thorough explanation in the Discussion is warranted. Things in particular I wonder about are:</p><p>– PPB alignment was observed to be misoriented in Pietra et al. – was this examined at all in this study?</p><p>– I am puzzled by the differences in cortical MT alignment found in their study, but not here. Could that be due to differences in cell developmental state (as cortical microtubules realign after cell expansion is complete in hypocotyl cells… I assume this is also true in <italic>P. patens</italic>?). Or perhaps, is there a feedback in Arabidopsis that influences the microtubules, i.e., is the a potential for an indirect effect? Or, is it possible that <italic>SABRE</italic> has different roles in different cellular contexts?</p><p>– Pietra et al., 2013, observed a cell plate enrichment, but no ER association – I think this should be discussed more thoroughly and perhaps speculated upon.</p><p>Aaron JS, Taylor AB, Chew TL.

The authors generated <italic>sabre</italic> mutant and overexpression lines using CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genome editing. Their detailed phenotypical analysis on the mutant and time-lapse data on <italic>SABRE-mEGFP/3mNG</italic> indicate that <italic>SABRE</italic> plays role in polarized cell growth, diffuse cell expansion and cell division. <italic>SABRE</italic> protein overlaps with the ER marker KDEL but not with the actin marker or microtubule marker. In <italic>sabre</italic> mutant, ER morphology becomes abnormal, and the process of cytokinesis is often defective. The authors thus demonstrated that <italic>SABRE</italic> regulates plant cell expansion and division via its interaction with the ER. These preliminary findings are potentially interesting, but are mostly descriptive and do not provide enough mechanistic understanding of the function of <italic>SABRE</italic> in ER organization and thus in cell morphogenesis and cell division. It is unclear whether the observed ER organization changes in <italic>sabre</italic> mutants are direct or indirect and how changes in ER organization in the mutant result in the cell growth defects and cell division defects.</p><p>1) The authors generated several genome-edited lines of <italic>SABRE</italic>, but other than genotyping data, no other confirmation evidence is provided. For instance, Are the mutants real knock-out? Is it possible to check the gene expression at mRNA level or protein level? For the C-terminal tagged lines, it is risky to conclude the fusion protein is functional just based on the “no growth defects in tagged plants”. Does the GFP signal reflect the real functional <italic>SABRE</italic>? I understand a rescue/complementation experiment here may be difficult, but a western blot showing fused <italic>SABRE-mEGFP/3mNG</italic> in the plants will help justifying the cell biology data shown later on.</p><p>2) I appreciate that the authors examined the phenotype of <italic>sabre</italic> mutants very carefully. It is clear that cell sizes and cell growth rates are both reduced, but based on the images in Figure 2D, there are more cells in the mutants, which is contradictory to the cell division failure described later. Could the authors quantify the cell number in the mutant vs. WT?</p><p>3) The authors believe <italic>SABRE</italic> is localized on the ER. Since <italic>SABRE-3mNG</italic> are detected on punctae, whereas ER-mCherry is shown as tubules and sheets, morphologically they are different. I feel at least one more piece of evidence (biochemical or cell biological evidence) is required here to support the conclusion.</p><p>4) The authors examined the cytoskeleton in <italic>sabre</italic> mutants based on fluorescent signals of two marker proteins. Both actin and microtubule still show accumulation in tips, how about the dynamics of these tips during cell expansion? The authors used “the correlation coefficient between images over all possible temporal spacings” to show actin/microtubule dynamics. Please explain more about the quantification data in Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and D in the main text.</p><p>5) The authors claim that actin plays a role in <italic>SABRE</italic> function. However, this is just based on the minor changes of actin marker protein in <italic>sabre</italic> mutant. Are the changes direct or indirect?

Journal of cell science. 2018 Feb 1;131(3).</p></disp-quote><p>The correlation coefficient analysis used to analyze the dynamics of actin and microtubules at the cell cortex in Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and D was developed in 2010 (Vidali et al., 2010) and has been used by our lab and others (Arieti and Staiger, 2020; Burkart et al., 2015; de Bang et al., 2020; Gavrin et al., 2020; van Gisbergen et al., 2020, 2018) to describe dynamics of a variety of fluorescently labeled proteins. We now include a brief description in the revised manuscript in the Results and Materials and methods sections.</p><p>With respect to the association of <italic>SABRE</italic> puncta with ER structures, in the revised manuscript we developed an additional method to quantify the degree of overlap, which is outlined in Figure 4—figure supplement 3 and described in the Results and Materials and methods sections. This new method calculates the area of overlap between <italic>SABRE</italic> and the ER, actin, or microtubules. Unlike Pearson’s correlation, this method does not depend on fluorescence intensity and thus does not significantly change when <italic>SABRE</italic> is overexpressed, thereby providing a more robust measure of correlation between geometrically distinct structures. This new method is reported in the revised Figure 4 and the Pearson’s correlation coefficient was moved to Figure 4—figure supplement 3, as a second independent method to quantify the association of <italic>SABRE</italic> with the ER. We also provide more examples in Figure 4—figure supplement 3 of <italic>SABRE</italic> puncta moving along ER tubules demonstrating the sustained and dynamic interaction between <italic>SABRE</italic> and the ER. These new analyses and additional dynamic data, together with the fact that loss of <italic>SABRE</italic> function impacts the ER, suggests that <italic>SABRE</italic> associates with the ER and influences ER function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Additional information about the genome-edited lines of SABRE is required, as beyond the genotyping data, no other confirmation evidence is provided.

We cloned and sequenced the 5’ end of the cDNA and demonstrated that the cDNA from <italic>∆sab</italic> contains the predicted in-frame stop codons resulting from the edited allele. This is reported in Figure 1—figure supplement 1. We also used CRISPR-Cas9 coupled with homology directed repair to insert the stop cassette into the <italic>SABRE</italic> locus in the <italic>OE-SAB-3mNG/ER-mCherry</italic> line, thereby knocking out the overexpressed <italic>SABRE-3XmNG</italic>. We then imaged the <italic>SAB-3mNG/ER-mCherry</italic> parental line and the disrupted line (<italic>∆sabre/OE-SAB-3mNG/ER-mCherry</italic>). In Figure 4—figure supplement 2, we show that <italic>∆sabre/OE-SAB-3mNG/ER-mCherry</italic> no longer exhibits mNG fluorescence, in contrast to the robust signal in <italic>OE-SAB-3mNG/ER-mCherry</italic>.</p><p>In Figure 4—figure supplement 2 we show quantitative growth assays for the lines that were generated in this study. All the <italic>SABRE</italic> loci that were edited to generate a fluorescent protein fusion of SABRE grow indistinguishably from wild type. These experiments are, in essence, complementation experiments, because the only copy of <italic>SABRE</italic> present in these lines was fused to the coding sequence of a fluorescent protein. Given that disruption of <italic>SABRE</italic> function results in a strong growth defect and that lines that express only the fluorescent fusion protein from the endogenous <italic>SABRE</italic> locus have no growth defect and are indistinguishable from wild type, we reason that fluorescent fusions of SABRE are functional and thus represent the endogenous localization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Because the results here differ from previous work (e.g. Pietra et al.), some discussion about how much the difference may reflect different cell types and organisms, rather than fundamental SABRE activities should be added.
