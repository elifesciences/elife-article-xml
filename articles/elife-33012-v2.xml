This is best exemplified for primary somatosensory neurons and postganglionic sympathetic neurons and their dependence on members of the neurotrophin family of growth factors, which includes nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT3) and neurotrophin-4 (NT4). Through binding to and activating their cognate receptors (NGF to TrkA, BDNF and NT4 to TrkB, NT3 predominantly to TrkC), neurotrophins promote neuronal survival, axonal growth and target field innervation, neuronal subtype specification and, for sympathetic neurons, synapse formation and maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cosker et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harrington and Ginty, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang and Reichardt, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Luo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miller and Kaplan, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sharma et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>NGF is the first described and prototypical neurotrophin. A remarkable feature of NGF signaling is that, in order to elicit trophic actions on developing sensory and sympathetic neurons, the NGF/TrkA signal must be propagated retrogradely, from distal axons to the soma, traveling a distance that is thousands of times the diameter of the cell body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cosker et al., 2008;</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Howe and Mobley, 2005</xref>). Although much is known about downstream signaling pathways and transcriptional targets that mediate the trophic actions of NGF, the molecular events that orchestrate this unique form of long-range axonal signaling remain unclear and debated.</p><p>A major mode of retrograde NGF signal propagation is through the actions of NGF/TrkA signaling endosomes. The signaling endosome model posits that NGF/TrkA complexes formed at distal axons are internalized and actively sorted into endosomes, a subset of which become mature, signaling-competent vesicles that undergo long-distance, microtubule-mediated retrograde transport to the soma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Howe and Mobley, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ye et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heerssen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wu et al., 2007</xref>). Indeed, experiments in which TrkA receptors were labeled in distal axons prior to internalization revealed their subsequent appearance in proximal axons, cell bodies and dendrites of sympathetic neurons in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sharma et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harrington et al., 2011</xref>). By recruiting TrkA effectors, TrkA endosomes in these different cellular compartments can function as signaling platforms that propagate trophic signals to support survival, maturation, and synapse formation and maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heerssen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harrington et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Howe et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Suo et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Defining molecular and ultrastructural features of signaling endosomes is key to understanding the mechanisms that underlie long-range NGF trafficking and signaling. A long-standing, canonical view is that retrograde NGF/TrkA signaling endosomes are early endosomes because, like other ligand/receptor complexes, internalized NGF/TrkA complexes are sorted into early endosomes and the membrane topology of receptors in early endosome-type vesicles can, in principle, enable signal propagation within the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cosker et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harrington and Ginty, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Howe and Mobley, 2005</xref>). Evidence supporting the early endosome model includes biochemical and ultrastructural analyses using an ex vivo sciatic nerve preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Delcroix et al., 2003</xref>). The small GTPase Rab5, a molecular marker and master regulator of early endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zerial and McBride, 2001</xref>), is enriched in purified axoplasmic fractions that contained retrograde <sup>125</sup>I-NGF. Also, TrkA was found associated with single-membrane vesicles labeled by Rab5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Delcroix et al., 2003</xref>). In agreement with this, retrogradely transported NGF conjugated to quantum dots was colocalized with Rab5 in compartmentalized cultures of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cui et al., 2007</xref>). However, despite the widely accepted view that signaling endosomes are early endosomes, late endosomes (LEs) and multi-vesicular bodies (MVBs) have been observed to contain retrogradely transported cargoes in other experimental paradigms. For example, in cultured DRG and motor neurons, internalized tetanus toxin is sorted into TrkB<sup>+</sup> vesicles associated with either Rab5 or Rab7 (a small GTPase enriched in MVBs and LEs) within axons, but only Rab7<sup>+</sup> vesicles underwent long-range retrograde transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deinhardt et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, in compartmentalized sympathetic neuron cultures, <sup>125</sup>I-NGF applied to distal axons was found predominantly in MVBs and lysosomes, based on ultrastructural analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Claude et al., 1982a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">1982b</xref>). In related work, gold-labeled NGF injected into the anterior chamber of the eye accumulated in MVBs in axons near sympathetic ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sandow et al., 2000</xref>). Also, activated TrkA was observed in multivesicular structures in the rat sciatic nerve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhattacharyya et al., 2002</xref>). However, BDNF injected into the tongue did not appear associated with MVBs or any other ultrastructurally defined endosome type in hypoglossal motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altick et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, a key conceptual challenge to the idea that MVBs are TrkA signal carriers is the lack of a plausible mechanism to explain how signals emanating from NGF/TrkA complexes encapsulated within intraluminal vesicles of MVBs are transmitted to the cytoplasm. Thus, while different endosomal compartments have been suggested as candidate retrograde NGF transport carriers, possibly due to the different means used to visualize endosomes, different preparations, and the use of different cell types, the prevailing view is that early endosomes are retrograde TrkA<sup>+</sup> signaling endosomes.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that molecularly and ultrastructurally defined MVBs carry the majority of NGF/TrkA complexes from distal axons to cell bodies. Moreover, Rab7, which regulates MVB and LE function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zerial and McBride, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vanlandingham and Ceresa, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lebrand et al., 2002</xref>), is essential in vivo and in vitro for retrograde TrkA signaling. Strikingly, TrkA<sup>+</sup> MVBs that arrive in cell bodies do not fuse with lysosomes, but rather can give rise to single-membrane vesicles marked by Vps35, but not Rab5. Moreover, TrkA kinase activity controls the maturation and fate of TrkA<sup>+</sup> MVBs. Thus, MVBs are mediators of long-range retrograde TrkA signaling, evading lysosomal fusion and degradation within the soma in a TrkA kinase-dependent manner, and evolving within the soma into single membrane vesicles with the capacity to propagate TrkA survival signals.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ultrastructural analysis of retrograde Flag-TrkA endosomes</title><p>We investigated the vesicular nature, molecular composition, maturation, and signaling dynamics of TrkA<sup>+</sup> signaling endosomes using a <italic>Ntrk1<sup>Flag</sup></italic> knockin mouse line, which expresses Flag epitope-tagged TrkA from the endogenous TrkA locus, and an in vitro compartmentalized microfluidic sympathetic neuron culture system to monitor internalization, sorting and retrograde trafficking of Flag-TrkA<sup>+</sup> endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sharma et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harrington et al., 2011</xref>).

The immediate juxtaposition of the small (5 nm) and large (10 nm) gold particles used to simultaneously visualize Flag-TrkA and P-TrkA, respectively, also confirms that the gold-conjugated anti-Flag antibody remains associated with Flag-TrkA throughout the course of these experiments. We also assessed the extent of co-localization between TrkA<sup>+</sup> MVBs and the lysosomal marker Lamp1 in axons and cell bodies. While over 50% of CD63 punctae in both distal and proximal axons were Lamp1<sup>+</sup>, very few CD63/Flag-TrkA double-labeled punctae were associated with lysosomes in axons and cell bodies (8.5 ± 2.2%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a,b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Taken together, both TrkA<sup>+</sup> early endosomes and MVBs recruit NGF/TrkA signaling effector proteins, suggesting that both are capable of TrkA effector signaling, and retrograde TrkA<sup>+</sup> MVBs are uniquely not degradative.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Retrogradely transported TrkA<sup>+ </sup>endosomes in cell bodies evolve from MVBs into simple, single-membrane vesicle structures and evade lysosomal sorting</title><p>From the ultrastructural analysis of retrogradely transported Flag-TrkA<sup>+</sup> endosomes in cell bodies, we observed that the majority of TrkA receptors are localized to the membrane of intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) of TrkA<sup>+</sup> MVBs while a smaller subset is present on the MVB limiting membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Based on principles of MVB formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hanson and Cashikar, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Katzmann et al., 2002</xref>), previous ultrastructural studies of other RTKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Futter et al., 1996</xref>), and our immuno-EM analysis, the topology of TrkA receptors associated with ILVs indicate that its catalytic domain and phosphotyrosine residues are located within the ILV lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). TrkA receptors in such a configuration are presumably unable to transmit NGF pro-survival signaling cascades to the cytoplasm and nucleus due to the restricted localization of their effector domains. TrkA receptors on the limiting membrane, in contrast, are in a signaling accessible position with their signaling domains facing the cytoplasm. Therefore, we asked whether the membrane localization of TrkA receptors changes to a position favorable for cytoplasmic signaling following MVB entry into cell bodies.</p><p>In order to assess the maturation of retrograde TrkA<sup>+</sup> MVBs in cell bodies over time, we developed a pulse-block TrkA labeling strategy based on the Flag-TrkA EM assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). For this assay, retrograde TrkA transport was allowed to proceed for 25 min. Then, all subsequent TrkA axonal transport from distal axons into cell bodies was blocked by applying nocodazole to the distal axon compartment to disrupt microtubules, and thus microtubule-dependent axonal transport in that compartment. The distribution of Flag-TrkA receptors in different membrane compartments within cell bodies was then assessed by EM at different time points following nocodazole application. The blockade of retrograde transport in distal axons by nocodazole was highly effective since it completely blocked accumulation of newly formed Flag-TrkA endosomes within the cell body compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In addition, live cell imaging experiments revealed that retrograde axonal movement of Flag-TrkA<sup>+</sup> endosomes in distal axons ceased within 15 to 20 min of nocodazole application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Moreover, nocodazole treatment at 25 min post-NGF application to distal axons resulted in sparse accumulation of retrograde TrkA endosomes in cell bodies at the 1 hr time point post-NGF treatment and a relatively low, but stable number of TrkA receptors were observed over the subsequent several hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). In contrast, neurons without axonal transport blockade exhibited a dramatic increase in the number of retrograde Flag-TrkA<sup>+</sup> vesicles appearing in cell bodies during the 1 hr time period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Furthermore, nocodazole application to distal axons did not affect microtubule-dependent endosome maturation and trafficking within the cell body compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>), indicating effective compartmentalization of transport blockade. These findings indicate that any change in TrkA<sup>+</sup> endosome ultrastructure in cell bodies at times following addition of nocodazole to distal axons is the result of maturation or evolution of existing endosomes that had arrived prior to nocodazole application, and not newly trafficked endosomes. Thus, this pulse-block Flag-TrkA EM paradigm allowed us to define the dynamics of membrane localization of retrogradely transported TrkA receptors following their arrival to the cell body.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33012.013</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Retrogradely transported TrkA<sup>+ </sup>endosomes within cell bodies evolve from MVBs into simple, single-membrane vesicle structures.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic of the pulse-block assay.

Moreover, the membrane localization of the Flag epitope was in agreement with the principle of endocytosis: the Flag epitope was found on the outer leaflet of ILV membranes and the inner leaflet of limiting membranes and SVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Consistent with our previous experiments, 1 hr after NGF application to distal axons, and following blockade of newly arriving endosomes, the majority (92.8 ± 3.6%) of retrograde TrkA<sup>+</sup> endosomes were MVBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, left panel). Among the MVB-resident TrkA receptors, 68.3 ± 2.6% were localized to ILVs and 24.5 ± 4.7% to the limiting membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, right panel). Strikingly, the fraction of total cell body Flag punctae found associated with MVBs decreased during the next several hours, and this decrease was coincident with the emergence of Flag-TrkA<sup>+</sup> SVs, which peaked (42.4 ± 8.2%) at ~5 hr post-NGF treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Moreover, the fraction of Flag-TrkA<sup>+</sup> puncta associated with lysosomes remained low during the first 8 hr of blocking the arrival of new endosomes, and by 24 hr post-NGF the majority of Flag-TrkA receptors were found associated with lysosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).</p><p>Because the transport blockade prevented TrkA<sup>+</sup> endosomes from entering cell bodies in this pulse-block paradigm, the most parsimonious explanation of the source of the TrkA<sup>+</sup> SV population during the course of these experiments is that they emerge de novo within cell bodies. Since the vast majority of newly arrived Flag-TrkA<sup>+</sup> endosomes at the start of the transport blockade are MVBs, the Flag-TrkA<sup>+</sup> SVs are therefore derived, either directly or indirectly, from TrkA<sup>+</sup> MVBs. These observations indicate that the membrane localization of retrogradely transported TrkA, and indeed the ultrastructural properties of TrkA<sup>+</sup> endosomes, changes following TrkA<sup>+</sup> endosome entry into the cell body.</p><p>To ask whether the MVB-to-SV transition and delayed lysosomal sorting occurs for MVBs carrying other types of cargoes, we next assessed the fate of retrogradely transported endosomes carrying transferrin, a ‘non-signaling’ cargo. Transferrin was internalized in distal axons in a dynamin-dependent manner and colocalized with the transferrin receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). The majority of newly internalized transferrin and Flag-TrkA were co-localized within distal axons, suggesting that they can be sorted into the same early endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Interestingly, the level of co-localization decreased over time, indicating that these cargoes were later sorted into different vesicular compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Moreover, retrogradely transported Flag-TrkA and transferrin remained segregated upon their arrival into cell bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Consistent with this, in EM experiments in which transferrin and Flag-TrkA were labeled with different size gold particles, we found that retrogradely transported transferrin and TrkA were localized to distinct MVBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>). In addition, in contrast to the observed emergence of TrkA<sup>+</sup> SVs in cell bodies, we did not observe SVs containing transferrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Instead, the majority of retrogradely transported transferrin proteins were observed in lysosomes, beginning as early as the 2 hr time point, when TrkA was mostly associated with MVBs and SVs. Similar results were found with MVBs containing Cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) or Bovine serum albumin (BSA) (See below, Figure 7B,C; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1F,G</xref>). Therefore, transferrin and TrkA are retrogradely transported in distinct MVBs populations, and TrkA<sup>+</sup> MVBs are unique in that they give rise to SVs and evade lysosomal fusion.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>TrkA<sup>+ </sup>single vesicles in cell bodies are signaling competent and not associated with the early endosome marker Rab5</title><p>We next asked whether TrkA<sup>+</sup> SVs that emerge in cell bodies are poised for signaling and associated with signaling effectors. SVs were visualized using immuno-gold labeling of P-TrkA and P-PLCγ in the pulse-block Flag-TrkA EM paradigm. Indeed, 5 hr following NGF application to distal axons, Flag-TrkA receptors localized to the membrane of SVs were observed co-localized with P-TrkA and P-PLCγ, with the Flag epitope oriented on the luminal side of the SV membrane and the phospho-tyrosine residues on the cytoplasmic side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). These observations suggest that TrkA<sup>+</sup> SVs derived from MVBs are signaling competent and capable of transducing TrkA signals within the cell body.</p><p>We also sought to define molecular features of TrkA<sup>+</sup> SVs in cell bodies. To determine whether TrkA<sup>+</sup> SVs in cell bodies of sympathetic neurons are associated with Rab5 following retrograde transport, we assessed the extent of co-localization between Flag-TrkA and Rab5 in cell bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). At the 5 hr time point of the pulse-block Flag-TrkA assay, when approximately 40% of retrogradely transported Flag-TrkA<sup>+</sup> endosomes are of a single vesicular nature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), fewer than 5% of the Flag punctae in cell bodies were co-localized with Rab5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,D</xref>). The extent of co-localization of Flag-TrkA and Rab5 was also assessed by EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). To visualize Rab5<sup>+</sup> endosomes by EM, we fused Rab5 with APEX2 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">(Figure 6—figure supplement 1F</xref>), a modified peroxidase that enables visualization of the product of the peroxidase-catalyzed reaction by EM and thus subcellular distribution of APEX2 fusion proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lam et al., 2015</xref>). Lentivirus-mediated delivery of APEX2-Rab5 into sympathetic neurons and EM analysis revealed that the majority of newly internalized Flag-TrkA receptors are associated with APEX2-Rab5<sup>+</sup> endosomes (67.9 ± 7.2%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, middle; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), as predicted. In contrast, and consistent with our immunocytochemical analyses, very few Flag-TrkA punctae were found to be associated with APEX2-Rab5<sup>+</sup> structures at the 5 hr time point of the pulse-block Flag-TrkA assay (6.4 ± 2.0%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, right; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). These findings indicate that TrkA<sup>+</sup> SVs that emerge from MVBs in cell bodies are not associated with Rab5.</p><p>Endocytic pathways downstream of MVBs, other than the well-described degradation pathway, include the recycling pathway and the retromer-dependent transport pathway to the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Katzmann et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cullen and Korswagen, 2011</xref>). Since TrkA<sup>+</sup> SVs in cell bodies are derived from TrkA<sup>+</sup> MVBs, the TrkA endocytic pathway in cell bodies might engage one or both of these routes. Indeed, we observed some TrkA <sup>+</sup> SVs in close proximity to Golgi, while others were close to the plasma membrane and exhibited a tubular shape resembling recycling endosomes <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">(Figure 6—figure supplement 1H</xref>). To more directly test these possibilities, we assessed the extent of Flag-TrkA co-localization with Rab11 and Vps35, key components of recycling endosomes and the retromer complex, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). At the 5 hr time point of the pulse-block Flag-TrkA assay, Flag-TrkA<sup>+</sup> endosomes were associated with Vps35 (39.8 ± 12.5%) and to a lesser extent Rab11 (13.0 ± 6.6%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,F</xref>). Interestingly, nearly all Rab11<sup>+</sup> Flag-TrkA endosomes were also Vps35<sup>+</sup>(10.3 ± 5.7%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,F</xref>).

In addition, the construct contains the F592A point mutation within the TrkA kinase domain ATP binding pocket, which renders TrkA catalytic activity sensitive to inhibition by the small molecule 1NMPP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>As expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atwal et al., 2000</xref>), expression of Flag-TrkB/A-F592A enabled survival of sympathetic neurons treated with BDNF acting exclusively on distal axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Furthermore, exposure of Flag-TrkB/A-F592A infected neurons to BDNF in the absence of NGF was sufficient to promote the generation and transport of Flag-TrkB/A-F592A<sup>+</sup> signaling endosomes, as seen by an increase in P-Trk immunoreactivity by both light microscopy and EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>).

The lack of P-Trk signals in the BDNF/1NMPP1-treated cells suggest that 1NMPP1 treatment is efficacious in inhibiting TrkA F592A kinase activity and BDNF stimulation does not lead to activation of endogenous TrkA receptors, whose kinase activity is 1NMPP1 insensitive.

Neurons expressing Flag-TrkB/A-F592A and treated with either DMSO or 1NMPP1 in the cell body compartment exhibited a similar pattern of TrkA membrane localization at the 1 hr time point, with the majority of Flag-TrkB/A-F592A associated with MVBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). However, at later time points, neurons exposed to 1NMPP1 on cell bodies exhibited a much lower fraction of Flag-TrkB/A-F592A<sup>+</sup> MVBs, virtually no Flag-TrkB/A-F592A<sup>+</sup> SVs, and a much higher percentage of Flag-TrkB/A-F592A<sup>+</sup> lysosomes, compared to DMSO control-treated neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,C</xref>). These observations indicate that TrkA kinase activity is necessary for the proper distribution of retrogradely transported TrkA within MVBs and SVs and the prevention of premature lysosomal sorting following endosome arrival to cell bodies.</p><p>Finally, we asked whether the distribution of TrkA in MVBs, SVs and lysosomes is controlled by local TrkA signaling associated with endosomes themselves or whether TrkA signals emanating from other platforms, that is in trans from other TrkA endosomes or the plasma membrane, can control the fate of retrogradely transported TrkA endosomes. For this, we compared the fate of retrogradely transported endosomes that contain either TrkA or non-TrkA cargoes, including transferrin, bovine serum albumin (BSA), or Cholera toxin subunit B (CTB), by EM analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1F,G</xref>). As for TrkA<sup>+</sup> endosomes, the majority of retrogradely transported transferrin<sup>+</sup>, BSA<sup>+</sup> or CTB<sup>+</sup> endosomes newly arrived within cell bodies were MVBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1F,G</xref>). In dramatic contrast to TrkA<sup>+</sup> endosomes, however, very few, if any transferrin<sup>+</sup>, BSA<sup>+</sup> and CTB<sup>+</sup> endosomes redistributed to SVs during the subsequent several hours. Rather, the vast majority of these non-TrkA MVBs were rapidly sorted into lysosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1F,G</xref>). This rapid sorting of transferrin<sup>+</sup>, BSA<sup>+</sup> and CTB<sup>+</sup> endosomes to lysosomes was independent of 1NMPP1 treatment, and was similar to the rapid sorting of TrkA<sup>+</sup> endosomes to lysosomes observed in neurons expressing Flag-TrkB/A-F592A and receiving 1NMPP1 treatment. Lastly, we asked whether TrkA signaling acting in trans can control the fate of retrogradely transported TrkA<sup>+</sup> MVBs. To address this possibility, we conducted similar Flag-TrkB/A-F592A experiments as those described above, although these were performed in the presence of NGF applied exclusively to the cell body compartment to activate endogenous TrkA signaling. Interestingly, NGF application to the cell body compartment partially rescued premature lysosome sorting of retrograde Flag-TrkB/A-F592A<sup>+</sup> MVBs in neurons treated with 1NMPP1 applied to the cell bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). In contrast, NGF application directly to cell bodies did not prevent the rapid sorting of retrogradely transported transferrin-containing endosomes to lysosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Thus, the fate of retrogradely transported MVBs within cell bodies is dependent on the nature and signaling activity of its cargo. TrkA kinase signaling promotes the emergence of TrkA<sup>+</sup> SVs from TrkA<sup>+</sup> MVBs and protects or delays these endosomes from acquiring a lysosomal fate. Moreover, TrkA receptors can signal in trans, albeit to a lesser extent than endosomal TrkA signals acting in cis, to influence the fate of retrograde TrkA<sup>+</sup> signaling endosomes and prevent their lysosomal targeting and degradation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The type of endosome that mediates long-range retrograde neurotrophin signaling has been controversial. Here, we report that in both sympathetic neurons and TrkA<sup>+</sup> primary sensory neurons, the majority of retrograde TrkA<sup>+</sup> endosomes are associated with MVB/late endosome proteins, including Rab7, CD63 and Hrs, and that Rab7 mediates retrograde TrkA transport and signaling both in vitro and in vivo. Our ultrastructural analysis revealed that retrogradely transported TrkA receptors are carried predominantly in MVBs in a signaling competent state. Moreover, upon their arrival into cell bodies, TrkA<sup>+</sup> MVBs give rise to a previously undescribed type of signaling competent TrkA<sup>+</sup> single vesicle, a subset of which are associated with the retromer complex component Vps35. Thus, MVBs mediate long-range retrograde axonal TrkA transport and retrograde TrkA signaling in neuronal cell bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33012.019</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model for MVB-mediated retrograde TrkA transport and signaling.</title><p>This schematic illustrates a model for how multivesicular bodies control propagation of retrograde NGF-TrkA signals. In distal axons, newly internalized NGF/TrkA complexes are sorted into Rab5<sup>+</sup> early endosomes, and these TrkA<sup>+</sup> early endosomes mature to form multivesicular bodies. Rab7, which localizes to TrkA<sup>+</sup> MVBs, facilitates rapid long-range retrograde axonal transport, and in turn, neuronal survival and synapse formation. In neuronal soma, active endosomal TrkA signaling induces de novo formation of single-membrane vesicles from retrogradely transported MVBs and prevents TrkA<sup>+</sup> MVBs fusion with lysosomes. Together, these TrkA activity-dependent MVB dynamics promote and sustain transduction of retrograde NGF signals.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-33012-fig8-v2"/></fig><p>Our findings are most consistent with earlier in vitro and in vivo studies in which radiolabeled NGF was found in MVB/lysosomal structures in axons and cell bodies of sympathetic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sandow et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhattacharyya et al., 2002</xref>). Although those observations implicated MVBs in mediating axonal transport of NGF, it had been unclear whether MVBs carry active TrkA receptors derived from distal axons since NGF can also bind to p75<sup>NTR</sup>, and NGF may be separated from TrkA and p75<sup>NTR</sup> following internalization. As such, whether MVBs transmit essential retrograde NGF signals within cell bodies was unknown. Our Flag-TrkA labeling strategy provided a means to visualize retrograde TrkA endosomes, and Flag/P-Trk and Flag/P-PLCγ double immuno-EM experiments revealed a signaling competent state of retrograde TrkA<sup>+</sup> MVBs in cell bodies. This observation is in agreement with a previous study in which P-Trk immunoreactivity was found associated with multivesicular structures in the sciatic nerve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhattacharyya et al., 2002</xref>). Other studies have suggested a lack of association of BDNF with MVBs or other endosomal structures in the hypoglossal motor neurons in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altick et al., 2009</xref>) and embryonic stem-cell-derived motor neurons in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Terenzio et al., 2014</xref>), and this discrepancy may be the result of low efficiency of labeling or that at least some other cell types utilize different mechanisms for retrograde BDNF transport. Future work will be needed to address whether BDNF or other neuronal growth factors and neuron types use mechanisms similar to those reported here for NGF in sympathetic and sensory neurons.</p><p>The present findings cause us to reconsider a long-held view in neuronal cell biology, that Rab5<sup>+</sup> early endosomes mediate long-range propagation of target-derived neurotrophic factor signals from distal axons to cell bodies. Prior evidence supporting the early endosome model included the finding of co-localization of NGF and Rab5 in neuronal soma in vivo and the presence of TrkA in Rab5<sup>+</sup> endosomes within cytoplasmic contents eluted from proximal segments of an ex vivo sciatic nerve preparation following NGF injection into the periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Delcroix et al., 2003</xref>). However, the lack of means for specific labeling of distal axon-derived TrkA<sup>+</sup> endosomes may complicate interpretations of those findings because of the possibility that the observed Rab5<sup>+</sup> structures were formed locally at the plasma membrane of the axon or cell body and therefore not representative of retrogradely transported TrkA<sup>+</sup> endosomes. On the other hand, we cannot exclude the possibility that early endosomes carry a small subset of retrograde NGF signals, because ~7% of retrograde TrkA<sup>+</sup> endosomes observed in the pulse block experiments at the earliest time point following transport blockade are single-membrane vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Nevertheless, considering the differences between the quantity of TrkA<sup>+</sup> MVBs and TrkA<sup>+</sup> early endosomes, the amount of TrkA receptors carried per endosome, and differences in MVB and early endosome movement properties, MVBs may provide a favorable means of long-range TrkA translocation and signal propagation, compared to early endosomes. It is noteworthy that, like TrkA, transferrin, BSA and CTB internalized in distal axons were also retrogradely transported to cell bodies mainly, if not entirely, via MVBs, suggesting to us that MVBs are the predominant and possibly sole retrograde axonal transport carrier of cargoes internalized in distal axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1G</xref>).</p><p>Our in vivo findings demonstrate that Rab7 participates in TrkA signaling, survival and synaptogenesis of sympathetic neurons. In vitro, Rab7 is associated with, and necessary for retrograde transport of TrkA<sup>+</sup> signaling endosomes. Moreover, Rab7 is required for neuronal survival when NGF is applied exclusively to distal axons. The sympathetic neuron survival defect in Rab7 mutant SCGs in vivo is, however, considerably less dramatic than that in SCGs of either <italic>Ntrk1</italic> or <italic>Ngf</italic> null mice in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Smeyne et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crowley et al., 1994</xref>). This discrepancy may be attributed to the incomplete ablation of <italic>Rab7</italic> between E14 and P0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Alternatively, a fraction of NGF survival signaling may occur via Rab7-independent MVB transport mechanism, NGF acting directly on cell bodies, or through early endosomes or another retrograde signal carrier that compensates for loss of Rab7 at embryonic times. Although a more complete depletion of Rab7 was achieved at P7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), sympathetic neurons are less dependent on NGF signaling for survival at this postnatal period. Ablation of Rab7 postnatally, during a period of NGF-dependent synaptogenesis, resulted in a dramatic loss of synaptic structures in sympathetic ganglia, showing that Rab7 is required for transmitting retrograde NGF synaptogenic signals. It is possible that a neuronal survival defect occurring between P7 and P14 contributes to the apparent loss of synaptic markers, or the extent of their colocalization, in the in vivo experiments. Future work will be needed to more rigorously test whether there is a survival-independent role of Rab7 during the establishment of sympathetic neuron connectivity. Nevertheless, a role for Rab7 during retrograde TrkA transport, survival and synapse formation provides additional support for the notion that MVBs are major carriers of retrograde NGF signals. Molecularly, one mechanism by which Rab7 mediates axonal transport of TrkA endosome is through its effector protein RILP, which also binds to dynein. In at least one reported case, the Rab7-RILP-dynein interaction facilitates movement of late endosomes on microtubules and maintains their perinuclear localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jordens et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Johansson et al., 2007</xref>). Consistent with this, we found that RILP is recruited to TrkA<sup>+</sup> MVBs in a Rab7-dependent manner and is required for retrograde TrkA transport. Therefore, we suggest that Rab7 controls maturation and transport competency of TrkA<sup>+</sup> MVBs through recruitment of RILP.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Multivesicular bodies as sorting and signaling platforms in neuronal soma</title><p>A long-standing view is that MVBs either repress signaling via receptor downregulation or, in some cases, facilitate signaling by degrading negative regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Taelman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Katzmann et al., 2002</xref>). Our findings provide evidence that MVBs can promote growth factor signal transduction directly. A signaling role for MVBs is supported by the presence of P-Trk phospho-tyrosine residues and P-PLCγ associated with retrograde TrkA<sup>+</sup> MVBs in cell bodies. Moreover, our pulse-block EM experiments revealed that MVBs give rise to, either directly or indirectly, a new type of endosome that has a single membrane structure that does not associate with Rab5 and that exhibits a topology of TrkA receptors in which the kinase domain is oriented toward the cytoplasm and thus poised for RTK signaling within the cytoplasm. MVBs can fuse with the plasma membrane and release intraluminal vesicles as exosomes. Therefore, theoretically, the TrkA<sup>+</sup> SVs we observed within cell bodies could be formed via exosome fusion with the cell body plasma membrane and subsequent receptor internalization. However, both our immunocytochemical and APEX2 EM findings indicate a lack of Rab5<sup>+</sup> Flag-TrkA endosomes in cell bodies within the time frame of our measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, it is unlikely that the Flag-TrkA<sup>+</sup> single vesicle population we observed in the pulse-block EM experiments is derived from an exosome route.</p><p>To our knowledge, an MVB-to-SV maturation step has been observed in only two other examples. First, in naive dendritic cells, MHC II receptor proteins are stored within intraluminal compartments of MVBs. Upon stimulation, these receptors can translocate from MVBs to the plasma membrane via an endosome intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kleijmeer et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Turley et al., 2000</xref>). In a second case, Ebola virus, upon cellular entry, becomes enriched in Rab7<sup>+</sup>late endosomes and this is an obligatory step for infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Saeed et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Spence et al., 2016</xref>). The virus can later exit late endosomes and re-enter the cytoplasm. The virus is not sorted into ILVs, but its envelope, a single-pass membrane structure, is thought to be fused with the MVB limiting membrane through Niemann–Pick disease, type C proteins NPC I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carette et al., 2011</xref>). These studies, together with the present work, indicate that MVBs are dynamic, versatile structures that, depending on the nature of their cargoes, function in cargo transport, sorting, degradation, and signaling. Moreover, we suggest that TrkA receptors localized to both SVs and the limiting membrane of MVBs provides a potential platforms for recruitment and activation of downstream effector proteins following retrograde the period of TrkA<sup>+</sup> MVB transport to cell bodies. Determining the mechanisms by which TrkA<sup>+</sup> MVBs give rise to SVs within the cell body, and defining the relative contributions of TrkA receptors on MVB limiting membranes and SV membranes for cell body TrkA signaling will be important future directions of this work.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>TrkA signaling directs the maturation and fate of retrogradely transported MVBs</title><p>While the existence of signaling endosomes following receptor endocytosis is well documented, mechanisms that underlie their maturation and metabolism have remained unclear, as has the significance of receptor activity and signaling from endosomal platforms in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sorkin and Von Zastrow, 2002</xref>). This is at least partly due to the close spatial and temporal proximity between endosomal signaling events and signals emanating from the plasma membrane, which are difficult to distinguish in cells with a simple morphology. Studies of target-derived growth factor signaling in neurons provide a unique opportunity to address mechanisms of endosome maturation, metabolism and signaling because the plasma membrane of distal axons is physically well separated from retrogradely transported endosomes that reside within the soma. Our pulse-block paradigm, which takes advantage of the separation between the site of plasma membrane signaling and endosome formation (distal axons) and a distant site of endosome signaling, maturation and degradation (cell bodies), allowed us to monitor stages of TrkA<sup>+</sup> endosome maturation and degradation in cell bodies in a synchronized fashion. Our findings that TrkA<sup>+</sup> SVs emerge from MVBs within cell bodies and that delayed lysosomal sorting occurs for retrograde TrkA<sup>+</sup> MVBs, but not transferrin-, BSA-, or CTB-containing MVBs, suggest that the emergence of SVs from MVBs is under the control of some unique feature of TrkA<sup>+</sup> MVBs. Indeed, we found that inhibition of TrkA kinase activity in cell bodies using a selective chemical genetic approach caused TrkA<sup>+</sup> MVBs to behave similarly to transferrin<sup>+</sup>, BSA<sup>+</sup>, and CTB<sup>+</sup> MVBs, which do not give rise to SVs but instead rapidly sort to lysosomes. Moreover, cell-body-generated NGF signals partially rescued the rapid lysosomal fate observed for signaling-deficient TrkA<sup>+</sup> MVBs while TrkA signals emanating from the cell body had no effect on the behavior of MVBs carrying non-TrkA cargoes, suggesting that NGF/TrkA signaling can function both in cis and in trans to influence maturation of retrograde TrkA MVBs. Therefore, active TrkA signaling is required for the emergence of TrkA<sup>+</sup> SVs from MVBs and the prevention of precocious lysosomal sorting, both of which, we suggest, promote further TrkA signaling.</p><p>One effector protein preferentially associated with TrkA<sup>+</sup> endosomes in cell bodies, coronin, has been implicated in delaying lysosomal degradation of TrkA and promoting survival of sympathetic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Suo et al., 2014</xref>). We propose a TrkA signaling-dependent, endosome-autonomous, feedforward mechanism that augments and sustains retrograde NGF signal transduction within cell bodies, through TrkA<sup>+</sup> MVB and SV recruitment of coronin and possibly other TrkA effectors. Taken together, our findings reveal that MVBs mediate long-range axonal transport of active TrkA, MVBs function in the cell soma as signaling and sorting platforms that give rise to signaling competent SVs, and the nature of MVB cargoes dictates MVB function and fate. It is noteworthy that defects in endosome function in neuronal processes and soma have been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases and disorders with neurological manifestations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cosker and Segal, 2014</xref>). Moreover, dysfunction of early endosome activity has been implicated in several types of neurological disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cooper et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Salehi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Israel et al., 2012</xref>).

A plasmid containing the APEX2 cDNA was a gift from Alice Ting (Addgene plasmid # 49385). Individual cDNAs or fusion transgenes were cloned into the lentiviral vector FUW by In-Fusion cloning kit (Takara). Sequences of 21mer siRNAs against mouse Rab7 or RILP were obtained from TRC library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moffat et al., 2006</xref>). shRNA oligos were synthesized, annealed and cloned into the lentiviral pLLX vector as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhou et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>DNA plasmids were transfected into neuronal cells on DIV three using Lipofectamine 2000 (1 μg DNA: 4 μl Lipofectamine per well).</p><p>Lentivirus was generated, harvested and concentrated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Salmon and Trono, 2007</xref>). Neuronal cultures were infected on DIV three and experiments were performed 48 ~ 72 hr later.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Superior cervical ganglia (SCG) were dissected, fixed in 4% PFA at room temperature for 1 hr, and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose at 4<sup>◦</sup>C overnight. Individual ganglion was embedded in OCT (Tissue Tek) and sectioned at 10 μm. Tissue sections were rehydrated in PBS, blocked 5% serum and 0.05% TritonX-100 for 1 hr and incubated with primary antibodies at 4<sup>◦</sup>C overnight. The next day, sections were washed and incubated with fluorescent secondary antibodies for 1 hr at room temperature. After extensive wash, sections were mounted. Images were acquired by laser scanning confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM 700).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Neuronal cell culture</title><p>Sympathetic neurons were cultured as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sharma et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harrington et al., 2011</xref>). Briefly, SCGs harvested from P0-P4 mice were dissociated and plated in mass cultures or compartmentalized microfluidic devices. Neuronal cultures were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and NGF (50 ng/ml). Cytosine β-D-arabinofuranoside (AraC) was added from DIV 1–3 to eliminate proliferating fibroblast and glia cells. DRG sensory neurons were cultured as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huang et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>The Flag-TrkA endosome transport assay</title><p>The Flag-TrkA assay was conducted as follows: an anti-Flag antibody was applied to the distal axon compartment (DA) of the microfluidic chamber and cells were incubated for 45 min at 4<sup>◦</sup>C. Axons were washed extensively to remove unbound antibody and NGF was applied to the DA side. Cells were then incubated at 37<sup>◦</sup>C for indicated times to allow Flag-TrkA internalization, maturation and trafficking. To visualize internalized Flag-TrkA in distal axons, the DA compartment was washed with 0.5M NaCl/0.2M acetic acid to remove surface bound antibody prior to fixation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Immunocytochemistry</title><p>To visualize proteins associated endosomes, a 0.025% saponin wash was performed first for 2 min. Cells were then fixed with 4% PFA for 10 min, blocked in 0.05% saponin and 2% serum, and subjected to antibody staining. TrkA<sup>+</sup> neurons in DRG cultures were identified by TrkA immunostaining and only those neurons were counted for quantification. 16 bit Images were acquired at resolution 1024*1024 by laser scanning confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM 700).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Live cell imaging</title><p>To track Flag-TrkA endosome movement in real time, an anti-Flag antibody pre-conjugated to Alexa Fluoro secondary antibody was applied to the distal axon compartment during the 4<sup>◦</sup>C incubation step of the Flag-TrkA assay. Prior to imaging, culture medium was replaced by artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) that is phenol red free and CO<sub>2</sub> independent. Axons and cell bodies were imaged by spinning disk microscopy (Zeiss) at 37<sup>◦</sup>C in an environmental chamber at two frames per second (512 × 512 pixels) using a 63X oil immersion objective (1.40 NA). Time-lapse images were imported to ImageJ (NIH) and individual vesicles were tracked manually and analyzed by the MtrackJ plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Meijering et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Electron microscopy and APEX2 detection</title><p>To detect retrogradely transported Flag-TrkA, transferrin, CTB or BSA, an anti-Flag antibody pre-conjugated to Protein A-5 nm gold secondary antibody, transferrin-gold (6 nm), CTB-gold (6 nm) or BSA-gold (6 nm) was applied to distal axons during the 4<sup>◦</sup>C incubation step of the Flag-TrkA assay, respectively. After the transport assay, cells were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1M cacodylate buffer for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were then post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide, stained with 2% uranyl acetate and 2% tannic acid to enhance membrane contrast, dehydrated in series of ethanol followed by embedding in EPON resin. The next day, coverslips were removed and areas containing cells were randomly selected and mounted. Ultrathin sections (70 nm) were collected, stained with lead citrate, and were examined on a JOEL electron microscope.</p><p>To detect protein localization by APEX2 reaction, diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lam et al., 2015</xref>): after fixation, cells were incubated in a Tris buffer containing DAB (0.7 mg/ml) and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (0.7 mg/ml) for 15–40 min until the development of brown reaction product. Cells were then washed extensively to prevent further reaction. Samples were subjected to EM procedures as above. Staining with uranyl acetate, tannic acid and lead citrate was omitted to maximize EM contrast generated by DAB staining.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Immunoelectron microscopy</title><p>Flag-TrkA assay was performed as above. Cells were fixed in 4% PFA and 0.15% glutaraldehyde for 30 min. Cells were then washed with 0.1% sodium borohydride for 30 min at room temperature to quench excessive free aldehyde and blocked in PBS with 10% serum, 0.05% saponin and 0.5% gelatin for 2 hr. Cells were incubated in primary antibodies in blocking solution overnight. After extensive washing, cells were incubated with 10 nm gold secondary antibodies overnight and washed again. Cells were then processed for EM.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>The pulse-block assay</title><p>The Flag-TrkA assay was performed as above.

The cells were then subjected to ICC or TEM as above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Image analysis</title><p>For all quantifications, axon segments or cell body areas were randomly selected. Images were first background subtracted by the Rolling Ball method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sternberg, 1983</xref>) and then smoothed before further analyses in ImageJ.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Multivesicular bodies mediate long-range retrograde NGF-TrkA signaling&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Lee Francis (Reviewer #2). The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This interesting manuscript from Ye et al. examines the role of multivesicular bodies (MBVs) in long-range NGF/TrkA signaling. The manuscript details studies in which TrkA receptor signaling endosomes are a sub-type of multivesicular bodies, which are retrogradely transported, evade lysosomal fusion and evolve into TrkA-positive single-membrane vesicles that are capable of signaling. The cell biological and EM studies are clearly designed and the results make a significant contribution to our understanding of TrkA retrograde trafficking as it had been previously thought that Rab5<sup>+</sup> early endosomes mediate the retrograde propagation of TrkA signaling.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers cited two major concerns:</p><p>First, additional in vivo validation is needed to strengthen the conclusions. There is an EM showing a MVB in gold labeled with Flag antibody in the axon. It is critical to show several more representative images, more feeding time points 30' – 3 hours) and different regions of the axon (distal, intermediate and proximal).</p><p>Second, further details are needed to explain how the TrkA receptors in MVB's evolve into SV's in the cell bodies. It has been previously shown that retrogradely transported TrkA receptors fused to the plasma membrane in the cell body. It would be interesting to assess whether the TrkA in MVBs route to the plasma membrane prior to SVs. In addition, the abundance of the TrkA receptors in the intralumenal vesicles in relation to the endosomal limiting membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and higher mag panel) suggests that fusion of the MVB at the cell surface would result in the extracellular release of the majority of the MVB bound TrkA receptors. If so, the formation of SVs labeled with TrKA would require fusion of the exosome back to the cell surface and subsequent internalization of the receptor into the cell body. At the very least, these issues of topology and recycling and molecular diversification/maturation should be discussed to add more impact to the impact of the study.</p><p>Other revisions and statistical comments:</p><p>In addition to the major issues, several experimental points need attention:</p><p>1) Nocodazole treatment is an interesting approach but more controls are necessary. Does nocodazole effect TrkA movement in the soma or dendrites? Nocodazole may diffuse once inside the neuron. As alternative strategy, ciliobrevin can be used to stop dynein-mediated transport without the drawback of a widespread disruption of the MT cytoskeleton.</p><p>2) Previous work indicated the presence of retrogradely-transported Trks in membrane-containing organelles, such as autophagosomes (Kononenko et al., 2017, Nat Comm) and MBVs (Wang et al., 2016, Nat Comm). Please clarify the origin of TrkA<sup>+</sup> MBVs and their molecular identity in light of the presence of Rab7 and CD63 in both types of organelles. How can the data be reconciled with those obtained in cortical and hippocampal neurons, where size and proportion of retrogradely transported MBVs versus SVs, seem to be very different (Wang et al., 2016)? Likewise, discrepancies with the work of Claude et al., 1982 (e.g. density of cargoes in different compartments). Informative work on the trafficking of other Trk receptors (Terenzio et al. 2014 EMBO J; Terenzio et al., 2017 Neuron) may also contribute to the Discussion.</p><p>3) The contribution of Rab7-negative carriers (25%) to the retrograde transport and signalling is not discussed. Also in the kymograph of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> half of the moving carriers are Rab7-negative.</p><p>4) The effects of RILP KD on transport should be controlled by rescue with siRNA-resistant RILP and/or by expression of DN RILP fragments (e.g. RILP-C33).</p><p>5) The identification of lysosomes and MBVs is based on single-plane EM and/or the presence of markers (Rab7, CD63, Lamp1), with a broader distribution. Additional identification of these organelles is therefore recommended (i.e. degradative potential, acidic pH and presence of cathepsins).</p><p>6) Since some manipulations (e.g. Rab7 KD or blocking signalling) are severe, it would be crucial to include controls showing that under the conditions blocking TrkA<sup>+</sup> carrier movement, the axonal transport of other cargoes, e.g. mitochondria, remains intact.</p><p>7) Is there any effect in survival of sympathetic neurons depleted of Rab7 between P7 and P14? Can we explain the reduced number of pTrk and the decrease in synaptic markers at least partially by a reduction in survival?</p><p>8) What is the identity of the acidic compartments shown in the cell body? Then, it is not clear whether the cargoes present in those degradative organelles are generated from single-membrane vesicles rapidly sorted to lysosomal pathway or from acidification of the MVB/autophagosomes due to fusion with lysosomes. Since Tf appears to be rapidly segregated to different carriers than TrkB in distal axons, and given the fact that during the first hour ~50% of Tf is in MVBs, are different classes of MBVs also retrogradely transported?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2. C-E</xref>: what is the length of the feed here? 3 hours? Everything looks overexpressed and cytosolic in contrast to the immunostain. D: I would like to break Flag-Trk/rab co-transport out into anterograde versus retrograde. E: is the colocalization of flag and the gfp-rab correct? How was stationary versus movement judged (add to Materials and methods)? From the kymograph of rab5, most look stationary to me.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E, 3H</xref>. No necessity to use a magenta color mask. Please use grayscale to enhance contrast. 3I. Is there a reason to plot the number of cells with puncta, instead of the amount of punctate signal per compartmentalised cell?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>.

In every legend it is stated that a 'Tukey's post-hoc correction' was performed. Tukey's is actually a post-hoc test. Please amend.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>:</p><p>D) In order to get at the maturation of the SE, I'd like to see a more detailed time course on both the distal and proximal axon sides for all markers. Low overall rab11 staining is surprising given the high axonal levels observed in Acsano et al., 2009 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). How do you reconcile this?</p><p>F) Viruses in general and certainly overexpression of Rabs are known to disrupt membrane trafficking. It is important to compare Flag trafficking in uninfected versus infected controls quantifying retrograde, anterograde, and stationary endosomes. Additionally, throughout the paper virally overexpressed proteins seem blown out making the colocalization work not as convincing. A discussion of thresholding approaches and how overexpression is controlled for is important.</p><p>g) 80% Flag positive MVBs are reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> with EM is inconsistent with light microscopy -50% cd63<sup>+</sup>MVBs (also in E). Are not all cd63<sup>+</sup> carries MVBs? Please comment.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>:</p><p>A-E) These are really nice controls. cd63 seems quite overexpressed. In some of these pictures it would be hard not to find co-localization. Is this an expression or a thresholding issue? Doesn't the notion that loss of Rab7 doesn't impact flag co-localization with cd63 undermine the premise that rab7 is targeting SEs to MVBs? I would like to see a video in the rab7 KD.</p><p>J-K) The expression levels of RILP seems very cytosolic - could you also provide a video? Would be good to see some quantification for J. The expression/thresholding for these axons look dramatically different between control and shrab7--rilp/TrkA<sup>+</sup>. They also move only.5 micron per second, which is half the speed of what was previously reported (Lehigh et al., 2017).</p><p>J-M) Need to show single channels and that are less thresholded.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>.

I thought Tfn receptor was not in axons. If not, then this would not be receptor-mediated endocytosis and transport.</p><p>G) Too zoomed into see anything. Either color code, outline, or show more zoomed out image.</p><p>Supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>.

Controls for long-term (8h) fluidic isolation of MFCs should be provided (e.g. for 1NMPP1 experiments).</p><p>There is a need to be explicit in distinguishing the proportion of the receptor versus the proportions of carriers that corresponds to each organelle. Is not the same to say that &quot;most of TrkA is in MVBs&quot; and that &quot;most of the retrograde carriers of this receptor are MVBs&quot;.

To address this, we attempted injection of anti-Flag antibody to back hairy skin of <italic>TrkA<sup>FLAG</sup></italic> mice, however we were unable to detect a Flag signal in axons or cell bodies of DRG sensory neurons by immunohistochemistry and thus we did not attempt to visualize Flag-TrkA by EM in vivo. A systematic approach testing different labeling methods such as quantum dot-NGF is likely to be necessary to achieve this goal. This will be a focus of future studies.</p><p>Regarding in vitro visualization of Flag-TrkA endosomes in different compartments of neurons over time, we have included more representative images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>. After antibody feeding and at the onset of NGF application, gold-labeled Flag antibody is present only on the plasma membrane of distal axons. After five minutes, gold particles were found in single-membrane vesicles in the vicinity of the plasma membrane, most likely early endosomes. At 30 minutes post NGF application, gold particles were found in both early endosomes and MVBs in distal axons but not proximal axons or cell bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). At the 1 hr time point, the majority of gold particles in distal axons were found in MVBs. Importantly, only Flag-TrkA MVBs were observed in proximal axons and cell bodies in the cell body compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). At the 3 hr time point, the majority of gold particles in distal axons and proximal axons were found in MVBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). A mixture of Flag-TrkA single-membrane vesicles and MVBs were found in cell bodies, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. It should be noted that the quality of EM images for axons is often lower than that of cell bodies because of the presence of thick, electron-dense microtubule tracks which often obscure visualization of endosomal structures and gold particles.</p><p>We have reported these findings in the last paragraph of the subsection “Ultrastructural analysis of retrograde Flag-TrkA endosomes” and the data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref> of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, further details are needed to explain how the TrkA receptors in MVB's evolve into SV's in the cell bodies.

At the very least, these issues of topology and recycling and molecular diversification/maturation should be discussed to add more impact to the impact of the study.</p></disp-quote><p>In axons, we observed a small percentage of Flag-TrkA punctae (~8%) associated with Rab11, a marker for recycling endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D, E</xref>), suggesting that at least some of retrogradely transported TrkA receptors can be recycled back to plasma membrane.</p><p>As for retrogradely transported TrkA MVBs in cell bodies, our pulse block EM analysis showed that very few, if any, Flag-TrkA receptors in cell bodies are associated with single-membrane vesicles, which include early endosomes and recycling endosomes, or present on the plasma membrane before the 3 hr time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Furthermore, we never detected Flag-TrkA MVBs in close proximity to the plasma membrane by EM. Complementary immunocytochemical experiments using the same pulse-block paradigm under non-permeabilizing condition also showed no Flag signal on the plasma membrane at the 1 or 2 hr time points (data not shown). Thus, although we could not formally exclude the possibility of delivery of retrograde TrkA onto plasma membrane via MVB fusion, our data provide no evidence for the existence of such a process.</p><p>Between the 3 hr and 8 hr time points in our pulse-block EM analyses, the emergence of TrkA single vesicles could, theoretically, be formed via a route consisting MVB fusion with plasma membrane and exosome release, exosome fusion with plasma membrane and subsequent receptor internalization. If that were the case, internalized TrkA should follow the canonical endocytic pathway by sorting into Rab5<sup>+</sup> early endosomes. However, both our immunocytochemical and APEX2 EM results indicate a lack of Rab5<sup>+</sup> Flag-TrkA endosomes during this time period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, it is highly unlikely that the Flag-TrkA single vesicle population we observed in the pulse-block EM experiments is derived from exosomes.</p><p>Lastly, at the 3 hr time point in the pulse-block immunocytochemical experiments, ~13% of Flag-TrkA were Rab11<sup>+,</sup> suggesting their potential recycling route to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This percentage is similar to previously published results using the same Flag-TrkA endosome assay without the pulse-block treatment (Suo et al., 2014). Therefore, our findings suggest that a subset of retrogradely transported TrkA receptors may be recycled and potentially re-inserted to the plasma membrane, but this process is likely to be mediated by TrkA single vesicles formed de novo in cell bodies, not by MVB fusion with plasma membrane.</p><p>As requested, we have added a new paragraph addressing this point to the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other revisions and statistical comments:</p><p>In addition to the major issues, several experimental points need attention:</p><p>1) Nocodazole treatment is an interesting approach but more controls are necessary. Does nocodazole effect TrkA movement in the soma or dendrites? Nocodazole may diffuse once inside the neuron. As alternative strategy, ciliobrevin can be used to stop dynein-mediated transport without the drawback of a widespread disruption of the MT cytoskeleton.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge the concerns raised by the reviewers regarding the use of nocodazole. As seen in supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>, nocodazole treatment of the cell body compartment completely blocked retrograde Flag-TrkA movement in proximal axons and cell bodies as well as endocytic sorting of TrkA to lysosomes when anti-Flag antibody was directly applied to cell bodies. Importantly, nocodazole treatment of distal axons did not affect microtubule-dependent endosome formation and trafficking within the cell body compartment, indicating effective compartmentalization of transport blockade (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D, E</xref>). The sympathetic neurons in these experiments have few if any dendrites because extension of dendrites requires more than 10 days in this culture paradigm. This point is clarified in the second paragraph of the subsection “Retrogradely transported TrkA<sup>+</sup> endosomes in cell bodies evolve from MVBs into simple, single membrane vesicle structures and evade lysosomal sorting”.</p><p>We also attempted to use ciliobrevin (50 μM) in our initial experimental design as it is a potent inhibitor of dynein (Firestone et al., Nature, 2012). However, in our hands, it took ~ 45 minutes to completely halt retrograde movement of Flag-TrkA endosomes in axons following application of ciliobrevin. Similar kinetics have been observed in its application in cell cycle arrest and inhibition of axonal transport in sensory neurons (Firestone et al., Nature, 2012; Sainath et al., Dev. Neurobio., 2014). This time frame gave more than a “pulse” of retrograde Flag-TrkA and confounded our EM time-course analyses because of the presence of continuously incoming TrkA MVBs within cell bodies after the initial time point. In contrast, retrograde transport was fully blocked after less than 15 minutes of nocodazole application.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Previous work indicated the presence of retrogradely-transported Trks in membrane-containing organelles, such as autophagosomes (Kononenko et al., 2017, Nat Comm) and MBVs (Wang et al., 2016, Nat Comm). Please clarify the origin of TrkA<sup>+</sup> MBVs and their molecular identity in light of the presence of Rab7 and CD63 in both types of organelles. How can the data be reconciled with those obtained in cortical and hippocampal neurons, where size and proportion of retrogradely transported MBVs versus SVs, seem to be very different (Wang et al., 2016)? Likewise, discrepancies with the work of Claude et al., 1982 (e.g. density of cargoes in different compartments). Informative work on the trafficking of other Trk receptors (Terenzio et al. 2014 EMBO J; Terenzio et al., 2017 Neuron) may also contribute to the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Rab7 and CD63 proteins are known to be associated with MVBs, late endosomes and late endosome/lysosome fusion intermediate structures (Pols MS., Exp. Cell. Res. 2009) and there are discrepancies and inconsistencies in the literature regarding the definition of a particular type of endosome based on its ultrastructure or molecular features. These discrepancies prompted us to evaluate the identity of retrograde TrkA endosomes by both light and electron microscopy using the same in vitro Flag endosome transport assay in sympathetic neurons to minimize technical and biological variation. Our EM analyses showed that nearly all retrogradely transported Flag-TrkA resides within MVBs that are devoid of mature late endosome and lysosome features such as increased electron density and a multi-laminar ultrastructure, nor do they contain irregular-shaped intraluminal structures typically associated with autophagosomes. These observations suggest that Flag-TrkA MVBs are likely to be a subset of Rab7 or CD63<sup>+</sup> endosomes.</p><p>The differences between this study and others addressing TrkB endosomes are most likely due to the very different techniques and neuronal populations used, and potential differences between TrkA and TrkB. In our hands, TrkA trafficking in DRG sensory neurons is similar to what we have observed in sympathetic neurons: MVBs are the major retrograde carrier of TrkA in axons, and Rab7 plays an essential role in retrograde TrkA transport in both cell types in vitro. However, although we favor the idea that technical differences account for differences in our findings and those reported in cortical and hippocampal neurons with a different Trk receptor, the nature of retrograde TrkA endosomes and underlying mechanisms could be different for TrkB endosomes in CNS neuronal populations. This point is now discussed in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The contribution of Rab7-negative carriers (25%) to the retrograde transport and signalling is not discussed. Also in the kymograph of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> half of the moving carriers are Rab7-negative.</p></disp-quote><p>From our co-localization analyses, retrogradely transported TrkA is also associated with early endosomes, recycling endosomes and lysosomes, albeit only very small percentage of endosomes. Knockdown of EEA1, a major protein for early endosome function, abolished retrograde transport but also prevented formation of TrkA MVBs in distal axons (data not shown). We plan to study the roles of each of these types of endocytic compartments for the initiation of retrograde transport and signaling in the future.</p><p>Live imaging of Flag-TrkA movement was performed in proximal axon regions where axons often bundle together. Our interpretation is that not every axon expresses the labeled endosomal marker proteins because the infection efficiency is less than 100% and therefore Flag-TrkA in these axons is not always associated with fluorophore-tagged endosomal markers. This point is clarified in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The effects of RILP KD on transport should be controlled by rescue with siRNA-resistant RILP and/or by expression of DN RILP fragments (e.g. RILP-C33).</p></disp-quote><p>We used a pool of five shRNAs for the knockdown experiments, which minimized potential off-target effects. Also, our immunocytochemical and live imaging results, taken together, indicate that RILP is a key effector downstream of Rab7 that mediate retrograde TrkA movement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The identification of lysosomes and MBVs is based on single-plane EM and/or the presence of markers (Rab7, CD63, Lamp1), with a broader distribution. Additional identification of these organelles is therefore recommended (i.e. degradative potential, acidic pH and presence of cathepsins).</p></disp-quote><p>To address this point, we attempted to measure the pH of retrograde CD63<sup>+</sup> Flag-TrkA endosomes using LysoSensor, as described in (Ouyang et al., Neuron, 2014). However, due to extensive spectrum overlap needed for four-channel imaging (LysoSensor-blue, LysoSensor-yellow, CD63 and Flag-TrkA), we were unable to reliably measure the acidity of TrkA MVBs. We hope to address this issue in future studies using a more advanced fluorophore tagging system to better understand the biochemical and molecular properties of retrograde TrkA endosomes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Since some manipulations (e.g. Rab7 KD or blocking signalling) are severe, it would be crucial to include controls showing that under the conditions blocking TrkA<sup>+</sup> carrier movement, the axonal transport of other cargoes, e.g. mitochondria, remains intact.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is an important point. We found that Rab7 knockdown did not affect mitochondria movement in axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G</xref>). We have added this finding to the last paragraph of the subsection “Rab7 mediates retrograde TrkA transport and signaling in vivo and in vitro” and the data are now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G</xref> of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Is there any effect in survival of sympathetic neurons depleted of Rab7 between P7 and P14? Can we explain the reduced number of pTrk and the decrease in synaptic markers at least partially by a reduction in survival?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that a survival defect may contribute to the apparent loss of synaptic markers and their colocalization in the in vivo experiments. To test whether there is a survival-independent role of Rab7 in the development of sympathetic circuit, we plan to compare <italic>Th<sup>CreER</sup>; Rab7<sup>f/f</sup>; Bax<sup>+/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Th<sup>CreER</sup>; Rab7<sup>f/f</sup>; Bax<sup>-/-</sup></italic> animals in the future. We have noted this possibility in the fourth paragraph of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) What is the identity of the acidic compartments shown in the cell body? Then, it is not clear whether the cargoes present in those degradative organelles are generated from single-membrane vesicles rapidly sorted to lysosomal pathway or from acidification of the MVB/autophagosomes due to fusion with lysosomes. Since Tf appears to be rapidly segregated to different carriers than TrkB in distal axons, and given the fact that during the first hour ~50% of Tf is in MVBs, are different classes of MBVs also retrogradely transported?</p></disp-quote><p>As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> and correctly stated by the reviewers, we never observed retrogradely transported transferrin and TrkA localized to the same MVB, despite robust labeling with both types of gold particles. These findings support the idea that transferrin and TrkA segregate to distinct populations of MVBs in distal axons which then undergo retrograde transport and entry to cell bodies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2.

However, sympathetic neurons in our experiments do not have dendrites and we found that the transferrin receptor is present in axons of sympathetic neurons in vitro. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, we found that newly internalized transferrin, in both distal axons and cell bodies, is associated with the transferrin receptor. Second, we blocked receptor-mediated endocytosis in distal axons through inhibition of dynamin, which is required for ligand-dependent internalization of the transferrin receptor, and assessed whether internalization of transferrin is perturbed in distal axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Compared to the DMSO vehicle control, treatment of Dyngo, a dynamin inhibitor, completely abolished internalization of transferrin, but not BSA, which is internalized by fluid-phase endocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).
