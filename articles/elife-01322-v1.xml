The radiation interacts with aqueous solutions to produce reactive forms of oxygen, which then cause the damage. A range of mechanisms exist to moderate and/or repair this damage, with certain species being able to tolerate extraordinary levels of radiation. The bacterium <italic>D. radiodurans</italic>, for example, can survive radiation levels that are over 1000 times higher than the levels that can kill human cells.</p><p>The molecular basis of high-level resistance to ionizing radiation is not well understood, and several mechanisms have been proposed. Recent work has focused on passive mechanisms that are based on changes in cellular levels of certain small molecules that prevent damage by reactive forms of oxygen molecules.</p><p>Now, based on experiments on <italic>E. coli</italic>, Byrne et al. demonstrate that active mechanisms, involving adaptations in the cellular DNA repair systems, can bring about dramatic increases in radiation resistance. The experiments were performed on populations of <italic>E. coli</italic> cells that had been subjected to an evolutionary selection for extremely high resistance to ionizing radiation. This involved exposing the <italic>E. coli</italic> cells to ionizing radiation that killed most of the population, and then growing up the survivors. Many repetitions of this process led to a population of cells with a resistance that was comparable to that of the bacterium <italic>D. radiodurans.</italic> The same evolution experiment was carried out four times, generating four separate populations of bacteria that were resistant to ionizing radiation.</p><p>Byrne et al. sequenced the genomes of the <italic>E. coli</italic> after 20, 40 or 50 rounds of the selection process, and compared mutations found in the four separate evolved populations. This showed that nine genes were particularly prone to mutations. Together, these genes had roles in repairing and copying DNA sequences, in decreasing damage caused by reactive forms of oxygen, and in manufacturing the molecular wall that shields cells.</p><p>To assess the importance of the mutations in the nine genes, Byrne et al. took Founder cells from the initial population of <italic>E. coli</italic> cells–which were not resistant to ionizing radiation–and introduced the very same mutations, one at a time. Then the mutations that had the largest positive effects on resistance to ionizing radiation were combined. Introducing particular mutations into three DNA repair genes resulted in the highest aggregate levels of resistance. Finally, evolved <italic>E. coli</italic> cells that were already resistant were made more sensitive to radiation by repairing the same individual mutations. Again, the biggest change was observed with the DNA repair genes. Indeed, repairing the mutations in just the three DNA repair genes completely removed the radiation resistance.</p><p>The next step is to determine how the properties of the mutated proteins change, and how those changes lead to radiation resistance. Also, there are clues in the work that suggest the presence of additional ways for cells to become radiation resistant, and these remain to be explored.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01322.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01322.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>DNA repair</kwd><kwd>ionizing radiation</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>extremophile</kwd><kwd>mutation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM32335</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cox</surname><given-names>Michael M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Department of Energy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DEFG0201ER63151, CSP2009.796601</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Battista</surname><given-names>John R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Experiments on <italic>E. coli</italic> show that multiple mechanisms contribute to extreme resistance to ionizing radiation in bacteria, with mutations to three genes for DNA repair having a prominent role in one evolved population.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ionizing radiation (IR) is encountered humans in the form of medical X-rays and tumor irradiation, and very rarely in the context of nuclear power plant malfunction. The study of organisms with extreme resistance to IR has received increasing attention as a potential source of mechanistic insights that might permit the modulation of IR resistance in cells. <italic>Deinococcus radiodurans</italic>, which can absorb IR doses in excess of 5 kGy without lethality (over 1000 times the lethal dose for humans), has become a key model organism for understanding this phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cox and Battista, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blasius et al., 2008</xref>). Mainly through the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), IR can lead to the damage of protein, DNA, and all other cellular macromolecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sonntag Cv, 2005</xref>). Ongoing research into the molecular basis of extreme IR resistance has suggested three potential classes of mechanisms. These are (A) a condensed nucleoid structure, which could potentially facilitate DNA repair processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zimmerman and Battista, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Levin-Zaidman et al., 2003</xref>), (B) an enhanced capacity for amelioration of protein damage, which could protect DNA repair systems and make them more readily available following irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Daly, 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Daly, 2009</xref>), and (C) potential specialized pathways for DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zahradka et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cox and Battista, 2005</xref>).</p><p>The amelioration of protein oxidation has received extensive experimental support as a mechanism to account for much if not all of the observed IR resistance in <italic>D. radiodurans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Daly et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Slade and Radman, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Krisko and Radman, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Daly, 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Daly, 2009</xref>). Increases in cytosolic antioxidant capacity, particularly an increase in the cellular Mn/Fe ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Daly et al., 2004</xref>), appear to make the major contributions. Increasing the Mn/Fe ratio limits the Fenton chemistry that produces ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Krisko and Radman, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Daly, 2012</xref>). The hypothesis that the condensed nucleoid of <italic>Deinococcus</italic> facilitates efficient DNA repair has been questioned, since the presence of condensed nucleoids does not correlate reliably with radiation resistance in bacterial species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zimmerman and Battista, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Repair of IR-induced DNA damage is clearly important to survival. However, the constellation of DNA repair functions in <italic>D. radiodurans</italic> is unremarkable by bacterial standards. <italic>D. radiodurans</italic> and other IR resistant species appear to have approximately the same toolbox of DNA repair pathways as non-resistant species. Thus, the argument has been advanced that specialized DNA repair plays little or no role in IR resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Daly, 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">2009</xref>). Instead, antioxidants prevent protein oxidation and render the classical DNA repair systems more readily available to correct the effects of IR.</p><p>Bacteria are being used in long-term laboratory experiments that have elucidated many aspects of evolutionary biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barrick et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hindre et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Elena and Lenski, 2003</xref>). Directed bacterial evolution can be used as a tool to determine the molecular underpinnings of adaptation to a stress or a new environment. Does IR resistance always arise via enhanced protection of otherwise commonplace DNA repair proteins from oxidative inactivation? Alternatively, can a special facility for DNA repair or some other mechanism make a significant contribution to this extremophile phenotype?</p><p>In an earlier study, we demonstrated that the naturally IR sensitive bacterium, <italic>E. coli,</italic> could acquire an extreme IR resistance phenotype by directed evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harris et al., 2009</xref>). In brief, we carried out 20 rounds of selection, with each round consisting of IR exposure sufficient to kill ∼99% of the population, followed by outgrowth. The experiment was carried out four times, generating four separately evolved populations (IR-1-20, IR-2-20, IR-3-20, and IR-4-20). In the evolved populations, survival at 3000 Gy was typically increased by 3–4 orders of magnitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harris et al., 2009</xref>). We reported genomic sequences from seven isolates of IR-1-20, one from IR-2-20, and one from IR-3-20. Genetic alterations in the evolved strains were quite numerous (within the range of 40–80 per isolate), suggesting a complex and somewhat variable pattern of genetic innovation. None of the isolates in that study had mutator phenotypes relative to the Founder strain, although it is possible that mutators appear and thrive in the various populations for periods during the many cycles of selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harris et al., 2009</xref>). An approximately fivefold variation in levels of resistance to IR was evident in a screen of 62 separate isolates from population IR-1-20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harris et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>It remained for us to determine which of those mutations underlay the increase in radiation resistance, and what each of them might contribute. If amelioration of protein oxidation uniquely explains high level IR resistance in bacteria, then the mutations that contribute substantially to the phenotype might follow a fairly predictable pattern. We now provide a greatly expanded analysis involving many additional evolved isolates. The results reveal multiple contributions to IR resistance as well as the detailed molecular basis of the phenotype in one isolate.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sequencing of multiple isolates from evolved populations reveals different evolutionary paths to IR resistance</title><p>In the present study, we augmented the earlier data with the complete genomic sequences of 13 new isolates from populations IR-2-20, IR-3-20, and IR-4-20. In addition, we examined the complete genomic sequences of nine isolates derived from either 20 or 30 rounds of further evolution of CB1000, an isolate derived from IR-1-20. We note that IR resistance in this more highly evolved population (IR-CB1000-30) was impossible to measure accurately. The cells in this population grew more slowly than the Founder, but growth continued during irradiation at 6 Gy/min (John R Battista, unpublished data).

mutational spectrum of the population is inferred based on the genetic alterations observed in the subset of strains sequenced.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p>One straightforward pattern noted in the earlier study was continued. The only genetic change that is universal to all strains sequenced is deletion of the e14 prophage, a defective lambdoid prophage that is 15.4 kb in length. The deletion of occurs early, within the first three rounds of selection for IR resistance (EA Wood and JR Battista, unpublished data), and it makes a significant contribution (an approximately 10-fold increase in survival at 3000 Gy) to the overall IR resistance phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harris et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Population IR-1-20 has a particularly complex population structure and is strikingly different from the IR-2-20 and IR-3-20 populations. Outside of the e14 deletion, there are no mutations shared by all seven of the IR-1-20 isolates. There are three groupings of mutations in subsets of the clonal isolates that reflect clonal interference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gerrish and Lenski, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Perron et al., 2012</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rozen et al., 2002</xref>) in this population (JR Battista, unpublished results). In contrast, isolates from the IR-2-20 and IR-3-20 populations each exhibit a number of mutations (23 in IR-2-20 and 30 in IR-3-20) that are present in all seven isolates from their respective populations, and are effectively fixed. The apparent fixation of a mutation in one of these populations may reflect its importance to the phenotype. Alternatively, this may reflect a genetic bottleneck at some stage in the evolution of these populations, and speaks to the close relationship of the isolates.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Identification of mutations contributing to IR resistance in IR-2-20</title><p>To identify the mutations that are most likely to contribute to the IR resistance phenotype, we focused on genetic alterations that exhibited the following criteria: (I) the mutation is present in all or most isolates sequenced in at least one population, (II) the mutated gene was a prominent mutational target in at least one other sequenced population or mutations are found in genes in the same operon or pathway in other populations. Application of the second criterion requires data that was unavailable in our earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harris et al., 2009</xref>), and provides a pattern implicating a particular mutation in the acquisition of an extreme IR resistance phenotype. This criterion also assumes that there is a significant level of phenotypic parallelism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hindre et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Futuyama, 1986</xref>) between the independently evolved populations. <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> summarizes the results of applying these criteria, with nine altered genes or systems meeting these two criteria.

We thus set out to define the genetic basis of the observed IR resistance in one representative isolate. We focused on the isolated strain CB2000 from the IR-2-20 population for several reasons. First, CB2000 is one of the most radiation resistant of the isolated strains from the original evolved populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harris et al., 2009</xref>). Second, it is particularly well characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harris et al., 2009</xref>; and this study). Third, it was isolated from a population that lacks any sign of clonal interference, allowing us to focus on patterns present in a relatively simple population. Finally, the patterns of mutations we highlight below overlap patterns that are evident in other populations, making CB2000 a good barometer of mechanisms by which radiation resistance evolved in many of our strains.

IR resistance can be increased—dramatically—by functional enhancement and/or adaptation of existing DNA repair enzymes. Although classical DNA repair systems may be shared widely in different IR resistant and IR sensitive bacterial species, those DNA repair systems are biologically malleable. Classical DNA repair pathways can adapt to facilitate more efficient repair when cells are exposed to high levels of IR. In our evolved isolates, adaptations to DNA repair, involving genetic alterations in well-studied enzymes that are present in most bacterial species, represent a substantial and sometimes the dominant adaptation that contributes to the IR resistance phenotype. In one well-characterized isolate, three mutations—all in DNA repair functions—largely account for the increase in IR resistance.</p><p>The metabolic profile of our cells indicates that the evolved strains possess little or no unusual gene expression, metabolite concentration, or metal ion adaptations when they first encounter irradiation. We acknowledge that irradiation may lead to an alteration of the profile of genes induced in the IR resistant isolates, and those isolates may thus adapt to the challenge of irradiation more rapidly. In CB2000, changes in the <italic>rsxB</italic> gene might bring about some significant and beneficial changes in the IR response. However, in the case of CB2000, it is clear that changes to DNA repair genes—not regulatory genes—play the major role in the observed IR resistance.</p><p>The complement of DNA repair systems present tend to be quite similar from one bacterial species to another, but they are not identical. The differences, some subtle and some significant, inevitably reflect the lifestyle and environment that applies to each species. Whereas <italic>Deinococcus radiodurans</italic> has a fairly standard set of DNA repair functions (Daly, MJ, 2012), there are important distinctions in both the relevant gene catalogue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cox and Battista, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blasius et al., 2008</xref>) and the mechanisms used to recover from exposure to high levels of ionizing radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Slade et al., 2009</xref>). In the present study, we directly demonstrate that genetic innovation involving the cellular DNA repair systems can directly contribute, and contribute substantially, to the acquisition of extreme resistance to ionizing radiation.</p><p>Nevertheless, we emphasize that there are other effects clearly evident in the data. Evolution of a complex extremophile phenotype, such as extreme resistance to ionizing radiation, has no single molecular explanation. There are multiple paths; multiple mutations affecting multiple cellular systems make significant contributions. The mutational patterns suggest that improvements in the amelioration of protein oxidation, as first pointed out by Daly et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Daly et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Slade and Radman, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Krisko and Radman, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Daly, 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">2009</xref>), may also play a role in some of the evolved populations. Although that role appears to be relatively minor in CB2000, it may well predominate in one or more of the other populations. Given the genes affected, any mechanisms contributing to the amelioration of protein oxidation in these isolates may be somewhat different than those described to date for <italic>D. radiodurans</italic>.</p><p>We note that the mutations to DNA repair genes might, in principle, simply render the protein products of those genes less vulnerable to oxidation. This does not appear to be the case for the changes we observe in the <italic>recA</italic> gene. We have characterized the proteins encoded by the <italic>recA</italic> gene variants described in this report (JR Piechura and MM Cox, unpublished data), particularly the RecA D276A and D276N mutant proteins. In brief, the altered RecA proteins nucleate filament formation more rapidly and extend those filaments more slowly than the wild-type protein, leading to larger numbers of shorter filaments. Those same proteins function better as shorter filaments, and are less sensitive to inhibition by ADP. In general, the proteins exhibit functional alterations that are easily rationalized in the context of a recombinational system that must simultaneously deal with large numbers of double strand breaks in cells where metabolic processes might be compromised.</p><p>Contributions to the extreme IR resistance phenotype by additional biochemical processes appear likely, and remain to be explored.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial strains used in this study</title><p>All strains used in this study are <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 derivatives and are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1D</xref>.

To further evolve the CB1000 isolate, 1 ml of mid logarithmic phase liquid culture grown in LB was placed into two 1.5 ml plastic tubes. One was archived at −80°C, and the other was exposed to IR (<sup>60</sup>Co source from a Shepherd model 484 irradiator; 19 Gy/min). After irradiation, appropriate dilutions were plated to estimate survival. The balance of the irradiated culture was used to inoculate fresh LB broth. Survivors were grown to stationary phase (12–18 hr) and the protocol was repeated. The administered radiation dose was adjusted to allow approximately 1% survival after 1 day at 37°C, with the dose increasing as radio-resistance increased. Survivors at the end of 20 and 30 rounds of irradiation constitute a population of cells, designated IR-CB1000-20 and IR-CB1000-30, respectively. Single colony isolates from both populations were isolated and designated with the prefix ‘CB’. All archived populations and strains were stored at −80°C with 15% vol/vol DMSO added as cryoprotectant.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>High-throughput sequencing using an Illumina instrument</title><p>New evolved isolates described in this study, were sequenced at the Joint Genome Institute, Walnut Creek, CA, as detailed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harris et al., 2009</xref>). We used Illumina-based next generation sequencing that typically generates very low error levels in bacterial genome sequencing. SNP calls required their presence in at least three reads. Typically, the SNPs were based on 50–150 reads. To estimate error levels, the sequence alignments for one dataset (CB2004) were examined manually. Since this is a haploid genome, loci which contained multiple alleles (a mixture or reference and ‘variant’ alleles) are indications of alignment errors or sequence specific errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nakamura et al., 2011</xref>) and were not called as SNPs No false positives were identified in the manual examination and we estimate their appearance at rates of &lt;2%. If reads can be aligned to multiple locations in the genome, their exact placement is ambiguous and assigned a map quality score of zero (MQ = 0). It is not possible to call SNPs in regions that contain only MQ = 0 reads and false negative calls are potentially present. Approximately, 100,000 bp of the genome was covered by only MQ = 0 reads, and thus the potential for false negatives extends over about 2.2% of the genome.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>IR survival assay</title><p>Cells from a fresh single colony of each strain were cultured in Luria–Bertani (LB) broth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Miller, 1992</xref>) at 37°C with aeration. After growth overnight, cultures were diluted 1:1000 into 10 ml fresh LB broth in 125 ml flasks and grown at 37°C with shaking until an optical density (OD<sub>600</sub>) of ∼0.2 was reached. Each culture was incubated on ice for 5 min before a 1 ml sample was transferred to an eppendorf tube and irradiated in a Mark I <sup>137</sup>Cs irradiator (from JL Shepherd and Associates, San Fernando, CA, USA) for a time corresponding to 3 kGy (∼7 Gy/min). Irradiated samples as well as the non-irradiated control samples for each culture were diluted appropriately, and plated on LB 1.5% agar medium to determine the total number of colony forming units (CFUs). Percent survival was calculated by dividing the titer of the surviving population by the titer of the non-irradiated control sample. Initial cell densities ranged from 2 to 6 × 10<sup>7</sup> CFU/ml (average 4 × 10<sup>7</sup> CFU/ml). For each strain, 3–5 biological replicates were carried out.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>IR survival competition assays</title><p>Cells from a fresh single colony of each strain were cultured in LB broth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Miller, 1992</xref>) at 37°C with aeration. After growth overnight, competition cultures were started by inoculating 10 ml fresh LB broth with 35 μl of competition <italic>Ara</italic>+ and Ara<sup>−</sup>strains in 125 ml flasks and grown at 37°C with shaking until an optical density (OD<sub>600</sub>) of ∼0.2 was reached. Each competition culture was incubated on ice for 5 min before a 1 ml sample was transferred to an eppendorf tube and irradiated in a Mark I <sup>137</sup>Cs irradiator (from JL Shepherd and Associates, San Fernando, CA) for a time corresponding to 2 kGy and 3 kGy (∼7 Gy/min). Irradiated samples were diluted appropriately, and plated on TA plates to determine the total number of surviving red and white colony forming units. A non-irradiated control sample for each competition culture was diluted and plated to determine the titer of each culture and the percent Ara+ vs Ara<sup>−</sup>cells before irradiation. For each competition, three biological replicates were carried out. Percent survival was calculated by dividing the titer of the surviving population by the titer of the non-irradiated control sample, for both <italic>Ara</italic>+ and Ara<sup>−</sup>strains. Selection rate, r, also referred to as log(advantage), was calculated as log(N<sub>1(IR)</sub>)/(N<sub>1(No-IR)</sub>) − log(N<sub>2(IR)</sub>)/(N<sub>2(No-IR)</sub>), where N<sub>1(No-IR)</sub> and N<sub>2(No-IR)</sub> represent the initial densities of the two competing strains before IR treatment, and N<sub>1(IR)</sub> and N<sub>2(IR)</sub> represent the corresponding densities after IR exposure. Normally, in a direct competition experiment, plates with fewer than 20 colonies of either competitor are usually excluded to reduce the effect of outliers caused by low counts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Breed and Dotterrer, 1916</xref>). However, because the differences in fitness after IR treatment is so great between CB2000 Ara<sup>−</sup>and CB2000 wtRecA wtDnaB wtYfjK and between Founder Δe14 Ara<sup>−</sup>and Founder Δe14 RecA D276N DnaB P80H YfjK A151D, it was virtually impossible to retrieve at least 20 colonies of the sensitive strains in a range that we could also use to calculate the density of the resistant strains. The selection rates in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> are approximate, because there were less than 20 colonies counted on plates for the sensitive strains. However, the trend that we show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> is strongly conserved. By reverting the three mutations in DNA metabolism genes, CB2000 loses virtually all of its IR resistance. We report in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> that when treated with 2000 Gy, CB2000 Ara− has <italic>at least</italic> a two log fitness advantage over CB2000 wtRecA wtDnaB wtYfjK and inversely, Founder Δe14 Ara- RecA D276N DnaB P80H YfjK P80H has at least a two log advantage over Founder Δe14. Because their sensitivities to IR were so similar, we did not have a problem with retrieving more than 20 colonies for each strain in the competition of Founder Δe14 and CB2000 wtRecA wtDnaB wtYfjK. Rather, CB2000 wtRecA wtDnaB wtYfjK had less than a half log advantage (less than threefold) over Founder Δe14, again illustrating the importance of mutations in these three genes for extreme radiation resistance.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>RNA-seq</title><p>This method is reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Croucher and Thomson (2010)</xref>.

Trimmed reads were mapped to the annotated CDSs of the reference genome (<italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 MG1655 m56 reference genome, RefSeq Accession Number NC_000913.2) with two mismatches allowed and 10 bases of each read were allowed to map beyond ORF boundaries. Expression was calculated independently for each duplicate sample. Any read that could be mapped to more than four locations was discarded. Genes encoding rRNA and tRNA transcripts were masked by removing their annotations from the reference genome prior to mapping so that did not affect normalization expression estimates of protein-coding genes.

Similarly, the author response typically shows only responses to the major concerns raised by the reviewers.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for sending your work entitled “Evolution of Extreme Resistance to Ionizing Radiation via Genetic Adaptation of DNA Repair” for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, Detlef Weigel, and 3 reviewers.</p><p>The editor and reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This paper extends previous findings from the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harris et al. (2009)</xref>, which described <italic>E. coli</italic> populations with unusually high tolerance to ionizing radiation (IR) generated through directional selection in the laboratory. Using genetic analyses, the authors show that three out of the 69 mutations found in one lineage account for most of the IR tolerance on top of the one found in the starting strain (with an e14 prophage deletion). All three mutations are involved in DNA repair and replication. The authors convincingly conclude that genetic innovations involving pre-existing DNA repair functions likely play a large role in the acquisition of unusually high IR tolerance.</p><p>Interestingly, the <italic>recA dnaB</italic> seems to be not more IR tolerant than the <italic>dnaB</italic> single mutant, although it is more resistant than the <italic>recA</italic> single mutant. This part of the work would, however, be more convincing if ALL possible single and double mutations in the founder and ALL possible and single reversions in the CB2000 strain were examined, completing the matrix shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>.</p><p>Additional major concerns that need to addressed during revision include following:</p><p>1) What are the false negative/false positive rates for mutation detection?</p><p>2) Throughout the manuscript, survival is always reported as fraction of the initial cell density. However, no mention is made of whether or not cell yields change over time. Do all mutant strains under all conditions always start at the same cell density? Someplace in the paper it is necessary to report actual CFU/ml measurements. Two strains might both experience 1% survival, but this is perhaps less meaningful it they start out at very different population densities.</p><p>3) Related to comment #1, there is another concern, based on the authors’ comments about population CB1000-30, which “continued” to grow during irradiation. The normal protocol is to grow cells to mid-log, then irradiate them in their culture medium, presumably at room temperature, and then sample. However, this one isolate continues to grow during this protocol. Does this mutant grow better under all conditions tested, e.g., at room temperature vs 37°C? Is there some link between this strains altered growth ability and its IR resistance?</p><p>4) The authors discuss the complex population structures of the evolved populations. Can they comment on the difference in IR resistance between members of the same population? Just how variable are these populations in general? The reviewers realize that only a subset of strains get sequenced, but they are curious as to the overall diversity of radio-resistance phenotypes.</p><p>5) In their discussion of the “genetic basis” of IR resistance, the authors focus on the role of repair mechanisms, among others, in their evolved strains.

Although generating an estimate of false positives and false negatives is not trivial, we tried to address this in the Materials and methods section, in a new section.</p><p><italic>2) Throughout the manuscript, survival is always reported as fraction of the initial cell density. However, no mention is made of whether or not cell yields change over time. Do all mutant strains under all conditions always start at the same cell density? Someplace in the paper it is necessary to report actual CFU/ml measurements. Two strains might both experience 1% survival, but this is perhaps less meaningful it they start out at very different population densities</italic>.</p><p>The CFU/mL for the cultures prior to irradiation were fairly consistent, as now detailed (with CFUs reported) near the end of the IR survival section of the Materials and methods section. The % survival was always measured relative to this measured starting level. IR-inflicted damage is a stochastic process. Small changes in the starting cell density should not affect the kinds and levels of damage inflicted as long as the cells are in log phase and thus in a similar metabolic state. We have previously shown (Harris 2009) that each of the four evolved populations highlighted in this study (IR-1-20, IR-2-20, IR-3-20, and IR-4-20) grow at the same rate, presumably because the outgrowth phase of each selection cycle would tend to select against any slow growers.</p><p><italic>3) Related to comment #1, there is another concern, based on the authors’ comments about population CB1000-30, which “continued” to grow during irradiation. The normal protocol is to grow cells to mid-log, then irradiate them in their culture medium, presumably at room temperature, and then sample. However, this one isolate continues to grow during this protocol. Does this mutant grow better under all conditions tested, e.g., at room temperature vs 37°C? Is there some link between this strains altered growth ability and its IR resistance</italic>?</p><p>These are extremely interesting questions that, unfortunately, we cannot answer at the moment. We note that CB1000-30 is not an isolate, but a rather complex population (derived from CB1000) that has been subjected to 30 additional cycles of irradiation-driven selection. The cells in this population have 3-4 times as many mutations as do the cells in the populations we focus on the most in this paper (as stated in the 2<sup>nd</sup> paragraph of the Results). We suspect that this population may either repair its DNA faster or may have lost some mechanism that normally constrains growth after damage, but a great deal of work would be needed to establish these or some other mechanism. The levels of radiation resistance in this more evolved population mean that delivering sufficient IR to kill 90% of the cells requires irradiation for many hours using the <sup>60</sup>Co source currently available. A higher dose rate may well constrain growth. We do not have the capacity to control temperature in the irradiator.</p><p>The evolved population CB1000-30 (one might call it “hyper-evolved” relative to the main evolved populations IR-1-20, IR-2-20, IR-3-20, and IR-4-20, although we have not used that term) has not been examined in detail, and is used here mainly to reinforce patterns seen in the main four evolved populations that we focus on in this paper. CB1000-30 actually grows slower than the Founder strain under all conditions when radiation is not present. Given that the outgrowth stages of each selection cycle would tend to select against slow growers, we think this slower growth is significant and may be associated with another genetic innovation that makes a substantial contribution to fitness with respect to IR resistance in these cells. This is an issue that we will be examining in ongoing work.</p><p><italic>4) The authors discuss the complex population structures of the evolved populations. Can they comment on the difference in IR resistance between members of the same population? Just how variable are these populations in general? The reviewers realize that only a subset of strains get sequenced, but they are curious as to the overall diversity of radio-resistance phenotypes</italic>.</p><p>There is indeed some variability. We reported on this to an extent in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harris et al. (2009)</xref>. There, we examined survival of 62 separate isolates of population IR-1-20 at 5,000 Gy, and found about a 5 fold variation in survival among these. This is now mentioned at the end of the penultimate paragraph of the Introduction.</p><p><italic>5) In their discussion of the “genetic basis” of IR resistance, the authors focus on the role of repair mechanisms, among others, in their evolved strains. Given that all of the strains sequenced have many more mutations than those shown to be causal for the resistance phenotype, I wonder if the basal mutation frequency of the evolved strains has changed with respect to the founder in the absence of IR? For example, is the spontaneous mutation frequency to rifampicin resistance the same in the founder vs evolved strains? Does this affect the “evolvability” of these strains under positive selection during the IR passage protocol</italic>?</p><p>In Harris et al., we reported that the strains examined in that study (including about a third of the isolates that are utilized in the current work) are not mutators as measured by a Rif reversion assay, and have no elevated level of mutation generation relative to the Founder. It is possible of course that mutators appear and flourish in the different populations for short times during the selection process. This is another question we are interested in exploring much more deeply in continuing work.</p></body></sub-article></article>
