In particular, X-ray synchrotron microtomography has been proved to be particularly useful for imaging anatomical structures in extant and fossil hominins that are traditionally observed through destructive histological methods (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Tafforeau and Smith, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Maggiano et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andronowski et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Mani-Caplazi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gunz et al., 2020</xref>). For instance, microscopic analyses of fossil craniodental specimens using synchrotron radiation have revealed previously unknown aspects of the ontogeny of extinct hominin taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Tafforeau and Smith, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gunz et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Besides its geological age of 3.67 million years, StW 573 (‘Little Foot’) is remarkable for its outstanding degree of preservation and completeness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Clarke and Kuman, 2019</xref>). The high-resolution virtual exploration of the ‘Little Foot’ skull is thus expected to provide new insights into the Pliocene <italic>Australopithecus</italic>’ biology. Here, we present preliminary results of our X-ray synchrotron-based investigation of the dentition and cranial bones of ‘Little Foot’. The main aim of our study is to identify and assess the degree of preservation of craniodental microstructures that could contribute to the reconstruction of <italic>Australopithecus</italic>’ biology. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that histological features of the compact bone of a Pliocene hominin skull have been non-invasively observed.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Histology of dental tissues</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows two dimensional (2D) sections through the roots of the upper right first molar with a resolution of 3.25 µm. These sections reveal the presence of cementum between the dentine and sediments filling the tooth alveolus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). The dentine–cementum junction and the boundary between the cementum and the sediments are clearly visible. Cementum microstructures, such as incremental lines, are discernible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Additionally, we reconstructed in three dimensions (3D) the enamel cap of the lower left canine using image stacks at 21.23 and 7.91 µm resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Lines and pits observable on the distal-buccal aspect of the 21.23-µm reconstruction are located at about 2.4 and 3.6 mm from the cemento-enamel junction, which represents 36% and 54% of the crown height, respectively. While fine details of the pits are clearly visible in the 3D reconstruction using synchrotron-based data sets at 7.91 µm, the color map reveals that they are slightly less clearly rendered in the 21.23-µm 3D reconstruction, especially on the mesial-buccal aspect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). These reductions in the normal thickness of enamel correspond to disruptions to the normal growth of enamel (i.e., hypoplasias) and indicate two disruptive events in StW 573’s life history.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>2D sections of the roots of the upper right first molar (<bold>A,B</bold>), of the cranial vault (<bold>C,D</bold>), and of the mandibular symphysis (<bold>E</bold>) of StW 573.</title><p>The close up (<bold>B</bold>) of the roots of the upper right third premolar shows the dentine–cementum junction.

The opening of the diploic channel through the inner table in the cranial vault could be identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The Haversian system is discernible in the outer and inner tables of the cranial vault (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>) and clearly visible in the compact bone of the mandible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> shows a 3D reconstruction of the canal network and branching and interconnections between the Haversian systems. Based on the terminology defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Maggiano et al., 2016</xref>, we identify a Type 2 (i.e., dichotomous) branching pattern. Furthermore, a linear transverse connection (i.e., Volkmann’s canal) can be observed. Vascular canals are proportionally more abundant close to the trabecular bone than in the rest of the compact bone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The Haversian canals globally lie parallel to the external surface.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Collectively, our results show that the virtual histological investigation of both dental and bone tissues in complete fossil hominin skulls by using high-resolution synchrotron radiation may be possible. Contrary to traditional histological analyses based on physical sections of the bone (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartsiokas, 2002</xref>) and imaging-based exploration of volumes of interest physically extracted from bones (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Maggiano et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andronowski et al., 2017</xref>), this method, as previously demonstrated in landmark papers for dental microstructures using dentognathic remains (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Tafforeau and Smith, 2008</xref>), offers the possibility of non-invasively investigating microscopic structures in complete crania that have deep implications for the ontogeny, physiology, biomechanics, and biological identity of fossil specimens.</p><p>More specifically, our observations reveal that ‘Little Foot’ preserves fine cementum microstructures that can be quantitatively explored. Because cementum is rarely remodeled during life, it may preserve valuable information about hominin paleobiology (rev. in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Tang et al., 2016</xref>). In particular, the incremental lines may be used to determine age-at-death as well as specific stress periods that might be related to life-history events (e.g., pregnancies) or diseases (rev. in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Tang et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, our high-resolution synchrotron images of the skull reveal the presence of enamel defects in ‘Little Foot’s' teeth. Enamel hypoplasias are indicators of physiological stress experienced during childhood and may be related to diseases or dietary deficiency/nutritional stress (rev. in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Guatelli-Steinberg and Huffman, 2012</xref>). Interestingly, enamel defects in StW 573’s lower left canine are found at the same distance of the cemento-enamel junction as in other <italic>Australopithecus</italic> lower canines from Sterkfontein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Guatelli-Steinberg, 2003</xref>). Our study thus further confirms that high-resolution synchrotron radiation may reveal very fine details of enamel defects, with substantial differences in the appreciation of hypoplasia between 21.23 and 7.91 microns of spatial resolution.</p><p>Additionally, the opening of the diploic vessels in the cranial vault of ‘Little Foot’ could be imaged. Since this structure may be involved in brain thermoregulation, future synchrotron-based 3D virtual reconstruction of the diploic network in early hominin skulls could be particularly useful for determining when and how the complex human-like thermal regulation system emerged (rev. in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bruner, 2017</xref>). In particular, such data would contribute to explore the potential correlations between large proportions of diploic bone in <italic>Australopithecus</italic> and related expansion of the diploic vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beaudet et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that histological features of the compact bone of a Pliocene hominin skull have been non-destructively observed. Since the microscopic organization of the compact bone may have age-related biological significance, the presence, identification, and characterization of such histological structures are of particular interest for determining the age-at-death of fossil specimens (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ericksen, 1991</xref>), particularly in combination with the dental markers discussed above. For example, the branching patterns identified in this study are also found in extant humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Maggiano et al., 2016</xref>). In the sample analyzed here, we could only identify one transverse connection, which confirms the advanced age of StW 573 since this type of branching is more common in young individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Maggiano et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Clarke and Kuman, 2019</xref>). Similarly, the spatial organization of the vascular canal network has been suggested to reflect functional adaptation throughout the individual’s life and/or growth rate in fossil long bones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ricqlès et al., 2000</xref>). Consequently, this histomorphological parameter represents a relevant proxy for evaluating the properties of the loading environment or developmental pattern in fossil specimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ricqlès et al., 2000</xref>). In our preliminary results, the vascular canals are more abundant close to the trabecular bone in the mandible of StW 573, which may indicate an area of intense bone remodeling, potentially in response of biomechanical loading. The fact that the vascular canals could be successfully reconstructed in 3D in the mandible of a 3.67-million-year-old fossil specimen such as ‘Little Foot’ reveals the invaluable contribution of synchrotron radiation in refining our knowledge of fossil hominin paleobiology at a histological level. For instance, a more comprehensive analysis of the compact bone microstructures should provide new insights into the evolution of the bone modeling/remodeling process, which is a fundamental aspect of bone functional adaptations in the human lineage. We might expect that, because of changes in the biomechanical environments (in the masticatory system but also in relation with locomotory adaptations), the organization of the Haversian system in the skeleton may have varied throughout the hominin lineage.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>X-ray synchrotron microtomography</title><p>We performed propagation phase-contrast synchrotron X-ray micro-computed tomography (PPC SXCT) at the I12 beamline of the Diamond Light Source, United Kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Drakopoulos et al., 2015</xref>). We used two setups to (1) image the full skull with an isotropic voxel size of 21.23 µm and (2) image regions of interest with an isotropic voxel size of 7.91 and 3.25 µm. PPC SXCT of the full skull was performed using the External Hutch Two of I12, providing the largest beam allowing for imaging the whole skull at once. The X-ray beam was set to a monochromatic energy of 140 keV (double bent Laue Si 111 monochromator). At the level of the detector, the beam size was 75.84 mm horizontally and 19.28 mm vertically. Projections were recorded using the large field of view indirect detector from I12 comprising a cadmium tungstate scintillator, 0.3× magnification optical lenses and two PCO.edge 5.5 sCMOS cameras (PCO AG, Kelheim, Germany). Complete imaging of the specimen consisted of 21 individual acquisitions, moving the specimen vertically each time by 10 mm, to use the brightest part of the beam providing an overlap of slightly over 50%, which was used later to increase the signal to noise ratio. The centre of rotation was shifted near the edge of the projection, effectively doubling the reconstructed field of view, by reflecting and assembling the complementary image sections as described. Each acquisition consisted of 9000 projections of 0.25 s each over a 360° rotation of the sample. Additionally, 50 flatfield images (sample out of the beam) were recorded before and after the series of acquisition as well as 10 dark images (X-ray beam off to record the noise of the camera). The regions of interest were scanned in I12 Experimental Hutch One using the beamline’s modular imaging system. This indirect detector consists of a PCO.edge 5.5 sCMOS camera and four user-selectable optical modules, each comprising a scintillator, 90-degree turning mirrors, and a visible light lens. We used modules 2 and 3 with a magnification of 0.820× and 2×, respectively, corresponding to a recorded pixel size of 7.91 µm and 3.25 µm, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Reconstruction</title><p>The full-skull images taken with the large field of view camera were reconstructed using prototype processing scripts implemented in Python and using the ASTRA library for the tomographic reconstruction step. The radiographs were pre-processed using X-ray noise removal, reference image ratio (flatfield correction), ring artifact suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Vo et al., 2018</xref>), and a low-pass phase-propagation-based filter (after <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Paganin et al., 2002</xref>). Tomographic reconstruction used the Filtered Back-Projection algorithm on a graphical processing unit (GPU) via the ASTRA library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ramachandran and Lakshminarayanan, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">van Aarle et al., 2016</xref>). The image data for the whole skull consisted of 21 individual, overlapping, vertical segments. Each segment was pre-processed and reconstructed with fine adjustment of the overlap determined by slice-by-slice comparison in the reconstructed images. Due to synchrotron beam loss during the pre-programmed scan, two segments had to be re-scanned subsequently resulting in small additional variations in the contrast for that segment.</p><p>The region-of-interest tomographs were reconstructed using the SAVU tomographic processing software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atwood et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Wadeson and Basham, 2016</xref>) developed at Diamond Light Source. In the reconstruction process, ringartifact removal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Vo et al., 2018</xref>) and autocentering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Vo et al., 2014</xref>) were applied, as well as distortion correction as necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Vo et al., 2015</xref>). The low-pass filter approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Paganin et al., 2002</xref>) was applied, and both filtered and unfiltered reconstructions were evaluated; the filtered output exhibits increased visible contrast between materials and decreased noise, but suffers some blurring of boundaries. Filtered back-projection reconstructions were performed using the Astra library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ramachandran and Lakshminarayanan, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">van Aarle et al., 2016</xref>), and the whole process was applied on an HPC cluster system using the SAVU tomography pipeline.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>2D and 3D observations</title><p>We focused our preliminary qualitative observations on the microstructural organization of the teeth and of the compact bone of the cranial vault and the mandible. We thus selected 2D sections from the high-resolution (i.e., 3.25 µm) X-ray volumes documenting structures of interest in (1) the roots of the upper right first molar, (2) the parietal eminence, and (3) the mandibular symphysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Moreover, we reconstructed in 3D (1) the enamel surface of the lower left canine (at 21.23 and 7.91 µm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and (2) the vascular canals preserved in the mandibular symphysis (at 3 µm, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) using the segmentation tools available in Avizo v9.0 (Visualization Sciences Group Inc). 3D reconstructions of the enamel cap of the lower left canine using the 21.23 and 7.91 µm scans were automatically aligned, and the distances between the two were mapped onto the enamel surface using the Avizo modules ‘Align surfaces’ and ‘Surface distance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beaudet et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was carried out with the support of the Diamond Light Source, instrument I12 (experiment MG21334-1).

Further the imaging techniques used permit non-destructive studies on fossil specimens and permits comparison to present day humans. In fact there is significant preservation of structure and function in this fossil specimen. The data further provides some insights into the stresses and hardships in the environment in which these early humans lived.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Preliminary palaeohistological observations of the StW 573 ('Little Foot') skull&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, including Carlos Isales as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Jack Yu (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a brief report of paleohistology, using micro CT, to examine the cranium and maxillary dento-alveolar complex (enamel, dentine, cementum and alveolar bone). The resolution was 3.25 micrometer, the specimen was fossilized Pliocene hominin, <italic>Australopihecus</italic> StW 573, &quot;Little Foot&quot;, from 3.67 million years ago. The images, mostly 2D with some 3D renditions, were of high quality , reconstructed using the Filtered Back-Projection Algorithm. This technical paper has considerable strengths. First, it confirms the ability of microCT to visualize histological features of fossilized specimens, such as the trabecular architecture, Haversian system, and dento-alveolar complex. Second, it demonstrates the detection of incremental lines in the cementum which correlate well with age of the individual. Finally, the article documents empanel hypoplasia, at the same distance from the cemento-enamel junction from another <italic>Australopithecus</italic> mandibular canines.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) The method, though fascinating, is not really new. The first Guatelli-Steinberg reference, for example, is from 2003. Because of that, simply introducing the methodology is not sufficient and the manuscript should contain other novel findings and their potential implications. Please discuss this aspect.</p><p>2) The author(s) pointed out some intriguing features but did not give any biological significance.</p><p>3) This paper is not the first time that histological features of compact bones were examined using microCT on Pliocene hominin skulls. 3.67 million years separate Homo sapient from <italic>Australopithecus</italic>. There are, no doubt, differences at the genetic and gross anatomical levels. What are the expected changes in histology, in any?</p><p>4) It would be helpful for the authors to provide more information on the physiological relevance of their findings and also how it compares to present day bone and tooth structure.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64804.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) The method, though fascinating, is not really new. The first Guatelli-Steinberg reference, for example, is from 2003.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this analysis of hypoplasia in fossil hominins in general, and in <italic>Australopithecus</italic> in particular, is not new. However, the idea of this paper is to insist on the fact that scanning a fossil hominin skull using the synchrotron technology not only provides information about the gross anatomy, but also about very fine structures, from increments in dental tissues (as illustrated in previous papers) to the cranial vascular system (as demonstrated here for the first time). The comparison with Guatelli-Steinberg, 2003, aims to reinforce the idea that this kind of information is crucial for the continuing development of the field of palaeobiology. Moreover, we did emphasis in the Introduction (and mentioned this again in the beginning of the Discussion in the revised version) that this technology has been previously used in palaeontology, but that we go further by imaging fine details of the compact bone from an entire cranium.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Because of that, simply introducing the methodology is not sufficient and the manuscript should contain other novel findings and their potential implications. Please discuss this aspect.</p></disp-quote><p>In the Discussion, we synthetized the main findings (increments of the cementum, hypoplasia, diploic vessels and Haversian system) and, for each of them, detailed biological implications. Moreover, we would like to emphasize that this is the first time that such tiny structural details of the compact bone could be reconstructed in 3D in a Pliocene hominin skull. This represents incredible potential for improved palaeohistological perspectives. We understand that this aspect should be further elaborated and have thus added further relevant information in the last paragraph of the Discussion. We also added a sentence in the introduction clarifying the aim of the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The author(s) pointed out some intriguing features but did not give any biological significance.</p></disp-quote><p>In the Discussion, we did present the biological significance of each feature explored in the study. In the second paragraph of the Discussion, we explained that increments in the cementum could be used to determine the age at death and stress periods that could be related to life-history traits. We also discussed the presence of hypoplasias, that could indicate important physiological stress such as disease or nutritional stress. In the third paragraph, we explained that the diploic system likely contributes to brain thermoregulation and, as such, could help us understand hominin brain evolution. The last paragraph is dedicated to the Haversian system. We added further information in the revised version so that the biological implications of this finding (i.e., bone modeling/remodeling) could be better emphasized.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) This paper is not the first time that histological features of compact bones were examined using microCT on Pliocene hominin skulls.</p></disp-quote><p>There were indeed previous studies applying synchrotron radiation to fossil hominin craniodental specimens (e.g., Carlson et al., 2011 Science; Le Cabec et al., 2015 PLoS One; Smith et al., 2015 PLoS One; Gunz et al., 2020), focusing on dental histological details and brain imprints. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the compact bone is investigated using synchrotron radiation in a Pliocene hominin skull. If not, we would be extremely grateful if the reviewer could provide relevant references.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.67 million years separate Homo sapient from <italic>Australopithecus</italic>. There are, no doubt, differences at the genetic and gross anatomical levels. What are the expected changes in histology, in any?</p></disp-quote><p>We absolutely agree that changes happened in the hominin lineage. In that respect, our experiment demonstrates that even microscopic changes in the biology of fossil hominins could be followed. Concerning the dental structures explored here, hypoplasias will indeed vary depending on the physical and social environments. The organization of the diploic vessels surely evolved with the brain. Changes in the Haversian system are more difficult to anticipate, as there is little information available at the moment about the organization of the vascular system at this scale in fossil hominins. We added a sentence regarding this aspect at the end of the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
