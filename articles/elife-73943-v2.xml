instability. Both the formation and repair of base damage occur in chromatin and are conceivably affected by DNA-binding proteins such as transcription factors (TFs). However, to what extent TF binding affects base damage distribution and BER in cells is unclear. Here, we used a genome-wide damage mapping method, <italic>N</italic>-methylpurine-sequencing (NMP-seq), and characterized alkylation damage distribution and BER at TF binding sites in yeast cells treated with the alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). Our data show that alkylation damage formation was mainly suppressed at the binding sites of yeast TFs ARS binding factor 1 (Abf1) and rDNA enhancer binding protein 1 (Reb1), but individual hotspots with elevated damage levels were also found. Additionally, Abf1 and Reb1 binding strongly inhibits BER in vivo and in vitro, causing slow repair both within the core motif and its adjacent DNA. Repair of ultraviolet (UV) damage by nucleotide excision repair (NER) was also inhibited by TF binding. Interestingly, TF binding inhibits a larger DNA region for NER relative to BER. The observed effects are caused by the TF–DNA interaction, because damage formation and BER can be restored by depletion of Abf1 or Reb1 protein from the nucleus. Thus, our data reveal that TF binding significantly modulates alkylation base damage formation and inhibits repair by the BER pathway. The interplay between base damage formation and BER may play an important role in affecting mutation frequency in gene regulatory regions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>BER</kwd><kwd>NER</kwd><kwd>MMS</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>mutagenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000066</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21ES029302</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wyrick</surname><given-names>John J</given-names></name><name><surname>Mao</surname><given-names>Peng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000066</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01ES032814</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wyrick</surname><given-names>John J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000066</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01ES028698</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wyrick</surname><given-names>John J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB 2028902</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Poon</surname><given-names>Gregory MK</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P20GM130422</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mao</surname><given-names>Peng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30CA118100</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Duan</surname><given-names>Mingrui</given-names></name><name><surname>Mao</surname><given-names>Peng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Transcription factor proteins play an important role in modulating base damage formation and excision repair at the binding sites in the genome.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>DNA in living cells is exposed to an array of genotoxic agents, both endogenous and exogenous. Alkylating agents comprise a large number of reactive chemicals present in cells and in the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fu et al., 2012</xref>), which can react with the nitrogen and oxygen atoms of DNA bases to induce formation of alkylation damage. Some alkylation damage is cytotoxic and mutagenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kondo et al., 2010</xref>), and thus poses threats to cell growth and genome stability. On the other hand, the cytotoxicity of DNA alkylation is utilized in chemotherapy. Alkylating agents such as temozolomide (TMZ) are used for the treatment of glioblastoma and other cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Newlands ES, Stevens MFG, Wedge SR, Wheelhouse RT, Brock C, 1997</xref>). Therefore, studies of alkylation damage and its repair are relevant for both cancer prevention and therapy.</p><p>The most common alkylation lesions are <italic>N</italic>-methylpurines (NMPs), including 7-methylguanine (7meG) and, to a lesser extent, 3-methyladenine (3meA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kondo et al., 2010</xref>). Although 7meG is not genotoxic by itself, it is prone to spontaneous depurination to form a mutagenic apurinic (AP) site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fu et al., 2012</xref>). 7meG can also form deleterious DNA–protein crosslinks with the lysine-rich histone tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). The 3meA damage is even more harmful than 7meG, as 3meA lesions block DNA polymerases and affect DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Plosky et al., 2008</xref>). Hence, NMP lesions need to be repaired in a timely manner to avoid detrimental outcomes such as cell death or mutations. The primary repair pathway for NMPs is base excision repair (BER), which is initiated by alkyladenine-DNA glycosylase (AAG; also known as MPG and ANPG) in human cells or its yeast ortholog Mag1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">O’Connor and Laval, 1991</xref>). During BER, AAG/Mag1 removes the alkylated base and generates an AP site, which is then cleaved by the apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (APE1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mol et al., 2000</xref>). Subsequently, DNA polymerase and ligase are recruited to the nick to conduct repair synthesis and ligation, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Krokan and Bjørås, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Transcription factors (TFs) are key proteins that regulate gene expression. Many TFs bind to DNA in a sequence-specific manner to direct transcription initiation to target promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jolma et al., 2013</xref>). While TFs mainly function in transcriptional regulation, their binding to DNA can affect DNA damage formation and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mao and Wyrick, 2019</xref>). To this end, several TF proteins have been shown to modulate formation of ultraviolet (UV) light-induced photolesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Frigola et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mao et al., 2018</xref>) and inhibit nucleotide excision repair (NER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Conconi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sabarinathan et al., 2016</xref>). The altered UV damage formation and suppressed NER are believed to cause increased mutation rates at TF binding sites in skin cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Frigola et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sabarinathan et al., 2016</xref>). Previous studies have also found that mutation rates are significantly increased at TF binding sites in non-UV exposed tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kaiser et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Melton et al., 2015</xref>), such as gastric and prostate cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Morova et al., 2020</xref>). However, what causes the high mutation rates in non-UV exposed cancers remains elusive. Since base damage (e.g. oxidative, alkylation, uracil, and so on) caused by endogenous and exogenous damaging sources is prevalently associated with cancer mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tubbs and Nussenzweig, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wallace et al., 2012</xref>), a potential mechanism for mutation elevation in non-UV exposed tumors is increased base damage formation and/or suppressed BER in TF-bound DNA. However, this hypothesis has not been tested and it is unclear to what extent TF binding affects base damage formation and BER.</p><p>Alkylation damage has been widely used as a model lesion for BER studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2015</xref>). We previously developed an alkylation damage mapping method, <italic>N</italic>-methylpurine-sequencing (NMP-seq), to precisely map 7meG and 3meA lesions in cells treated with methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mao et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we used NMP-seq to analyze alkylation damage formation and BER at the binding sites of ARS binding factor 1 (Abf1) and rDNA enhancer binding protein 1 (Reb1), two essential yeast TFs that have been extensively characterized. The genome-wide binding sites for Abf1 and Reb1 have been identified at near base-pair resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kasinathan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rossi et al., 2021</xref>) and the DNA-binding mechanisms were analyzed in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jaiswal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McBroom and Sadowski, 1994a</xref>). Analysis of our NMP-seq data indicates that both damage formation and BER are affected by TF binding in yeast cells. We further show that Reb1 protein binding directly inhibits BER of alkylation damage in vitro. Collectively, these analyses uncover an important role for TF binding in modulating base damage formation and inhibiting BER.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Abf1 and Reb1 modulate alkylation damage formation at their binding sites</title><p>NMP-seq is a sequencing method developed to map 7meG and 3meA lesions across the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mao et al., 2017</xref>). This method employs BER enzymes AAG and APE1 to digest MMS-damaged DNA and create a nick at the NMP lesion site, which is then ligated to adaptor DNA for next-generation sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). As NMP lesion sites are precisely tagged by the adaptor DNA, sequencing with a primer complementary to the adaptor generates a genome-wide profile of NMP lesions at single-nucleotide resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mao et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>To determine how TF binding affects NMP lesion formation, we analyzed initial NMP lesions at Abf1 and Reb1 binding sites in yeast immediately after 10 min MMS treatment (i.e. no repair incubation). The ongoing BER during the period of MMS exposure may repair some of the damage and affect analysis of NMP formation. To minimize the effect of endogenous BER, we used a BER-deficient <italic>mag1</italic> deletion strain (i.e. <italic>mag1Δ</italic>) to profile the initial NMP distribution. We obtained a total of ~44 million sequencing reads in MMS-treated <italic>mag1Δ</italic> cells. The majority of the reads (~56%) were associated with G nucleotides (G reads), followed by A nucleotides (A reads) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), consistent with the expected trend of 7meG and 3meA lesion formation after MMS treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Friedberg et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Since 7meG is the major class of lesion induced by MMS, we first characterized 7meG formation at Abf1 and Reb1 binding sites. To account for potential DNA sequence bias at the binding sites, we also mapped NMP damage in naked yeast genomic DNA, in which all proteins were removed and the purified DNA was damaged by incubating with MMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Normalization of cellular G reads by the naked DNA G reads enables us to elucidate the modulation of 7meG formation by TF proteins. Importantly, we found that formation of 7meG was significantly inhibited at Abf1 and Reb1 binding sites relative to the flanking DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). Analysis of the average 7meG levels in 5 bp non-overlapping moving windows indicates that 7meG was reduced by up to 40 and 70% for Abf1 and Reb1 binding sites, respectively, and the difference is statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Furthermore, the extent of damage reduction was correlated with the level of TF occupancy, as Reb1 binding sites with low occupancy (occupancy &lt;10) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kasinathan et al., 2014</xref>) only slightly reduced 7meG formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Formation of 7-methylguanine (7meG) lesions at ARS binding factor 1 (Abf1) and rDNA enhancer binding protein 1 (Reb1) binding sites.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Distribution of 7meG damage at 661 Abf1 binding sites and the flanking DNA in methyl methanesulfonate (MMS)-treated yeast cells.

Genomic DNA was first sonicated to short fragments (~400 bp) and ligated to the 1st adaptor (green). After blocking all free 3’-OH groups with terminal transferase and dideoxy-ATP (dd), DNA fragments were digested with AAG and APE1 to generate a new nick with a ligatable 3’-OH group at the NMP damage site. After denaturing to obtain single-stranded DNA, the new 3’ end is ligated to a splint adaptor (2nd adaptor; purple) and the ligation occurs exactly at the damage site. The biotin on the 2nd adaptor allows purification of ligation product with the Streptavidin beads. The purified product is used as the template for PCR amplification, using primers complementary to the 1st and 2nd adaptors. The resulting library is sequenced on an Iron Torrent sequencer using a sequencing primer complementary to the 2nd adaptor.

While damage formation was mainly suppressed in the core motif, we also saw increased 7meG levels (~1.5 fold) at a few positions (e.g. −7,–3, –2, and 0) at the edge of the Abf1 motif or between the two highly conserved regions within the motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Repeat of the NMP-seq experiment generated reproducible damage mapping data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) and showed inhibition of 7meG formation at Abf1 and Reb1 binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>).

Analysis of the published Reb1-DNA complex structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jaiswal et al., 2016</xref>) indicates that Reb1 protein binding causes a large curvature (~56°) in DNA and significantly compresses the minor groove near the –3 position.

Repair analysis was conducted by normalizing 7meG lesions at each time point to the initial 7meG damage (i.e. 0 hr repair). This analysis considers the variable amounts of initial damage along the motif sequence, which can conceivably impact remaining damage after repair. The normalization (i.e. damage after repair/initial damage) results in fraction of remaining damage, which is inversely correlated with DNA repair activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mao et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Our analysis indicates that repair of 7meG lesions was strongly suppressed at both Abf1 and Reb1 binding sites in wild-type (WT) cells, shown by peaks of unrepaired damage at 1 and 2hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) near the TF binding midpoint. The repair suppression is mediated by TF binding, not the underlying DNA sequence, because no repair inhibition was observed at ‘low-occupancy’ Reb1 binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, F</xref>). Additionally, nucleosomes around the TF binding sites play an important role in affecting 7meG repair. Fast repair was observed in the nucleosome-depleted region around the TF binding site and linker DNA between two adjacent nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In contrast, slow repair was found near nucleosome peaks, which is consistent with previous studies showing inhibition of BER at the nucleosome dyad center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kennedy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mao et al., 2017</xref>). These data indicate that BER is affected by the combined effects of TF binding and nucleosome positioning. Analysis of the remaining damage at single-nucleotide resolution confirmed repair inhibition and further indicated that repair was suppressed in an ~ 20–30bp DNA region for Abf1 and ‘high-occupancy’ Reb1, but not for ‘low-occupancy’ Reb1 binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G-L</xref>).

As both Abf1 and Reb1 are essential for yeast survival and cannot be knocked out, we used the published Anchor-Away strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Haruki et al., 2008</xref>) to conditionally and rapidly export the protein from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. We then performed NMP-seq experiments in the TF-depleted yeast strains to analyze 7meG formation and repair. Both Abf1 and Reb1 anchor-away strains (Abf1-AA and Reb1-AA) were generated and used to study their impacts on gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kubik et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kubik et al., 2015</xref>).

Moreover, growth of Abf1-AA or Reb1-AA strain was inhibited on rapamycin-containing plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), confirming that nuclear depletion of either protein is lethal for yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kubik et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In the control strain (WT-AA), in which no target protein is tagged for depletion, analysis of the NMP-seq data indicates that 7meG damage formation was still suppressed at the conserved motif sequences upon rapamycin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that rapamycin itself had little effect on NMP damage formation. However, TF depletion in Abf1-AA or Reb1-AA cells restored damage formation at their corresponding binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Instead, BER was faster at Abf1 binding sites relative to the flanking DNA in Abf1-AA cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), likely because these binding sites are located in nucleosome-depleted regions and damage is efficiently repaired by BER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mao et al., 2017</xref>). Repair in the surrounding nucleosomes was also affected by Abf1 depletion (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, C</xref>), potentially due to the weakened nucleosome organization around Abf1 binding sites in Abf1-AA cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kubik et al., 2018</xref>), further supporting that BER is affected by TF binding and the accompanying chromatin organization.

Although the sequence at +4 position is not conserved in the Reb1 motif, the Reb1–DNA crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jaiswal et al., 2016</xref>) shows that this position is directly contacted by the DNA binding domain of Reb1 protein.</p><p>The strong repair inhibition at the + 4 position led us to further investigate BER using an in vitro system. To simulate 3meA repair at the Reb1 binding site, we incorporated a stable AAG substrate, inosine (denoted as I), at the + 4 position of the motif strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Inosine can naturally arise from adenine deamination in cells and is repaired by AAG-mediated BER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alseth et al., 2014</xref>).

Using a UV damage mapping method cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer sequencing (CPD-seq), we previously showed that formation of UV-induced CPDs is significantly suppressed at Abf1 and Reb1 binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mao et al., 2016</xref>). To investigate NER of CPDs at Abf1 and Reb1 binding sites, we analyzed CPD-seq data generated in UV-irradiated yeast cells. We found that repair of CPDs at 2 hr (normalized to CPDs at 0 hr) was inhibited at both Abf1 and Reb1 binding sites in WT cells, shown by high levels of unrepaired CPDs at the binding sites relative to the flanking nucleosome-occupied DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A, B</xref>). As both Abf1 and Reb1 binding sites are localized in gene promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), transcription-coupled NER (TC-NER) may play a role in the removal of CPDs in transcribed regions surrounding the binding sites.

A comparison between CPD and 7meG repair indicates that GG-NER was inhibited in a broader DNA region at Abf1 and Reb1 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E, F</xref>). While BER (i.e. 7meG repair) was inhibited in ~ 30 bp DNA surrounding the center of the binding motif, inhibition of GG-NER was extended by an additional 10 bp on each side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E, F</xref>). These high-resolution sequencing data demonstrate the difference between BER and GG-NER at TF binding sites, which is consistent with the different mechanisms underling NER and BER (see Discussion).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we used MMS-induced damage as a model lesion and analyzed base damage distribution and BER at the binding sites of yeast TFs. Our high-resolution damage mapping data revealed an important role for TF binding in modulating initial damage formation and inhibiting BER. As base damage (e.g. oxidative, alkylation, uracil, and AP sites) has long been recognized as an important source of DNA mutations in human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maynard et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tubbs and Nussenzweig, 2017</xref>), the interplay between TF binding, base damage formation, and BER revealed by our study has important implications for understanding mutations in gene regulatory regions.</p><p>Our data shows that TF binding can significantly modulate NMP damage formation. Depending on the location and the conservation level in the binding motif, TF binding can both suppress and elevate damage levels. The highly conserved nucleotides in the core motif of both Abf1 and Reb1 binding sites mainly suppressed NMP damage formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). NMP damage is formed via the chemical reaction between the alkylating agent and individual nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fu et al., 2012</xref>). Due to protein–DNA interactions, nucleotides with restrained reactivity with MMS will be less sensitive and thus generate reduced amounts of damage. The highly conserved nucleotides in the Abf1 and Reb1 motifs are directly contacted by specific amino acids of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jaiswal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McBroom and Sadowski, 1994a</xref>). This suggests that Abf1 and Reb1 reduce the reactivity of the bound nucleotides, thus protecting conserved parts of the core motif from alkylation DNA damage. The protective role of TFs does not seem be specific for alkylation damage. UV damage formation was also reported to be suppressed by TF binding in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mao et al., 2016</xref>) and human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Frigola et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, TF binding may function as an important mechanism in cells that protects conserved regulatory sequences from being damaged and mutated.</p><p>A few specific positions in the Abf1 motif exhibit elevated 7meG formation. Moreover, we also found a specific 3meA hotspot in the Reb1 motif. While the detailed mechanism for elevated alkylation damage formation is unclear, previous studies of UV damage formation revealed that TF binding-mediated DNA structural change plays a critical role in dictating damage yields. Indeed, human ETS (E26 transformation-specific) TFs have been shown to change the DNA geometry at their binding sites and cause individual UV damage and mutation hotspots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Elliott et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mao et al., 2018</xref>). Yeast Abf1 protein has been shown to bend DNA toward its minor groove (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McBroom and Sadowski, 1994b</xref>). DNA bending caused by Abf1 may expose certain bases in the motif and increase their reactivity with MMS, resulting in elevated damage yields.</p><p>The published complex structure of Reb1 (from <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>) with DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jaiswal et al., 2016</xref>) provided an opportunity to investigate how TF–DNA interactions could modulate alkylation damage distribution and BER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The DNA-binding domain (DBD) of Reb1 winds around two turns of duplex DNA as a series of four helix-turn-helix (HTH) domains, forming a so-called “saddle”-shaped structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Two homologous HTH domains, termed MybAD1 and MybAD2, are followed by two homologous repeat domains MybR1 and MybR2. C-terminal to the DBD is a transcription termination domain (TTD) that is not essential to DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jaiswal et al., 2016</xref>). Within the central core of the Reb1 consensus (<named-content content-type="sequence">5’-GG<underline>G</underline>TAA-3’</named-content>; the underlined G is position 0), positions +2–0 (i.e., GGG) are directly bound by both MybAD2 and MybR1 and exhibit significantly reduced 7meG formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Positions –1 to –3 (i.e. TAA) are sandwiched between the subsites for MybAD1 and MybAD2, which insert recognition helices into the adjacent DNA major groove. As a result, the minor groove from positions –1 to –3 is strongly compressed in width and increased in depth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). These results suggest that preferential formation of 3meA at position –3 may be facilitated by enhanced minor groove narrowing and DNA curvature by Reb1 binding. As expected, the strong binding of DBD leads to significantly slower BER kinetics in the central core, as shown by little change of 7meG damage levels after 1 or 2 hr repair compared to the initial damage at 0 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). In addition to the core motif, the structural data indicates that nucleotides in the flanking DNA are bound by the Reb1 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jaiswal et al., 2016</xref>). Consistently, BER in the flanking regions (e.g. –12 to –4 and +4 to +12) was also inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Although Abf1–DNA complex structure data is currently unavailable, it is conceivable that Abf1 also binds to both the core motif and part of the flanking DNA. The strength of protein–DNA interaction in the flanking DNA may not be as high as in the core motif, which still allows damage formation to occur, but it considerably reduces the access of BER enzymes, particularly in DNA immediately adjacent to the core motif. As BER is generally inhibited in TF-bound DNA, damage hotspots induced by TF binding cannot be efficiently repaired and may eventually cause individual mutation hotspots when DNA is replicated. Considering the conserved damage formation and repair mechanisms between yeast and human cells, our findings provide a potential explanation to mutation hotspots at TF binding sites in non-UV exposed tumors. Moreover, recent studies suggest that AAG-mediated BER pathway plays a direct role in affecting RNA Pol II transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Montaldo et al., 2019</xref>). This, in combination with mutations at TF binding sites, may affect gene expression in cells exposed to alkylating agents.</p><p>The comparison between NMP and CPD repair at TF binding sites provides new insights into how TFs affect BER and NER differently. While TF binding inhibits both BER and NER, we found that the affected DNA region is considerably broader in NER compared to BER. NER is inhibited in about 50 bp DNA centered on the midpoint of Abf1 or Reb1 binding sites, whereas BER is suppressed in a narrower DNA region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The extended inhibition region in NER is consistent with more proteins being involved in NER compared to BER and more stable multi-protein complex assembled on DNA for NER. Moreover, NER requires repair endonucleases to cleave upstream of the 5’ side and downstream of the 3’ side relative to the lesion, releasing a repair intermediate of ~ 25 nt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huang et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schärer, 2013</xref>). Although UV damage located outside of the TF binding site may be recognizable by the damage recognition factor such as XPC or yeast Rad4, one of the two repair cleavage sites may still be located within the binding motif and is inaccessible to the repair endonuclease. Hence, the unique ‘dual-incision’ mechanism of NER is consistent with the broader repair-resistant DNA region around a TF binding site compared to BER.</p><p>In summary, we generated high-resolution alkylation damage and BER maps at yeast TF binding sites, which allows us to elucidate how TF binding modulates base damage formation and repair. Considering the potential connection between base damage, BER, and mutations in non-UV exposed tumors, these analyses provide important insights into cancer mutations frequently elevated at TF binding sites.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains</title><p>WT and <italic>mag1Δ</italic> strains were in the BY4741 background.

The gel was exposed to a phosphor screen and imaged using a Typhoon FLA7000 scanner and quantified by ImageQuant.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Structural analysis</title><p>The co-crystal structure of <italic>S. pombe</italic> Reb1 with terminator DNA that harbors a core consensus 5’-GGGTAA-3’ (PDB: 5eyb) was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jaiswal et al., 2016</xref>).

Analysis of NMP-seq data at Abf1 and Reb1 ChIP-exo peaks and flanking regions showed strongly inhibited BER after 2 h repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, left and middle panels), consistent with analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> using the ORGANIC binding data.

The authors provide a series of well-executed and designed high-resolution sequencing data demonstrating that transcription factor (TF) binding perturbs alkylation base damage formation as well as inhibits its repair via base excision repair (BER) at TF binding sites. Moreover, they demonstrate differences between nucleotide excision repair and BER at TF binding sites that are consistent with the different repair mechanism of these two pathways. These results should have an important and timely impact on the field.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Bennett Van Houten (Reviewer #1); Amy Whitaker (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The results presented in this study provide an important new information on the effects of two transcription factors on formation and repair of damage at hundreds of binding sites within the yeast genome. The manuscript is well-written, although the way some of the experimental results were split in the main text and supplemental figures made the overall manuscript a bit cumbersome to read through. The authors also missed an opportunity for a nice summary figure showing high resolution mapping of lesions and repair kinetics within the Reb1 binding sites.</p><p>1) Reproducibility and statistics. The entire manuscript seems to be absent of statistical analysis. Please indicate the number of times each experiment was performed and how reproducible these data are from experiment to experiment. Finally, even within an experiment when hundreds of binding sites are compared what is the mean and S.D. around each point, what is the significance of 40% and 70% changes over a 5 bp window and a 1.5 increase at specific bases. What is the most appropriate statistical test to assess these differences? This type of deep dive into one data set is essential (perhaps described in a supplemental data section) to understand whether differences in repair which are presented are truly significantly different.</p><p>2) All reviewers recommend significant reorganization of the manuscript along the lines listed below:</p><p>– The validation studies using ORGANIC and Chip-Exo would be better shifted into the supplemental materials.</p><p>– Repair kinetics: The authors state on line 157 repair incubation (e.g. 1 and 2 h repair), but almost every figure legends in the main text indicates a 2 hr recovery periods were used to compare, however 1 hr data is reported in the supplement. Why break up the data in this way, and not show the kinetics of repair from 0, 1, and 2 all on the same graph or try to actually get a rate constants for removal based on these three time points? Also high resolution frequency initial damage is given, but then repair kinetics are often compared over broader regions.</p><p>Admittedly it is beyond the scope of this already demanding set of experiments to get high accuracy on precise repair kinetic profiles, but their subsequent analysis of repair kinetics was grouped by first looking at nucleosome-depleted regions and then suggesting that the slower repair within these regions are within the Abf1 and Reb1 binding position. Why did the authors change the comparison between Figure 1 and Figure 4? Could not individual high resolution repair kinetics be followed in a similar manner as the frequency distributions at base pair resolution? Then in Figure 5 the authors seems to us the high resolution matrix approach for the two TF binding sites to examine repair for 3meA. Why put the work-up of the +4 position of Reb1 high occupancy which showed slower kinetics in the supplement?</p><p>– As part of the enhancing the Discussion section, where specific structural details of the TF binding interactions are reviewed, it would be extremely informative and helpful to the high-resolution base-pair studies within the Reb1 binding sites. As long as these differences are statistically valid and real then showing the high-resolution damage mapping AND repair kinetics within the binding site from a co-crystal structure in a final summary figure would be elegant and helpful. For example, the structure shown in S3 C and D showing both a plot of damage frequencies and rates of removal would be extremely informative.</p><p>– Because of data presented Figure 6 regarding the inhibition of repair of UV-induced damage flanking the TF binding sites, the manuscript title is too limited and undermines the broad significance of this work and a more inclusive title discussing both types of damage and repair pathways could be included, for example, something like, &quot;High resolution mapping demonstrate inhibition of DNA excision repair pathways by transcription factors&quot;. Clearly the effect of TF repair inhibition of UV-induced damage should be mentioned in the abstract as well.</p><p>– Improve clarity throughout the manuscript which data sets were used to determine binding sites and TF binding, and which for damage site analysis.</p><p>3) Figure 1 – Analysis of alkylated DNA bases immediately after the MMS exposure should be performed also in WT cells both to strengthen the manuscript that further primarily uses WT strain as well as to achieve adequate normalization to naked DNA isolated from WT cells. This requires additional experimentation.</p><p>4) Figure 2C (pg 8, line 166-167) – Authors indicate with respect to the high and low occupancy of Reb1 sites that &quot;The repair suppression is mediated by TF binding, not the underlying DNA sequence…&quot;. However, at those sites that nucleosome occupancy appears also to be markedly different and thus could potentially impact repair efficiency. This, as well as in general the combined effects of both TF binding and accompanying chromatin organization (e.g. Figure 3A and 3C), should be further discussed.</p><p>5) Figure 4 – While the results indicate clear specific accumulation of alkylated bases in the promoter regions of Abf1 and Reb1 target genes, the impact of impaired repair on the expression of these genes should be tested. Specifically, since recent works suggested that AAG-BER and BER in general can influence gene expression. The author may want to consider additional experimentation and/or discussing this limitation of their data.</p><p>6) Figure 5E – BSA should be used as a negative control in reactions without Reb1 to make sure that the effect is not driven simply by increased overall protein concentration. This could be combined with the effort to present results of at least three independent experiments in Figure 5F. This requires additional experimentation.</p><p>7) Figure 4 and 5 – Analysis of Abf1 and Reb1 in promoters of certain target genes should be analyzed directly and after the MMS treatment.</p><p>8) Figure S7C – Result should be quantified.</p><p>Additional points</p><p>These require text changes only.</p><p>9) pg. 14 – While inosine is a stable AAG substrate, it is not a direct analog of 3meA. This should be corrected.</p><p>10) Authors are encouraged to cite more the original works instead of review articles e.g. pg.3 &quot;During BER, AAG/Mag1 removes the alkylated base and generates an AP site, which is then cleaved by the apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (APE1) (Whitaker and Freudenthal, 2018).&quot;</p><p>11) Figure 3: Can the authors explain why the regions more distant from the TF binding sites (i.e. -500 to -200 and 200 to 500) have reduced repair in the Reb1-AA and Abf1-AA cells compared to the WT-AA cells?</p><p>12) Figure S6 – indicate in the figure legend which data used for Abf1 and Reb1 binding.</p><p>13) The authors compare differences between BER and NER mechanisms that support their finding that TF binding inhibits a larger region of DNA for NER. One point worth considering adding is that BER factors only form transient interactions with one another, as opposed to NER which is thought to form a more stable multi-protein complex on the DNA and thus would likely have a larger overall DNA footprint during repair.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73943.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Reproducibility and statistics.

We then analyzed mean and S.D. of 7meG reads from the five bins. The statistical significance was analyzed by paired t tests of 5-bp moving windows as well as at each single nucleotide. These analyses showed significantly changed 7meG within the binding motif relative to the flanking DNA with p values &lt; 0.05.

Clearly the effect of TF repair inhibition of UV-induced damage should be mentioned in the abstract as well.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good suggestion and will broaden the scope of this study. We have changed the title to “High-resolution mapping demonstrates inhibition of DNA excision repair by transcription factors”. Repair inhibition of UV damage is mentioned in the abstract.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Improve clarity throughout the manuscript which data sets were used to determine binding sites and TF binding, and which for damage site analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>To clarify, we used ORGNIC TF binding sites for most of our analysis, except for the ChIP-exo validation, which used the ChIP-exo binding sites. We have now moved the ChIP-exo part to Supplemental Materials and methods to reduce the confusion. Additionally, we revised the Materials and methods section in the main manuscript to clarify that all analysis was conducted using the ORGANIC data.</p><p>For NMP-seq datasets, we used data generated in different yeast strains, including WT, <italic>mag1</italic> mutant, and anchor-aways. We have explained which strain was used in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 1 – Analysis of alkylated DNA bases immediately after the MMS exposure should be performed also in WT cells both to strengthen the manuscript that further primarily uses WT strain as well as to achieve adequate normalization to naked DNA isolated from WT cells. This requires additional experimentation.</p></disp-quote><p>The WT-0 h library was sequenced in parallel with the WT-1 h and 2 h repair time points, but was not used in the original version of the manuscript. We have now revisited the WT-0 h data and generated a new supplemental figure (Figure 1 — figure supplement 5). Analysis of WT-0 h data (normalized to naked DNA) shows a very similar damage formation pattern as in the <italic>mag1</italic>-0 h, suggesting the endogenous repair does not remove a significant portion of damage during the 10minute MMS treatment time. We have revised the Results section on page 7, to mention the WT-0 h data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 2C (pg 8, line 166-167) – Authors indicate with respect to the high and low occupancy of Reb1 sites that &quot;The repair suppression is mediated by TF binding, not the underlying DNA sequence…&quot;. However, at those sites that nucleosome occupancy appears also to be markedly different and thus could potentially impact repair efficiency. This, as well as in general the combined effects of both TF binding and accompanying chromatin organization (e.g. Figure 3A and 3C), should be further discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>This comment raises a good point that the combination of TF binding and chromatin organization modulates BER. We have expanded the discussion on how the chromatin organization affects repair at high and low Reb1 sites (page 9) and in the anchor-away yeast strains (page 12) in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 4 – While the results indicate clear specific accumulation of alkylated bases in the promoter regions of Abf1 and Reb1 target genes, the impact of impaired repair on the expression of these genes should be tested. Specifically, since recent works suggested that AAG-BER and BER in general can influence gene expression. The author may want to consider additional experimentation and/or discussing this limitation of their data.</p></disp-quote><p>We have followed this suggestion to expand the Discussion (page 20). This expansion discusses potential effects of the unrepaired alkylation damage, mutations caused by the unrepaired damage, and BER enzymes, on gene expression. While this manuscript is focused on damage and repair and does not directly address gene expression, we are interested in investigating this important topic in a future study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 5E – BSA should be used as a negative control in reactions without Reb1 to make sure that the effect is not driven simply by increased overall protein concentration. This could be combined with the effort to present results of at least three independent experiments in Figure 5F. This requires additional experimentation.</p></disp-quote><p>All repair reactions, including naked DNA without Reb1, were done in the presence of 100 µg/ml BSA. This is now communicated more clearly in the methods section relevant to our in vitro experiments (page 27).</p><p>We purified new Reb1 protein and performed the in vitro repair experiments three more times. The quantification data from four independent repeats, showing the average repair rates and S.D., is now included in a new Figure 5F. All the original unedited repair gel images are also submitted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figure 4 and 5 – Analysis of Abf1 and Reb1 in promoters of certain target genes should be analyzed directly and after the MMS treatment.</p></disp-quote><p>We consulted with the reviewing editor and confirmed that this comment is about DNA damage/repair at Abf1 and Reb1 binding sites in promoters of individual target genes. We have added new gene-by-gene heatmaps to demonstrate 7meG damage in each target gene in a supplemental figure (Figure 4 —figure supplement 1), which showed correlation between BER inhibition and TF binding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure S7C – Result should be quantified.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now quantified the gels and the quantification data is added to the figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional points</p><p>These require text changes only.</p><p>9) pg. 14 – While inosine is a stable AAG substrate, it is not a direct analog of 3meA. This should be corrected.</p></disp-quote><p>We corrected it in the main text on page 15.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Authors are encouraged to cite more the original works instead of review articles e.g. pg.3 &quot;During BER, AAG/Mag1 removes the alkylated base and generates an AP site, which is then cleaved by the apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (APE1) (Whitaker and Freudenthal, 2018).&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this reminder and have updated the citation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Figure 3: Can the authors explain why the regions more distant from the TF binding sites (i.e. -500 to -200 and 200 to 500) have reduced repair in the Reb1-AA and Abf1-AA cells compared to the WT-AA cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We think two mechanisms can potentially contribute to the reduced repair in Reb1-AA and Abf1-AA cells. First, both Reb1 and Abf1 are general regulatory factors (GRFs) and regulate expression of many yeast genes (Chasman et al., 1990; Miyake et al., 2004). Depletion of them from the nucleus likely affects gene expression, including DNA repair genes. Second, it has been shown that Abf1 and Reb1 cooperate with the chromatin remodeling complex, RSC, to establish accessible chromatin to facilitate transcription (Kubik et al., 2018). The less accessible chromatin and disrupted chromatin organization in the anchor-away cells may reduce repair efficiency considerably.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Figure S6 – indicate in the figure legend which data used for Abf1 and Reb1 binding.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now indicated in the figure legend that the NMP-seq data generated in WT-2 h cells was used. Repair was analyzed in genes linked with Abf1 and Reb1 binding sites mapped by the ORGANIC method (Kasinathan et al., 2014).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) The authors compare differences between BER and NER mechanisms that support their finding that TF binding inhibits a larger region of DNA for NER. One point worth considering adding is that BER factors only form transient interactions with one another, as opposed to NER which is thought to form a more stable multi-protein complex on the DNA and thus would likely have a larger overall DNA footprint during repair.</p></disp-quote><p>We have mentioned the more stable NER complex on DNA as an additional mechanism for the larger repair inhibition region in Discussion (page 21).</p><p>References:</p><p>Chasman DI, Lue NF, Buchman AR, LaPointe JW, Lorch Y, Kornberg RD. 1990.
