therapeutic effect in treating HER2<sup>+</sup>HR<sup>+</sup> breast cancer; however, the underlying molecular mechanism remained elusive. Through the drug sensitivity test, the drug combination efficacy of pyrotinib, tamoxifen, and dalpiciclib to BT474 cells was tested. The underlying molecular mechanisms were investigated using immunofluorescence, Western blot analysis, immunohistochemical staining, and cell cycle analysis. Potential risk factor that may indicate the responsiveness to drug treatment in HER2<sup>+</sup>/HR<sup>+</sup> breast cancer was identified using RNA-sequence and evaluated using immunohistochemical staining and in vivo drug susceptibility test. We found that pyrotinib combined with dalpiciclib exerted better cytotoxic efficacy than pyrotinib combined with tamoxifen in BT474 cells. Degradation of HER2 could enhance ER nuclear transportation, activating ER signaling pathway in BT474 cells, whereas dalpiciclib could partially abrogate this process. This may be the underlying mechanism by which combination of pyrotinib, tamoxifen, and dalpiciclib exerted best cytotoxic effect. Furthermore, CALML5 was revealed to be a risk factor in the treatment of HER2<sup>+</sup>/HR<sup>+</sup> breast cancer and the usage of dalpiciclib might overcome the drug resistance to pyrotinib + tamoxifen due to CALML5 expression. Our study provided evidence that the usage of dalpiciclib in the treatment of HER2<sup>+</sup>/HR<sup>+</sup> breast cancer could partially abrogate the estrogen signaling pathway activation caused by anti-HER2 therapy and revealed that CALML5 could serve as a risk factor in the treatment of HER2<sup>+</sup>/HR<sup>+</sup> breast cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>breast cancer cell line</kwd><kwd>xenograft mouse model</kwd><kwd>patient specimens</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U20A20381</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Caigang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81872159</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Caigang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Dalpiciclib could partially abrogate ER nuclear transportation induced by pyrotinib in HER2+HR+ breast cancer and CALML5 could serve as a potential risk factor in the treatment of HER2+HR+ breast cancer.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2<sup>+</sup>) breast cancer is associated with an increased risk of disease recurrence and death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Perou et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Slamon et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Tzahar et al., 1996</xref>). HER2-overexpressing breast cancers have high heterogeneity, accounting partially for the co-expression of hormone receptors (HRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Loi et al., 2016</xref>). Previous studies have demonstrated that extensive cross-talk exists between the HER2 signaling pathway and the estrogen receptor (ER) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, exposure to anti-HER2 therapy may reactivate the ER signaling pathway, which could lead to drug resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Brandão et al., 2020</xref>). Generally, however, HER2-positive patients are treated using the same algorithms, both in the early and advanced stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Moja et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Increasing evidence has confirmed that the intrinsic differences between HER2<sup>+</sup>/HR<sup>+</sup> and HER2<sup>+</sup>/HR<sup>-</sup> patients should not be ignored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Carey et al., 2016</xref>). Clinical outcomes have demonstrated that HER2<sup>+</sup>/HR<sup>+</sup> breast cancer patients have a lower chance of achieving a pathologically complete response than HER2<sup>+</sup>/HR<sup>-</sup> patients, when treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus anti-HER2 therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cameron et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cortazar et al., 2014</xref>). Nevertheless, the addition of concomitant endocrine therapy to anti-HER2 therapy or chemotherapy did not show any advantages in clinical trials, such as the NSABP B-52 and ADAPT HER2<sup>+</sup>/HR<sup>+</sup> studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Harbeck et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Rimawi et al., 2017</xref>). Recently, the synergistic effect of CDK4/6 (cyclin kinase 4/6) inhibitors and anti-HER2 drugs in HER2<sup>+</sup> breast cancer has been reported. The combination of anti-HER2 drugs and CDK4/6 inhibitors showed strong synergistic effects and high efficacy in HER2<sup>+</sup> breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Goel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Besides, in the recent MUKDEN 01 clinical trial (NCT04486911), the combination use of pyrotinib (anti-HER2 drug), letrozole (endocrine drug), and dalpiciclib (CDK4/6 inhibitor) exerted optimal therapeutic effect in HER2<sup>+</sup>HR<sup>+</sup> breast cancer patients and offered novel chemo-free neoadjuvant therapy for the treatment of HER2<sup>+</sup>HR<sup>+</sup> breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Niu et al., 2022</xref>), yet the underlying mechanism warrants further investigation.</p><p>Herein, we investigated the underlying molecular mechanism how the combination of pyrotinib, letrzole, and dalpiciclib achieved satisfactory therapeutic effect in MUKDEN 01 trial. We studied the combined effect of pyrotinib (anti-HER2 drug), tamoxifen (endocrine therapy), and dalpiciclib (CDK4/6 inhibitor) on the HER2<sup>+</sup>/HR<sup>+</sup> breast cancer cell line BT474 to simulate the clinical therapy in MUKDEN 01 trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Niu et al., 2022</xref>). We found that pyrotinib combined with dalpiciclib exerted better cytotoxic efficacy than pyrotinib combined with tamoxifen. Moreover, the combination use of pyrotinib, tamoxifen, and dalpiciclib displayed the best cytotoxic effect both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, HER2-targeted therapy induced nuclear ER redistribution in HER2<sup>+</sup>/HR<sup>+</sup> cells and the activation of ER signaling pathway, which could be partially abrogated by the addition of dalpiciclib. Furthermore, the expression of CALML5 could be a potential risk factor in the treatment of HER2<sup>+</sup>HR<sup>+</sup> breast cancer and the introduction of dalpiciclib could partially abrogate the drug resistance to pyrotinib + tamoxifen caused by the high expression of CALML5 in HER2<sup>+</sup>HR<sup>+</sup> breast cancer. Our study provided potential molecular mechanisms why the combination of pyrotinib, letrozole, and dalpiciclib could achieve satisfactory clinical response and found CALML5 as a potential risk factor in the treatment of HER2<sup>+</sup>HR<sup>+</sup> breast cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Pyrotinib combined with dalpiciclib exerted stronger cytotoxic effect than pyrotinib combined with tamoxifen</title><p>To explore the effects of anti-HER2 drugs, tamoxifen, and dalpiciclib in HER2<sup>+</sup>/HR<sup>+</sup> breast cancer, we first evaluated the cytotoxic activities of these three reagents in BT474 breast cancer cells. The results indicated that the IC<sub>50</sub> doses for pyrotinib, trastuzumab, tamoxifen, and dalpiciclib were 10 nM, 170 μg/ml, 5 μM, and 8 μM, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). To further investigate whether these drugs could have a synergistic effect on BT474 cells, we assessed the cytotoxic effects of the combinations of pyrotinib and dalpiciclib, pyrotinib and tamoxifen, and tamoxifen and dalpiciclib at different concentrations. We calculated the combination index for each combination using Compusyn software to determine whether the antitumor effects were synergistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chou and Talalay, 1984</xref>). Synergistic effects were observed in the combination group of pyrotinib and dalpiciclib, as well as in the pyrotinib and tamoxifen groups; both with CI values of &lt;1 at several concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).

As both dalpiciclib and tamoxifen showed synergistic effects in combination with pyrotinib, we sought the combination that exerted better cytotoxic efficacy. Hence, we treated the BT474 cells with different combinations at IC<sub>50</sub> or half IC<sub>50</sub> concentrations. The three-drug combination and the combination of pyrotinib and dalpiciclib showed a stronger cell inhibition compared with that exerted by pyrotinib and tamoxifen as well as tamoxifen and dalpiciclib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). In the colony formation assay, the three-drug combination group formed the least colonies and the group that was treated by the combination of pyrotinib and dalpiciclib formed the second least colonies.

Considering that the expression of HER2 could affect the distribution of the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Yang et al., 2004</xref>), we performed immunofluorescence staining for ER distribution on the different drug-treated groups to see whether anti-HER2 therapy could degrade HER2 and affect the distribution of ER. We found that pyrotinib induced ER nuclear translocation in BT474 cells, which could be partially abrogated by the addition of dalpiciclib, rather than tamoxifen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Besides trastuzumab, the monoclonal antibody of HER2 could also enhance the nuclear shift of ER and could also be abrogated by the introduction of dalpiciclib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c</xref>). Western blot analyses revealed that although the total expression of ER was reduced, the nuclear ER levels increased considerably after the use of pyrotinib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a and b</xref>).

first analyzed the gene expression profiles of the breast cancer cells treated with pyrotinib via RNA-seq. The signaling pathway enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) showed that the majority of the DEGs were significantly enriched in the TNF signaling pathway and cell cycle, while steroid biosynthesis was also strongly active, suggesting that the steroid hormone pathway was activated by pyrotinib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a and b</xref>). Consistent with the findings of signaling pathway enrichment analysis above, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) revealed the following results. The administration of pyrotinib resulted in downregulation of the cell cycle and activation of the hormone pathway. The leading-edge subset of these pathways included the MITOTIC SPINDLE, G2M CHECKPOINT, and ESTROGEN RESPONSE EARLY (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>).

the major treatment strategies for treatment of HER2<sup>+</sup>/HR<sup>+</sup> breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gianni et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Schneeweiss et al., 2013</xref>). Although pCR and DFS improve with the use of the combination of anti-HER2 therapy and chemotherapy, the strong adverse effects of chemotherapy cannot be ignored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Maguire et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, clinical data showed that the addition of anti-estrogen receptor drugs in the treatment regimen of HER2<sup>+</sup>/HR<sup>+</sup> breast cancer did not provide additional advantages in the pCR rates and DFS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Harbeck et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Rimawi et al., 2017</xref>). Hence, with the rapid development of small-molecule drugs such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and CDK4/6 inhibitors, additional chemo-free strategies are being developed for the treatment of HER2<sup>+</sup>/HR<sup>+</sup> breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gianni et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Pascual et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Saura et al., 2014</xref>). In the recent MUKDEN 01 clinical trial (NCT04486911), the combination of pyrotinib, letrozole, and dalpiciclib achieved satisfactory clinical response in HER2<sup>+</sup>HR<sup>+</sup> patients with minimal adverse effects and offered novel chemo-free neoadjuvant therapy for HER2<sup>+</sup>HR<sup>+</sup> patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Niu et al., 2022</xref>). The molecular mechanism of how the combination of pyrotinib, letrozole and dalpiciclib achieved optimal therapeutic effect remained elusive.</p><p>In our study, we found that the combination of pyrotinib and dalpiciclib exerted stronger cytotoxic effects on BT474 cells than the combination of pyrotinib and tamoxifen. This was anomalous since the two blocking agents of HER2 and ER were expected to inhibit their crosstalk and achieve better responses. To explore the potential mechanisms, we investigated the crosstalk between HER2 and the ER. After degrading HER2 with pyrotinib, ER was found to relocate to the cell nucleus, enhancing the function of ER, which was consistent with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kumar et al., 2002</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Yang et al., 2004</xref>. We believe that the anti-HER2-mediated ER redistribution caused the enhanced ER function, leading to the relatively low cytotoxic efficacy of the combination of pyrotinib and tamoxifen in the treatment of HER2<sup>+</sup>/HR<sup>+</sup> cells. Moreover, we found that the introduction of dalpiciclib to pyrotinib significantly decreased the total and nuclear expression of ER, and partially abrogated the ER activation caused by pyrotinib. This may be the underlying mechanism by which the addition of dalpiciclib could achieve better response in the in vitro and in vivo studies.</p><p>Furthermore, using mRNA-seq and bioinformatics analyses, CALML5 was identified as a potential risk factor in the treatment of HER2<sup>+</sup>HR<sup>+</sup> breast cancer. CALML5, known as calmodulin-like 5, is a skin-specific calcium-binding protein that is closely related to keratinocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Méhul et al., 2001</xref>). A previous study showed that the high expression of CALML5 was strongly associated with better survival in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Wirsing et al., 2021</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Misawa et al., 2020</xref> reported that the methylation of CALML5 led to its downregulation, and this showed a correlation with HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer. Moreover, the ubiquitination of CALML5 in the nucleus was found to play a role in the carcinogenesis of breast cancer in premenopausal women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Debald et al., 2013</xref>). Our results suggested that the high expression of CALML5 in HER2<sup>+</sup>HR<sup>+</sup> breast cancer patients may lead to the resistant of pyrotinib combined with tamoxifen and the introduction of dalpiciclib might overcome this drug resistance and offer better therapeutic effects. However, the underlying mechanism of CALML5 in breast cancer warrants further investigation.</p><p>In conclusion, our study investigated the underlying synergistic mechanism for the combination of pyrotinib, letrozole, and dalpiciclib in the MUKDEN 01 clinical trial (NCT04486911). We identified the novel role of the dalpiciclib in HER2<sup>+</sup>/HR<sup>+</sup> breast cancer, provided evidence that CALML5 may serve as a potential risk factor in the treatment of HER2<sup>+</sup>HR<sup>+</sup> breast cancer and the introduction of dalpiciclib might overcome the drug resistance to pyrotinib + tamoxifen due to the expression of CALML5 in HER2<sup>+</sup>HR<sup>+</sup> breast cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

In addition, some of the neoadjuvant cohorts (aside from the small number of patients in pyrotinib study), must have been treated with trastuzumab + pertuzumab. These would have a very different effects compared to irreversible TKIs such as pyrotinib.</p><p>In addition, the authors have not supported their preclinical studies using the same anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies used in the clinical cohorts cited in various figures. The reviewers noted that clinical trial (NCT04486911) used letrozole instead of tamoxifen but the authors didn't show any data using letrozole in cell lines there would not be comparability between the preclinical and clinical parts of this manuscript.</p><p>It was felt the revision of all these weaknesses would be beyond the scope and time that would normally be allowed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>From reading the introduction section and its references, the premise (and hence the hypothesis to address) of this paper is that ER activity may underpin part of the SECONDARY/acquired resistance to anti-HER2 inhibitors. There has certainly been previous preclinical literature support for this hypothesis (Wang, Morrison et al., 2011).</p><p>Clinical trials have been conducted on the basis of the preclinical literature but these tend to be early stage studies (e.g. phase 1 study of Palbociclib and T-DM1 in HER2+ metastatic/advanced breast cancer patients who progress subsequent to Trastuzumab (Haley, Batra et al., 2021)) so clinically, this preclinical hypothesis has certainly not been substantiated yet.</p><p>Nor do we understand the precise mechanisms of the potential CDK-HER2 crosstalk in these patients. Notably one should differentiate this hypothesis from clinical trials which are primarily designed to address primary resistance (using ER-HER2 combined targeting) in early breast cancer patients (Brandao, Maurer et al., 2020, Harbeck, Gluz et al., 2017).</p><p>The authors succeeded in demonstrating that pyrotinib (anti-HER2 TKI) combined with dalpiciclib (CDK4/6 inhibitor) showed better efficacy than pyrotinib combined with tamoxifen. Mechanistically, the authors also succeeded in showing pyrotinib induced ER nuclear translocation in the human triple-positive (ER+/PR+/HER2+, TPBC) breast cancer cell line BT474, a phenomenon which could be partially reversed by the addition of dalpiciclib, rather than tamoxifen. The weakness of the followup experiments to these findings, which were designed to further investigate whether the expression of HER2 (using HER2 overexpression plasmids) could affect the distribution of ER, lies in the non-physiological overexpression of HER2 in ER+ MCF7 cells.</p><p>The authors also claimed they showed in Figure 2d, in their ongoing clinical trial (NCT04486911), the nuclear ER expression levels of patients did not show significant elevations after the HER2-targeted therapy. However a major weakness exists as NCT04486911 is a single arm study of Pyrotinib Maleate, CDK4/6 Inhibitor (dalpiciclib) and Letrozole in Combination for Stage II-III TPBC: a Phase II Trial.</p><p>As Figures 2c and 2d (third column labelled as CDKi+antiHER2) were not derived from the same trial (by definition as 2d's findings pertained to a single arm study), the claim that &quot;these findings verified that the ER receptor may have shifted to the nucleus after anti-HER2 therapy, which could be reversed with the introduction of a CDK4/6 inhibitor&quot; is not valid.</p><p>In BT474 cells, the authors concluded that after the introduction of dalpiciclib, the activation of mTOR was partially inhibited, which relieved the negative feedback on the HER2 pathway, as evidenced by the slight increase in the HER2 and pAKT, which maintained the sensitivity of the HER2 pathway to pyrotinib (Figure 4a). If this conclusion was drawn by comparing lanes 1 &amp; 4 in Figure 4a (pTOR vs total TOR, compared also with total or phosphor- HER2 changes), the changes on the blots are not convincing to draw this conclusion.</p><p>Finally, the authors have succeeded in demonstrating that TPBC patients with positive CALML5 (being one of the three genes that were found to overlap between the upregulated genes treated with pyrotinib and the genes belonging to the estrogen signaling pathway (Figure 3G)), may benefit from the addition of CDK4/6 inhibitors to anti-HER2 antibody in neoadjuvant therapy (Figure 4c).</p><p>Brandao M, Maurer C, Ziegelmann PK, Ponde NF, Ferreira A, Martel S, Piccart M, de Azambuja E, Debiasi M, Lambertini M (2020) Endocrine therapy-based treatments in hormone receptor-positive/HER2-negative advanced breast cancer: systematic review and network meta-analysis.

Breast Cancer Res 13: R121</p><p>Figure 2b shows that the expression of HER2 (using HER2 overexpression plasmids) could affect the distribution of ER, but this was demonstrated via non-physiological overexpression of HER2 in ER+ MCF7 cells. In addition to the results in Figure 2B, experiments should be done with knockout/knockdown with rescue by reintroducing physiological levels of HER2.</p><p>In Figure2—figure supplement 1a-b, the authors showed although the nuclear ER levels increased considerably after pyrotinib, the total expression of ER was reduced. The authors should show whether ER ubiquitination, a known mechanism to regulate ERα stability (Ding &amp; Kuang, 2021), was increased.</p><p>As pointed out, data used to support the conclusion drawn by comparing lanes 1 &amp; 4 in Figure 4a (pTOR vs total TOR, compared also with total or phosphor- HER2 changes), are not conclusive. Statistical differences of these purported changes in multiple independent biological repeats should be presented.</p><p>The authors also claimed they showed in Figure 2d, in their ongoing clinical trial (NCT04486911), the nuclear ER expression levels of patients did not show significant elevations after the HER2-targeted therapy. However they should clarify the study design of NCT04486911 which is a single-center, single-arm, open-label trial from what I can find – https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04486911. Otherwise, Figures 2c and 2d (third column labelled as CDK1+antiHER2) could not have been derived from the same trial and the claim that &quot;these findings verified that the ER receptor may have shifted to the nucleus after anti-HER2 therapy, which could be reversed with the introduction of a CDK4/6 inhibitor&quot; would not be valid. The authors should address this.</p><p>The authors should make clear in the results and the figure legends the exact detail of the clinical studies e.g. WRT &quot;patients with positive CALML5 may benefit from the addition of CDK4/6 inhibitors to anti-HER2 antibody in neoadjuvant therapy (Figure 4c)&quot;, it is not clear what anti-HER2 was used and in which trial context.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors compared the effects of dalpiciclib, pyrotinib and tamoxifen or their combination in in triple-positive breast cancer cells. They showed synergistic effects of dalpiciclib and pyrotinib as well as pyrotinib and tamoxifen but not with tamoxifen and dalpiciclib although the greatest efficacy was seen with the triple combination. This study has also assessed potential predictive biomarker, CALML5 to CDK4/6 inhibitor in combination with anti-HER2.</p><p>Strengths</p><p>This paper has shown the promising anti-tumour effect of dalpiciclib and pyrotinib +/- tamoxifen. The study proposed the mechanisms of why dalpiciclib + pyrotinib was more effective than pyrotinib with tamoxifen since pyrotinib induced ER nuclear translocation, which could be partially reversed by the addition of dalpiciclib, rather than tamoxifen. The study utilizes human tissues, which strengthen the data.</p><p>Weakness</p><p>The promising combination of pyrotinib + CDk4/6 inhibitor has already been previously reported so the combination of irreversible TKI and CDK4/6 inhibitor combination is not novel. The paper referred to anti-HER2 treatments in neoadjuvant/adjuvant setting and this is likely to be trastuzumab and pertuzumab and would have different effects to irreversible TKI like pyrotinib. In addition, one of the clinical trial samples were from patients treated with letrozole but the authors have not supported the preclinical data using letrozole. The effect of tamoxifen or letrozole in combination with protinib and dalpaciclib may be different. The authors did not show the combination in xenograft and/or patient-derived organoid models, which would strengthen the data.</p><p>Overall, the authors' claims and conclusions are justified by their data but further work is required before the findings could be translated into clinic.</p><p>Figure 1: P+D and P+T effective and synergistic. T+D not effective or synergistic. In the combination treatment group (Figure 1C) there is no control group like DMSO. Use of t-test instead of anova in Figure 1C, not be appropriate as it causes bias in the selection of groups and does not account for multiple-testing errors. Could also use control (vehicle group). In addition, no error bars are shown in each point despite the figure legend states that data was presented as mean (plus minus) SEMs in Figure 1a-b.</p><p>Figure 1d – is this adjuvant or neoadjuvant – The Figure 1d states adjuvant but the table 1 and 2 state neoadjuvant, The cohorts of patients are very confusing. Is the 177 patients in Figure 1D the same as those 172 patients in Table 1? I am not sure whether Table 1, Table 2 or Figure 1d are from the same cohorts with overlaps or are there complete different cohorts. If Figure 1d is from different cohort, patients' demographic and characteristics need to be shown. If they are the same cohorts, the manuscript needs to be clearer.</p><p>I think Figure 2c is misleading and doesn't necessarily support the data from cell lines. This is because most the anti-HER2 and chemotherapy given to patients would be different from those in the in vitro experiments. The authors have now shown the effect of trastuzumab and pertuzumab +/- chemo on ER nuclear translocation in cell line</p><p>The author stated their ongoing clinical trial (NCT04486911) and that the nuclear ER expression levels of patients did not show significant elevations after the HER2-targeted therapy combined with dalpiciclib (Figure 2d). However, in this study, the hormone treatment was different, letrozole instead of tamoxifen. The authors didn't show any data using letrozole in cell lines.</p><p>It is important for the authors to state the drugs used in NCT04486911 – otherwise we have to google to find out. The authors should have stated that dalpiciclib is SHR6390 used in NCT04486911.</p><p>In both table 1 and 2, the HER2 status contained both 2+ and 3+. I assumed that the HER2 2+ was FISH positive and if so this needs to be stated.</p><p>Figure 2B. Not sure what does NC stand for. This should be stated.</p><p>Figure 3: CALML5 is indicated to be a predictive biomarker for responsiveness to anti-her2 therapy containing CDK4/6 inhibitor. The authors stated that they wanted to further explore the synergistic mechanisms of the addition of CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment in HER2+/HR+ breast cancer. They first analyzed the gene expression profiles of the breast tumor cells treated with pyrotinib via RNA-seq. They then compared gene expression between pyrotinib, tamoxifen and dalpaciclib and pyrotinib and tamoxifen. I am surprised that they did not compare the gene expression between pyrotinib + dalpiciclib with pyrotinib alone to see the effect of adding dalpaciclib to anti-HER2 palbociclib as they wanted to explore the synergistic mechanisms of adding CDK4/6 inhibitor to anti-Her2.</p><p>Could the authors define CALML5-positive cells – is it any staining or just strong staining and % of positive cells?</p><p>In table 2 – it states that the patient received chemotherapy + anti-HER2 – which anti-Her2 therapies? If they are trastuzumab and pertuzumab, these would have induced very different effect compared to irreversible TKI.</p><p>Figure 4: 4a the spelling for pyrotinib is wrong in the figure. There is no control treatment group using DMSO. Phosphorylation status of CDK4/6 could be useful to look at because its activity is regulated by Cyclin D and p27 and phosphorylation of the threonine 172 residue (pThr172) is the rate limiting step in CDK4 activation. Therefore, tumour cells lacking Thr172 phosphorylation would progress in cell cycle independent of CDK4 pathway.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Dalpiciclib Partially Abrogates ER Signaling Activation Induced by Pyrotinib In HER2 + HR + Breast Cancer&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Through a series of in vitro drug sensitivity studies and in vivo drug susceptibility studies, the authors revealed that pyrotinib combined with dalpiciclib exhibits better therapeutic efficacy than the combination use of pyrotinib with tamoxifen. Moreover, the authors found that CALML5 may serve as a biomarker in the treatment of HER2+/HR+ breast cancer.</p><p>The authors provide solid evidence for the following:</p><p>1. The combination use of pyrotinib with dalpiciclib exhibits better therapeutic efficacy than the combination use of pyrotinib with tamoxifen.</p><p>2.

The strengths include the identification of the novel role of dalpiciclib in the treatment of HER2+/HR+ breast cancer. Moreover, the authors provide solid evidence that the combined use of dalpiciclib with pyrotinib significantly decreased the total and nuclear expression of ER.

Mechanistically, using anti-HER2 drugs such as pyrotinib and trastuzumab could degrade HER2 and facilitate the nuclear transportation of ER in HER2+HR+ breast cancer, which enhanced the function of ER signaling pathway. The introduction of dalpiciclib partially abrogated the nuclear transportation of ER and exerted its canonical function as cell cycle blockers, which led to the optimal cytotoxicity effect in treating HER2+HR+ breast cancer. Furthermore, using mRNA-seq analysis and in vivo drug susceptibility test, the authors succeeded in identifying CALML5 as a novel risk factor in the treatment of HER2+HR+ breast cancer.</p><p>1. The catalogue number of the antibodies used in this study shall be added in the section of Chemicals and antibodies.</p><p>2. I suggest the change of &quot;CDK4/6 inhibitor&quot; into &quot;dalpiciclib&quot; in line 221, because only dalpiciclib was used in this study and we were unaware of if other CDK4/6 inhibitors could affect the nuclear transportation of ER.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this research, the authors explore a novel mechanism of CDK4/6 inhibitor dalpiciclib in HER2+HR+ breast cancers, in which dalpiciclib could reverse the process of ER intra-nuclear transportation upon HER2 degradation. The conclusions are significant to gain insight into the biological behavior of TPBC and provided a conceptual basis for the ideal efficacy in the published clinical trial. The findings are supported by supplemented in vivo assay and transcriptomic analysis.</p><p>1. In some parts of the manuscript, the author interchanged the expression of &quot;breast cancer&quot; and &quot;breast tumor&quot;, I suggest sticking to one expression throughout the whole text, which may improve the concordance of the manuscript.</p><p>2. In Table 1 and Table 2, the reasons for dividing the demographic data into subgroups should be specified in the Material and Method session.</p><p>3. In Table 1 and Table 2, the first line where different treatment groups were listed should be adjusted for new line management.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85246.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

We also made new tables to describe the demographic information of the clinical samples we analyzed (Table1 and 2).

Despite there may be some difference in the working mechanism of trastuzumab and pyrotinib in targeting HER2, the affecting of ER distribution was both observed in clinical specimens (Figure 2b) and cell lines (Figure 2—figure supplement 1c). Hence, we think these evidences could still partially prove our idea that the usage of anti-HER2 therapy could enhance the nuclear distribution of ER in HER2<sup>+</sup>HR<sup>+</sup>breast cancer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In BT474 cells, the authors concluded that after the introduction of dalpiciclib, the activation of mTOR was partially inhibited, which relieved the negative feedback on the HER2 pathway, as evidenced by the slight increase in the HER2 and pAKT, which maintained the sensitivity of the HER2 pathway to pyrotinib (Figure 4a). If this conclusion was drawn by comparing lanes 1 &amp; 4 in Figure 4a (pTOR vs total TOR, compared also with total or phosphor- HER2 changes), the changes on the blots are not convincing to draw this conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your suggestion, the description of this part was a little bit overstated and we’ve checked out manuscript and removed such descriptions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the authors have succeeded in demonstrating that TPBC patients with positive CALML5 (being one of the three genes that were found to overlap between the upregulated genes treated with pyrotinib and the genes belonging to the estrogen signaling pathway (Figure 3G)), may benefit from the addition of CDK4/6 inhibitors to anti-HER2 antibody in neoadjuvant therapy (Figure 4c).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your comments. Besides, we added in vivo study to investigate the function of CALML5 in this version (line 213-218). The existence of CALML5 could lead to relative worse response to pyrotinib+tamoxifen and requires the introduction of dalpiciclib (Figure 4e and f).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2b shows that the expression of HER2 (using HER2 overexpression plasmids) could affect the distribution of ER, but this was demonstrated via non-physiological overexpression of HER2 in ER+ MCF7 cells.

Actually, our findings emphasized on the usage of anti-HER2 therapy to disturb the location of ER.

Hence, we’ve cited this article to prove our ideas (line 121-124) that targeting HER2 using TKIs or trastuzumab could affect the distribution of ER (Figure 2a and Figure 2—figure supplement 1c) and removed the part of overexpressing HER2 plasmids in MCF7 cells (Figure 2b in the previous version).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 2—figure supplement 1a-b, the authors showed although the nuclear ER levels increased considerably after pyrotinib, the total expression of ER was reduced.

However they should clarify the study design of NCT04486911 which is a single-center, single-arm, open-label trial from what I can find – https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04486911. Otherwise, Figures 2c and 2d (third column labelled as CDK1+antiHER2) could not have been derived from the same trial and the claim that &quot;these findings verified that the ER receptor may have shifted to the nucleus after anti-HER2 therapy, which could be reversed with the introduction of a CDK4/6 inhibitor&quot; would not be valid. The authors should address this.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your suggestion, we should have clarified about the clinical trial. Indeed, 3 kinds of neoadjuvant therapy were enrolled in this part to elevate if anti-HER2 therapy could lead to ER nuclear shift in clinical practice. The therapies were as follow: trastuzumab+chemotherapy(docetaxel+carboplatin); chemotherapy (docetaxel+carboplatin); pyrotinib+dalpiciclib+letrozole which is our clinical trial NCT04486911 (line 138-146, 202-211, 278-284).

They showed synergistic effects of dalpiciclib and pyrotinib as well as pyrotinib and tamoxifen but not with tamoxifen and dalpiciclib although the greatest efficacy was seen with the triple combination. This study has also assessed potential predictive biomarker, CALML5 to CDK4/6 inhibitor in combination with anti-HER2.</p><p>Strengths</p><p>This paper has shown the promising anti-tumour effect of dalpiciclib and pyrotinib +/- tamoxifen. The study proposed the mechanisms of why dalpiciclib + pyrotinib was more effective than pyrotinib with tamoxifen since pyrotinib induced ER nuclear translocation, which could be partially reversed by the addition of dalpiciclib, rather than tamoxifen. The study utilizes human tissues, which strengthen the data.</p><p>Weakness</p><p>The promising combination of pyrotinib + CDk4/6 inhibitor has already been previously reported so the combination of irreversible TKI and CDK4/6 inhibitor combination is not novel. The paper referred to anti-HER2 treatments in neoadjuvant/adjuvant setting and this is likely to be trastuzumab and pertuzumab and would have different effects to irreversible TKI like pyrotinib. In addition, one of the clinical trial samples were from patients treated with letrozole but the authors have not supported the preclinical data using letrozole. The effect of tamoxifen or letrozole in combination with protinib and dalpaciclib may be different. The authors did not show the combination in xenograft and/or patient-derived organoid models, which would strengthen the data.</p><p>Overall, the authors' claims and conclusions are justified by their data but further work is required before the findings could be translated into clinic.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the comments. We agree with the idea that the effect of tamoxifen or letrozole in combination with pyrotinib and dalpiciclib may be different. However, as an aromatase inhibitor, letrozole could functionally inhibit the generation of estrogen in human body and subsequently dysfunction ER. In in vitro conditions, letrozole could only exert functions when treating cells which overexpressed aromatase (Banerjee, 2010 #73). The over expression of aromatase in BT474 cells lines may cause other alterations in the cell properties and may not simulate the HER2<sup>+</sup>/HR<sup>+</sup> breast cancer very well. Hence, we used the tamoxifen which could directly inhibit ER as the endocrine therapy in preclinical studies.</p><p>As for in vivo xenograft studies, we added in vivo xenografts to investigate the function of CALML5 in this part (line 213-221).

They first analyzed the gene expression profiles of the breast tumor cells treated with pyrotinib via RNA-seq. They then compared gene expression between pyrotinib, tamoxifen and dalpaciclib and pyrotinib and tamoxifen. I am surprised that they did not compare the gene expression between pyrotinib + dalpiciclib with pyrotinib alone to see the effect of adding dalpaciclib to anti-HER2 palbociclib as they wanted to explore the synergistic mechanisms of adding CDK4/6 inhibitor to anti-Her2.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your comments. This is because that we found the usage of pyrotinib may activate the ER signaling pathway. Through analyzing the differential expressed genes between pyrotinib group and DMSO control group, we may find out potential markers which could reflect the ER signaling activation. Further on, to seek how dalpiciclib effectively inhibit the cell viability, we intersected the genes which was up-regulated by the introduction of pyrotinib and was down-regulated by dalpiciclib. As we believe this down stream genes was also controlled by ER signaling, we are afraid that the introduction of tamoxifen could partially block its change and make the change of the expression not significant, hence we intersected the up-regulated genes in pyrotinib treatment and down-regulated genes in dalpiciclib treatment(line174-185).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Could the authors define CALML5-positive cells – is it any staining or just strong staining and % of positive cells?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your suggestion.

There is no control treatment group using DMSO. Phosphorylation status of CDK4/6 could be useful to look at because its activity is regulated by Cyclin D and p27 and phosphorylation of the threonine 172 residue (pThr172) is the rate limiting step in CDK4 activation. Therefore, tumour cells lacking Thr172 phosphorylation would progress in cell cycle independent of CDK4 pathway.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggestion and sorry for the spelling mistake.

Mechanistically, using anti-HER2 drugs such as pyrotinib and trastuzumab could degrade HER2 and facilitate the nuclear transportation of ER in HER2+HR+ breast cancer, which enhanced the function of ER signaling pathway. The introduction of dalpiciclib partially abrogated the nuclear transportation of ER and exerted its canonical function as cell cycle blockers, which led to the optimal cytotoxicity effect in treating HER2+HR+ breast cancer. Furthermore, using mRNA-seq analysis and in vivo drug susceptibility test, the authors succeeded in identifying CALML5 as a novel risk factor in the treatment of HER2+HR+ breast cancer.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your comments and valuable suggestions, we’ve improved our manuscript according to your suggestions below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

I suggest the change of &quot;CDK4/6 inhibitor&quot; into &quot;dalpiciclib&quot; in line 221, because only dalpiciclib was used in this study and we were unaware of if other CDK4/6 inhibitors could affect the nuclear transportation of ER.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your suggestions, we’ve changed “CDK4/6 inhibitor” into “dalpiciclib” in line 224 to avoid confusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In this research, the authors explore a novel mechanism of CDK4/6 inhibitor dalpiciclib in HER2+HR+ breast cancers, in which dalpiciclib could reverse the process of ER intra-nuclear transportation upon HER2 degradation. The conclusions are significant to gain insight into the biological behavior of TPBC and provided a conceptual basis for the ideal efficacy in the published clinical trial. The findings are supported by supplemented in vivo assay and transcriptomic analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your comments and valuable suggestions to us so that we could improve this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. In some parts of the manuscript, the author interchanged the expression of &quot;breast cancer&quot; and &quot;breast tumor&quot;, I suggest sticking to one expression throughout the whole text, which may improve the concordance of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your suggestions. We realized that interchanging the expression of “breast cancer” and “breast tumor” had caused confusion.

In Table 1, patients who only received chemotherapy was not evaluated for the expression of CALML5 before receiving neoadjuvant therapy. To avoid confusions when mentioning the patients who were evaluated for the expression of CALML5 in the manuscript, we additionally made Table 2 to display the demographic characteristics of these patients. We have specified the reasons for dividing the demographic data into subgroups in the Clinical specimen part in the Material and Method session (line 290-294).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.
