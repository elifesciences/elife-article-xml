breast cancer-related deaths, especially delayed breast cancer distant metastasis. The current study assessed the frequency of CD44<sup>-</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> breast cancer cells in 576 tissue specimens for associations with clinicopathological features and metastasis and investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms. The results indicated that higher frequency (≥19.5%) of CD44<sup>-</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> cells was associated with delayed postoperative breast cancer metastasis. Furthermore, CD44<sup>-</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup>triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells spontaneously converted into CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup>cancer stem cells (CSCs) with properties similar to CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup>CSCs from primary human breast cancer cells and parental TNBC cells in terms of stemness marker expression, self-renewal, differentiation, tumorigenicity, and lung metastasis in vitro and <italic>in NOD/SCID mice</italic>. RNA sequencing identified several differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in newly converted CSCs and <italic>RHBDL2</italic>, one of the DEGs, expression was upregulated. More importantly, <italic>RHBDL2</italic> silencing inhibited the YAP1/USP31/NF-κB signaling and attenuated spontaneous CD44<sup>-</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> cell conversion into CSCs and their mammosphere formation.

Different treatment strategies, such as surgical resection, hormone therapy, targeted therapy, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, have greatly improved survival of breast cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bray et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burstein et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative G, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Khan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Saini et al., 2012</xref>). To date, clinical strategies for breast cancer treatment remain suboptimal. Although continuous treatment with tamoxifen for 10 years has reduced cancer recurrence and mortality of patients with luminal A breast cancer, a significant proportion of patients may be over-treated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bianchini et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">O'Conor et al., 2018</xref>). Hence, it is urgently needed to discover novel biomarkers to predict treatment effectiveness and to improve treatment success and prognosis of breast cancer patients. Furthermore, the available therapies can also lead to a considerable number of patients at a risk to develop a delayed breast cancer metastasis, which occurs even 20–40 years after breast cancer diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sharma, 2018</xref>). Notably, breast cancer metastasis occurring 5–8 years after initial surgical resection has become a significant cause of cancer relapse, progression, and poor survival in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nishimura et al., 2013</xref>); thus, further researches on its molecular mechanisms and gene alterations may help identify novel biomarkers and targets for development of therapeutic strategies to effectively control breast cancer metastasis and progression.</p><p>Indeed, tumor metastasis is a multistep process, during which, cancer cells escape from the primary site, migration into a neighboring or distant tissues, extravasation, survival, and colonization, leading to the formation of new tumor nodules at a secondary site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Drabsch and ten Dijke, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Klein, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Scott et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Syn et al., 2016</xref>). The rate-limiting step of cancer metastasis is cancer cell colonization and proliferation at the secondary site, because the initial metastatic cancer nodule usually lacks an efficient vasculature to provide sufficient nutrients to support cancer cell growth. Thus, the newly arrived tumor cells may grow to a certain size in the new and harsh microenvironment and undergo growth arrest in that organ. However, once they regain their proliferative ability, delayed metastasis will occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Langley and Fidler, 2007</xref>). Molecularly, CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> breast cancer cells from primary breast tumors are associated with distant metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham et al., 2005</xref>), and these cells display potent motility and invasiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2010</xref>), similar to chemoresistance cancer stem cells (CSCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Velasco-Velázquez et al., 2011</xref>). Previous studies have shown that CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> breast CSCs may be a dominant factor for the relapse of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), due to their potent self-renewal and differentiation capacities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Geng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, injection with about 50 breast CSCs can induce a solid tumor mass in immunocompromised mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chaffer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Iliopoulos et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, the number of breast CSCs in the secondary site may affect the efficient formation of early metastatic nodules, and breast CSCs are commonly prone to be resistant to chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">De Angelis et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, previous studies have reported that the differentiated cancer cells can spontaneously convert into CSCs to renew the CSC pool in breast cancer, pancreatic cancer and sarcomas, resulting in chemoresistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gruber et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ye et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, the dormant CD44<sup>-</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> breast cancer cells that have previously been colonized in the metastatic site may be able to spontaneously convert into CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> breast CSCs to regain their potent proliferative ability and drug resistance, resulting in delayed breast cancer metastasis. Accordingly, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the frequency of CD44<sup>-</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> cells in human tumor specimens may be useful in the prediction of delayed breast cancer metastasis.</p><p>The current study aimed to explore the molecular mechanisms by which CD44<sup>-</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> cell conversion into CSC promotes delayed breast cancer metastasis. First, a retrospective analysis of CD44<sup>-</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> breast cancer cells in tissue specimens from patients enrolled from three academic medical centers was performed to investigate the potential associations between the frequency of CD44<sup>-</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> cells and postoperative tumor metastasis. Next, the spontaneous CD44<sup>-</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> cell conversion into CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> CSCs was tested and the biological functions of the converted CSCs were analyzed in vitro and in vivo. The results may provide novel insights into the role of CD44<sup>-</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> tumor cells in delayed breast cancer metastasis and into the potential use of CD44<sup>-</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> cells as a biomarker to predict survival and metastasis in breast cancer patients. These findings also suggest that <italic>RHBDL2</italic> may be a novel therapeutic target for the future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Patients and tissue specimens</title><p>Paraffin-embedded surgical tissue samples were collected from 576 breast cancer patients, who underwent breast cancer surgery between June 2005 and April 2013 in China Medical University Affiliated Hospital (Shenyang, Liaoning, China), Liaoning Cancer Hospital (Shenyang, Liaoning, China), and Dalian Municipal Central Hospital Affiliated to Dalian Medical University (Dalian, Liaoning, China). The patients were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer histologically, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) breast cancer classifications, 4<sup>th</sup> edition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tan et al., 2015</xref>) and classified, according to breast cancer TNM staging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2012</xref>). The demographic, clinicopathological and follow-up data of all patients were collected from their medical records or via telephone interview.

Briefly, individual sections (4 µm) on the tissue microarray glass slides that had been pre-coated with (3-aminopropyl) triethoxysilane solution were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and subjected to regular antigen retrieval. The sections were blocked with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Cellmax, Lanzhou, China) at room temperature for 1 h and incubated with a mouse anti-human CD44 monoclonal antibody (Cat. #3570; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) and a rabbit anti-human CD24 antibody (Cat. #ab202073; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) at 4ºC overnight. After being washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the sections were incubated with Alexa Fluor 647-labeled rabbit goat anti-mouse IgG and Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG, followed by nuclear staining with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The fluorescence signals in the immunostained tissue sections were photoimaged under a fluorescence microscope (E800, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) with the NIS-Elements F3.0 (Nikon) and analyzed using ImageJ software (National Institute of Heath, Bethesda, MD, USA). The percentages of CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> CSCs and CD44<sup>-</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> cells in 2000 tumor cells from at least three sections were calculated in a blinded manner.

Next, the purified CD44<sup>-</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with pGL3-OCT4-EGFP using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and 6 h later, the cells were cultured into microraft QuAscount assay plates (Teacon, Maennedorf, Switzerland) in a single cell manner for 1, 3 or 5 days, according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The EGFP- cells at 24 h post culture and EGFP+ cells at 72 and 120 h post culture (three cells per time point) were captured separately and subjected to RNA-seq analysis at a single cell level to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). In brief, total RNA was isolated from individual single-cell samples, and their mRNA was enriched using the oligo-dT microbeads and fragmented to 300-500 nucleosides, followed by reversely transcribed into cDNA. The cDNA samples were amplified by PCR to generate cDNA libraries, which were sequenced in an Illumina HiSeq (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA).

Therefore, the findings may uncover new biomarkers for prognosis of delayed distant breast cancer metastasis and shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the distant metastasis of breast cancer, particularly for TNBC. It is necessary to further investigate whether RHBDL2 can be a therapeutic target in inhibiting the development and progression of breast cancer.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that non-CSC tumor cells can dedifferentiate (convert) into CSCs in human glioblastoma and intestinal stroma melanoma, contributing to intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stepanova et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tzimas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wei et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, CSC plasticity and heterogeneity can promote tumor progression and resistance to therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Das et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kilmister et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martin-Castillo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Thankamony et al., 2020</xref>). For example, intra-tumoral heterogeneity is a major ongoing challenge for effective cancer therapy, while CSCs are responsible for intra-tumoral heterogeneity, therapeutic resistance, and metastasis, which may be because cancer cells exhibit a high level of plasticity and an ability to dynamically switch between CSC and non-CSC states or among different subsets of CSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Thankamony et al., 2020</xref>). Consistently, the differentiated non-CSCs can revert to be trastuzumab-refractory, CSS-like cells by enhancing their epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martin-Castillo et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, the changes in tumor microenvironment and epigenetics can promote the conversion of non-CSCs into CSCs, leading to tumor progression and therapeutic resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Das et al., 2020</xref>). The current study further confirmed that CD44<sup>-</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> TNBC cells spontaneously converted into CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> CSCs that possessed biological properties, similar to their CSCs isolated directly from parental TNBC cells. More importantly, a higher frequency of CD44<sup>-</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> cells in breast cancer tissues was associated with significantly with worse DFS and delayed distant metastasis. These, together with the dynamic process of spontaneous conversion of non-CSC CD44<sup>-</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> cells and CSC differentiation, indicate that the spontaneous conversion of CD44<sup>-</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> cells helps maintain the CSC pool size, contributing to the delayed distant metastasis and worse prognosis in breast cancer patients.</p><p>The data from the current study indicated that a higher frequency of CD44<sup>-</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> cancer cells, like higher frequency of CSCs, was one of the independent risk factors for delayed distant metastasis and worse DFS in this population. Particularly, the higher frequency of CD44<sup>-</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> cancer cells was a better predictor of delayed breast cancer metastasis (up to 12 years after initial breast cancer diagnosis). Evidently, while high frequency of CSCs was valuable for predicting distant metastasis at 5–7 years post-surgery a higher frequency of CD44<sup>-</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> cells effectively predicted delayed distant metastasis in cases with a low frequency of CSCs. These results suggest that CD44<sup>-</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> cells may spontaneously convert into CSCs and cause delayed distant metastasis when environmental and other factors cause a clonal evolution by accumulating successive mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Meacham and Morrison, 2013</xref>).</p><p>In addition, the RNA-seq analysis and subsequent RT-qPCR identified several DEGs during the dynamic process of CD44<sup>-</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> TNBC cell conversion into CSCs, such as <italic>RHBDL2</italic>, and its expression was up-regulated in the newly converted CSCs. The RHBDL2, also known as the rhomboid like 2, is one intramembrane serine protease of the secretase-A rhomboid family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Etheridge et al., 2013</xref>). Previous studies have identified that the RHBDL2 cleaves its substrates, including EGF, ephrin-β3, thrombomodulin, the C-type lectin family 14 member A (CLEC14A), cadherin, IL-6R, Spint-1 and the collagen receptor tyrosine kinase DDR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adrain et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Battistini et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Etheridge et al., 2013</xref>). Although the functional consequence of cleaving these substrates has not been fully explored the available findings indicate that RHBDL2 functionally activates the EGF signaling, cadherin shedding, angiogenesis and promotes the wound healing and migration of different types of cells, including tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adrain et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheng et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, up-regulated RHBDL2 expression is associated with worse prognosis of several types of malignant tumors, such as breast cancer, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, clear cell kidney cancer, and low-grade glioma patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Canzoneri et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Johnson et al., 2017</xref>). However, little is known on how upregulated RHBDL2 expression promotes malignant behaviors of these types of tumors. Interestingly, the current study not only observed that the upregulated <italic>RHBDL2</italic> transcription was associated with worse DFS of breast cancer patients in TCGA, but also found that <italic>RHBDL2</italic> silencing inhibited the YAP1/NF-κB signaling by upregulating USP31 expression and attenuated the spontaneous conversion of CD44<sup>-</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> cells into CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> CSCs and their mammosphere formation. Moreover, these data extended previous observation that YAP1-mediated suppression of USP31 enhances NF-κB activity to promote sarcomagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kemeny and Fisher, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mehta et al., 2018</xref>). YAP1 can enhance CSC stemness in several types of human cancers, and aberrant YAP1 activation is associated with a low level of TNBC differentiation and poor survival of breast cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bora-Singhal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hansen et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, the findings from the current study indicated that RHBDL2 promoted the spontaneous conversion of CD44<sup>-</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> cells into CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> CSCs by enhancing YAP1 stability through inhibiting its phosphorylation to suppress USP31 expression, enhancing the NF-κB signaling in breast cancer cells, whereas <italic>RHBDL2</italic> silencing had the opposite effects in breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). Alternatively, RHBDL2 may cleave other substrates to activate the EGF receptor-mediated signaling, and modify cadherin and other molecules through their involved signal pathways to promote the spontaneous conversion of CD44<sup>-</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> cells into CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> CSCs. Hence, these findings may provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the action of RHBDL2 in regulating the CSC pool to promote the metastasis of TNBC. Given that CSCs are crucial for breast cancer progression and metastasis, RHBDL2 may be a new therapeutic target for control of CD44<sup>-</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> cell conversion into CSCs to reduce CSC pool size and limit breast cancer progression and metastasis.</p><p>Definitely, this study had limitations. First, the sample size in some groups remained relatively smaller, which might affect statistical power. Second, this study only centered on the role of RHBDL2, but not other DEGs in regulating the spontaneous conversion of CD44<sup>-</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> TNBC cells into CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> CSCs. The results might miss some important information on the molecular mechanisms underlying the spontaneous conversion. Furthermore, the method for identification of CD44<sup>-</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> TNBC cells did not include a positive tumor molecular marker, which might contaminate some other types of cells, although using histological tissue sections for identification of tumor cells. Thus, further studies are warranted with advanced cutting-edge technologies, such as combination of single-cell RNA-seq, multiple marker-based CyTOF mass cytometry or spatial proteomics to quantify the frequency or number of CD44<sup>-</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> breast cancer cells in fresh breast cancer tissues, together with prospectively following-up the patients, in a bigger population to investigate the prognostic value of CD44<sup>-</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> breast cancer cells and the molecular mechanisms underlying the spontaneous conversion of CD44<sup>-</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> TNBC into CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> CSCs in the metastasis of breast cancer.</p><p>In summary, postoperative breast cancer metastasis, especially delayed metastasis (e.g. ≥5 years after diagnosis), is an important unresolved issue. The results from the current study indicated that patients with a higher frequency of CD44<sup>-</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> cells in their breast cancer tissues had a high risk to develop delayed distant metastasis 5–7 years after diagnosis. Mechanistically, CD44<sup>-</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> cells spontaneously converted into CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> CSCs and both WT and newly converted CSCs had similar stemness properties in vitro and in vivo. <italic>RHBDL2</italic> silencing significantly decreased YAP1 expression and increased USP31 expression to attenuate the NF-kB activation and CD44<sup>-</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> cell conversion into CSCs as well as their mammosphere formation. RHBDL2 may act as a positive regulator of the spontaneous conversion of CD44<sup>-</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> cells into CSCs by enhancing the YAP1/USP31/NF-kB signaling. Alternatively, RHBDL2 may cleave other substrates to activate the EGF and other signal pathways, enhancing the spontaneous conversion of CD44<sup>-</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> TNBC into CSCs and their metastasis. These novel findings may provide insights into the molecular process of non-CSCs conversion into CSCs, leading to breast cancer progression and delayed distant metastasis. Therefore, the current findings may uncover a novel biomarker for prognosis and therapeutic target for intervention of breast cancer, particularly for TNBC.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by grants from The National Natural Science Foundation of China (#81572609), the Major Project Construction Foundation of China Medical University (#2017ZDZX05) and Liaoning Province young top talent project (#XLYC1807099).</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Reviewing Editor, eLife</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Validation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Resources, Software, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Writing - original draft, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Software, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Data curation, Software</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Formal analysis, Funding acquisition</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Conceptualization, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1"><p>Animal experimentation: The experimental protocol was approved by the Animal Research and Care Committee of China Medical University (Shenyang, China) and followed the Guidelines of the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals issued by the Chinese Council on Animal Research.

describes a possible link between the presence of CD44-/CD24- cells and post-operative site distant metastasis. The functional significance of CSC, particularly of the phenotype CD44-/CD24- remains elusive and is worthy of careful evaluation. The strength of the study is the inclusion of a large number of patient samples, which were used in a retrospective analysis. The resulting data provide the rationale for the application of contemporary technologies in the evaluation of CDX and PDX models. As such, this work paves the way for further investigation at a mechanistic and translational level, which may lead to a better understanding of breast cancer metastasis.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Association of CD44 -/CD24 -Breast Cancer Cells with Late Stage Tumor Recurrence&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Robin Anderson (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Referees comments must be addressed in a convincing manner, with additional data.</p><p>2) Edits are required in all sections of the manuscript.</p><p>3) If extensively revised, this manuscript would represent an incremental contribution in the field of breast cancer biology.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors set out to demonstrate the importance of a subset of cancer cells lacking CD44 and CD24, in promoting tumor progression, metastasis and resistance to therapy. They analyse archival breast tissues from patients where the clinical outcome – development of metastasis and therapy response – are known. They then take this information into cell culture experiments, seeking the mechanism that underlies the importance of these CD44-/CD24- cells. Their major premise is that these double negative cells can de-differentiate into cancer stem cells that subsequently promote metastasis and chemotherapy resistance.</p><p>The overall concept of this study is good and the cell-based results are mainly clear. However, the archival tissue analysis needs clarification, as does the RNAseq analysis, as detailed below.</p><p>The breast cancer tissues are scored by immunofluorescence for expression of CD44 and CD24, but there is no indication that these two markers are being scored only in tumor cells rather than in all lineages within the tumor microenvironment. This is an important point that must be clarified. Also, the RNAseq analysis is reported to be conducted on single cells, but the data presented do not indicate if this is actually the case and how many replicate samples were analysed and which sample yielded each heat map pattern. Again clarification is required before the data can be interpreted.</p><p>Finally, the conclusion from this study is that RHBDL2 induces spontaneous conversion of CD44-/CD24- cells into CD44+/CD24- cells via YAP1, USP31 and decreased NFkB signaling. This may well be the case, but has not been proven by the experiments presented here. Whilst DHBDL2 does alter YAP, USP31 and NFkB, it could also be working through an alternate pathway to induce CSCs.</p><p>1. Figure 1 and S1 and S2A score the numbers of samples with the varying CD44/CD24 protein levels. For Figure S1, this is shown by immunofluorescence, but there is no indication of whether the cells being analysed are tumor cells or host cells from the microenvironment. There should be co-staining for EpCAM or CK19 to confirm that tumor cells only are being scored. I am assuming that the data shown in Figure S2A are actually from the immunostaining and not from flow cytometry analysis as stated in the figure legend? If this was a flow analysis, there is no description of the origin or processing of the samples reported in Figure 1A for flow cytometry. The legend for Figure S2A states that the data are stratifying only metastatic tumors, but in Figure 1A, apparently many of the tumors showed no metastasis. All these points need to be clarified/corrected.</p><p>2. This first section of the manuscript is poorly presented and I am struggling to follow the arguments and data being provided. Many of the figures are mis-labelled in the text and they are not presented in consecutive order as discussed in the text. For some references to data in the text where the wrong figure has been cited, I cannot even find the correct figure.</p><p>3. Possibly the way the data are presented, with some figures referring to the training set and other figures to the test set is adding to the confusion when it is not clearly stated which set is under discussion at the time.</p><p>4. Late metastasis – better phrased as delayed metastasis.</p><p>5. The sentence in the Introduction: &quot;Previous studies have shown that CD44+/CD24- breast CSCs might be a dominant factor in relapse of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), due to their possession of potent self-renewal and differentiation capacities to differentiate into mature CD44-/CD24-, CD44+/CD24+, and CD44-/CD24+ cancer cells (Geng et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014)&quot;. It is not at all clear to me that the references provided support this comment. Geng et al. do not mention CD44-/CD24- cells at all, and Wang et al. do not discuss differentiation of CD44+/CD24- into the other phenotypes. Only CD44- cells are mentioned, not CD24.</p><p>6. Sentence in Introduction: &quot;Indeed, injection of up to 1000 breast CSCs was able to generate a solid tumor mass in immunocompromised mice (Chaffer et al., 2011; Iliopoulos et al., 2011).&quot; Please clarify. It is not obvious to me that Chaffer et al. specified how many CSCs they injected and Iliopoulos et al. showed that as few as 50 CSCs could form tumors.</p><p>7. Sentence in Introduction: &quot;Moreover, previous studies reported that non-CSCs, such as CD44-/CD24- TNBC cells, are able to spontaneously convert into CSCs to renew the CSC pool, resulting in chemoresistance (Gruber et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2015; Ye et al., 2018).&quot; The statement being referenced is for non-CSCs in TNBC, but Gruber et al. and Ye et al. are not reporting on TNBC.</p><p>8. Figure 1B – please explain more fully how the cut-off of 19.5% CD44-/CD24- was determined.</p><p>9. Figure 1C – please explain how the ratios of different subtypes of breast cancer with high or low CD44-/CD24- were calculated. According to the figure, for luminal cancers, there was a metastasis rate of ~40% in the high group and less then 10% in the low group. How were the numbers of 63.1% and 32.6% derived from Figure 1C?</p><p>Then the same figures are provided for Figure 2A, when using the test set. Were the data in Figure 1C from the training set? Why are the final metastasis rates exactly the same? This needs a better explanation.</p><p>10. Page 6: reference to Figure S3C should be Figure S2C?</p><p>11. Page 7 – Should Figure S5A,B actually be Figure S3?</p><p>12. Page 7: The statement: &quot;Moreover, a low CSC percentage led to different risks for developing tumor metastasis 5 years after diagnosis and adjuvant chemotherapy between the C1 and C0 patients (Figure S3D).&quot; This does not appear to apply to Figure S3D and I cannot tell to which figure this statement is referring.</p><p>13. Page 7, last sentence: &quot;In the present study, we first designed the experiments illustrated in Figure 3A to characterize the percentages of different cell subtypes among MDA-MB-231 cells using cell culture and flow cytometric cell sorting of parental MDA-MB-468 cells.&quot; If I understand correctly, this should re-worded as follows: &quot;In the present study, we first designed the experiments illustrated in Figure 3A and Figure S5 to characterize the percentages of different cell subtypes among MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells using cell culture and flow cytometric cell sorting of parental cells.</p><p>14. Figure 3C raises questions about reproducibility of the data. The profile in Figure 3C after 7 days in culture looks very different from that shown in Figure 3B.</p><p>15. Figure 5C: please explain how you obtained a weight measurement for the lung metastases. You record lung metastasis weights of up to 2 grams. Lungs typically weight about 0.2 grams. Lungs of 2 grams seem improbable, let alone metastases in lungs weighing 2 grams. Also, tumor sizes of 700 mm2 do not seem possible in lungs.</p><p>16. The RNAseq analysis requires more explanation. In Figure 6B, please explain the three columns shown in the heat map. Without their designation, the rest of this figure is hard to interpret. It seems that only one single cell per timepoint has been analysed. Is this correct? How reliable is sequencing from a single cell? Or was the analysis from many cells grown up from a single cell? How many single cells (or derivative of single cells) were analysed at each time point? There is a discrepancy between the protocol described in the text and that provided in the Methods section, when describing the RNAseq analysis. It is difficult to relate the significance of the genes shown in Panel B to the Kaplan-Meier data when it is not clear what the three columns in panel B represent.</p><p>17. Figure 6D: I assume that the &quot;*&quot; and &quot;#&quot; are meant to convey some sort of significance, but they do not appear for any of the genes assessed by RT-PCR. Does that mean that none of the changes were significant?</p><p>18. Why does the legend for Figure S6 talk about SILAC for protein analysis? Was SILAC run on these samples? Impossible on single cells. No mention of SILAC in Methods.</p><p>19. Page 10: Explain why YAP was selected for analysis following knockdown of RHBDL2. Was there a previously known connection between these two genes? For the CD44-/CD24- cells in Figure 7B, was YAP phosphorylation also altered? Please show a western demonstrating that RHBDL2 is reduced after transfection with siRHBDL2.</p><p>20. Figure 7D: text says 0.7% CD44+/CD24- but figure says 0.5% and vice versa for the MDA-MB-468 cells.</p><p>21. The text on page 11 needs re-writing. The second paragraph, commencing with &quot;We next selected…&quot; is a repeat of the text above where you have already done this step and analysed the cells by flow cytometry.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript describes a possible link between the presence of CD44-/CD24- cells and post-operative site distant metastasis. This is not a new concept, yet the actual biological function of CSC, particularly of the phenotype CD44-/CD24- remains inconclusive. The primary strength of the study is the large number of patient samples used in the retrospective analysis that provides the rationale for in vitro experiments using cultured cancer cells. Several technical and methodological limitations were identified.</p><p>The description of the patient cohort is very elusive. The bioinformatic analysis lacks in rigor as the methodology used to identify and quantitate CD44-/CD24- cells in patients is not properly described. For instance, Figure legends describe the use of flow cytometry for quantification of CD44-/CD24- negative cells from patient samples. Yet only an immunofluorescence staining is described in Results. No Methods description is given to FACS of patient samples. The manuscript seems focused on TNBC, yet the reader has a difficult time understanding how many samples are actually from TNBC patients. Two TNBC established cell lines are mentioned in the manuscript but no rationale is provided as to why some experiments are performed only with MDA-MB-468 and some with MDA-MB-231. The same is true for several other experiments. The extensive molecular description of CD44-/CD24- cell dedifferentiation into CSCs deserves distinction but will need to be confirmed in patient samples before conclusions can be drawn with regards to the biological significance of these findings to breast cancer patients and the medical community at large.</p><p>Clarify the methodology used to quantitate CD44-/CD24- in patient samples, as well as the bioinformatic analysis supporting the current hypothesis.</p><p>Provide a detailed analysis of clinical and pathologic information of the patient cohort, including histology.</p><p>Several references are 10 years old or older, new references supporting the authors finds would strength the hypothesis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65418.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The authors set out to demonstrate the importance of a subset of cancer cells lacking CD44 and CD24, in promoting tumor progression, metastasis and resistance to therapy.

It is true that RHBDL2 acts as an intramembrane serine protease that can cleave and activate other substrates, including ephrin B and others, contributing to the development and progression of malignant tumors. Actually, ephrin B has been shown to function as a prognostic factor of uterine cervical (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PMID_(identifier)">PMID</ext-link> <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25205602">25205602</ext-link> ). Unfortunately, we are unable to perform more experiments to test alternative mechanisms underlying the action of RHBDL2 in promoting distant metastasis of breast cancer due to the limited resources. In response to his/her concern, we have modified the conclusion of this study in a conservative manner and briefly discussed the potential alternative mechanisms underlying the action of RHBDL2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Figure 1 and S1 and S2A score the numbers of samples with the varying CD44/CD24 protein levels. For Figure S1, this is shown by immunofluorescence, but there is no indication of whether the cells being analysed are tumor cells or host cells from the microenvironment. There should be co-staining for EpCAM or CK19 to confirm that tumor cells only are being scored. I am assuming that the data shown in Figure S2A are actually from the immunostaining and not from flow cytometry analysis as stated in the figure legend? If this was a flow analysis, there is no description of the origin or processing of the samples reported in Figure 1A for flow cytometry. The legend for Figure S2A states that the data are stratifying only metastatic tumors, but in Figure 1A, apparently many of the tumors showed no metastasis. All these points need to be clarified/corrected.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully understand his/her concern. In this study, we performed H&amp;E staining and immunofluorescence simultaneously in a series of consecutive tissue sections. With H&amp;E stained sections, we identified tumor cells and other types of non-tumor cells in the tumor regions. Subsequently, we analyzed the numbers of CD44-CD24- tumor cells in each section as described in the method section to determine the frequency of CD44-CD24- cells in total tumor cells. We have provided the relevant H&amp;E stained sections in the revision and clarified the data in Figure S2A(now is Figure 1—figure supplement 2) by revising the figure legend in the revision. We are sorry for our carelessness to state wrong method in the Figure S2(now is Figure 1—figure supplement 2) legend</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

The sentence in the Introduction: &quot;Previous studies have shown that CD44+/CD24- breast CSCs might be a dominant factor in relapse of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), due to their possession of potent self-renewal and differentiation capacities to differentiate into mature CD44-/CD24-, CD44+/CD24+, and CD44-/CD24+ cancer cells (Geng et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014)&quot;. It is not at all clear to me that the references provided support this comment. Geng et al. do not mention CD44-/CD24- cells at all, and Wang et al. do not discuss differentiation of CD44+/CD24- into the other phenotypes. Only CD44- cells are mentioned, not CD24.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his/her careful review.

It is not obvious to me that Chaffer et al. specified how many CSCs they injected and Iliopoulos et al. showed that as few as 50 CSCs could form tumors.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his/her careful review. We have re-checked the references and found that Chaffer et al. described that injection of up to 50 breast CSCs was able to generate a solid tumor mass in immunocompromised mice.

Sentence in Introduction: &quot;Moreover, previous studies reported that non-CSCs, such as CD44-/CD24- TNBC cells, are able to spontaneously convert into CSCs to renew the CSC pool, resulting in chemoresistance (Gruber et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2015; Ye et al., 2018).&quot; The statement being referenced is for non-CSCs in TNBC, but Gruber et al. and Ye et al. are not reporting on TNBC.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his/her careful review.

Figure 1C – please explain how the ratios of different subtypes of breast cancer with high or low CD44-/CD24- were calculated.

Also, tumor sizes of 700 mm2 do not seem possible in lungs.</p></disp-quote><p>We are sorry for our carelessness. Actually, we measured the lung weights, but not the tumor weights because we cannot dissect all metastatic tumor nodules in the lung. Similarly, the tumor size data were calculated wrongly, based on the magnified images. Now, we have corrected these mistakes in the revision. Overall, our data indicated the converted CSCs had similar tumorigenicity and differential capacity in mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16. The RNAseq analysis requires more explanation. In Figure 6B, please explain the three columns shown in the heat map. Without their designation, the rest of this figure is hard to interpret. It seems that only one single cell per timepoint has been analysed. Is this correct? How reliable is sequencing from a single cell? Or was the analysis from many cells grown up from a single cell? How many single cells (or derivative of single cells) were analysed at each time point? There is a discrepancy between the protocol described in the text and that provided in the Methods section, when describing the RNAseq analysis. It is difficult to relate the significance of the genes shown in Panel B to the Kaplan-Meier data when it is not clear what the three columns in panel B represent.</p></disp-quote><p>We are sorry that we did not describe the experimental protocol in detail and present the data in Figure 6B well. We cultured CD44-/CD24- MDA-MB-231 cells in a single cell manner for 24, 72 and 120 h and they were harvested for RNAseq analysis of three single cells at each time point. We have modified the experimental protocol to specify it in the revision. Although we did single cell RNAseq the data could not be explained by single cell RNAseq, rather than general RNAseq. Accordingly, we changed the term of single cell RNAseq into RNAseq to avoid potential misleading in the revision. From the data in the heatmap, the repeated single samples display similar levels of each gene, indicative of its reliable nature. We are sorry for our carelessness and now, we have modified the manuscript to ensure the consistence between the protocol and result sections.

Indeed, the Hippo pathway is important for the stemness of tumor cells. Thus, we selected the YAP1 as a verification indicator. We did not find any available data on how RHBDL2 modulates YAP1 expression and phosphorylation in any type of tumors in the literature. In response to his/her concerns, we have performed additional experiments and found that transfection with RHDBL2-specific siRNAA effectively decreased the relative levels of its expression in CD44-/CD24- cells. More importantly, RHDBL2 silencing also decreased YAP1 expression, but increased YAP1 phosphorylation (Figure 7B), leading to increased USP31 expression and decreased NF-κB phosphorylation in CD44-/CD24- breast cancer cells. These data supported our conclusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>20.

This is not a new concept, yet the actual biological function of CSC, particularly of the phenotype CD44-/CD24- remains inconclusive. The primary strength of the study is the large number of patient samples used in the retrospective analysis that provides the rationale for in vitro experiments using cultured cancer cells. Several technical and methodological limitations were identified.</p><p>The description of the patient cohort is very elusive. The bioinformatic analysis lacks in rigor as the methodology used to identify and quantitate CD44-/CD24- cells in patients is not properly described. For instance, Figure legends describe the use of flow cytometry for quantification of CD44-/CD24- negative cells from patient samples. Yet only an immunofluorescence staining is described in Results. No Methods description is given to FACS of patient samples. The manuscript seems focused on TNBC, yet the reader has a difficult time understanding how many samples are actually from TNBC patients. Two TNBC established cell lines are mentioned in the manuscript but no rationale is provided as to why some experiments are performed only with MDA-MB-468 and some with MDA-MB-231. The same is true for several other experiments. The extensive molecular description of CD44-/CD24- cell dedifferentiation into CSCs deserves distinction but will need to be confirmed in patient samples before conclusions can be drawn with regards to the biological significance of these findings to breast cancer patients and the medical community at large.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully understand the reviewer’s concerns and we are sorry for the confusion in the manuscript. As we addressed the similar concerns from the reviewer 1, we have clarified the experimental protocols and corrected couple mistakes in the revision.

Moreover, <italic>Supplementary file 1A</italic> (Table S1) shows the number of patients with three molecular classifications and their clinical information. In addition, our data have been verified with two cell lines MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231, and these data have been added to the manuscript. In order to confirm our findings in patients’ samples, we utilized fresh specimens from breast cancer patients to isolate primary cells for data verification.
