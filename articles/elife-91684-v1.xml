symptoms in citrus plants because of the transcriptional activator-like (TAL) effector PthA4, which activates the expression of the citrus susceptibility gene <italic>CsLOB1</italic>. This study reports the regulation of the putative carbohydrate-binding protein gene <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> by PthA4-mediated induction of CsLOB1 during <italic>Xcc</italic> infection. We found that the transcription of <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> was induced by infection with <italic>Xcc</italic> in a PthA4-dependent manner. Even though it specifically bound to a putative TAL effector-binding element in the <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> promoter, PthA4 exerted a suppressive effect on the promoter activity. In contrast, CsLOB1 bound to the <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> promoter to activate its expression. The silencing of <italic>CsLOB1</italic> significantly reduced the level of expression of <italic>Cs9g12620</italic>, which demonstrated that <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> was directly regulated by CsLOB1. Intriguingly, PhtA4 interacted with CsLOB1 and exerted feedback control that suppressed the induction of expression of <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> by CsLOB1. Transient overexpression and gene silencing revealed that <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> was required for the optimal development of canker symptoms. These results support the hypothesis that the expression of <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> is dynamically directed by PthA4 for canker formation through the PthA4-mediated induction of CsLOB1.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Xanthomonas citri</italic> subsp. <italic>citri</italic></kwd><kwd>citrus bacterial canker</kwd><kwd><italic>Citrus sinensis</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31872919</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zou</surname><given-names>Huasong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31801696</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fan</surname><given-names>Xiaojing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31701752</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhuo</surname><given-names>Tao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The putative carbohydrate-binding protein gene <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> by PthA4-mediated induction of CsLOB1 during <italic>Xcc</italic> infection.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Citrus canker is a severe bacterial disease that impacts the production of citrus because it affects most commercial cultivars of citrus in tropical and subtropical areas. The early symptoms on leaves, stems, and fruits are characterized by tiny, slightly raised blister-like lesions with water-soaked margins, which then develop into necrotic, raised lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brunings and Gabriel, 2003</xref>). In addition to the severe defoliation and premature fruit dehiscence that usually occur on heavily infected trees, the blemished fruits also have significantly reduced commercial value. The citrus canker is associated with five different bacterial pathotypes, including three pathotypes of <italic>Xanthomonas citri</italic> subsp. <italic>citri</italic> (<italic>Xcc</italic>) (A, A*, and A<sup>w</sup>) and two pathotypes of <italic>X. fuscans</italic> subsp. <italic>aurantifolii</italic> (B and C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gottwald et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sun et al., 2004</xref>). The <italic>Xcc</italic> A-type canker is the most prevalent and affects a wide range of hosts, including <italic>Citrus</italic> spp. and many closely related rutaceous plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Graham et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p><italic>Xcc</italic> PthA4 is a transcription activator-like (TAL) effector that is delivered into host plants by a type III secretion system (T3SS). The <italic>Xcc</italic> strains defective in the <italic>pthA4</italic> gene cannot cause canker symptoms on their normal hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Saadi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yan and Wang, 2012</xref>). Uniquely, <italic>pthA4</italic> alone induces weak canker phenotypes in citrus leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Saadi et al., 2007</xref>). The heterologous expression of T3SS and <italic>pthA4</italic> homologous genes in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> elicits similar canker symptoms in citrus but not in tobacco (<italic>Nicotiana benthianum</italic>), soybean (<italic>Glycine max</italic>), or cotton (<italic>Gossypium hirsutum</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kanamori and Tsuyumu, 1998</xref>). Variants of the PthA4 effector are widely present across all five bacterial subspecies that cause citrus canker disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Swarup et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Saadi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jalan et al., 2013</xref>). PthA4 acts as a major virulence determinant for the formation of cankers when translocated into the nuclei of its citrus host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yang and Gabriel, 1995</xref>). The superhelical structure of this TAL effector recognizes host sequences through its repeat variable di-residue (RVD), which specifically recognizes the effector-binding element (EBE) in the gene promoter of host plants, and thus, activates the expression of host target gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Deng et al., 2012</xref>). Notably, PthA4 acts in a protein–protein interaction manner during infection with <italic>Xcc</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Domingues et al., 2010</xref>). In addition to the proteins associated with DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Domingues et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">de Souza et al., 2012</xref>), PthA4 specifically interacts with citrus CsMAF1 and releases the suppressive effect on RNA Polymerase III to increase the transcription of tRNA and cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Soprano et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, <italic>Xcc</italic> PthA4 functions through versatile mechanisms and modulates target genes not only at the transcriptional level but also at the protein level.</p><p>PthA4 activates the transcription of the <italic>CsLOB1</italic> susceptibility gene in host citrus plants owing to the TAL effector DNA-binding principles and specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Moscou and Bogdanove, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boch et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2014</xref>). Remarkably, gene editing of the coding region or promoter sequence of <italic>CsLOB1</italic> has been used to promote the resistance of citrus to infection with <italic>Xcc</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Peng et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>CsLOB1</italic> belongs to the lateral organ boundary domain (LBD) gene family, which encodes a set of plant-specific transcription factors (TFs) that contain cysteine-rich DNA-binding motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Husbands et al., 2007</xref>). Plant LBD genes are involved in the regulation of plant growth, as well as the production of anthocyanins and nitrogen metabolism, and also respond to both hormonal and environmental stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Majer and Hochholdinger, 2011</xref>). There are as many as 36 LBD proteins in citrus plants. CsLOB2 and CsLOB3 show the same involvement in inducing the formation of pustules as CsLOB1 when they are induced by <italic>Xcc</italic>, which expresses an artificial TAL effector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). In this case, many differentially expressed citrus genes have been identified, including those related to cell wall metabolism. However, the CsLOB2 and CsLOB3 promoters do not contain specific binding elements for PthA4; thus, neither can be induced by PthA4 during infection by <italic>Xcc</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Since <italic>CsLOB1</italic> is a TF, elucidating its downstream target genes is particularly important to understand the molecular events associated with the development of pustule symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2014</xref>). PthA4 and CsLOB1 form a regulatory cascade that activate the citrus genes during <italic>Xcc</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Duan et al., 2018</xref>). Our previous research showed that the ectopic expression of the TAL gene <italic>avrXa7</italic> in <italic>Xcc</italic> suppressed the development of cankers but induced a yellowing phenotype around the inoculation site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sun et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, 138 upregulated citrus plant genes were identified to respond to wildtype (WT) <italic>Xcc</italic> infection but were relatively downregulated in leaves inoculated with <italic>Xcc</italic> 29-1 that expresses <italic>avrXa7</italic>. This study aimed to characterize the target genes of the citrus hosts that are directly regulated by the PthA4-mediated induction of CsLOB1 during <italic>Xcc</italic> infection, as well as its potential role in canker development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The expression of <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> depends on <italic>pthA4</italic> during <italic>Xcc</italic> infection</title><p>Our previous study on a transcriptome analysis reported that 138 genes were upregulated in citrus plants infected with the WT <italic>Xcc</italic> and downregulated in plants inoculated with <italic>Xcc</italic> that expressed <italic>avrXa7</italic>. Those genes were assumed to be related to the major <italic>Xcc</italic> virulence effector PthA4. PthA4 has 17.5 RVDs in its central domain that correspond to an EBE of 18 nucleotides of the target gene promoter. Based on the TAL effector–DNA-binding code, PthA4 can bind an optimal EBE of the 19 bp oligonucleotide -<named-content content-type="sequence">TATAAACCCCCAATACCCT</named-content>-, in which the first nucleotide ‘T’ at 0 position is strictly conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Even though the levels of expression of <italic>pthA4</italic>, <italic>CsLOB1</italic>, and <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> were enhanced at 5 and 10 days post-inoculation (dpi) compared with 0 dpi, their pattern of expression differed between 5 and 10 dpi. <italic>pthA4</italic> and <italic>CsLOB1</italic> showed the highest levels of expression at 10 dpi. In contrast, the level of expression of <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> at 10 dpi was lower than that at 5 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). To verify this special pattern of expression, <italic>Xcc</italic> strain 049, its TAL-free mutant <italic>Xcc</italic> 049E, and <italic>Xcc</italic> 049E that expressed <italic>pthA4</italic> (<italic>Xcc</italic>049E/<italic>pthA4</italic>) were inoculated on <italic>C. sinensis</italic> plants.

The efficiency of gene silencing was evaluated in 1-month-old leaves at 60 days post-stem inoculation. The infection by CTV was indicated by verification of the transcripts of CTV <italic>P23</italic> gene. The transcript level of <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> was then verified to be reduced by approximately 70% in the gene-silenced <italic>C. sinensis</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Inoculation of the WT <italic>Xcc</italic> 29-1 caused remarkably attenuated canker symptoms in the <italic>Cs9g12620</italic>-silenced plants. In comparison with the control plants that were infected with empty CTV, there were remarkably fewer symptoms on the <italic>Cs9g12620</italic>-silenced plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). The <italic>Xcc</italic> 29-1 in the <italic>Cs9g12620</italic>-silenced plants grew more slowly than in the control plants. Significantly fewer cell numbers were isolated from the <italic>Cs9g12620</italic>-silenced plants than from the control plants at 2, 4, and 6 days post-inoculation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). The expression levels of <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> and <italic>CsLOB1</italic> genes in <italic>Cs9g12620</italic>-silenced plants inoculated with <italic>Xcc</italic> 29-1 showed that the induced transcription levels of both were decreased, and the expression levels of <italic>pthA4</italic> were also significantly decreased, downregulated by 38%, 15%, and 16%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). The TAL-free 049E caused extremely wreak canker symptom, and wildtype 049 and 049E/<italic>pthA4</italic> caused severe canker on control plants. On <italic>Cs9g12620</italic>-silenced plants, wildtype 049 and 049E/<italic>pthA4</italic> caused greatly reduced canker symptom, while the 049E/<italic>pthA4</italic> caused weak canker symptom alike to TAL-free mutant 049E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). Furthermore, the population of 049 and 049E/<italic>pthA4</italic> recovered from <italic>Cs9g12620</italic>-silenced plants was lower than that in control plants. In contrast, population of 049E was low in either <italic>Cs9g12620</italic>-silenced or control plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). This demonstrated expression of <italic>pthA4</italic> in 049E did not restore bacterial virulence on <italic>Cs9g12620</italic>-silenced plants. The level of expression of <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> is correlated with the formation of canker symptoms in citrus plants.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The ectopic expression of <italic>avrXa7</italic> in <italic>Xcc</italic> 29-1 did not induce canker symptoms on citrus plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sun et al., 2018</xref>), which was consistent with a previous study that reported that the browning phenotype was elicited by an <italic>Xcc</italic> L2 strain that expressed <italic>avrXa7</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ishihara et al., 2003</xref>). This was hypothesized to be caused by two groups of differentially expressed genes, including (1) resistance genes induced by AvrXa7, and (2) susceptibility genes induced by PthA4 but suppressed by the expression of AvrXa7. A transcriptome analysis was utilized to identify the different relevant citrus genes and showed that AvrXa7 specifically activated the aspartic protease gene <italic>Cs7g06780.1</italic> and linoleate 13S-lipoxygenase gene <italic>orange1.1t03773.1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sun et al., 2018</xref>). In this study, we focused on identification of the genes induced by PthA4 for canker formation. Based on the pattern of expression and analysis of promoter activity, Cs9g12620 was proven to be dynamically regulated by the PthA4-mediated induction of CsLOB1 for the development of canker symptoms. This supported the hypothesis that the PthA4-mediated induction of CsLOB1 serves a critical role in the complicated regulatory network on gene expression during <italic>Xcc</italic> infection.</p><p>The original purpose of this study was to explore the genes that were directly targeted by PthA4 through TAL effector–DNA recognition. Based on a sequence analysis, the two genes <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> and <italic>CsLOB1</italic> were predicted to contain PthA4 EBEs. An analysis of the pattern of expression revealed that <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> and <italic>CsLOB1</italic> were induced by <italic>Xcc</italic> infection in a PthA4-dependent manner. Because the susceptibility gene <italic>CsLOB1</italic> has already been proven to be targeted by <italic>Xcc</italic> PthA4, the binding and regulatory role of PthA4 on the <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> promoter was assayed experimentally. Y1H, EMSA, and promoter reporter fusion analyses were used and enabled the conclusion that PthA4 bound to the <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> promoter, whereas it suppressed the promoter activity. Since two CsLOB1 putative binding sites were predicted from the <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> promoter, we demonstrated that CsLOB1 bound directly to the <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> promoter. Most importantly, CsLOB1 could activate the <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> promoter. As such, <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> is actually a target of <italic>CsLOB1</italic>.</p><p>The ectopic expression of <italic>CsLOB1</italic> restores the mutant canker symptoms of <italic>Xcc pthA4</italic>, which demonstrates that <italic>CsLOB1</italic> is the key target of PthA4 and thus, induces pustule symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Duan et al., 2018</xref>). The transient overexpression of CsLOB1 did not induce an obvious phenotype in the citrus plant leaves, which was consistent with the findings of previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hu et al., 2014</xref>). Instead, the contribution of CsLOB1 to canker symptoms has been verified by the transformation of ‘Duncan’ grapefruit (<italic>Citrus</italic> x <italic>paradisi</italic>) plants with a 35S:CsLOB1-glucocorticoid receptor construct, which suggested that the continuous expression of CsLOB1 is essential for the development of canker symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Duan et al., 2018</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Duan et al., 2018</xref> reported that a number of citrus genes appear to be associated with <italic>CsLOB1</italic>, but only the <italic>Cs2g20600</italic> promoter probe interacted with CsLOB1. <italic>Cs2g20600</italic> encodes a zinc finger C3HC4-type RING finger protein with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Duan et al., 2018</xref>). In this study, we found that <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> was another target that is directly regulated by CsLOB1. The regulatory role of <italic>CsLOB1</italic> includes promoting host cell proliferation, regulating citrus cell wall remodeling, and affecting hormone signaling pathways, which is accompanied by the optimal growth of <italic>Xcc</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zou et al., 2021</xref>). Although it has been reported to specifically bind to -CGGC- in its target promoter region, CsLOB1 retained the ability to bind the <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> promoter DNA when the two specific binding sites LB1 and LB2 were deleted. We hypothesized that there are other putative binding sites of CsLOB1 in the <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> promoter, and multiple citrus genes are directly targeted by CsLOB1 for the development of cankers during <italic>Xcc</italic> infection.</p><p>PthA4 acts as a sole disease TAL required by <italic>Xcc</italic> to cause symptoms of canker on citrus plants. It localizes to the nuclei following secretion into host cell by the T3SS. A transient overexpression analysis showed that PthA4 exhibited a particular suppressive effect on the CsLOB1-activated <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> promoter activity. Since the PthA4-binding site is critical for activity of the <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> promoter, the binding of PthA4 suppressed the promoter activity. This prompted us to study whether PthA4 affects CsLOB1 alternatively. Y2H and pull-down assays showed that PthA4 interacted with CsLOB1 at the protein–protein level. This provided a new insight to study the dynamical regulatory role of PthA4 during <italic>Xcc</italic> infection since we found that PthA4 affects the expression of <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> in a dose-dependent manner. When PthA4 was expressed at a high level at 10 dpi, the level of expression of <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> was surprisingly lower. This suggested that there is a precise mechanism of the PthA4-CsLOB1-<italic>Cs9g12620</italic> regulatory cascade during infection with <italic>Xcc</italic>.</p><p>Although the amino acid sequence of Cs9g12650 was 86.3% homologous with that of Cs9g12620, they differed in their promoter sequences. The promoter of <italic>Cs9g12650</italic> lacks 22 bp of nucleotides at its 3’ terminus, which are critical for the activity of its promoter. The activity of <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> promoter was completely lost if the 22 bp sequence was deleted by mutation. Therefore, <italic>Cs9g12650</italic> is not transcribed in citrus plants. This supported the hypothesis that the null activity of <italic>Cs9g12650</italic> promoter was owing to genetic diversity in citrus plants, which leads to different patterns of expression between the two paralogs in citrus. The 22 bp sequence at the <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> promoter could be a potential site for gene editing to create citrus plants that are resistant to citrus canker. A similar regulation of expression has been found in <italic>CsLOB1</italic>; CsLOB2 and CsLOB3 show the same ability to induce pustule formation as CsLOB1, but their promoters do not contain the PthA4 EBE; therefore, neither can be induced by PthA4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The Cs9g12620 protein contains three distinctive conserved domains, including a signal peptide, a duplicated DUF642 region, and a bacterial exosortase protein domain. The duplicated DUF642 region has been shown to be a carbohydrate-binding domain. The exosortase system is involved in directing transport across the plasma membrane, with additional posttranslational modifications, such as glycosylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haft et al., 2012</xref>). This system is distributed across many biofilm-producing environmental bacteria and is closely related to the <italic>N</italic>-acyl amino acid synthases in Proteobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Craig et al., 2011</xref>). It was hypothesized that Cs9g12620 could possibly be involved in the transportation of carbohydrates in citrus cells. This was similar to the SWEET genes induced by the effectors that pathogenic bacteria secrete into plants, and they export intracellular sugar into the extracellular space, which can be utilized by pathogenic bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hu et al., 2014</xref>). The binding of carbohydrates and the exact role for canker formation merits further study.</p><p>In conclusion, the putative carbohydrate-binding protein gene <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> was identified as a target of CsLOB1, which was directly regulated by PthA4-mediated induction of CsLOB1. In addition to the enhanced pattern of expression in response to <italic>Xcc</italic> infection, <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> was dynamically feedback regulated by PthA4 in a dose-dependent manner. At the early infection stage, the presence of PthA4 is responsible for the induction of CsLOB1, which is necessary for the activation of Cs9g12620. At the late infection stage, the over-redundancy of PthA4 exerts a feedback suppression effect on the activation of <italic>Cs9g12620</italic> by CsLOB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).

The authors identified a homolog of Cs9g12620, which has variations in the promoter region. The authors show PthA4 suppresses Cs9g12620 promoter activity independent of the binding action. The authors also show that CsLOB1 binds to the promoter of Cs9g12620. Interestingly, the authors show that PthA4 interacts with CsLOB1 at protein level. Finally, it shows that Cs9g12620 is important for canker symptoms. Overall, this study has reported some interesting discoveries and the writing is generally well done. However, the discoveries are affected by the reliability of the data and some flaws of the experimental designs.</p><p>Here are some major issues:</p><p>The authors have demonstrated that Cs9g12620 contains the EBE of PthA4 in the promoter region, to show that PthA4 controls Cs9g12620, the authors need to compare to the wild type Xcc and pthA4 mutant for Cs9g12620 expression. The data in Figure 1 is not enough.</p><p>The authors confirmed the interaction between PthA4 and the EBE in the promoter of Cs9g12620 using DNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). However, Fig. 2B is not convincing. The lane without GST-PthA4 also clearly showed mobility shift. For EMSA assay, the authors need also to include non-labeled probe as competitor to verify the specificity. The description of the EMSA in this paper suggests that it was not done properly. It is suggested the authors to redo this EMSA assay following the protocol: Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) for detecting protein-nucleic acid interactions PMID: 17703195.</p><p>The authors also claimed that PthA4 suppresses the promote activity of Cs9g12620. The data is not convincing and also contradicts with their own data that overexpression of Cs9g12620 causes canker and silencing of it reduces canker considering PthA4 is required for canker development. The authors conducted the assays using transient expression of PthA4. It should be done with Xcc wild type, pthA4 mutant and negative control to inoculate citrus plants to check the expression of Cs9g12620.</p><p>Fig. 6 AB is not convincing. There are no apparent differences. The variations shown in B is common in different wild type samples. It is suggested that the authors to conduct transgenic instead of transient overexpression.</p><p>Gene silencing data needs more appropriate controls. Fig. D. seems to suggest canker symptoms actually happen for the RNAi treated. The authors need to make sure same amount of Xcc was used for both CTV empty vector and the RNAi. It is suggested a blink test is needed here.</p><p>Comments on revised version:</p><p>Point 1: Addressed well.</p><p>Point 2: The EMSA was reconducted with adding unlabeled DNA, however, the results are still not convincing. Firstly, in fig.3D lane 5, with the absence of unlabeled DNA, the shifted bound signal wasn't reduced significantly. Secondly, still in fig.3D lane 5, the free labeled DNA probe at the bottom of the gel didn't increase. Which together mean that the unlabeled DNA was unable to compete with the labeled DNA and the &quot;bound&quot; shifted bands might not be true positive.</p><p>Point 3: The authors didn't address the question clearly regarding the connection between the inhibition of Cs9g12620 promoter by PthA4 and the positive function of Cs9g12620 on citrus canker.</p><p>Point 4: The comment was not addressed. Fig.7A and B are not convincing. Firstly, no evidence shows the expression of transiently expressed genes. Secondly, hard to tell the difference in 7A. Thirdly, since CsLOB1 positively regulates Cs9g12620, why expressing of CsLOB1 is unable to cause phenotype, while expression of PthA4 does?</p><p>Point 5: addressed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.91684.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Xinyu</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Fuzhou</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zou</surname><given-names>Huasong</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Huzhou College</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Huzhou</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhuo</surname><given-names>Tao</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Fuzhou</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Rou</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Fuzhou</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Fuzhou</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Fan</surname><given-names>Xiaojing</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Fuzhou</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p><p>Point 1: The authors have demonstrated that Cs9g12620 contains the EBE of PthA4 in the promoter region, to show that PthA4 controls Cs9g12620, the authors need to compare to the wild type Xcc and pthA4 mutant for Cs9g12620 expression. The data in Figure 1 is not enough.</p></disp-quote><p>The data in Figure 1 D and E show a pthA4 Tn5 insertion mutant Mxac126-80 and the expression level of Cs9g12620 in citrus inoculated with the pthA4 mutant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point 2: The authors confirmed the interaction between PthA4 and the EBE in the promoter of Cs9g12620 using DNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). However, Figure 2B is not convincing. The lane without GST-PthA4 also clearly showed a mobility shift. For the EMSA assay, the authors need also to include a non-labeled probe as a competitor to verify the specificity. The description of the EMSA in this paper suggests that it was not done properly. It is suggested the authors redo this EMSA assay following the protocol: Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) for detecting protein-nucleic acid interactions PMID: 17703195.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for your comments. We have re-conducted the EMSA analysis based on your suggestion. The DNA probe was labeled with Cy5, included a non-labeled probe as a competitor. (Figure 3 B and D; Figure 4B and E)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point 3: The authors also claimed that PthA4 suppresses the promote activity of Cs9g12620. The data is not convincing and also contradicts with their own data that overexpression of Cs9g12620 causes canker and silencing of it reduces canker considering PthA4 is required for canker development. The authors conducted the assays using transient expression of PthA4. It should be done with Xcc wild type, pthA4 mutant, and negative control to inoculate citrus plants to check the expression of Cs9g12620.</p></disp-quote><p>We have detected Cs9g12620 expression in silencing citrus plants inoculated wild type Xcc 29-1. (Figure 7F)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point 4: Figure 6 AB is not convincing. There are no apparent differences. The variations shown in B are common in different wild-type samples. It is suggested that the authors conduct transgenic instead of transient overexpression.</p></disp-quote><p>It has been proven that transient expression of PthA4 leads to canker-like phenotype, suggesting that this experiment is effective. However, it will be more confident if conduct transgenic plant overexpressing pthA4 and Cs9g12620. We’ll create the plants in our following research to confirm the phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point 5: Gene silencing data needs more appropriate controls. Figure D seems to suggest canker symptoms actually happen for the RNAi treated. The authors need to make sure the same amount of Xcc was used for both CTV empty vector and the RNAi. It is suggested a blink test is needed here.</p></disp-quote><p>We used the same amount of Xcc to inoculate CTV empty vector and the RNAi. In either inoculation, the cultured Xcc cells were suspended in sterile distilled water to a final concentration of 108 CFU/mL (OD600 = 0.3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point 6: Figure 1. Please draw a figure to clearly show the location of the EBE in the promoter of Cs9g12620, including the transcription start site, and translational start site.</p></disp-quote><p>The EBE in Cs9g12620 promoter was indicated by underlined in Figure supplement 1. We did not sure about the translation start site, but the translation start site was labelled.</p></body></sub-article></article>
