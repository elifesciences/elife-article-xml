We previously reported that cell-free chromatin particles (cfChPs) - chromosomal fragments released from the billions of dying cells that circulate in human blood - are horizontally transferred to healthy cells with biological effects. However, the underlying mechanism and function of these effects remained unclear. We treated NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts cells with cfChPs isolated from human serum and serially passaged the cells. The intracellular activities of cfChPs were analysed using chromatin fibre fluorography, cytogenetic analysis, immunofluorescence, and fluorescent in situ hybridisation. We discovered that the internalised cfChPs were almost exclusively comprised of non-coding DNA, and the disparate DNA sequences contained within them had randomly combined to form complex concatemers, some of which were multi-mega base pairs in size. The concatemers autonomously performed many functions attributable to the nuclear genome such as DNA, RNA and protein synthesis. They harboured human LINE-1 and <italic>Alu</italic> elements, with the potential to rearrange themselves within the mouse genome. Our results suggest that a cell simultaneously harbours two autonomous genome forms: one that is inherited (hereditary genome) and numerous others that are acquired (satellite genomes). The satellite genomes may have evolutionary functions given their ability to serve as vehicles for transposable elements and to generate a plethora of novel proteins. Our results also suggest that ‘within-self’ HGT may occur in mammals on a massive scale via the medium of cfChP concatemers that have undergone extensive and complex modifications resulting in their behaviour as ‘foreign’ genetic elements.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>horizontal gene transfer</kwd><kwd>cell-free chromatin</kwd><kwd>mammalian evolution</kwd><kwd>non-coding DNA</kwd><kwd>supernumerary genome</kwd><kwd>transposable elemets</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001502</institution-id><institution>Department of Atomic Energy, Government of India</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CTC-TMC</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mittra</surname><given-names>Indraneel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Uptake of cell-free chromatin particles released from dying cells and carrying non-coding DNA could redefine mammalian genomics.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) plays an important role in the adaptation of microorganisms to changing environments and in evolutionary processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bushman, 2002</xref>). However, defining the occurrence of HGT in mammals has been a challenge. Nonetheless, experimental studies on HGT have offered insight into the regulations and functions of exogenously introduced genes and facilitated the design of drug-resistant cells, transgenic plants, and animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hofmann et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nagler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Puonti-Kaerlas et al., 1990</xref>). Indeed, gene therapy is founded on the principle of HGT, and several studies have indicated that oncogenes can be horizontally transferred across mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anker et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergsmedh et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dvořáková et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">García-Olmo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Trejo-Becerril et al., 2012</xref>). These observations support the hypothesis that HGT may occur naturally in mammalian cells and contributes to evolutionary, and potentially oncogenic, processes.</p><p>Several hundred billion to trillion cells die in the human body every day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fliedner et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sender and Milo, 2021</xref>) and release chromosomal fragments in the form of cell-free chromatin particles (cfChPs), which enter the extracellular compartments, including the circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Holdenrieder and Stieber, 2009</xref>). We previously reported that cfChPs circulating in the blood, and those that are released locally from dying cells, are readily internalised by living cells through horizontal transfer followed by their association with the host cell genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mittra et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mittra et al., 2017</xref>). The latter was confirmed by whole-genome sequencing and fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) analysis, as well as by the detection of multiple human <italic>Alu</italic> elements in the mouse recipient cells. Cellular uptake of cfChPs has several biological ramifications such as induction of DNA damage and the activation of inflammatory and apoptotic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mittra et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mittra et al., 2017</xref>). Given the high turnover of cells, it can be assumed that all cells in the body continually internalise horizontally transferred cfChPs throughout their lifespan, leading to somatic mosaicism, which may be associated with ageing, chronic diseases, and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Raghuram et al., 2019</xref>). However, the mechanisms and processes governing the intracellular consequences of horizontally transferred cfChPs remain unclear.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the intracellular processes and functions that regulate the various biological activities of cfChPs. We selected NIH3T3 mouse fibroblast cells for our experiments as we have extensive experience using this cell line for studies relating to cellular transformation, and these cells have also been widely used in various studies relating to oncogene discovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Parada et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Santos et al., 1982</xref>). In our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mittra et al., 2015b</xref>), we investigated the relative biological activities and functions of healthy and cancerous cfChPs. We found that cfChPs isolated from cancer patients had significantly greater activity in terms of DNA damage and activation of apoptotic pathways than those isolated from healthy individuals. We have also reported that cfChPs released locally from dying cells can horizontally transfer themselves into healthy bystander cells, leading to DNA damage and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mittra et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, in the present study, we treated NIH3T3 cells with cfChPs isolated from the sera of both cancer patients and healthy individuals, as well as with those released from hypoxia-induced dying MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. The cells were serially passaged following cfChPs treatment, and using chromatin fibre fluorography, cytogenetic analysis, and treatment with appropriate antibodies and fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) probes, we analysed the intracellular dynamics and processes that regulate the functional properties of the internalised cfChPs. The results of these experiments are presented in this article, which suggests that they may help to throw new light on mammalian evolution, ageing and cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The results of the study are summarized in <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>.</p><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="elife-103771-video1.mp4" id="video1"><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>A complete summary of our work.</title></caption></media><p>Our results are described under three separate headings depending on whether NIH3T3 cells were treated with cfChPs isolated from sera of cancer patients or healthy individuals or with cfChPs that were released from hypoxia-induced dying MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Most of the experiments were conducted using cfChPs isolated from cancer patients because of our special interest in cancer and our earlier results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mittra et al., 2015b</xref>), which had shown that cfChPs isolated from cancer patients had significantly greater activity in terms of DNA damage and activation of apoptotic pathways than those isolated from healthy individuals. The majority of experiments were performed more than once with reproducible results.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experiments using cfChPs from cancer patients</title><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>cfChPs are rapidly and abundantly internalised by NIH3T3 mouse fibroblast cells</title><p>We isolated cfChPs from the sera of cancer patients by a protocol described by us earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mittra et al., 2015b</xref>). A representative electron microscopy image of the cfChPs is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. In order to track the intracellular activities of cfChPs, we fluorescently dually labelled the isolated cfChPs in their DNA with Platinum Bright Red 550 and in their histones with ATTO-488 and applied them (10 ng) to NIH3T3 mouse fibroblast cells. A representative image of isolated cfChPs that had been fluorescently dually labelled and used to treat the NIH3T3 cells is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>. Examination of NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts treated with the dually fluorescently labelled cfChPs confirmed our earlier observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mittra et al., 2015b</xref>) that cfChPs can readily and rapidly horizontally transfer themselves to healthy cells via phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mittra et al., 2017</xref>) to accumulate in their cytoplasm and nuclei by 6 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). The fluorescent cfChPs appeared prominent, ostensibly owing to the amalgamation of multiple cfChPs to form large concatemers following their cellular entry (described in detail later). Chromatin fibres prepared from similarly treated NIH3T3 cells at 6 hr revealed the presence of numerous dually labelled cfChPs of varying sizes, which were present in both the cytoplasm and overlapping with mouse chromatin fibres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). Since chromatin fibres are derived from interphase cells, we further investigated whether the internalised concatemers could also be detected in metaphase cells. The detection of concatemers on metaphase spreads was of especial interest to us in view of the resurgence of interest in extra-chromosomal DNA (ecDNA) in human cancers, which have largely been conducted on metaphase chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yan et al., 2024</xref>). We were interested to examine how the cfChP concatemers might relate to the reported characteristics of cancer ecDNAs. Metaphase spreads prepared from cfChPs-treated NIH3T3 cells at 6 hr revealed many dually labelled cfChPs, some of which were associated with the chromosomes while others were present in extrachromosomal spaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Electron microscopy image of cfChPs isolated from pooled serum of patients with cancer.</title><p>A ‘beads-on-a-string’ appearance typical of chromatin is clearly seen.

To test this hypothesis, we performed FISH analysis using multiple different pairs of human chromosome-specific FISH probes on chromatin fibres and metaphase spreads prepared from cfChPs-treated NIH3T3 cells that were in continuous passage. Since these chromosome- specific probes were custom synthesised, we ensured that the probes that we used were human-specific and did not cross-react with mouse chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a and b</xref>). We detected frequent co-localisation of red and green fluorescent signals suggesting that unrelated chromosomal fragments containing disparate DNA sequences had randomly amalgamated with each other to form highly complex concatemers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Some of the concatemers appeared strikingly prominent, which is particularly evident from images presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>. This suggested that the components of the concatemer had been markedly amplified. Even the small fluorescent signals shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref> appeared as concatemers. As the analytical resolution of a FISH signal under a fluorescent microscope is in the range of 100–200 Kb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cui et al., 2016</xref>), even the small concatemers can be assumed to be at least of a similar size range. Surprisingly, we detected the fluorescence signals of chromosome 4 to co-localise with those of centromeres and of chromosome 22 to co-localise with those of telomeres. This finding highlighted the extent of genetic complexity and chaotic nature of the concatemers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, panels 4 and 5). Perhaps the ultimate evidence of the chaotic composition of the concatemers comes from our detection of co-localising signals of telomeres and centromeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, panel 6). The centromeric signal seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, panel 4 is strikingly prominent, suggesting that the concatemers had not only incorporated centromeric DNA sequences (171 bp in size) within their folds but that they had undergone large-scale amplification. Results of quantitative analysis of the degree of co-localisation of fluorescent signals generated upon treatment with FISH probes specific to different chromosome pairs are given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>. The extent of co-localisation ranged between 32.4% and 39.8%. Concatemerisation could also be detected in metaphase spreads prepared from serially passaged cfChPs-treated NIH3T3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Negative control experiments performed on native NIH3T3 cells that had not been exposed to cfChPs treatment did not react with human-specific FISH probes against chromosome 4 and chromosome 16 which were tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Internalised cfChPs combine to form complex concatemers.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) FISH analysis of chromatin fibres prepared from cfChPs-treated NIH3T3 cells in continuous passage using different combinations of human chromosome-specific FISH probes, including probes specific for the human centromere and telomere, revealing co-localised fluorescent signals (arrows).

To investigate this, we used a human long non-coding RNA probe which comprised a set of Stellaris RNA FISH probes containing a pool of up to 48 unique sequences, each labelled with a fluorophore, that collectively bind along an RNA target transcript (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

The human specificity of the RNA probe was confirmed by the demonstration that it did not bind to NIH3T3 mouse DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">Figure 17a</xref>). This finding suggested that the long non-coding RNA probe could be used as a substitute to detect human non-coding DNA.

Herein, we have reported multiple additional activities and biological processes that can be summarised as follows. The internalised cfChPs containing widely disparate DNA sequences randomly combined to form complex concatemers of variable sizes, many of which were ostensibly multi-mega base pairs in size. The concatemers exhibited variable and bizarre spatial relationships with the host cell interphase DNA, with many remaining in the cytoplasm and others being directly associated with the mouse chromosomal DNA. The concatemers once formed persisted across cell generations and showed remarkable stability. They exhibited the potential to perform many functions that are normally attributed to the nuclear genome. They could generate DNA polymerase which allowed them to synthesise DNA and independently replicate themselves without heed to the mitotic cycle of the host cell. The concatemers synthesised RNA as well as RNA polymerase, ribosomal RNA, ribosomal proteins, and numerous other human proteins in the mouse cells. The latter manifested as complex multi-peptide fusion proteins that were often highly overexpressed. Further analysis demonstrated that the concatemers harboured human LINE-1 and <italic>Alu</italic> retro-transposable elements which were associated with the enzyme DNA polymerase. The latter allowed them to increase their copy numbers and extensively amplify themselves with time in culture. The LINE-1 and Alu elements were also associated with reverse transcriptase and transposase, suggesting that they had the potential to rearrange themselves within the mouse genome leading to extensive modifications. Taken together, the above findings lead us to conclude that the concatemers that form following horizontal transfer of cfChPs act as autonomous satellite genomes which function independently of the nuclear genome. Being associated with transposable elements, they have the potential to modify the host genome in unpredictable ways, leading to somatic mosaicism - the hallmark of ageing and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vijg, 2014</xref>). Finally, the above findings could be reproduced in four other cell lines derived from different species, suggesting that horizontal transfer of cfChPs may be a universal phenomenon.</p><p>Some of the summary points mentioned above call for further elaboration. We discovered that the concatemers were primarily composed of non-coding DNA. The latter is not normally known to perform the diverse biological activities that we detected to be associated with the concatemers. This suggested that non-coding DNA has many hidden biological functions which remain dormant but are activated following cellular apoptosis to become detectable in association with the cfChP cocatemers. Our demonstration that the concatemers synthesise ribosomal RNA, RNA polymerase, and ribosomal protein suggests that they are capable of creating their own autonomous protein synthetic machinery without recourse to that of the host cell. The concatemers being composed of open chromatin are apparently able to indiscriminately transcribe their DNA via RNA polymerase, and the RNAs thus generated are translated into proteins with the help of their own ribosomal RNA and ribosomal proteins. Significantly, the newly synthesised proteins remained strictly associated with their concatemers of origin, suggesting that, although the concatemers contained the critical components of a protein synthetic machinery, they lacked the machinery required for protein sorting. Taken together, these findings suggest a novel mechanism of protein synthesis which functions autonomously without recourse to the host cell’s own protein synthetic machinery. Clearly, such an assertion, which defies existing knowledge, requires critical experimental scrutiny to define the mechanism(s) that underlie such a unique biological process.</p><p>Our detection of the unusual intracellular characteristics and functions of cfChPs and their concatemers was facilitated by several factors. First, our trans-species model comprising mouse recipient cells and cfChPs derived from human serum. This allowed us to track the activities of internalised human cfChP concatemers within the mouse cells using appropriate human-specific FISH probes and antibodies. Second, the chromatin fibre technique facilitated the detection of spatial relationships between internalised cfChPs concatemers and the mouse interphase DNA. Third, our use of human-specific DNA FISH probes and antibodies allowed the detection of short DNA sequences within the concatemers and small peptides that they synthesised by binding to the corresponding DNA sequences and peptide epitopes, respectively. These would not have been readily detectable by the standard techniques of molecular biology (discussed subsequently in the manuscript). Finally, our discovery that the non-coding RNA probe could be substituted to detect non-coding DNA allowed us to confirm that the concatemers were primarily composed of non-coding DNA and that they could perform many of the functions that are normally attributed to the genomic DNA.</p><p>Much research has been devoted to transposable elements since the seminal discovery of Barbara McClintock of ‘jumping genes’ in maize. The sequencing of the human genome has revealed that approximately 40% of the genome is composed of retro-transposable elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lander et al., 2001</xref>), and the latter has been shown to numerically increase with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">De Cecco et al., 2013</xref>). Although many theories have been proposed for this age-related increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yushkova and Moskalev, 2023</xref>), our results would suggest that the concatemers containing LINE-1 and Alu elements proliferate and amplify with time in culture by virtue of their association with DNA polymerase. Furthermore, the association of LINE-1 and Alu elements within the concatemers with reverse transcriptase and transposase suggested that the amplified retro-transposable elements have the capability to indiscriminately rearrange the host genome, potentially resulting in a degree of somatic mosaicism that would prevent the assembly of a contiguous genome. We found that this may indeed be the case, as we observed that the cfChPs-treated NIH3T3 cells began to die out beyond passage number ~250. It should be mentioned in this context that retro-transposable elements are implicated in cancer due to their ability to create genomic structural variation, alterations, and instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burns, 2017</xref>). We have earlier hypothesised that illegitimate and repeated genomic integration of cfChPs may be the underlying aetiological factor for cancer as well as ageing and age-related chronic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Raghuram et al., 2019</xref>). Taken together, the above discussion suggests that horizontal transfer of cfChPs has profound effects on genome structure and function that are critical to human health and disease. The results also raise the possibility of developing potential therapies for prevention of cancer and retardation of ageing using agents that could deactivate cfChPs before they entered into new host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mittra, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Khanvilkar and Mittra, 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pal et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pilankar et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bandiwadekar et al., 2025</xref>).</p><p>Transposable elements carried by the concatemers may also play a significant role in mammalian evolution by inserting themselves into unpredictable locations, disrupting or restoring gene function, generating new regulatory elements, and potentially inducing genomic rearrangements and instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Senft and Macfarlan, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pourrajab and Hekmatimoghaddam, 2021</xref>). However, the origin of transposable elements has remained in the realm of speculation. Many transposable elements are thought to represent remnants of ancient viruses that had become integrated into host genomes millions of years earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gilbert and Feschotte, 2018</xref>). Our demonstration that the concatemers carry LINE-1 and Alu elements suggests transposable elements are ‘foreign’ genetic elements that are acquired from dying cells via HGT. It has been proposed that generation of novel proteins resulting from gene duplication, sequence divergence, and gene combination may also have evolutionary functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bashton and Chothia, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). We speculate that the plethora of novel fusion proteins that we discovered may likewise play a role in the evolutionary process.</p><p>Conventionally, HGT refers to the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another. Although HGT occurs extensively in microorganisms, it has thus far been difficult to detect HGT in mammals. Our results suggest that HGT occurs in mammalian cells via cfChPs released from the billions of host cells that die on a daily basis. We previously proposed that circulating cfChPs released from dying cells function as a new class of mobile genetic elements (MGEs) that act intra-corporeally and transfer themselves horizontally to the organism’s own cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mittra, 2015a</xref>). Thus, ‘within-self’ HGT may occur in mammals on a massive scale via the medium of cfChP concatemers that have undergone extensive and complex modifications resulting in their behaviour as ‘foreign’ genetic elements. However, for concatemers to have evolutionary relevance in mammals, they need to be horizontally transferred to the germ line. The latter is not unlikely given the high turnover of daily cell death and release of cfChPs in the blood circulation which could carry them to all cells and tissues of the body, including the germ line cells.</p><p>Numerous attempts on our part to characterise the concatemers by conventional real-time PCR were unsuccessful. Given the complex and chaotic amalgams of disparate DNA fragments that comprise the concatemers, the primer sequences specific to a particular gene could not find the appropriate DNA sequences to bind to. Advanced sequencing techniques may help to define the complex nature of the DNA sequences that comprise the concatemers. Likewise, multiple attempts to detect the components of the fusion proteins by western blotting also failed. Even if an antibody reacted to a peptide component of a fusion protein, the band obtained would not correspond to the molecular weight of the positive control band, and the possibility of it being an artefact could not be excluded. Studies using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry may help to delineate the composition of the fusion proteins.</p><p>Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning here that we have earlier reported results of whole genome sequencing of NIH3T3 cells that had been treated with cfChPs isolated from serum of cancer patients under identical conditions as used in the present study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mittra et al., 2015b</xref>). Whole genome sequencing on Illumina GA IIX platform and bioinformatics analysis of two single cell clones (D5 and B2) developed from the cfChPs treated cells detected 25,000–28,000 strictly human reads in the mouse cell genomes. It is likely that our highly stringent alignment criteria had greatly underestimated the number of human sequences that we detected the mouse cells in that study. Computational analysis of the two clones also detected 35–47 unique human Alu repeat sequences in the recipient cells which were confirmed by PCR and Sanger sequencing. Taken together, these data support our current results that human DNA in the form of cfChPs is present in large numbers in the treated mouse cells and carry Alu elements within them.</p><p>The presence of extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) has been described in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wong and Wildman, 1972</xref>), yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Møller et al., 2015</xref>), <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shoura et al., 2017</xref>), <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stanfield and Lengyel, 1979</xref>), mice, and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Møller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shibata et al., 2012</xref>). Recently, there has been a resurgence of interest in the role of ecDNA in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yan et al., 2024</xref>). In particular, it has been suggested that ecDNA can be a source of extreme gene amplification enabling a cell to harbour multiple copies of oncogenes and can potentially promote tumour heterogeneity and therapy resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yan et al., 2024</xref>). It is believed that ecDNAs are derived from the host cell’s own genome resulting from chromothripsis, DNA damage, or genomic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wu et al., 2022</xref>). Our study, which also detected multiple highly amplified oncogene products, often appearing as fusion proteins, raises the possibility that ecDNAs that have been detected in human cancers may represent concatemers composed of cfChPs acquired from surrounding dying cancer cells via HGT. The origin and biological properties of ecDNA call for further in-depth investigations in light of our current findings.</p><p>Our study leaves many unanswered questions, and our findings will require critical validation in future research. As such, our results should be viewed as representing an expansive theory, wherein the activities of the concatemers formed by amalgamation of horizontally transferred cfChPs are governed by unknown biological processes that are distinct from those that govern the nuclear genome. Our results also suggest that non-coding DNA may have many unique biological functions which remain dormant but are activated following cellular apoptosis to become detectable in association with the cfChP cocatemers. An understanding of these unexplored biological processes could offer a new perspective on the process of mammalian evolution.</p><p>In summary, the present findings lead to a novel hypothesis that a cell simultaneously harbours two genome forms that function independently of each other: one that is inherited (hereditary genome) and numerous others that are acquired (satellite genomes). The latter, acting as autonomous genomic agents, blur the line between inherited and acquired genetic material, opening new research avenues in biology and medicine. The satellite genomes may potentially perform evolutionary functions by acting as vehicles of transposable elements and generating a plethora of novel proteins. Our findings suggest that the biological life of the genome is not a co-terminus with the death of a cell, but rather that the genome is recycled in a fragmented and extensively modified incarnation to perform new functions in distant destinations acting as ‘within-self’ foreign genetic elements. This suggests that a cell’s propensity to internalise cfChPs represents a natural biological process designed to modify the hereditary genome, which in turn may promote evolutionary change. We hypothesise that mammalian evolution is driven by ‘within-self’ HGT of cfChP concatemers that have undergone such extensive and complex modifications that they behave as ‘foreign’ genetic elements.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Isolation of cfChPs from human serum</title><p>cfChPs were isolated from sera of five patients suffering from cancer and five healthy volunteers using the protocol described by us earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mittra et al., 2015b</xref>).

The cells (10×10<sup>4</sup>) were treated with 10 ng of cfChPs isolated from the serum of cancer patients or healthy individuals and maintained in continuous culture by passaging every fourth day.

In the dual-chamber system used in these experiments, the pore size of the filter separating the two chambers was 400 µm. Consequently, the cfChPs from the dying MDA-MB-231 cells that were collected in the lower chamber were &lt;400 µm in size.

In case of immunofluorescence on metaphase spreads, the paraformaldehyde fixation step was omitted. For FISH on both chromatin fibres and metaphase spreads, the slides were dehydrated using alcohol series (70%, 80%, and 100%) followed by hybridisation overnight with appropriate FISH probes in a humidified chamber at 37 °C. In order to remove the unbound probes, the slides were washed in 0.4 X SSC at 70 °C for 1 min followed by 4 X SSCT (4 X SSC in 0.05% Tween20) washes at 45 °C for 5 min each.

Among other modifications/additions, they now mention that they think that NIH3T3 cells treated with cfChPs die out after 250 passages because of genomic instability which might be caused by horizontal transfer of cfChPs DNA into the genome of treated cells (pp. 45-46, lines 725-731). However, no definitive formal proof of genomic instability and horizontal transfer is provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We mention that the NIH3T3 cells treated with cfChPs die out after 250 passages in response to the reviewer’s earlier comment “Should HGT through internalization of circulating chromatin occur on a massive scale, as claimed in this study, and as illustrated by the many FISH foci observed in Fig 3 for example, one would expect that the level of somatic mosaicism may be so high that it would prevent assembling a contiguous genome for a given organism”.</p><p>We have agreed with the reviewer and have simply speculated that the cells may die because of extreme genomic instability. We have left it as a speculation without diverting our paper in a different direction to prove genomic instability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors now refer to an earlier study they conducted in which they Illumina-sequenced NIH3T3 cells treated with cfChPs (pp. 48, lines. 781-792). This study revealed the presence of human DNA in the mouse cell culture. However, it is unclear to me how the author can conclude that the human DNA was inside mouse cells (rather than persisting in the culture medium as cfChPs) and it is also unclear how this supports horizontal transfer of human DNA into the genome of mouse cells. Horizontal transfer implies integration of human DNA into mouse DNA, through the formation of phosphodiester bounds between human nucleotides and mouse nucleotides. The previous Illumina-sequencing study and the current study do not show that such integration has occured. I might be wrong but I tend to think that DNA FISH signals showing that human DNA lies next to mouse DNA does not necessarily imply that human DNA has integrated into mouse DNA. Perhaps such signals could result from interactions at the protein level between human cfChPs and mouse chromatin?</p></disp-quote><p>With due respect, our earlier genome sequencing study that the reviewer refers to was done on two single cell clones developed following treatment with cfChPs. So, the question of cfChPs lurking in the culture medium does not arise.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should be commended for doing so many FISH experiments. But in my opinion, and as already mentioned in my earlier review of this work, horizontal transfer of human DNA into mouse DNA should first be demonstrated by strong DNA sequencing evidence (multiple long and short reads supporting human/mouse breakpoints; discarding technical DNA chimeras) and only then eventually confirmed by FISH.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned earlier, we disagree with the reviewer that our study is incomplete because we did not perform whole genome sequencing. Tens of thousands of genomes have been sequenced, and yet they have failed to detect the presence of the numerous “satellite genomes” that we describe in our paper.

Rather, the reviewer should have commended us for the numerous control experiments that we have done to ensure that our FISH probes and antibodies are target specific and do not cross-react.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding my comment on the quantity of human cfChPs that has been used for the experiments, the authors replied that they chose this quantity because it worked in a previous study. Could they perhaps explain why they chose this quantity in the earlier study? Is there any biological reason to choose 10 ng and not more or less? Is 10 ng realistic biologically? Could it be that 10 ng is orders of magnitude higher than the quantity of cfChPs normally circulating in multicellular organisms and that this could explain, at least in part, the results obtained in this study?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer again raises the same issue to which we have already addressed in our revised manuscript. To quote “We chose to use 10ng based on our earlier report in which we had obtained robust biological effects such as activation of DDR and activation of apoptotic pathways using this concentration of cfChPs (Mittra I et. al., 2015)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is also mentioned in the response that RNA-seq has been performed on mouse cells treated with cfChPs, and that this confirms human-mouse fusion (genomic integration). Since these results are not included in the manuscript, I cannot judge how robust they are and whether they reflect a biological process rather than technical issues (technical chimeras formed during the RNA-seq protocol is a well-known artifact). In any case, I do not think that genomic integration can be demonstrated through RNA-seq as junction between human and mouse RNA could occur at the RNA level (i.e. after transcription). RNA-seq could however show whether human-mouse chimeras that have been validated by DNA-sequencing are expressed or not.</p></disp-quote><p>We did perform transcriptome sequencing as suggested earlier by the reviewer, but realized that the amount of material required to be incorporated into the manuscript to include “material and methods”, “results”, “discussion”, “figures” and “legends to figures” and “supplementary figures and tables” would be so massive that it will detract from the flow of our work and hijack it in a different direction. We have, therefore, decided to publish the transcriptome results as a separate manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given these comments, I believe that most of the weaknesses I mentioned in my review of the first version of this work still hold true.</p><p>An important modification is that the work has been repeated in other cell lines, hence I removed this criticism from my earlier review.</p></disp-quote><p>Additional changes made</p><list list-type="order" id="list1"><list-item><p>We have now rewritten the “Abstract” to 250 words to fit in eLife’s instructions.

At this stage, I am unconvinced that cfChPs provide any evolutionary advantage to the genome. It is entirely possible that these structures have no function whatsoever and could simply be byproducts of other processes. The findings presented in this study do not rule out this neutral hypothesis. Alternatively, some particular components of the genome could be driving the process and may have been selected to do so. This brings us to the hypothesis that cfChPs could serve as vehicles for transposable elements. While speculative, this idea seems to be compatible with the study's findings and merits further exploration.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s viewpoint. We have replaced the term “predatory genome” with a more realistic term “satellite genome” in the title and throughout the manuscript. We have also thoroughly revised the discussion section and elaborated on the potential role of LINE-1 and Alu elements carried by the concatemers in mammalian evolution. (pp. 46-47, lines 743-756).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I also found some elements of the discussion unclear and speculative, particularly the final section on the evolution of mammals. If the intention is simply to highlight the evolutionary impact of horizontal transfer of transposable elements (e.g., as a source of new mutations), this should be explicitly stated. In any case, this part of the discussion requires further clarification and justification.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, we have revised the “discussion” section taking into account the issues raised by the reviewer and highlighted the potential role of cfChPs in evolution by acting as vehicles of transposable elements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In summary, this study presents important new findings on the behavior of cfChPs when introduced into a foreign cellular context. However, it overextends its evolutionary interpretations, often in an unclear and speculative manner. The concept of the &quot;predatory genome&quot; should be better defined and justified or removed altogether. Conversely, the suggestion that cfChPs may function at the level of transposable elements (rather than the entire genome or organism) could be given more emphasis.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, we have replaced the term “predatory genome” with “satellite genome” and revised the “discussion” section taking into account the issues raised by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) I strongly recommend validating the findings of this study using other approaches. Whole genome sequencing using both short and long reads should be used to validate the presence of human DNA in the mouse cell line, as well as its integration into the mouse genome and concatemerization. Breakpoints between mouse and human DNA can be searched in individual reads. Finding these breakpoints in multiple reads from two or more sequencing technologies would strengthen their biological origin. Illumina and ONT sequencing are now routinely performed by many labs, such that this validation should be straightforward. In addition to validating the findings of the current study, it would allow performance of an in-depth characterization of the rearrangements undergone by both human cfChPs and the mouse genome after internalization of cfChPs, including identification of human TE copies integrated through bona fide transposition events into the mouse genome. New copies of LINE and Alu TEs should be flanked by target site duplications. LINE copies should be frequently 5' truncated, as observed in many studies of somatic transposition in human cells.</p><p>(2) Furthermore, should the high level of cell-to-cell HGT detected in this study occur on a regular basis within multicellular organisms, validating it through a reanalysis of whole genome sequencing data available in public databases should be relatively easy. One would expect to find a high number of structural variants that for some reason have so far gone under the radar.</p><p>(3) Short and long-read RNA-seq should be performed to validate the expression of human cfChPs in mouse cells. I would also recommend performing ChIP-seq on routinely targeted histone marks to validate the chromatin state of human cfChPs in mouse cells.</p><p>(4) The claim that fused human proteins are produced in mouse cells after exposing them to human cfChPs should be validated using mass spectrometry.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer has suggested a plethora of techniques to validate our findings. Clearly, it is neither possible to undertake all of them nor to incorporate them into the manuscript.However, as suggested by the reviewer, we did conduct transcriptome sequencing of cfChPs treated NIH3T3 cells and were able to detect the presence of human-human fusion sequences (representing concatemerisation) as well as human-mouse fusion sequences (representing genomic integration). However, we realized that the amount of material required to be incorporated into the manuscript to include “material and methods”, “results”, “discussion”, “figures” and “legends to figures” and “supplementary figures and tables” would be so massive that it will detract from the flow of our work and hijack it in a different direction. We have, therefore, decided to publish the transcriptome results as a separate manuscript.However, to address the reviewer’s concerns we have now referred to results of our earlier whole genome sequencing study of NIH3T3 cells similarly treated with cfChPs wherein we had conclusively detected the presence of human DNA and human Alu sequences in the treated mouse cells. These findings have now been added as an independent paragraph (pp. 48, lines. 781-792).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) It is unclear from what is shown in the paper (increase in FISH signal intensity using Alu and L1 probes) if the increase in TE copy number is due to bona fide transposition or to amplification of cfChPs as a whole, through mechanisms other than transposition. It is also unclear whether human TEs end up being integrated into the neighboring mouse genome. This should be validated by whole genome sequencing.</p></disp-quote><p>Our results suggest that TEs amplify and increase their copy number due to their association with DNA polymerase and their ability to synthesize DNA (Figure 14a and b). Our study design cannot demonstrate transposition which will require real time imaging.</p><p>The possibility of incorporation of TEs into the mouse genome is supported by our earlier genome sequencing work, referred to above, wherein we detected multiple human Alu sequences in the mouse genome (pp. 48, lines. 781-792).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) In order to be able to generalize the findings of this study, I strongly encourage the authors to repeat their experiments using other cell types.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have now used four different cell lines derived from four different species and demonstrated that horizontal transfer of cfChPs occur in all of them suggesting that it is a universal phenomenon. (pp. 37, lines 560-572) and (Supplementary Fig. S14a-d).</p><p>We have also mentioned this in the abstract (pp. 3, lines 52-54).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Since the results obtained when using cfChPs isolated from healthy individuals are identical to those shown when using cfChPs from cancer sera, I wonder why the authors chose to focus mainly on results from cancer-derived cfChPs and not on those from healthy sera.</p></disp-quote><p>Most of the experiments were conducted using cfChPs isolated from cancer patients because of our especial interest in cancer, and our earlier results (Mittra et al., 2015) which had shown that cfChPs isolated from cancer patients had significantly greater activity in terms of DNA damage and activation of apoptotic pathways than those isolated from healthy individuals. We have now incorporated the above justification on (pp. 6, lines. 124-128).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Line 125: how was the 10-ng quantity (of human cfChPs added to the mouse cell culture) chosen and how does it compare to the quantity of cfChPs normally circulating in multicellular organisms?</p></disp-quote><p>We chose to use 10ng based on our earlier report in which we had obtained robust biological effects such as activation of DDR and apoptotic pathways using this concentration of cfChPs (Mittra I et. al. 2015). We have now incorporated the justification of using this dose in our manuscript (pp. 51-52, lines. 867-870).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Could the authors explain why they repeated several of their experiments in metaphase spreads, in addition to interphase?</p></disp-quote><p>We conducted experiments on metaphase spreads in addition to those on chromatin fibres because of the current heightened interest in extra-chromosomal DNA in cancer, which have largely been based on metaphase spreads. We were interested to see how the cfChP concatemers might relate to the characteristics of cancer extrachromosomal DNA and whether the latter in fact represent cfChPs concatemers acquired from surrounding dying cancer cells. We have now mentioned this on pp. 7, lines 150-155.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) Regarding negative controls consisting in checking whether human probes cross-react with mouse DNA or proteins, I suggest that the stringency of washes (temperature, reagents) should be clearly stated in the manuscript, such that the reader can easily see that it was identical for controls and positive experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We were fully aware of these issues and were careful to ensure that washing steps were conducted meticulously. The careful washing steps have been repeatedly emphasized under the section on “Immunofluorescence and FISH” (pp. 54-55, lines. 922-944).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) I am not an expert in Immuno-FISH and FISH with ribosomal probes but it can be expected that ribosomal RNA and RNA polymerase are quite conserved (and thus highly similar) between humans and mice. A more detailed explanation of how these probes were designed to avoid cross-reactivity would be welcome.</p></disp-quote><p>We were aware of this issue and conducted negative control experiment to ensure that the human ribosomal RNA probe and RNA polymerase antibody did not cross-react with mouse. Please see Supplementary Fig. S4c.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(12) Finally, I could not understand why the cfChPs internalized by neighboring cells are called predatory genomes. I could not find any justification for this term in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and this criticism has also been made by #Reviewer 2. We have now replaced the term “predatory” genomes with “satellite” genomes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) P2 L34: The term &quot;role&quot; seems to imply &quot;what something is supposed to do&quot; (similar to &quot;function&quot;).
