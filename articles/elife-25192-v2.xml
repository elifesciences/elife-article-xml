The difficulty of predicting individual mutation effects, and particularly the interactions between them, has prevented the development of a comprehensive theory that links genotypic changes to their phenotypic effects. We show that a general thermodynamic framework for gene regulation, based on a biophysical understanding of protein-DNA binding, accurately predicts the sign of epistasis in a canonical <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory element consisting of overlapping RNA polymerase and repressor binding sites. Sign and magnitude of individual mutation effects are sufficient to predict the sign of epistasis and its environmental dependence. Thus, the thermodynamic model offers the correct null prediction for epistasis between mutations across DNA-binding sites. Our results indicate that a predictive theory for the effects of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory mutations is possible from first principles, as long as the essential molecular mechanisms and the constraints these impose on a biological system are accounted for.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25192.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25192.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25192.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Mutations are changes to DNA that provide the raw material upon which evolution can act. Therefore, to understand evolution, we need to know the effects of mutations, and how those mutations interact with each other (a phenomenon referred to as epistasis). So far, few mathematical models allow scientists to predict the effects of mutations, and even fewer are able to predict epistasis.</p><p>Biological systems are complex and consist of many proteins and other molecules. Genes are the sections of DNA that provide the instructions needed to produce these molecules, and some genes encode proteins that can bind to DNA to control whether other genes are switched on or off. Lagator, Paixão et al. have now used mathematical models and experiments to understand how the environment inside the cells of a bacterium known as <italic>E. coli</italic>, specifically the amount of particular proteins, affects epistasis.</p><p>These mathematical models are able to predict interactions between mutations in the most abundant class of DNA-binding sites in proteins. This approach found that the nature of the interaction between mutations can be explained through biophysical laws, combined with the basic knowledge of the logic of how genes regulate each other’s activities. Furthermore, the models allow Lagator, Paixão et al. to predict interactions between mutations in several different environments, such as the presence of a new food source or a toxin, defined by the amounts of relevant DNA-binding proteins in cells.</p><p>By providing new ways of understanding how genes are regulated in bacteria, and how gene regulation is affected by mutations, these findings contribute to our understanding of how organisms evolve. In addition, this work may help us to build artificial networks of genes that interact with each other to produce a desired response, such as more efficient production of fuel from ethanol or the break down of hazardous chemicals.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25192.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25192.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>epistasis</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>gene regulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004963</institution-id><institution>Seventh Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FP7/2007-2013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lagator</surname><given-names>Mato</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004963</institution-id><institution>Seventh Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>618091 (SAGE)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Paixao</surname><given-names>Tiago</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010661</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020 Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FP/2007-2013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bollback</surname><given-names>Jonathan P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Thermodynamic framework accurately predicts the sign of epistasis and its environment dependence for a canonical <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory element.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The interaction between individual mutations – epistasis – determines how a genotype maps onto a phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wolf et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Phillips, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Breen et al., 2012</xref>). As such, it determines the structure of the fitness landscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Visser and Krug, 2014</xref>) and plays a crucial role in defining adaptive pathways and evolutionary outcomes of complex genetic systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sackton and Hartl, 2016</xref>). For example, epistasis influences the repeatability of evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Weinreich et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Woods et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Szendro et al., 2013</xref>), the benefits of sexual reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kondrashov, 1988</xref>), and species divergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Orr and Turelli, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dettman et al., 2007</xref>). Studies of epistasis have been limited to empirical statistical descriptions, and mostly focused on interactions between individual mutations in structural proteins and enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Phillips, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Starr and Thornton, 2016</xref>). While identifying a wide range of possible interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), these studies have not led to a consensus on whether there is a systematic bias on the sign of epistasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lalić and Elena, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kussell, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Velenich and Gore, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kondrashov and Kondrashov, 2015</xref>), a critical feature determining the ruggedness of the fitness landscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Poelwijk et al., 2011</xref>). Specifically, it is only when mutations are in sign epistasis that the fitness landscape can have multiple fitness peaks - a feature that determines the number of evolutionary paths that are accessible to Darwinian adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Visser and Krug, 2014</xref>). Furthermore, even a pattern of positive or negative epistasis has consequences for important evolutionary questions such as the maintenance of genetic diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Charlesworth et al., 1995</xref>) and the evolution of sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kondrashov, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Otto and Lenormand, 2002</xref>). While the absence of such a bias does not reduce the effect of epistasis on the response to selection, it does demonstrate that predicting epistasis remains elusive.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25192.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The different types of epistasis between two point mutations.</title><p>Two point mutations, A and B (grey), individually increase the measured quantitative phenotype (gene expression, for example) compared to the wildtype. In this study, we use the multiplicative expectation of how the phenotypic effects of two mutations contribute to the double mutant phenotype, according to which epistasis = f<sub>m12</sub> / (f<sub>m1</sub>f<sub>m2</sub>), where f<sub>m12</sub> is the relative fluorescence of a double mutant (m<sub>12</sub>), and f<sub>m1</sub> and f<sub>m2</sub> the relative fluorescence of the two corresponding single mutants (m<sub>1</sub> and m<sub>2</sub>), respectively. An alternative to the multiplicative assumption would be the additive one, in which the effect of the double mutant in the absence of epistasis is the sum of the effects of single mutants. The multiplicative model is a better assumption for gene expression data, as there is a lower limit on this trait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cordell, 2002</xref>). In the absence of an interaction between mutations (‘no epistasis’ scenario, represented by a grey circle), the phenotype of the double mutant is the product of the individual mutation. If the effect of the double mutant is greater or lower than the multiplicative expectation, the two mutations are said to be in positive (blue) or negative (orange) magnitude epistasis, respectively. Sign epistasis (dark green) occurs when one mutation has the opposite effect in the presence of the other (as for mutation B above). Reciprocal sign epistasis (light green) indicates a situation when both mutations have the opposite effect when in the presence of the other, compared to when they occur independently on the wildtype background.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25192.003">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25192.003</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-25192-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p>Scarcity of predictive models of epistasis comes as no surprise, given that most experimental studies focused on proteins. The inability to predict structure from sequence, due to the prohibitively large sequence space that would need to be experimentally explored in order to understand even just the effects of point mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Maerkl and Quake, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shultzaberger et al., 2012</xref>), let alone the interactions between them, prevents the development of a predictive theory of epistasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lehner, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Visser and Krug, 2014</xref>). In fact, the only predictive models of epistasis focus on tractable systems where it is possible to connect the effects of mutations to the underlying biophysical and molecular mechanisms of the molecular machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dean and Thornton, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lehner, 2011</xref>); namely, RNA sequence-to-shape models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schuster, 2006</xref>), and models of metabolic networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Szathmáry, 1993</xref>). Even though these studies have provided accurate predictions of interactions between mutations, applying their findings to address broader evolutionary questions remains challenging. For RNA sequence-to-shape models, the function of a novel phenotype (new folding structure) is impossible to determine without experiments. In addition, this approach cannot account for the dependence of epistatic interactions on even simple variations in cellular environments, which are known to affect epistasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Flynn et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Caudle et al., 2014</xref>). On the other hand, metabolic network models are limited to examining the effects of large effect mutations, like deletions and knockouts, and lack an explicit reference to genotype.</p><p>In order to overcome the limitations of existing theoretical approaches to predicting epistasis, we focused on bacterial regulation of gene expression as one of the simplest model systems in which the molecular biology and biophysics of the interacting components are well understood. We analyze the effects of mutations in a prokaryotic <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory element (CRE) – the region upstream of a gene containing DNA-binding sites for RNA polymerase (RNAP) and transcription factors (TFs). As such, we study a molecular system where an interaction between multiple components, rather than a single protein, determines the phenotype. Promoters that are regulated by competitive exclusion of RNAP by a repressor are particularly good candidates for developing a systematic approach to understanding epistasis as, in contrast to coding regions as well as more complex CREs and activatable promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Garcia et al., 2012</xref>), the phenotypic effects of mutations in binding sites of RNAP and repressor are tractable due to their short length and the well-understood biophysical properties of protein-DNA interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bintu et al., 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Saiz and Vilar, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vilar, 2010</xref>). Understanding the effects of point mutations in the <italic>cis</italic>-element on the binding properties of RNAP and TFs allows for the construction of a realistic model of transcription initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bintu et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kinney et al., 2010</xref>), while providing a measurable and relevant phenotype - gene expression level - for the analysis of epistasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Here we studied epistasis between point mutations in the canonical lambda bacteriophage CRE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ptashne, 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We employ a fluorescent reporter protein that is under the control of the strong lambda promoter <italic>P<sub>R</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>), which is fully repressed by an inducible TF, CI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). RNAP and CI have overlapping binding sites in this CRE, and hence compete for binding. We created a library of 141 random double mutants in the CRE, with all their corresponding single mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This design allows us to calculate epistasis between the mutations in the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory element in two environments: in the absence of CI, when only RNAP determines expression; and in the presence of CI when the two proteins compete for binding.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25192.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Experimental system.</title><p>The <italic>P<sub>R</sub></italic> promoter system used in the empirical measurements consists of a strong lambda phage <italic>P<sub>R</sub></italic> promoter (RNAP-binding site) and two CI operator sites (transcription factor binding sites <italic>O<sub>R1</sub> and O<sub>R2</sub></italic>), which control the expression of a <italic>venus-yfp</italic> reporter gene. <italic>cI</italic> is encoded on the opposite strand, separated by a terminator and 500 bp of random sequence, and under the control of an inducible promoter <italic>P<sub>TET</sub></italic>.

In a repressible promoter, the effects of mutations on the binding of the two proteins have opposite effects on gene expression — a reduction in RNAP binding leads to a decrease in gene expression, while a reduction in CI binding leads to higher expression levels. By comparing epistasis between two environments – absence of CI and high CI concentration – we find that the 141 tested random double mutants show a strong dependence on the environment (ANOVA testing for a GxGxE interaction: F<sub>1,280</sub> = 21.77; p&lt;0.0001), in line with previous observations in another bacterial regulatory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lagator et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, 58% of double mutants display a change in the sign of epistasis between the two environments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Especially prevalent is a switch from negative epistasis in the absence of CI, to positive epistasis in its presence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Strikingly, the proportion of double mutants exhibiting reciprocal sign epistasis (when the sign of the effect of each mutation changes in the presence of the other mutation) is greater in the presence (66%) than in the absence (8%) of CI (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). This difference likely arises from the molecular architecture of a repressible strong promoter. Mutations affect the binding of both DNA-binding proteins, but in the presence of CI the effect on the binding of RNAP is only unmasked when CI does not fully bind, a scenario that is more likely in the presence of two mutations.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25192.009</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Sign of epistasis changes with the environment for most double mutants.</title><p>Points show the log<sub>10</sub> value of epistasis in the absence of repressor, and the difference in the log<sub>10</sub> value of epistasis in the presence and the absence of repressor: log<sub>10</sub> (ε<sub>CI</sub>) – log<sub>10</sub> (ε<sub>noCI</sub>), for all 141 double mutants.

Importantly, our model is generic, as it does not consider the details of any specific transcription factors involved in regulation. Instead, we model competitive binding between two generic transcription factors that share a single binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). The binding of one of these TFs leads to an increase in the gene expression level, in a manner similar to the function of a typical RNAP or an activator. The other is a repressor molecule, the binding of which has a negative effect on gene expression level, achieved by blocking access of the activator to its cognate binding site. In order to draw a parallel to our experimental system, we refer to these two TFs in the generic model as ‘RNAP’ and ‘repressor’, without actually relying on any specific properties of the two molecules, such as CI dimerization, or cooperative binding of CI dimers to multiple operator sites.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25192.010</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Overview of the generic model.</title><p>The theoretical approach used in this study, originally developed to describe gene regulation by the lambda bacteriophage repressor CI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackers et al., 1982</xref>), relies on statistical thermodynamics assumptions to model initiation of transcription.

Given a set of DNA-binding proteins (a generic RNAP-like and a generic repressor-like TF, in this case) and a promoter sequence, a Boltzmann weight can be assigned to any configuration of these TFs on the promoter. By assigning a Boltzmann weight to all configurations, one can calculate the probability of finding the system in a configuration that leads to the initiation of transcription. (<bold>b</bold>) When considering only the binding of a single protein to DNA (for example ‘RNAP’ only), if mutations have a negative effect on protein-DNA binding, the model predicts negative epistasis between them in terms of expression. This prediction arises from the non-linear relationship between binding energy and gene expression <italic>p<sub>on</sub></italic> (dotted line). In this illustration, we show a relative change in binding energy compared to the sequence with highest possible binding, in kT. (<bold>c</bold>) By generalizing the properties of the relationship between binding and gene expression, we conclude that the sign of epistasis depends only on the sign of individual mutation effects (p<sub>1</sub> and p<sub>2</sub>) upon binding. When both ‘RNAP’ and ‘repressor’ are present in the system, epistasis depends on the ‘repressor’ concentration and the magnitude of single mutation effects on ‘RNAP’ and ‘repressor’ binding (<bold>d,e,f,g</bold>).

In our formulation, we assume that each position along the single DNA-binding site under consideration contributes additively to the global free binding energy – an assumption found to be accurate at least for a few mutations away from a reference sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vilar, 2010</xref>). These energy contributions can be determined experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kinney et al., 2010</xref>) and are typically represented in the form of an energy matrix. Given a set of DNA-binding proteins (specifically, their energy matrices) and a promoter sequence, a Boltzmann weight can be assigned to any configuration of these proteins on the promoter. The Boltzmann weight is proportional to the probability of finding the system in each of the possible configurations. By assigning a Boltzmann weight to all configurations, one can calculate the probability of finding the system in a particular state (a set of configurations sharing a common property). Specifically, one can calculate the probability of finding the system in a configuration that leads to the initiation of transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>).</p><p>In our generic model, we consider only a single binding site to which ‘repressor’ and ‘RNAP’ compete for binding. Note that the model does not make any assumptions about the identity of the TFs that are binding DNA and hence does not utilize any specific energy matrix. The model is, therefore, general in nature, relying only on the physical and mechanistic properties of protein-DNA binding. In such a system, three basic configurations are possible: no proteins bound to DNA, only ‘RNAP’ bound, or only ‘repressor’ bound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>).

When one point mutation negatively affects only ‘RNAP’ binding, while the other only ‘repressor’ binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>), the system does not exhibit any epistasis when ‘repressor’ concentration is very low, as only one of the mutations affects ‘RNAP’ binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). As ‘repressor’ concentration increases, the system is in positive epistasis. Finally, at very high ‘repressor’ concentrations, which are probably not biologically relevant, epistasis approaches 0 as the ‘repressor’ binds too strongly. When point mutations negatively affect both ‘RNAP’ and ‘repressor’ binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>), epistasis changes the sign from negative to positive as ‘repressor’ concentration increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g</xref>).</p><p>To intuit this finding, consider two mutations that reduce binding of both ‘RNAP’ and ‘repressor’. In the absence of ‘repressor’, when only ‘RNAP’ is present, epistasis will be negative because of the negative curvature of the relationship between expression and binding energy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). But, in the presence of ‘repressor’, it is the relative magnitude of individual mutation effects that will determine the sign of epistasis. This is because mutations that weaken ‘repressor’ binding increase expression. If the mutation effects are larger on ‘RNAP’, then the negative epistasis on expression arising from ‘RNAP’ will dominate. When the mutations have a greater effect on ‘repressor’ binding, then negative epistasis on ‘repressor’ binding will dominate and lead to positive epistasis on expression, and hence to a dependence on the environment. At high ‘repressor’ concentration, only the sign of the effects of mutations on ‘repressor’ binding will determine the sign of epistasis. As most experimentally tested mutations reduce both RNAP and CI binding, our model explains the observation that most double mutants change the sign of epistasis between the two environments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Independent validation of the generic model predictions</title><p>The experimental data from the random mutant library (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>) shows that the patterns of epistasis between two environments follow the generic model predictions, specifically that epistasis switches sign between environments in many mutants. However, our experimental design, where we only measure gene expression levels, does not allow us to identify the effects of a mutation on CI binding alone. For example, if a mutation decreases gene expression level in the presence of CI, we cannot know if it decreases RNAP binding, increases CI binding, or both. This prevents a more thorough verification of the generic model. In order to independently experimentally validate the generic model predictions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), it is necessary to know the effects of CRE mutations on RNAP and CI. To obtain this information, we used the experimentally determined energy matrices for RNAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kinney et al., 2010</xref>) and CI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sarai and Takeda, 1989</xref>), and utilized it to create five random double mutants for each possible combination of single mutation effects shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. Due to the high specificity of binding of both RNAP and CI, we could not identify point mutations that simultaneously improved the binding of both (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Therefore, we validate the model by measuring epistasis in 30 double mutants (five for each of the six possible combinations of single mutant effects) in the two environments. We find no difference between the predicted and experimental estimates of the sign of epistasis and its dependence on the two experimental environments (Pearson’s χ<sup>2</sup><sub>2,30</sub>=0.68; p=0.72) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). As such, the predictions about the sign of epistasis that arise from the generic model (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) hold true in our experimental system.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25192.013</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>The thermodynamic model accurately predicts sign of epistasis and its environment-dependence.</title><p>In order to conduct an independent test of the assumptions of the generic model, we expanded the generic model to include specific information about the two TFs relevant to the experimental system – namely, the energy matrices for RNAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kinney et al., 2010</xref>) and CI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sarai and Takeda, 1989</xref>). We could not use the 141 random mutants to validate the model, as most of them contained mutations that were in the regions of the CRE that were poorly characterized by the energy matrices. Therefore, using the energy matrices, we had to create a new library consisting of five random double mutants for each category from <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. As we could not identify any single point mutations that simultaneously improved the binding of both RNAP and repressor, we tested if empirical measurements of epistasis conformed to model predictions in 30 mutants. The model predictions of the sign of epistasis and its environment dependence were based only on the sign of individual mutation effects on RNAP and repressor binding. The location of points corresponds to the experimental measurement of epistasis for each mutant, while the color indicates the model prediction: (<bold>i</bold>) blue - double mutants predicted to be in negative epistasis both in the absence and in the presence of the repressor CI; (ii) orange - double mutants that are always in positive epistasis; (iii) grey - double mutants predicted to change the sign of epistasis in the two environments.

Because such a model depends on the concentrations of RNAP and CI, we estimated the values for these parameters so as to maximize the correlation between model predictions and empirical values of epistasis. When we excluded those double mutants which did not empirically exhibit significant epistasis, we found a significant fit between experimental measurements and model predictions of the magnitude of epistasis in the absence (F<sub>1,15</sub> = 9.86; p&lt;0.01) and in the presence of CI (F<sub>1,15</sub> = 4.59; p&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). As such, the model predicts not only the general patterns of epistasis (sign), but is also reasonably accurate at predicting its magnitude, which is remarkable since the model does not consider detailed molecular aspects of the experimental system, such as CI dimerization or cooperativity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The theory we present here, which is based on mechanistic properties of protein-DNA binding without accounting for any details of the molecular system studied, provides an accurate prediction of the sign of epistasis and its environmental dependence for a repressible promoter system - the most common form of gene regulation in <italic>E. coli</italic> (~40% of all regulated genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Salgado et al., 2013</xref>]). Furthermore, the fact that we use a generic model with no reference to any particular empirical measures means that our results are derived from first principles. As such, the presented results should hold as long as the effects of mutations on gene expression are mainly driven by their direct impact on TF-DNA binding, as represented by the energy matrix for a given TF. Under such conditions, the thermodynamic model, rather than the multiplicative (or additive) expectation, provides a meaningful null model for the sign of epistasis in CREs.</p><p>The sign of the deviations from a multiplicative expectation can have important evolutionary consequences, such as for the evolution of sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Otto and Lenormand, 2002</xref>) or the maintenance of genetic variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Charlesworth et al., 1995</xref>). A particularly important pattern of epistasis is sign epistasis, where the sign of the effect of a particular substitution depends on the genetic background. Sign epistasis can lead to the existence of multiple optima (local peaks). In the system we analyze here, sign epistasis cannot exist in the absence of a repressor, since there is an optimum binding site sequence and the effects of mutations have a definite sign toward this optimal sequence. In the presence of a repressor, however, sign epistasis is possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Poelwijk et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, we show that the sign of epistasis very often reverses between environments. This phenomenon, previously observed in a different system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Vos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lagator et al., 2016</xref>), could alleviate constraints coming from the existence of multiple peaks in a particular environment. The thermodynamic model provides a mechanistic basis for this observation: RNAP and repressor have opposite effects on gene expression and this, when combined with the specific shape of response induced by the thermodynamic model, can lead to the environmental dependence of the sign of epistasis.</p><p>Our results concern the combined effect of mutations (epistasis) on phenotype, as opposed to fitness. Phenotypes logically precede fitness and even though it could be argued that fitness is ‘what matters’ for evolution, since mutations spread in part based on their fitness effects, determining the fitness effects of mutations depends on the environment which may or may not be representative of ‘natural’ conditions. Moreover, knowledge about one environment is hardly informative about the fitness patterns in a novel environment. Our results allow for the prediction of patterns of phenotypic epistasis across different environmental conditions, independent of the selection pressures applied to this phenotype. The evolutionary consequences of these patterns of epistasis can then be inferred from the knowledge (or assumptions) of how selection is acting on this phenotype, or in other words, how the phenotype maps onto fitness.</p><p>In order to predict the sign of epistasis in a regulatory system, the thermodynamic model accounts for the underlying physical mechanisms that impose constraints on the genotype-phenotype map under consideration. Incorporating details of physical and molecular mechanisms into models of more complex regulatory elements, as well as coding sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dean and Thornton, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2016</xref>), can elucidate how epistasis impacts genotype-phenotype maps and their dynamic properties across environments, helping us to understand the environmental dependence of fitness landscapes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Gene regulation in the <italic>P<sub>R</sub></italic> promoter system</title><p>We developed a system based on the <italic>right</italic> regulatory element of the lambda phage (P<sub>R</sub>), in which we decoupled the <italic>cis-</italic> and <italic>trans-</italic>regulatory elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Johnson et al., 1981</xref>).

Effects of mutations on RNAP and on CI were obtained from the experimentally determined energy matrices of RNAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kinney et al., 2010</xref>) and CI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sarai and Takeda, 1989</xref>) binding. We could not validate the model from the random mutant library, as the majority of mutants fell in regions that are poorly described by the energy matrices. For this reason, we aimed to create this new library. As the <italic>P<sub>R</sub></italic> promoter is very strong, finding double mutants where both mutations improved expression was not possible. Hence, we selected five double mutants from six categories (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>), and synthesized them, as well as their corresponding single mutants, using annealed oligonucleotide overlap cloning. We measured fluorescence of these mutants and calculated epistasis in the same manner as described for the random mutant library, and we asked if the epistasis for each double mutant was different from the null-expectation in the manner described in section ‘Statistical analyses’. We used Pearson’s <italic>chi</italic>-square test to determine if the environmental-dependence of the sign of epistasis in the experimental measurements differs from model predictions.</p><p>In order to test whether the thermodynamic model can also predict the magnitude of epistasis, we incorporated the energy matrices for RNAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kinney et al., 2010</xref>) and CI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sarai and Takeda, 1989</xref>) into the generic model. As the energy matrix for RNAP contained one additional position in the spacer region between −10 and −35 sites compared to the experimental P<sub>R</sub> system, we eliminated one position in that region that had lowest impact on overall RNAP binding. In the manner described above, we modeled epistasis in those mutants from the 30-mutant validation library that exhibited significant epistasis. As the thermodynamic model depends on the concentrations of RNAP and CI, we estimated the values for these parameters so as to maximize the correlation between model predictions and empirical values of epistasis. In order to estimate how well the model predicted the magnitude of epistasis, we fitted a linear regression between experimental measurements of epistasis and the model predictions, both in the absence and in the presence of CI.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank H Acar, S Sarikas, and G Tkacik for discussion and useful comments on the manuscript.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;On the Mechanistic Nature of Epistasis in a Canonical <italic>cis</italic>-Regulatory Element&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Alvaro Sanchez (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by Aviv Regev as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Lucas B Carey (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The paper addresses an interesting question, concerning the ability to predict the sign of epistasis. Non-additive (or non-multiplicative) effects of mutations on gene expression are common. The authors show that in a complex system in which both an activator (RNA Pol) and a repressor (CI) bind to the same sequence, the effect of mutations depends on both the environment (CI concentration) and on other mutations. This is an important problem in quantitative biology, and the authors have successfully resolved it for a specific system using a combination of theory and experiment.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three referees expressed concerns regarding the presentation and a general lack of clarity of the manuscript. In order for the paper to be ready for publication, several major changes need to be made to the writing to improve its clarity and rigor. A consolidated list of required changes is below:</p><p>1) The thermodynamic model is an integral part of the paper and it needs to be described in detail in its own separate &quot;Modeling&quot; or &quot;Theory&quot; section of the paper. The authors should start the section by explaining what assumptions go into the model, explicitly stating which features of the system are being included and which excluded for the sake of simplicity. For instance, the authors should make it clear that their model ignores well known features of this system, such as explicit modeling of cI dimerization, cooperative binding of two cI dimers to OR1 and OR2, as well as any other assumptions that are currently implicit and not discussed. The authors should also explicitly discuss the limitations of their approach. For instance, if the model ignores any of these features for the sake of clarity, the authors should explicitly state how they expect this to affect a quantitative comparison between theory and experiment, and whether the model should be taken as a semi-quantitative comparison or not.</p><p>2) Along these lines, the referees were concerned about the lack of quantitative calibration of the model. Although it is understood that the model is used in a semi-quantitative fashion as a way to obtain the sign of epistasis rather than its magnitude, all referees found it would be necessary to establish how quantitatively accurate their model is, given the many assumptions it makes (as opposed to, for instance, more detailed models such as those of Ian Dodd et al. (Genes Dev 2004)). A way to do this would be to provide a quantitative comparison between their model and an independent data set. This is an approach that has been followed multiple times to calibrate thermodynamic models; See for instance the comparison between theory and experiment by Vilar &amp; Saiz (PNAS 2005, NAR 2008), or Bintu et al. using the data from Muller-Hill et al. on the lac system (Bintu et al. 2005). One good data set where single point mutants have been studied can be found in the paper by by Sarai and Takeda, 1989. The authors should compare their theory with the results of Sarai &amp; Takeda (or an alternative paper if the authors know of it). Note that we do not expect a perfect correlation between theory and experiment, but rather that the authors use such a comparison to establish how quantitative their model is, and whether we should just take it as a toy model that still provides some useful insights or a more serious thermodynamic model that captures the essentials of the system and provides reasonable predictive power. Either way would be fine, but the authors need to discuss this.</p><p>3) In the box (which may be instead re-purposed as a Figure that could go with the new theory section), Panel b is rather perplexing (and needs to be explained better). The authors plot Gene expression (Shouldn't this be fold-change in expression?) as a function of Ep (which, if interpreted correctly, is the free energy of binding of the polymerase). The plot is unusual because the free energy goes from +0.05 to +10 (in units of kT?). A positive free energy represents the case of repulsion between polymerase and the promoter. While technically the plot is correct, in that for a repulsive free energy, the higher the energy the lower expression would be, that is never the case and all known binding free energies between RNAP and promoters are of course negative and thus favorable (see Bintu et al., Dodd et al., and a long etc.). This point is particularly unclear in its relation with the rest of the paper, so it should be clarified.</p><p>4) A second panel to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> should be presented containing the +CI data.</p><p>5) The authors should explain in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> why they synthesized 30 new variants, 17 with statistically significant epistasis, to test the model? Why not use all 141 mutants, and use the single mutants to predict the doubles? The authors should explain their logic for doing this, particularly in relation to how quantitatively calibrated their model is.</p><p>6) The concept of sign epistasis should be better explained and motivated in the introduction. For example, when it is first introduced (in the Introduction section), it is not defined. For many readers, this will make it very difficult to understand the paper. The importance of sign epistasis is detailed in the second paragraph of the Discussion. As this is important to motivate the work, the authors should move it to the introduction.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25192.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p> <italic>All three referees expressed concerns regarding the presentation and a general lack of clarity of the manuscript.

We have also removed Box 1 and replaced it with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. Now we provide substantially more information in the main text on how the model works, what its basic assumptions are, as well as why we created a generic model (one that does not account for any specific TFs). The new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> now contains the accompanying description of how the generic model works, as well as what its main conclusions are. After explaining how the model works, we then apply it to a simple CRE, one that is akin to the experimental system used in this study, and explain what predictions arise from it regarding epistasis and its dependence on repressor concentration and individual mutation effects. To this effect, we have introduced changes to the sections: ‘The sign of epistasis can be predicted from first principles’ and ‘Independent validation of generic model predictions’. We think that this new section as well as the other changes, clarify what the model does and how it is used in this study</italic></p><p> <italic>2) Along these lines, the referees were concerned about the lack of quantitative calibration of the model. Although it is understood that the model is used in a semi-quantitative fashion as a way to obtain the sign of epistasis rather than its magnitude, all referees found it would be necessary to establish how quantitatively accurate their model is, given the many assumptions it makes (as opposed to, for instance, more detailed models such as those of Ian Dodd et al.

Either way would be fine, but the authors need to discuss this.</italic> </p><p>We tested how quantitatively accurate the thermodynamic model is in predicting our experimental data, and present the findings in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, and in the section ‘Independent validation of the generic model predictions’. In order to go one step further from the generic model we incorporated previously published energy matrices for RNAP and CI (Kinney <italic>et al.</italic> 2010 for RNAP; Sarai and Takeda, 1989 for CI) into the thermodynamic model. The only other aspect of the experimental system that we explicitly modeled were the cellular concentrations of RNAP and CI, which we estimated so as to maximize the fit between experimental and model estimates of epistasis. We did not explicitly model any other aspects of the system, namely the dimerization of CI molecules and the cooperative binding between CI dimers.</p><p>We quantitatively compare this model to our validation dataset of 30 mutants, which we first used to demonstrate that the sign of individual mutation effects alone is sufficient to predict the sign of epistasis (note that for the qualitative validation of the predictions arising from the generic model, namely that sign of epistasis can be predicted from sign of individual mutations and repressor concentration, we used the published energy matrices for RNAP and CI to determine the single and double mutant effects in order to validate our model. For RNAP, this is in contrast to what we presented in the first submission, where we obtained single mutation effects from our experimental measurements of the random mutant library). Using a linear regression, we evaluate how well the thermodynamic model with energy matrices describes the magnitude of epistasis, and find a significant fit both in the absence and in the presence of CI.</p><p> <italic>3) In the box (which may be instead re-purposed as a Figure that could go with the new theory section), Panel b is rather perplexing (and needs to be explained better).

While technically the plot is correct, in that for a repulsive free energy, the higher the energy the lower expression would be, that is never the case and all known binding free energies between RNAP and promoters are of course negative and thus favorable (see Bintu et al., Dodd et al., and a long etc.). This point is particularly unclear in its relation with the rest of the paper, so it should be clarified.</italic> </p><p>The reviewers are right to observe the lack of clarity in the panel b of the box (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), which stems from a silly mistake we made in the figure. Namely, we wrongly stated that the x-axis marked the binding energy. Instead, the plot was meant to display gene expression as a function of the change in binding energy, relative to the reference sequence with strongest possible binding. In this formulation, the sequence with strongest possible binding would have the value of 0. We introduced these changes in the figure and the figure legend. Furthermore, panel b) is meant as an illustration of how the general shape of the gene expression predicted by the thermodynamical framework leads to the patterns of epistasis that we find (in the absence of repressor). Hence, the units are not important but they are indeed units of kT.</p><p> <italic>4) A second panel to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> should be presented containing the +CI data.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that the information about epistasis in the presence of CI was too obscurely concealed within <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, and have added it to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> as a second panel.</p><p> <italic>5) The authors should explain in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> why they synthesized 30 new variants, 17 with statistically significant epistasis, to test the model? Why not use all 141 mutants, and use the single mutants to predict the doubles? The authors should explain their logic for doing this, particularly in relation to how quantitatively calibrated their model is.</italic> </p><p>Following the suggestions of the reviewers, we have now expanded the section ‘Independent validation of the generic model predictions’, the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> (old <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), and the accompanying Materials and methods section, in order to better explain why we use a separate dataset to validate the model. To summarize, the main finding of our paper is that for <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements, the biophysical properties of protein-DNA binding provide a null-model for epistasis, which results in the dependency of epistasis on TF concentrations. The generic model we use, which mathematically demonstrates why this is true for CREs in the absence of secondary effects of mutations, was inspired by experimental observations of 141 mutants. Most of these mutants had mutations in the regions of the CRE that were poorly described by the previously published energy matrices which we use in the model. In order to conduct an independent test of generic model predictions, we needed to introduce specific energy matrices for RNAP and CI, and hence to construct a new dataset where all mutations would be in the regions of the CRE that are well characterized by available energy matrices. As we have not picked the original 141 mutants in this manner, but rather randomly, incorporating them in the model would not provide an independent test of all the assumptions of the model.</p><p> <italic>6) The concept of sign epistasis should be better explained and motivated in the introduction. For example, when it is first introduced (in the Introduction section), it is not defined. For many readers, this will make it very difficult to understand the paper. The importance of sign epistasis is detailed in the second paragraph of the Discussion. As this is important to motivate the work, the authors should move it to the introduction.</italic></p><p>In order to better explain sign epistasis and to motivate its significance, we introduced a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, which provides a definition of the main types of epistasis (magnitude, sign, and reciprocal sign epistasis). In the Box we explain why we utilize the multiplicative instead of the additive model of epistasis to analyze this dataset and the model. In addition, we elaborated in the introduction on why sign epistasis matters for understanding evolution.</p></body></sub-article></article>
