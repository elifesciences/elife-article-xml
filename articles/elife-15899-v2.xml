established using few reporter molecules (e.g. Ras, yeast <bold>a</bold>-factor mating pheromone). These proteins undergo three coordinated COOH-terminal events: isoprenylation of the cysteine, proteolytic removal of <italic>aaX</italic>, and COOH-terminal methylation. Here, we investigated the coupling of these modifications in the context of the yeast Ydj1p chaperone. We provide genetic, biochemical, and biophysical evidence that the Ydj1p <italic>CaaX</italic> motif is isoprenylated but not cleaved and carboxylmethylated. Moreover, we demonstrate that Ydj1p-dependent thermotolerance and Ydj1p localization are perturbed when alternative <italic>CaaX</italic> motifs are transplanted onto Ydj1p. The abnormal phenotypes revert to normal when post-isoprenylation events are genetically interrupted. Our findings indicate that proper Ydj1p function requires an isoprenylatable <italic>CaaX</italic> motif that is resistant to post-isoprenylation events. These results expand on the complexity of protein isoprenylation and highlight the impact of post-isoprenylation events in regulating the function of Ydj1p and perhaps other <italic>CaaX</italic> proteins.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15899.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15899.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>CaaX</kwd><kwd>HSP40</kwd><kwd>isoprenylation</kwd><kwd>chaperone</kwd><kwd>thermotolerance</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P41GM103490</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wells</surname><given-names>Lance</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007699</institution-id><institution>University of Georgia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schmidt</surname><given-names>Walter K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A branch to the protein prenylation pathway has been previously overlooked.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>I<bold>ntroduction</bold></title><p><italic>CaaX</italic> proteins have roles in many biological processes, including cancer, development, aging, and parasitic growth, among others. They are defined by a COOH-terminal <italic>CaaX</italic> motif where <italic>C</italic> is cysteine, <italic>a</italic> is typically an aliphatic amino acid, and <italic>X</italic> can be one of several residues. In some publications, the <italic>CaaX</italic> motif is referred to as a <italic>CXXX</italic> motif due to its highly degenerate nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kinsella et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fu and Casey, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Young et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wright et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>CaaX</italic> motif is commonly cited as undergoing an ordered series of post-translational modifications. The first modification is C15 (farnesyl) or C20 (geranylgeranyl) isoprenylation of the cysteine (<italic>C</italic>) by cytosolic isoprenyltransferases. This is followed by endoproteolysis to remove the COOH-terminal tripeptide (<italic>aaX</italic>). Rce1p and Ste24p are proteases that can independently mediate this activity, but the promiscuous nature of Ste24p suggests that <italic>CaaX</italic> proteolysis is not likely its primary duty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boyartchuk et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tam et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ast et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hildebrandt et al., 2016</xref>). The isoprenylated cysteine revealed by proteolysis is carboxylmethylated by an isoprenylcysteine carboxylmethyltransferase (ICMT/Ste14p). The <italic>CaaX</italic> proteases and ICMT are all integral, multi-pass membrane proteins associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Romano et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schmidt et al., 1998</xref>). In some instances, additional modifications occur to <italic>CaaX</italic> proteins. Common examples are palmitoylation of mammalian H-Ras and N-Ras, and additional proteolysis of precursors to yeast <bold>a</bold>-factor and lamin A. The modifications occurring to <italic>CaaX</italic> proteins often impact their function and/or localization, and intense interest is focused on developing therapeutic inhibitors against all enzymatic steps associated with <italic>CaaX</italic> protein modification (<italic>e.g.</italic> farnesyltransferase inhibitors; FTIs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Silvius, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Winter-Vann and Casey, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berndt et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The modifications occurring to <italic>CaaX</italic> proteins have largely been interrogated using relatively few <italic>CaaX</italic> proteins, with Ras and Ras-related GTPases, the yeast <bold>a</bold>-factor mating pheromone, and lamin A being the most common reporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boyartchuk et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tam et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boyartchuk and Rine, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Roberts et al., 2008</xref>). Whereas these proteins certainly undergo the ordered set of post-translational modifications described above, several lines of evidence support the existence of a shunt pathway that yields partially modified products. Mammalian Rab38 (CAKS <italic>CaaX</italic> motif) is farnesylated, but not carboxylmethylated, implying that it is not cleaved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leung et al., 2007</xref>). The α (CAMQ) and β (CVLS) subunits of phosphorylase b kinase (Phk) are farnesylated yet retain their <italic>CaaX</italic> motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heilmeyer et al., 1992</xref>). The major form of Gγ5 (CSFL) is geranylgeranylated and also retains its <italic>CaaX</italic> motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kilpatrick and Hildebrandt, 2007</xref>). Additionally, mammalian annexin A2 (CGGDD) was identified in a screen for isoprenylated proteins. Its non-canonical length motif suggests that it may not be cleaved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kho et al., 2004</xref>). Detailed follow-up studies of these observations have not been reported, and the relevance of interrupted processing to protein function has not been investigated.</p><p>In this study, we developed the Ydj1p <italic>CaaX</italic> protein as a new reporter for assessing the role of <italic>CaaX</italic> proteolysis and carboxylmethylation in regulating <italic>CaaX</italic> protein function. Ydj1p is a yeast homolog of DnaJ, an <italic>E. coli</italic> heat shock protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Caplan and Douglas, 1991</xref>). The homology between Ydj1p and DnaJ lies predominantly in the NH<sub>2</sub> terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Caplan and Douglas, 1991</xref>); DnaJ does not possess a <italic>CaaX</italic> motif. Heat shock proteins generally function in protein folding, transport, and assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Qiu et al., 2006</xref>). Among its many reported roles in yeast, Ydj1p functions with Hsp70s of the Ssa class to mediate the transfer of preproteins across mitochondrial and ER membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Caplan and Douglas, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atencio and Yaffe, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Becker et al., 1996</xref>). Ydj1p is also required for growth at elevated temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caplan et al., 1992</xref>). Farnesylation of Ydj1p is specifically required for growth at elevated temperatures, the suppression of certain prions, and maturation of Hsp90 client proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caplan et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Summers et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Flom et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sharma et al., 2009</xref>). The roles of proteolysis and carboxylmethylation in regulating these activities have not previously been investigated. We report here that the yeast Hsp40 chaperone Ydj1p is a <italic>CaaX</italic> protein that avoids post-isoprenylation proteolysis and carboxylmethylation. We also demonstrate that there are negative consequences to Ydj1p function and localization if it is forced to undergo post-isoprenylation modification. These observations expand on the complexity of protein isoprenylation and are expected to provide a better understanding of the roles of the <italic>CaaX</italic> proteases and ICMT in regulating the function of <italic>CaaX</italic> proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>R<bold>esults</bold></title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Alternative <italic>CaaX</italic> motifs negatively impact Ydj1p-dependent thermotolerance</title><p>The yeast Hsp40 chaperone Ydj1p is a farnesylated protein. Ydj1p is required for growth at elevated temperatures, and its farnesylation status influences this phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caplan et al., 1992</xref>). Using a qualitative plate growth assay, we observed as previously reported that yeast fail to grow at elevated temperatures in the absence of Ydj1p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; vector). Expression of wildtype Ydj1p (CASQ) reversed this phenotype and allowed growth at elevated temperature. The non-prenylatable Ydj1p mutant (SASQ) failed to grow at the highest temperature assessed (40°C) and displayed reduced growth at a slightly lower temperature (37°C) as evident by the smaller colony size relative to wildtype Ydj1p. We decided to take advantage of the <italic>ydj1∆</italic> temperature sensitivity phenotype to develop Ydj1p as a novel reporter for post-isoprenylation processing events.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15899.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Alternate CaaX motifs on Ydj1p affect thermotolerance but not farnesylation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Yeast cultured in selective SC-Ura media were normalized for culture density and spotted as 10-fold serial dilutions onto YPD; the leftmost spot in each panel is undiluted.

At the onset of this study, we expected that altering the <italic>CaaX</italic> motif of Ydj1p would yield phenotypes matching that of either farnesylated or unmodified Ydj1p (<italic>i.e.</italic> CASQ and SASQ phenotypes respectively). We further expected farnesylated forms of Ydj1p to be cleaved and carboxylmethylated at the COOH-terminus. We observed an intermediate phenotype, however, when we evaluated Ydj1p mutants containing the <italic>CaaX</italic> motifs from <bold>a</bold>-factor (CVIA) and the Ste18p Gγ subunit (CTLM). These Ydj1p <italic>CaaX</italic> mutants developed normal colony size at 37°C, indicative of isoprenylation, but grew poorly at 40°C relative to wildtype Ydj1p. The growth defect at 40°C was more pronounced than just a smaller colony size. There were fewer colonies per spot relative to farnesylated Ydj1p (CASQ) and additional colonies did not appear after prolonged growth at elevated temperature. It should be mentioned that the <italic>CaaX</italic> motifs compared were purposefully chosen. In the context of <bold>a</bold>-factor, the CASQ motif is recognized as being Ste24p-specific, CTLM is Rce1p-specific, and CVIA is cleaved by both proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Trueblood et al., 2000</xref>); this target specificity is species-independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Plummer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cadiñanos et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Initial experiments were performed using Ydj1p <italic>CaaX</italic> variants encoded on low-copy plasmids. To insure that mild over-expression was not overwhelming the activities of CaaX-processing enzymes and thus confounding phenotypes and data interpretation, we evaluated Yd1jp mutants in the context of chromosome encoded genes. Nearly identical results were obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Alternative <italic>CaaX</italic> motifs do not hinder Ydj1p farnesylation</title><p>We predicted that the differential phenotype observed for Ydj1p <italic>CaaX</italic> mutants (SASQ, CTLM and CVIA) was due to differential expression and/or post-translational modification relative to wildtype (CASQ). For SASQ, we expected loss of isoprenylation. For the others, we expected either reduced farnesylation or alternative geranylgeranylation. To assess the isoprenylation status of the Ydj1p mutants, we took advantage of the observation that farnesylation increases the SDS-PAGE mobility of Ydj1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caplan et al., 1992</xref>). Lysates from the same strains used for the thermotolerance assay were evaluated by immunoblot, which revealed that SASQ was indeed unmodified while CTLM and CVIA were fully farnesylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Moreover, the expression levels of the <italic>CaaX</italic> variants appeared similar. The <italic>ram1</italic> genetic background was used to generate unmodified Ydj1p for comparison; <italic>RAM1</italic> encodes the β subunit of the farnesyl isoprenyltransferase. The <italic>ram1</italic> strain contains a chromosomal copy of <italic>YDJ1</italic> that contributes a small amount of immunoreactive signal in each of the <italic>ram1</italic> samples; the contribution was calculated to be approximately 25% of the total signal in plasmid-transformed strains though comparison of serially diluted samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). It is important to note that the cultures for the extracts evaluated by immunoblotting were prepared at permissive temperature (25°C). Thus, it remains formally possible that reduced thermotolerance could result from poor farnesylation of CTLM and CVIA sequences at higher temperatures. We find this unlikely based on evidence that these motifs are still farnesylated at higher temperature when using a genetic background that allows growth at 40°C (see below and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Post-isoprenylation events decrease the thermotolerance and growth of strains expressing Ydj1p <italic>CaaX</italic> variants</title><p>The differential phenotypes observed for Ydj1p (CASQ) and the Ydj1p mutants (CTLM and CVIA) suggested that the modifications occurring to wildtype Ydj1p were somehow different than those occurring to the mutants. In the absence of altered isoprenylation as an explanation for the differing phenotypes, we considered that post-isoprenylation events might differ between the variants even though we initially predicted that each Ydj1p variant would be proteolytically trimmed to the same species. In keeping with the reported target specificity of the <italic>CaaX</italic> proteases, we expected that Ste24p would cleave Ydj1p (CASQ), Rce1p would cleave Ydj1p (CTLM), and both proteases would act on Ydj1p (CVIA).

Lack of Ste14p improved thermotolerance for strains expressing Ydj1p (CTLM) or Ydj1p (CVIA). A similar pattern was observed using chromosome-encoded Ydj1p <italic>CaaX</italic> variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Ultimately, germination was achieved by including a plasmid copy of <italic>YDJ1</italic> in the parent strain. Once the triple knockout haploid strain was recovered and the plasmid lost, the strain did not grow well, even at room temperature, precluding its use in our study.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15899.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Post-isoprenylation processing negatively impacts Ydj1p variants having alternative CaaX motifs.</title><p>Data were collected as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.

We took advantage of this observation to examine the impact of alternative Ydj1p <italic>CaaX</italic> motifs on this phenotype. By comparison to a vector control, strains over-expressing Ydj1p (CASQ) or non-prenylated Ydj1p (SASQ) yielded slightly smaller colonies after a fixed time of incubation on selective solid media and a 2-fold increase in liquid culture doubling time in both the presence and absence of <italic>STE14</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; compare vector with CASQ and SASQ).

Using GFP-Ras2p, we observed that the CASQ variant was farnesylated but not properly localized to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). These findings provide yet additional support that the ability of CASQ to be farnesylated and resist cleavage are reporter-independent properties of the motif.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Interactions between Ydj1p and the Rnq1 prion domain are not affected by <italic>CaaX</italic> motif mutations</title><p>It is unclear why Ydj1p <italic>CaaX</italic> mutants display growth defects (i.e. thermosensitivity, over-expression toxicity).

The specific underlying cellular process that affects thermotolerance and growth rates is unknown, but could stem from any one of the many processes with which Ydj1p has been associated. Our investigations of client interactions did not yield differences for wildtype and mutant Ydj1p. Additional studies will be needed to establish whether retention of the <italic>CaaX</italic> motif is important for certain protein-protein interactions, proper localization, or for optimal biochemical activity of Ydj1p.

We conclude this because disrupting Ste14p reverses the altered phenotypes associated with Ydj1p variants having cleavable <italic>CaaX</italic> motifs. If preventing <italic>CaaX</italic> proteolysis were the main goal of the shunt motif, then carboxylmethylation would have had little or no impact. Because <italic>CaaX</italic> proteolysis precedes carboxylmethylation, regulating proteolysis through use of different <italic>CaaX</italic> sequences is thus an easy way for the cell to control carboxylmethylation of target proteins. Carboxylmethylation is generally described as enhancing the non-polar/hydrophobic character of the COOH-terminus. In cases where carboxylmethylation occurs (e.g. <bold>a</bold>-factor, Ras-related GTPases, and prelaminA), the effect appears to enhance membrane partitioning of the molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergo et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marcus et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Michaelson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Takahashi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hanker et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ibrahim et al., 2013</xref>). Ydj1p, by comparison, is widely regarded as being mostly a cytosolic chaperone despite being farnesylated. Future studies will address whether maintenance of a polar COOH-terminus (i.e. shunting) is critical for modulating Ydj1p interactions with membranes.</p><p>A major question that our observations raise relates to the frequency of shunting among <italic>CaaX</italic> proteins. There are certainly other <italic>CaaX</italic> proteins that are strong candidates for utilizing the shunt pathway. These isoprenylated proteins have been characterized to retain their <italic>CaaX</italic> motifs directly through biophysical methods (<italic>i.e.</italic> Phk α1 and β subunits; Gγ5) or indirectly through an inability to detect carboxylmethylation (<italic>i.e.</italic> Rab38) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leung et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heilmeyer et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kilpatrick and Hildebrandt, 2007</xref>). Our study adds Ydj1p the list of shunted proteins, but importantly, it is the first to associate a negative impact on cellular processes when a shunted protein is forced to undergo post-isoprenylation processing (i.e. proteolysis and carboxylmethylation). This implies, for Ydj1p at least, that a retained <italic>CaaX</italic> motif is a critical feature necessary for optimal function of the protein. There is a high degree of sequence conservation within the <italic>CaaX</italic> motif for the DNAJA2 chaperone family, to which Ydj1p belongs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). This suggests that our observations may not be specific to yeast. It remains to be determined whether any negative consequences arise when other shunted proteins are forcibly modified.</p><p>It is reasonable to assume that the amino acid sequences that direct a protein to the shunt pathway must be fit two rules basic rules: (1) recognition by prenyltransferases, and (2) not recognized by <italic>CaaX</italic> proteases. The amino acid rules of the <italic>CaaX</italic> motif that promote shunting, however, remain unclear. Limited alanine-scanning site-directed mutagenesis of Ydj1p has not revealed a single amino acid within or immediately adjacent to the motif that is critical for shunting (Kim and Schmidt, unpublished observations). By comparison, similar studies of the shunted protein Gγ5 (CSFL) suggest that the presence of an aromatic residue at the <italic>a</italic><sub>1</sub> or <italic>a</italic><sub>2</sub> position of the <italic>CaaX</italic> motif is the feature that reduces cleavage efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kilpatrick and Hildebrandt, 2007</xref>). Ydj1p and Phk subunits, however, lack an aromatic residue at this position. Moreover, we have observed that the CASQ and CTSQ <italic>CaaX</italic> motifs support similar phenotypes in the context of both Ydj1p and <bold>a</bold>-factor (<italic>i.e.</italic> poorly cleaved), implying that the <italic>a</italic><sub>1</sub> position can be something other than aliphatic in nature ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Plummer et al., 2006]</xref>; Hildebrandt and Schmidt, unpublished observation). Thus, the feature(s) that dictates whether a <italic>CaaX</italic> protein is shunted is likely more complex than a specific amino acid type at a particular position.</p><p>The CASQ sequence taken advantage of in this study is the best example to date of a <italic>CaaX</italic> motif that is specifically cleaved by Ste24p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Trueblood et al., 2000</xref>). Our data continue to support this specificity, but only in the context of <bold>a</bold>-factor as a reporter and only under conditions of protease and/or substrate over-expression. By our best methods, we have determined that only a small amount of fully processed <bold>a</bold>-factor is generated with the CASQ motif relative to motifs cleaved by Rce1p (<italic>e.g.</italic> CVIA, CTLM). Likewise, it is possible that a very small amount of Ydj1p (CASQ) is cleaved, but not in sufficient amounts to be detected. Thus, we conclude that CASQ should not be technically referred to as a Ste24p-specific <italic>CaaX</italic> motif. In fact, emerging evidence points to roles for Ste24p in activities that do not appear to involve isoprenylated targets. These range from quality control of protein topology and translocation to cleavage of non-prenylated peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ast et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hildebrandt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tipper and Harley, 2002</xref>). Taken together, the majority of evidence suggests that Ste24p should be re-classified as a promiscuous protease rather than a highly specific and efficient <italic>CaaX</italic> protease.</p><p>Through our development of Ydj1p as a novel CaaX protein reporter, we have been able to make two significant observations. First, a shunt pathway exists to divert <italic>CaaX</italic> proteins such that isoprenylation is the only post-translational event occurring at the <italic>CaaX</italic> sequence. This pathway is critical to maintenance of Ydj1p dependent phenotypes and likely critical to other proteins that use the shunt pathway. Second, we have undercut the argument that CASQ is a Ste24p-specific <italic>CaaX</italic> motif, which leaves open the question of whether such motifs exist. These observations add significant complexity to protein prenylation, its regulation, and the impact of inhibitors that target the various steps associated with protein prenylation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>M<bold>aterials and</bold> m<bold>ethods</bold></title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains</title><p>The yeast strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>.

rid="bib32">Krishnankutty et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The low-copy Ydj1p expression plasmids were constructed as follows. pWS942 (<italic>CEN URA3 YDJ1</italic>) was derived by subcloning a <italic>YDJ1</italic>-encoding PCR fragment into the XhoI and BamHI sites of pRS416. The PCR fragment was amplified from yeast genomic DNA and contained both 5´ and 3´ untranslated regions associated with <italic>YDJ1</italic>; the fragment was designed to retain a naturally occurring XhoI site 5´ of the <italic>YDJ1</italic> ORF and was engineered through oligo design to contain a BamHI site at the 3´ end of the fragment. pWS1132 (<italic>CEN URA3 YDJ1-SASQ</italic>) was derived by QuikChange such that a silent NheI site was introduced along with the <italic>CaaX</italic> motif mutation. pWS1246 (<italic>CEN URA3 YDJ1-CTLM</italic>) and pWS1286 (<italic>CEN URA3 YDJ1-CVIA</italic>) were derived by modifying pWS1132 through PCR-directed, plasmid-based recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Oldenburg et al., 1997</xref>). In brief, pWS1132 digested with <italic>Nhe</italic>I was co-transformed into yeast along with a PCR product having the desired sequence changes and sequence homology to the parent plasmid in regions flanking the restriction site(s) to allow for gap repair. Following co-transformation, plasmids recovered from yeast colonies surviving SC-Ura selection were evaluated by restriction enzyme mapping and sequencing to confirm the identity of the desired plasmid. <italic>CEN LEU2</italic> versions of the above plasmids were constructed by subcloning <italic>Xho</italic>I-<italic>Bam</italic>HI fragments into the same sites of pRS315.</p><p>The multi-copy Ydj1p expression plasmids were constructed as follows. pWS948 (<italic>2µ URA3 P<sub>PGK</sub>-YDJ1</italic>) was derived by subcloning a <italic>YDJ1</italic>-encoding PCR fragment into the EcoRI and NotI sites of pSM703. The PCR fragment was amplified from yeast genomic DNA and lacked the untranslated regions associated with <italic>YDJ1</italic>; the fragment was engineered to contain EcoRI and NotI sites adjacent to the 5´ and 3´ ends of the <italic>YDJ1</italic> ORF. pWS972 (<italic>2µ URA3 P<sub>PGK</sub>-YDJ1-SASQ</italic>) was derived by PCR-directed, plasmid-based recombination involving pWS948 as the recipient plasmid and a PCR fragment generated using a megaprimer site-mutagenesis approach. The PCR fragment was amplified from pWS948. pWS1247 (<italic>2µ URA3 P<sub>PGK</sub>-YDJ1-CTLM</italic>) and pWS1291 (<italic>2µ URA3 P<sub>PGK</sub>-YDJ1-CVIA</italic>) were constructed by subcloning the <italic>YDJ1</italic>-encoding BamHI-BsaBI fragments from pWS1246 and pWS1286, respectively, into the same sites of pWS948.</p><p>The His<sub>6</sub>-Ydj1p expression plasmid (pWS1307) was constructed in two steps.

Next, a fragment encoding a poly-histidine tag was introduced into pWS1298 such that the GST sequence and a linker region were eliminated.</p><p>The GFP-Ydj1p expression plasmids (pWS1389-1392) were each constructed by subcloning a PCR fragment, designed to encode GFP flanked by <italic>YDJ1</italic> 5´ non-coding and coding sequences, into appropriate Ydj1p expression plasmids (pWS942, pWS1132, pWS1246 and pWS1286, respectively). This resulted in GFP encoded at the 5´ end of the <italic>YDJ1</italic> open reading frame. The DNA fragment was produced by PCR from pWS882 (<italic>CEN URA3 P<sub>GAL</sub>-GFP-YDJ1</italic>) with appropriately designed primers, digested with <italic>Eco</italic>RI and <italic>Pfl</italic>MI, and ligated into the same sites on recipient plasmids. pWS882 itself was created by PCR-directed, plasmid-based recombination involving the introduction of a PCR fragment encoding <italic>YDJ1</italic> into pWS270 (<italic>CEN URA3 P<sub>GAL</sub>-GFP-RAS2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Manandhar et al., 2007</xref>).

Immunoprecipitated Ydj1p could not be visualized because it was obscured by the presence of the antibody heavy chain that co-migrated with Ydj1p on the gel.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Sequence alignments</title><p>Sequences and alignment scores were retrieved from the HomoloGene (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002924">SCR_002924</ext-link>) database using “Ydj1” as the query (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/homologene">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/homologene</ext-link>).

Primarily relying on genetic methods in yeast, the authors show that the natural C-terminal sequence CASQ of Ydj1p in yeast is farnesylated but not proteolyzed or carboxymethylated. They show that Ydj1p farnesylation is critical for function (based on results with the SASQ mutant) but that forced proteolysis and carboxymethylation by substituting with C-terminal sequences from a-factor or Ste18p disrupt Ydj1p function as evidenced by thermotolerance differences. They also show that CASQ processing is context dependent (i.e. different with protease overexpression and presence in a-factor). The work appears carefully done and rigorous and is the first clear demonstration that prenylation without further processing is a biological requirement for at least one protein.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>What is not clear from the manuscript is why further processing is counterproductive for Ydj1p and whether there are for example, any 'readers' for a specific C-terminal code. We think the manuscript would be significantly strengthened if the authors attempted to investigate whether CASQ vs. CVIA versions of Ydj1p showed differences in binding partners. This could involve testing by immunoprecipitation whether there are changes in the degree of association with GDI, Yip or other possible interacting proteins.</p><p>Another limitation of the study is the possibility that overexpression of Ydj1p constructs might alter the efficiency of processing, perhaps by swamping out the key membrane proteases, and thereby influence the phenotypes and levels of processing observed. We think this could be addressed in at least two ways. One of the ways to address this would be to use chromosomally inserted forms of the <italic>CXXX</italic> Ydj1p and then assess the thermotolerance of the strains. An alternative approach would be to perform mass spectrometry on an overexpressed form of Ydj1p with a CVIA C-terminal sequence (same plasmid and promoter as the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> experiment; rce1 KO). In this case, one would be testing the prediction that overexpressed Ydj1p-CVIA was completely processed by Ste24p in contrast to the result with Ydj1p-CASQ which was not under these conditions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15899.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>What is not clear from the manuscript is why further processing is counterproductive for Ydj1p and whether there are for example, any 'readers' for a specific C-terminal code.

The possibility that the natural Ydj1p <italic>CaaX</italic> motif interacts with specific ‘readers’ is an intriguing possibility. We first investigated, as suggested, whether interactions between Ydj1p <italic>CaaX</italic> mutants and specific client proteins were disrupted. But, it was unclear to us why investigations of GDI and Yip1 were promoted, since we are not aware of evidence (genetic, physical, published) that these proteins interact with Ydj1p. Instead, we chose to investigate the interaction between Ydj1p and the prion domain of Rnq1p (PrD), which is known to be dependent on farnesylated Ydj1p. We confirmed the previously reported farnesyl-dependency but did not observe altered interactions for Ydj1p <italic>CaaX</italic> mutants despite using multiple technical approaches, including co-IP and genetic analyses. These results are now reported as an additional figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). We also investigated the interaction between Ydj1p and the glutamine-rich fragment of Htt and observed no differences with <italic>CaaX</italic> mutants. Lastly, we evaluated expression of Axl1p whose mRNA and protein levels are dependent on Ydj1p (Meacham et al., J. Biol. Chem. 1999, 274:34396-34402). We observed reduced levels of Axl1p in the absence of Ydj1p (<italic>i.e. ydj1</italic>∆) but not for any of the Ydj1p <italic>CaaX</italic> mutants, including Ydj1p SASQ. The Htt and Axl1p results are mentioned in the text but not reported in figure format. Of the considerable number of other genetic and physical interactors reported for Ydj1p (over 400 unique interactors on the <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> Genome Database), we expect that a case-by-case approach could eventually yield an appropriate “reader”. But, extensive case-by-case analyses and/or more appropriate global analyses would have quickly expanded our effort beyond the scope and timeframe of this current study. In our opinion, our negative results for interaction studies do not weaken our conclusion that the shunt pathway is functionally relevant for certain <italic>CaaX</italic> proteins.</p><p><italic>Another limitation of the study is the possibility that overexpression of Ydj1p constructs might alter the efficiency of processing, perhaps by swamping out the key membrane proteases, and thereby influence the phenotypes and levels of processing observed.

Moreover, the rescuing effect of a <italic>ste14</italic>∆ deletion was again observed as reported with plasmid-based studies. We interpret these findings to indicate that observed phenotypes reflect underlying alterations in physiology that are not due to the mild over-expression of Ydj1p achieved with a <italic>CEN</italic>-based plasmid system.</p></body></sub-article></article>
