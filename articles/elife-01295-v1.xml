membrane protein palmitoylation subsequent to mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) openings. Here, we characterize this pathway in cardiac muscle. Myocytes with increased expression of the acyl transferase, DHHC5, have decreased Na/K pump activity. In DHHC5-deficient myocytes, Na/K pump activity and surface area/volume ratios are increased, the palmitoylated regulatory protein, phospholemman (PLM), and the cardiac Na/Ca exchanger (NCX1) show greater surface membrane localization, and MEND is inhibited in four protocols. Both electrical and optical methods demonstrate that PTP-dependent MEND occurs during reoxygenation of anoxic hearts. Post-anoxia MEND is ablated in DHHC5-deficient hearts, inhibited by cyclosporine A (CsA) and adenosine, promoted by staurosporine (STS), reduced in hearts lacking PLM, and correlates with impaired post-anoxia contractile function. Thus, the MEND pathway appears to be deleterious in severe oxidative stress but may constitutively contribute to cardiac sarcolemma turnover in dependence on metabolic stress.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01295.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01295.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01295.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many people who survive a stroke or heart attack experience substantial tissue damage when the blood supply is restored. Much of this damage can be caused by the mitochondria inside the cells releasing a protein called cytochrome c that can cause cells to die in a process called apoptosis. The cytochrome c is released as the outer membrane of the mitochondria becomes permeable and pores called permeability transition pores open up in the inner membrane. Now Lin et al. explore if additional molecules released from the mitochondria might also initiate important cellular responses during the reoxygenation of oxygen-deprived tissue.</p><p>Lin and co-workers recently showed that the mitochondria of some cells can release a small enzyme cofactor, coenzyme A, which then promotes a cellular response called massive endocytosis. This process can cause up to 70% of the cell surface membrane to be absorbed into the interior of the cell in the form of membrane vesicles. Most forms of endocytosis involve a much smaller fraction of the cell membrane and employ a set of well-known endocytic proteins that are not involved in massive endocytosis. Now, Lin et al. investigate the role of massive endocytosis in cardiac muscle.</p><p>Electrical and optical measurements reveal that massive endocytosis occurs as cardiac cells that have been deprived of oxygen are reoxygenated. Lin et al. also find that an enzyme called DHHC5 must be present to allow endocytosis to take place during reoxygenation. DHHC5 is an enzyme that catalyzes a process called acylation – the transfer of acyl groups to proteins at the cell surface. Moreover, the deletion of DHHC5 has a beneficial impact on the performance of cardiac muscle after oxygen deprivation, which implies that molecules that inhibit protein acylation might protect the heart from damage during reoxygenation. Together, these results establish new pathological and physiological roles for the acylation, which is one of the most common biochemical modifications made to membrane proteins after they are synthesized.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01295.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01295.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>endocytosis</kwd><kwd>cardaic myocyte</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>voltage clamp</kwd><kwd>cyclosporine</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL067942</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hilgemann</surname><given-names>Donald W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL513225</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hilgemann</surname><given-names>Donald W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Reoxygenation of anoxic cardiac tissue promotes massive endocytosis that is triggered by release of coenzymeA from mitochondria, followed by palmitoylation of membrane proteins, sarcolemma vesiculation, and transfer of sarolemma vesicles to large endosomes and vacuoles.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Acute ischemic events are now a leading cause of death in the entire world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">World Health Organization, 2013</xref>). Ironically, much of the damage from ischemic events can occur during reoxygenation of tissue when mitochondria begin to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) at increased rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jennings, 2013</xref>). One of the hallmarks of reperfusion injury is a pronounced swelling of mitochondria, and the extensive opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pores (PTPs) that underlies this swelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haworth and Hunter, 1979</xref>) is a nearly decisive step on the path to cell demise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Halestrap et al., 2004</xref>). Associated with this progression, mitochondria release cytochrome c to the cytoplasm and thereby activate apoptosis programs that can definitively establish cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gottlieb, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Given that both outer and inner mitochondrial membranes become permeable during reperfusion injury, mitochondria with certainty release a large number of metabolites and small proteins. Therefore, the question arises whether, besides cytochrome c, other molecules released from mitochondria might serve signaling functions. Our analysis of Ca-activated endocytosis in BHK fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hilgemann et al., 2013</xref>) suggests that mitochondrial release of coenzyme A (CoA) may be important. This hypothesis arises from two facts. First, mitochondria accumulate CoA to high concentrations with respect to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Leonardi et al., 2005</xref>). Second, many key cytoplasmic enzymes are modulated by binding long-chain acyl CoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Faergeman and Knudsen, 1997</xref>), a CoA metabolite that will be generated immediately if CoA is released (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Idell-Wenger et al., 1978</xref>). These include glycogen synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wititsuwannakul and Kim, 1977</xref>), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kawaguchi and Bloch, 1974</xref>), and perhaps AMP kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Faergeman and Knudsen, 1997</xref>), as well as KATP potassium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shumilina et al., 2006</xref>). Our study in BHK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hilgemann et al., 2013</xref>) suggests that release of CoA from mitochondria may promote the palmitoylation of surface membrane proteins, subsequent to generation of acyl CoA. Further, our study suggests that extensive palmitoylation promotes internalization of membrane as a form of ‘lipid raft’-dependent endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Doherty and McMahon, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Beyond the function of PTPs at the threshold of cell death, it is now established that transient mitochondrial PTP openings play important physiological functions by causing transient mitochondrial depolarizations that release matrix Ca to the cytoplasm accompanied by the generation of superoxide flashes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brenner and Moulin, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhou and O’Rourke, 2012</xref>). In this light, a possibility emerges that cytoplasmic free CoA could physiologically play important second messenger functions in dependence on its release from mitochondria. On the one hand, mitochondrial depolarization will favor reverse CoA transport to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tahiliani, 1991</xref>), and on the other hand transient PTP openings may allow enough CoA to escape from the matrix space, down its more than 50-to-1 gradient, to significantly increase the low micromolar concentration of free cytoplasmic CoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Idell-Wenger et al., 1978</xref>).</p><p>We describe here experiments that address these possibilities in cardiac myocytes and in intact cardiac tissue. First, we show that the function and abundance of cardiac Na/K pumps and Na/Ca exchangers is affected by the expression of the plasmalemma-directed acyl transferase, DHHC5, then we show that massive endocytic (MEND) responses in isolated myocytes depend on acyl CoA and DHHC5 activity, and that MEND responses occur when PTP openings occur during the reoxygenation of anoxic cardiac muscle. Finally, we show that two cardiac membrane proteins are indeed increasingly palmitoylated during reoxygentation, that internalized PLM (phospholemman) is more heavily palmitoylated than PLM on the cell surface, and that DHHC5 activity significantly impacts cardiac contractile recovery after anoxia.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In developing a tactic to characterize the MEND pathway in cardiac myocytes, we chose to focus on Na/K pumps. First, Na/K pumps are high density transmembrane protein complexes in the cardiac sarcolemma whose activity strongly modulates cardiac function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hilgemann, 2004</xref>). As such, Na/K pumps likely represent a large fraction of membrane particles that have been visualized in freeze fracture studies and that cluster and decrease in number during anoxia/reoxygenation episodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Frank et al., 1980</xref>). Second, it was described almost 40 years ago that the number of Na/K pumps, quantified as ouabain binding sites, decreases markedly during ischemia/reperfusion events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beller et al., 1976</xref>). Recently, it has been shown that Na/K pumps are indeed internalized via endocytosis in a cardiac myocyte culture during ‘simulated’ ischemia/reperfusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belliard et al., 2012</xref>), and internalization still occurs during metabolic stress when a di-leucine motif of Na/K pump alpha subunits has been mutated to prevent pump involvement in conventional, clathrin-dependent trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pierre et al., 2010</xref>). Third, extensive internalization of Na/K pumps also occurs in response to metabolic stress in several other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mandel et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bortner et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mann et al., 2001</xref>). In alveolar epithelia the reversible internalization of Na/K pumps in hypoxia is initiated by ROS generation and the activation of protein kinase Cs (PKCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dada et al., 2003</xref>), details that are reminiscent of our findings that PKCs and ROS promote MEND in BHK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hilgemann et al., 2013</xref>). Fourth, the FXYD subunits of Na/K pumps can be dually palmitoylated and depalmitoylated at the surface membrane, and we have shown that overexpression of the major FXYD protein of cardiac muscle, phospholemman (PLM), promotes the occurrence of MEND in a PKC-dependent fashion in a TReX-293 cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hilgemann et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>As a second tactic, we developed a new electrical method to monitor surface membrane area as electrical cell capacitance (C<sub>m</sub>) <italic>on-line</italic> in intact tissue over periods of hours. In results presented, we employ this non-invasive C<sub>m</sub> (NIC) recording technique with superfused right ventricular strips (see ‘Materials and methods’). Briefly, NIC recording exploits the fact that myocyte sarcolemma constitutes the great majority of cellular surface membrane in the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banerjee et al., 2007</xref>). Although non-myocytes can be as numerous as myocytes, all non-myocytes are much smaller than myocytes. Similar to skeletal muscle, therefore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cole, 1976</xref>), rapid extracellular voltage oscillations (15 kHz/1 mV) can be used to monitor the composite sarcolemmal C<sub>m</sub>. The use of this <italic>on-line</italic> method allowed us to rapidly test for the occurrence of MEND in intact cardiac tissue. As described subsequently, we have verified all findings from NIC recording with independent methods, specifically via an optical method in intact hearts to follow fluid phase uptake of fluorescent probes and via patch clamp of isolated myocytes. Additional results that validate NIC recording are provided in ‘Material and methods’.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sarcolemmal significance of constitutive DHHC5 activity</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> demonstrates that expression of the DHHC5 acyl transferase strongly influences Na/K pump activity in cultured cardiac myocytes, namely human fibroblast-derived cardiac myocytes (iCell Cardiomyocytes, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ma et al., 2011</xref>]). These myocytes are transfected easily to overexpress and knockdown regulatory proteins, they highly express cardiac-specific proteins, such as PLM and the Na/Ca exchanger, NCX1, and ion transport activities are equivalent to those of adult myocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fine et al., 2013</xref>). Measuring maximal Na/K pump currents exactly as described in our study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fine et al., 2013</xref>), the first two bar graphs of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> show that overexpression of DHHC5, together with green fluorescent GFP to identify transfected myocytes, decreases Na/K pump currents by 55%. This decrease becomes still somewhat larger with dual DHHC2/DHHC5 expression. Conversely, knockdown of DHHC5 by siRNA causes a 38% increase of Na/K pump currents, compared to myocytes transfected with scrambled siRNA (‘siRNA control’), and dual DHHC5/DHHC2 knockdown causes a 90% increase. Although these changes may arise from either a change of pump activity or a change of pump density in the sarcolemma, data presented next indicate that changes of transporter localization play a large role.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01295.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Na/K pump current densities are inversely dependent on DHHC5 expression in human iCell Cardiomyocytes.</title><p>From left to right, Na/K pump current densities in iCell Cardiomyocytes transfected with GFP to identify transfected cells, DHHC5, DHHC5 and DHHC2, transfected with scrambled siRNA, siRNA for DHHC5, and siRNA for DHHC5 and DHHC2.

DHHC5-GT mice have significantly reduced growth rates. Between 4 and 5 weeks, the average weights of DHHC5-GT mice (14 ± 0.8 g) were 24% less than control litter mates (19 ± 0.9 g).

The dimensions of isolated myocytes from young DHHC5-GT animals were also significantly smaller than those from matched WT animals.

Cell area (i.e., C<sub>m</sub>) /volume ratios of myocytes were then determined as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. The volume of each myocyte was estimated from a micrograph of the myocyte still resting on the surface of the chamber employed.

Furthermore, myocyte surface area/volume ratios are significantly increased. Analysis of ion channel and excitation-contraction coupling function are now required to define more clearly the roles of DHHC5 and DHHC2 in myocytes. However, the present results strongly suggest that DHHC5 activity modulates Na/K pump densities in cardiac myocytes by modifying pump internalization rates.

In contrast to the delayed MEND responses that occur in BHK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hilgemann et al., 2013</xref>), Ca transients cause immediate MEND responses in myocytes. These responses, which may represent myocyte wounding responses, are blunted in DHHC5-deficient myocytes when they are activated by moderate Ca transients. However, the explosive responses that occur when Ca transients are large (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) are unaffected by acute inhibition of DHHC5 activity. Thus, the palmitoylation state of myocytes promotes Ca-activated MEND, but Ca can cause MEND by a mechanism unrelated to DHHC activity. In contrast, myocyte MEND responses to transient oxidative stress and to phenylephrine require an immediate presence of cytoplasmic acyl Co A and therefore are likely to involve palmitoylation as they develop. In the case of MEND induced by KSP solution, we cannot discount at this time that mitochondrial Ca release is playing some role.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>MEND in intact cardiac muscle</title><p>In cardiac muscle more than 95% of total CoA metabolites reside in the mitochondrial matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Idell-Wenger et al., 1978</xref>), and the cytoplasmic free CoA concentration is about 7 μM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Idell-Wenger et al., 1978</xref>). Given that mitochondria make up about 30% of myocyte volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>), the physical basis for our working hypothesis is well established in myocytes. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6">Figures 5 and 6</xref> document by independent methods that sarcolemma in intact hearts is significantly internalized upon reoxygenation after an anoxic episode. Internalization is dependent on fatty acids and DHHC5 activity. It is prevented by agents that precondition hearts against reoxygenation damage, namely adenosine and CsA, and it is promoted by low concentrations of staurosporine that promote reoxygenation damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schneider, 2005</xref>). The results together suggest that MEND responses occurring during reoxygenation may be relevant to human ischemia/reperfusion events.</p><p>As expected if MEND contributes significantly to myocyte damage during reoxygenation, contractile function of ventricular muscle is preserved by 60% in DHHC5-GT right ventricles after 30 min anoxia without glucose and 25 min reoxygenation with glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This degree of functional preservation is as good as standard ‘preconditioning’ protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cave et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schneider et al., 2001</xref>). Whether the occurrence of MEND is in fact detrimental to functional recovery is uncertain. Loss of substantial amounts of sarcolemma may certainly impact cardiac excitation-contraction coupling. From a different perspective, MEND itself may not be the culprit. MEND appears to rely on the development of submicroscopic membrane phase transitions. Independent of endocytosis, therefore, the occurrence of membrane phase transitions may promote membrane defects and membrane shedding that mediates release of cytoplasmic enzymes and metabolites to the extracellular space. The important conclusion for reperfusion injury is that effective inhibition of palmitoylation may significantly inhibit this part of reperfusion damage, and these same considerations apply to the function of vascular cells and fibroblasts during reperfusion.</p><p>In conclusion, this article provides evidence that a signaling pathway leading from mitochondrial PTP openings to DHHC5 acyl transferases and endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hilgemann et al., 2013</xref>) is activated during the reoxygenation of anoxic cardiac tissue. Multiple lines of evidence support that idea that endocytosis during reoxygentation requires increased membrane protein palmitoylation, and inhibition of the pathway appears to protect muscle from reoxygenation injury. The phenotypes of myocytes that are deficient in DHHC5 acyl activity suggest that the pathway contributes significantly to constitutive sarcolemma turnover and will mediate enhanced sarcolemma turnover in response to transient metabolic stress.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Electrical methods and myocytes</title><p>Patch clamp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yaradanakul et al., 2008</xref>) and myocyte preparation were as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lariccia et al., 2011</xref>).

Right ventricular strips were dissected at 10°C in a relaxing solution that contained 20 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> to prevent electrical activity and contraction. Muscles were mounted horizontally in a chamber maintained at 37°C and superfused with physiological salt solution, described below, at a velocity of 1–2 cm/s. The capacitive component of NIC signals increased with increasing oscillation frequency up to a maximum at ∼23 kHz. The optimal frequency for recording was therefore about 15 kHz. The phase angle was adjusted by up to 2° to insure that the capacitive signal was zero upon touching the probe to a soft rubber septum in the recording chamber. As described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, capacitive signals in NIC recording can be strongly decreased by extracting lipids from right ventricular strips and are very insensitive to sarcolemmal conductance changes of very large magnitudes. One major experimental requirement for reliable NIC recording is that the probe remains mechanically stable with respect to the tissue and that conductance of the tissue (i.e., of the extracellular space) does not change. Conductance signal changes were negligible during NIC recordings presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01295.011</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>NIC recording monitors sarcolemmal area and is insensitive to sarcolemmal conductance changes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) As described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lariccia et al., 2011</xref>), (2-hydoxypropyl)-β-cyclodextrin (HPCD) extracts cholesterol from fibroblasts without causing C<sub>m</sub> changes. However, methyl-β-cylodextrin (BMCD) causes large decreases of C<sub>m</sub> that presumably reflect extraction of both phospholipids and cholesterol. Similarly, NIC signals from right ventricular strips are unaffected by application of HPCD (8 mM) but are strongly decreased by application of BMCD (8 mM). (<bold>B</bold>) Muscle incubated with ATP and 0 Ca with 1 mM EGTA to avoid contraction when the sarcolemma develops ruptures. A rather high concentration of sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS, 2.5 mM) does not significantly decrease NIC signals. Although this concentration of SDS generates sarcolemmal leaks with great certainty, it does not effectively extract the sarcolemma from the intact muscle preparation. By contrast, Triton X100 at 3% very effectively decreases NIC signals from the same muscle, as expected for an effective membrane extraction. These results verify that NIC signals are not affected by increases of sarcolemmal conductance until cellular conductance becomes significant with respect to that of the extracellular space.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01295.011">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01295.011</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-01295-fig9-v1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Solutions</title><p>Standard MEND Solutions minimize all currents other than NCX1 current.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Richard Aldrich (Reviewing editor) and Bertil Hille (peer reviewer).</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Reoxygenation after anoxia in cardiac tissue results in massive endocytosis (MEND) described in the companion manuscript. Here, the authors extend their MEND experiments to induced cardiomyocytes (iCell cardiomyocytes) in culture during reperfusion injury. Using protocols that either raise cytoplasmic [acyl CoA], increase K succinate, or raise Ca, the authors infer that PTP openings, PKC activation, and a fast reacting calcium-dependent mechanism induce MEND.</p><p>MEND is strongly inhibited in mice lacking the acyltransferase, corresponding to significantly preserved right ventricular contractile function in DHHC5 KO mice after reperfusion injury. Finally, phospholemman and flotillin-2 are more palmitoylated after reperfusion injury. The hypothesis is that palmitoylation either reduces Na/K pump activity directly or increases uptake of this transporter.</p><p>As in the companion manuscript, the authors study the whole MEND process. In this paper, however, the authors present the interesting finding that reperfusion injury induces MEND, and inhibition of MEND reduces loss of cardiac contractility (at least in R. ventricle). This most consequential finding of a reduction of MEND and preservation of contractility in DHHC5 KO mice suggests a potential new approach to ameliorate the vexing reperfusion injury problem.</p><p>The following issues would have to be adequately addressed for the paper to be accepted.</p><p>The high importance of the paper is that it brings to real tissue the new hypothesis proposed in the first paper only on the basis of cultured cells, and then it uses that new concept to suggest an approach to relieving reperfusion injury. Several of the mechanistic conclusions are much less well supported and detract from the central point. These aspects of the paper should be diminished to what is strongly supported or should be eliminated.</p><p>1) There are two weak parts of the manuscript: 1) the link between palmitoylation and Na/K pump activity and 2) PKC's part in this process. Shotgun palmitoylation of diverse protein targets seems to be the central mechanism, perhaps in analogy to uncontrolled ubiquitination. Somehow, this activates massive membrane uptake, and of course, Na/K ATPase as an abundant membrane protein is lost. The authors need to tone down the centrality of the Na/K ATPase. Although it is logical that this has a major negative impact on cells, it may be simply one of many.</p><p>2) Overall, the conclusion that is most interesting is the protection from ischemia reperfusion injury by DHHC5 loss. This makes a good conclusion for the functional importance of palmitoylation, but the authors should remain conservative about what palmitoylation does to loss of protein or membrane.</p><p>The only way we see forward is comparison of proteins and their palmitoylation states by mass spec before and after MEND induction in order to obtain more clues about the uptake process. This is likely to take a year or more and should be the topic of follow-up studies.</p><p>3) The insufficiently resolved conclusions/speculations on lipid order should be eliminated.</p><p>Also increased is IDTPP, the magnitude of a “hydrophobic cation current” per surface area. IDTTP is not explained and no recordings are shown, but perhaps IDTPP is a capacitative displacement current accompanying voltage steps, and it appears when a hydrophobic cation is added to cells and partitions into their plasma membrane. The authors assume that IDTTP assays “disorder” in membranes but don't explain what disorder means in this case, nor why disorder would increase the partition of hydrophobic ion into a plasma membrane. The increase of IDTPP in the hypomorph mice is taken to suggest that “membrane protein palmitoylation promotes membrane order, similar to cholesterol”. It is not clear which protein(s) was/were palmitoylated, nor how such palmitoylation would increase order.</p><p>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the authors measure the “Na/K pump current”. How this is done is not explained, and apparently not referenced.</p><p>It is shown that expression of GFP diminished the pump current by 30%, nearly as much as overexpression of DHHC5 (55%). The effect of GFP is not discussed. Happily, the pump current is doubled by knockdown of both DHHC5 and DHHC2 (the graph seems mislabeled). It is not discussed what the pump current assays in this case. Is the pump current larger because the cytoplasmic Na concentration is increased? Or does lack of DHCC5 increase the surface density of Na pumps, or the fraction of surface pump molecules that are palmitoylated, or all of the above? While <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> is suggestive of a role of palmitoylation, it's difficult to distil a clear message.</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> studies single cardiac cells, and strips of cardiac tissue, from mice with diminished DHHC5 expression. The volume of the myocytes is slightly smaller, and their capacitance per volume slightly larger; what this means is not explained. A capacitance is determined in strips of tissue by “non-invasive capacitance recording” (NIC). That capacitance, too, is increased. NIC is a new method briefly explained in the Methods, but not well enough for others to use it, and it is not validated. It's not explained how a surface area (per volume of an individual cell) is related to what we take to be the summed surface area (not per volume) of all myocytes in a strip of muscle.</p><p>6) As with the companion manuscript, the writing, proofreading, and presentation need to be greatly improved.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01295.013</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The high importance of the paper is that it brings to real tissue the new hypothesis proposed in the first paper only on the basis of cultured cells, and then it uses that new concept to suggest an approach to relieving reperfusion injury.

In the first figure of the cardiac article, I presented an inverse dependence of Na/K pump currents on DHHC expression in cultured myocytes. It was noted by the reviewers that the inhibition by DHHC5 overexpression was unimpressive because overexpression of GFP caused an inhibition of nearly one-half the magnitude. <italic>I shot myself unnecessarily in the foot!</italic> From many years of experience, we know with great certainty that smaller cells are preferentially transfected when DNA is transfected with Lipofectamine and related reagents. We have already published in detail for these cardiac iCells that the Na/K pump activity is lower in smaller cells. That is because the smaller cells are less well differentiated (Fine and Hilgemann, Am J Physiol Cell Physiol. 2013;305:C481-91), and that is why pump current densities are lower in the GFP-transfected myocytes. In response, I removed data for the untransfected iCells and therewith removed a completely unnecessary complication.</p><p>Regarding PKCs, the sticky point that enabled this critique is that the generation of acyl CoAs (subsequent to PTP openings) is required for MEND to occur, but it is definitively not sufficient. I had worked fairly extensively on this issue prior to submission and decided to present clear (and rather extensive) evidence that PKCs play a role in BHK cells. I don’t see why the reviewers objected to that data, except that it burdens the reader with the truth about a biological system that is not entirely simple. The fact is that the equivalent experiments in cardiac myocytes were less impressive, and I am happy to tone them down. This is easily done because I now present much more impressive data that transient oxidative stress supports the final steps of MEND in myocytes (as well as in BHK cells).</p><p>I also point the reader toward the idea that the coalescence of proteins and membranes into domains constitutes the development of membrane phase transitions that on their own may have consequences, e.g.cause membrane defects, in addition to consequences of MEND per se.</p><p><italic>2) Overall, the conclusion that is most interesting is the protection from ischemia reperfusion injury by DHHC5 loss.

We are initiating mass spec studies and they will indeed take a long time to move forward. The biggest wait will be the wait to be funded to do this seriously! One year, maybe two, if we are lucky, based on my experiences recently.</p><p><italic>3) The insufficiently resolved conclusions/speculations on lipid order should be eliminated</italic>.</p><p><italic>Also increased is IDTPP, the magnitude of a “hydrophobic cation current” per surface area.

I point out immediately that all results employing NIC recording have been confirmed by either patch clamp measurements using myocytes or by optical methods using intact hearts. Furthermore I point the reader to results presented in the Methods that further validate the NIC methods. I explain to the reader that the NIC method was critical because it allowed me to analyze the behavior of intact cardiac tissue under wide range of conditions. The method was key to moving forward with this paper, even though everything has been confirmed with other methods. I believe that the presentation of the data from NIC recording is very well justified and that the description of the method and potential problems in using are adequately described for this publication.</p><p><italic>6) As with the companion manuscript, the writing, proofreading, and presentation need to be greatly improved</italic>.</p><p>I have really tried hard to improve the clarity of this article. The overwhelming recommendation of the reviewers for both articles was to work hard on the presentation, to improve the clarity of writing and figures, and to make the articles more attractive to a wider audience. I have really tried:</p><p>I have remade all of the figures, using color and cartoons to make them both easier to understand and to make them friendlier to look at on a computer screen. I was at first skeptical, but my colleagues strongly agree that the improvements are big ones.</p><p>I completely rewrote both the Introduction and the Discussion of this paper. As noted already, I have taken your recommendation to get off the Na/K horse seriously and I launch the paper straight from the perspective of ‘reperfusion injury.’ I also try to guide the discussion along this line, which likely will attract the most readers. As for Na/K pumps, I do keep the perspective in foreground that this transporter is a key regulator of cardiac contractility and therefore that it deserves general attention. That’s a fact.</p><p>In both articles I have included many didactic lines to help guide the general reader through the data (and to understand what we do experimentally) both in the text of the article and in the figure legends.</p></body></sub-article></article>
