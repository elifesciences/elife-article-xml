different pre-microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), each varying in sequence and/or structure. We hypothesize that TRBP displays dynamic adaptability to accommodate heterogeneity in target RNA structures. Thus, it is crucial to ascertain the role of intrinsic and RNA-induced protein dynamics in RNA recognition and binding. We have previously elucidated the role of intrinsic and RNA-induced conformational exchange in the double-stranded RNA-binding domain 1 (dsRBD1) of TRBP in shape-dependent RNA recognition. The current study delves into the intrinsic and RNA-induced conformational dynamics of the TRBP-dsRBD2 and then compares it with the dsRBD1 study carried out previously. Remarkably, the two domains exhibit differential binding affinity to a 12-bp dsRNA owing to the presence of critical residues and structural plasticity. Furthermore, we report that dsRBD2 depicts constrained conformational plasticity when compared to dsRBD1. Although, in the presence of RNA, dsRBD2 undergoes induced conformational exchange within the designated RNA-binding regions and other residues, the amplitude of the motions remains modest when compared to those observed in dsRBD1. We propose a dynamics-driven model of the two tandem domains of TRBP, substantiating their contributions to the versatility of dsRNA recognition and binding.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>RNA recognition</kwd><kwd>protein dynamics</kwd><kwd>conformational heterogeneity</kwd><kwd>MD simulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001843</institution-id><institution>Science and Engineering Research Board</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EMR/2015/001966</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chugh</surname><given-names>Jeetender</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001407</institution-id><institution>Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BT/PR24185/BRB/10/1605/2017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chugh</surname><given-names>Jeetender</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The differential conformational space accessible to the two domains of TRBP, even though they both adopt a canonical dsRBD fold, affect how they interact with target RNAs.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play a crucial role in every aspect of RNA biology, including folding, splicing, processing, transport, and localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dreyfuss et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jiang and Baltimore, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wilkinson and Shyu, 2001</xref>). RBPs can be broadly classified into single-stranded RNA-binding proteins (ssRBPs) and double-stranded RNA-binding proteins (dsRBPs). While ssRBPs are generally sequence specific as the interaction points include exposed nucleobases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Auweter et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Daubner et al., 2013</xref>); dsRBPs tend to target a particular structural fold, especially the A-form RNA duplex via phosphate backbone and sugar hydroxyl protons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Masliah et al., 2013</xref>). dsRBPs interact with highly structured dsRNAs via their double-stranded RNA-binding motifs/domains (dsRBMs/dsRBDs).</p><p>dsRBDs are 65â68 amino acid long domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">St Johnston et al., 1992</xref>) that contain a highly conserved secondary structure (Î±<sub>1</sub>âÎ²<sub>1</sub>âÎ²<sub>2</sub>âÎ²<sub>3</sub>âÎ±<sub>2</sub>), where the two Î±-helices are packed against an antiparallel Î²-sheet formed by three Î²-strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bycroft et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kharrat et al., 1995</xref>). All the dsRBDs have three common RNA-binding regions: (1) the middle of helix Î±<sub>1</sub> (E residue), (2) the N-terminal residues of helix Î±<sub>2</sub> (KKxAK motif), and (3) the loop between Î²<sub>1</sub> and Î²<sub>2</sub> strands (GPxH motif), forming a canonical RNA-binding surface that interacts with the consecutive minor, major, and minor groove of a dsRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Masliah et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tian et al., 2004</xref>). dsRBDs interact with dsRNAs in a non-sequence-specific manner, targeting the sugar 2â²-OH groups (dsRBDs do not target dsDNAs) and phosphate backbone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bevilacqua and Cech, 1996</xref>). They are often arranged in a modular fashion to create highly versatile RNA-binding surfaces and have been classified into types A and B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fierro-Monti and Mathews, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">St Johnston et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krovat and Jantsch, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Masliah et al., 2013</xref>). Type-A dsRBDs are highly homologous (&gt;59%) to the consensus sequence and are involved in RNA binding, whereas type B has only a conserved C-terminal end and helps in stabilizing the proteinâRNA/protein complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Green et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krovat and Jantsch, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Laraki et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>dsRBDs, both within and across proteins, exhibit significant variations in their binding modes and affinities toward specific RNA targets. For example, <italic>X. laevis</italic> RNA-binding protein A (XlrbpA) has three dsRBDs: xl1 (type A), xl2 (type A), and xl3 (type B), where the xl2 is only able to bind the dsRNA in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krovat and Jantsch, 1996</xref>). In Protein Kinase R (PKR), these two types of dsRBDs also demonstrate a differential dynamic behavior, i.e., dsRBD1 (type A) shows plasticity on Âµs and psâns timescale, while dsRBD2 (type B) predominantly depicts dynamics on the psâns timescale dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fierro-Monti and Mathews, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nanduri et al., 2000</xref>). Furthermore, the average order parameter (S<sup>2</sup>; the degree of motion of the backbone NâH vector in a cone, where S<sup>2</sup> = 1 indicates limited flexibility and 0 indicates maximum flexibility) for the individual Î±-helices and Î²-sheets is observed to be lower for dsRBD1 than for dsRBD2, suggesting the latter as a more rigid domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fierro-Monti and Mathews, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nanduri et al., 2000</xref>). Trans-activation response (TAR) RNA-binding protein (TRBP) harbors two type A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krovat and Jantsch, 1996</xref>) dsRBDs, i.e., dsRBD1 and dsRBD2, where the latter shows a significantly stronger binding affinity (four times) for pre-miR-155 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benoit et al., 2013</xref>). Additionally, studies have reported that dsRBD2 of TRBP displays a higher binding affinity for siRNA and HIV TAR RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Daviet et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yamashita et al., 2011</xref>). It is intriguing to notice that the two type-A dsRBDs originating from the same protein demonstrate a markedly different binding affinity for target RNAs across various cases, as elucidated above. Recent investigations have suggested that the dissimilar behavior of dsRBDs in Dicer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wostenberg et al., 2012</xref>), PKR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nanduri et al., 2000</xref>), and double-stranded-RNA-binding protein 4 (DRB4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chiliveri et al., 2017</xref>) might be attributed to protein dynamics. Although variations in the binding affinity for the two type-A dsRBDs of TRBP have been documented for several target RNAs, a comprehensive exploration of the differences in the conformational dynamics between these two domains remains to be undertaken.</p><p>In this study, we have investigated the role of differential conformational dynamics of the two type-A dsRBD domains of TRBP2 (isoform 1 of TRBP) in RNA recognition and binding. First discovered as a TRBP (39 kDa) involved in HIV-I replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gatignol et al., 1991</xref>), TRBP was later found to be indispensable to the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2014</xref>). It is involved in Dicer-mediated pre-miRNA/pre-siRNA cleavage and recruitment of Argonaute protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chendrimada et al., 2005</xref>). Being a part of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), TRBP helps in the guide strand selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Noland et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Noland and Doudna, 2013</xref>). The guide strand of the mature miRNA directly interacts with the target mRNA to regulate its expression, while the passenger strand is cleaved off by the RISC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Leuschner et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Matranga et al., 2005</xref>). TRBP and its homologs across different species such as Loquacious (Loqs in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>), R2D2 (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>), DRB1-3,5 (<italic>A. thaliana</italic>), RNAi defective 4 (RDE-4 in <italic>C. elegans</italic>), Xlrbpa (<italic>X. laevis</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eckmann and Jantsch, 1997</xref>), and the PKR activator (PACT) protein (mammals) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Peters et al., 2001</xref>) have conserved arrangement of three consecutive dsRBDs; of which, the two N-terminal domains (type A) are known to bind dsRNAs, whereas the third domain is known for proteinâprotein interactions. We have recently established the role of TRBP2-dsRBD1 dynamics in dsRBDâdsRNA interactions and proposed that dsRBD1 adopts a conformationally dynamic structure to recognize a set of topologically different dsRNA structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Paithankar et al., 2022</xref>). The Âµs timescale motions were found to be present all along the dsRBD1 backbone with higher frequency motions (<italic>k</italic><sub>ex</sub> &gt; 50 kHz) in the RNA-binding sites. The data suggested that the presence of conformational exchange in the Âµs timescale could help the dsRBD1 to dynamically tune itself for targeting conformationally distinct dsRNA substrates.</p><p>In this work, we have compared TRBP2-dsRBD1 with TRBP2-dsRBD2 in terms of the structure, dynamics (intrinsic and RNA-induced), and dsRBDâdsRNA interactions in the two type-A domains. We have measured motions in the TRBP2-dsRBD2 at psâns and Âµsâms timescale dynamics by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) relaxation dispersion experiments in apo-state and studied its perturbation in the presence of an A-form duplex RNA. We also compared the apo- and RNA-bound conformational dynamics measured in dsRBD2 with that of dsRBD1. Based on our observations, we propose that the differential protein dynamics and its perturbation in the presence of RNA in the two dsRBDs enables them to recognize a variety of RNA substrates and may lead to diffusion along the length of the RNA.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Structural and dynamical comparison of apo TRBP2-dsRBD1 and TRBP2-dsRBD2</title><p>Primary sequence comparison of TRBP2-dsRBD1 and TRBP2-dsRBD2 domain constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) revealed 30% identity and 38% similarity. The consensus for dsRNA-binding has been marked in red in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. The two reported RNA-binding regions 1 (E) and 3 (KKxAK) of both the domains were matched to the consensus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). While RNA-binding region 2 (GPxH) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, region 2) of TRBP2-dsRBD2 was an exact match to the consensus, dsRBD1 harbored a mutation in region 2 (P56Q). Proline is a rigid amino acid with one less dihedral angle; it imparts flexibility to the backbone by causing secondary structure breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Imai and Mitaku, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Krieger et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, the presence of conserved Pro186 in the Î²<sub>1</sub>âÎ²<sub>2</sub> loop of dsRBD2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, region 2) may perturb the Î²<sub>1</sub>âÎ²<sub>2</sub> loop region plasticity, thereby making it more accessible to the incoming RNA partner. Additionally, dsRBD2 contains a KR-helix motif in the Î±<sub>2</sub>-helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, region 3) known to increase its binding affinity, as reported earlier by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Daviet et al., 2000</xref>. Owing to these tightly conserved RNA-binding regions and the presence of additional KR-helix motif, dsRBD2 could make stronger contact with RNA.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Sequence and structure comparisons for dsRBD1 and dsRBD2 of TRBP2 along with the structure of the D12 RNA duplex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) dsRBD constructs [TRBP2-dsRBD1 (1â105 aa) and TRBP2-dsRBD2 (154â234 aa)] of Human TRBP2 full-length protein used in this study.

Despite their core length being identical (69 aa), the individual secondary structure spans were found to be different, as listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>. The flexible regions, like loops 1 and 2 depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, E</xref>, are longer in dsRBD2, whereas the structured regions Î²<sub>2</sub>, Î²<sub>3</sub>, and Î±<sub>2</sub> are longer in dsRBD1. Most importantly, loop 2 (Î²<sub>1</sub>âÎ²<sub>2</sub> loop) â critical for RNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Masliah et al., 2013</xref>) â is equal to the canonical length in dsRBD2, while in dsRBD1, it is shorter by 1 residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We have used a 12-bp duplex RNA for the comparative study called the D12 RNA derived from the miR-16-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref> and sequence mentioned in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>).</p><p>Comparing the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation data of the core residue-specific RMSF (root mean square fluctuation) plots of these two type-A dsRBD domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), we observe that the average RMSF of the core domain of dsRBD2 is 0.22 nm, which is almost half as compared to dsRBD1 RMSF average of 0.43. This, in turn, indicates that dsRBD2 is overall more rigid among the two. The most interesting fact is that loop 2 (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) of dsRBD2 is very flexible compared to the rest of the core, with an average RMSF of 0.49 nm (more than double the core average), as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. Hence, we propose that this long, conserved, and dynamic loop 2 might help dsRBD2 to establish strong contacts in the minor grooves of dsRNA partners.

Interestingly, the secondary structural motifs Î±<sub>1</sub>, loop 2, and Î±<sub>2</sub> (refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, D</xref>), containing RNA-binding regions of dsRBD2, showed a higher rigidity than dsRBD1. The presence of conservedf Pro in loop 2 (L2) of dsRBD2 and a longer length of L2 in dsRBD2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>) might be responsible for the additional observed flexibility in dsRBD2, as also observed in the MD simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Loop 1 (W173, L175) of dsRBD2 containing the stabilizing tryptophan (absent in dsRBD1) also showed higher rigidity than dsRBD1, corroborated by the low RMSF values for residues in this region from the MD simulation study. The global rotational correlation time (<italic>Ï</italic><sub>c</sub>) of dsRBD2 was 7.3 ns, and that of dsRBD1 was 7.64 ns, suggesting a more compact structure of dsRBD2 than dsRBD1. This result corroborates the CD-based determination of the melting point of the two constructs. While TRBP2-dsRBD2 exhibited a higher <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> (55Â°C), TRBP2-dsRBD1 melted at 45Â°C (data not shown), thus suggesting a stronger network of interactions in TRBP2-dsRBD2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yamashita et al., 2011</xref>).

Briefly, (1) wt miR-16 (22â23 bp) has a bulge (unpaired uridine) and an internal loop (A:A mismatch), miR-16-1-M has only A:A mismatch, (2) miR-16-1-B has only U-bulge, and (3) miR-16-1-D has neither the bulge nor internal loop forming a perfect duplex (Figure 1 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Paithankar et al., 2022</xref>). It has been established that the TRBP2-dsRBD1 is able to recognize a set of topologically different dsRNA structures owing to its high conformational plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Paithankar et al., 2022</xref>). In the current study, we have characterized the interaction of TRBP2-dsRBD2 with the same set of topologically different dsRNAs (wt miR-16-1 and mutants; sequences mentioned in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>) used for TRBP2-dsRBD1 through <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC-based NMR titrations shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>. The NMR investigation regarding the interaction of TRBP-dsRBD2 with the wt miR-16-1 and the three mutant dsRNAs revealed only chemical shift perturbations (&lt;0.1 ppm) in the presence of four topologically different RNAs as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>. This indicated that the tertiary structure/fold of the protein remained unperturbed upon RNA binding. The fact that the structure remains unperturbed is consistent with the previous findings reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yamashita et al., 2011</xref>, where the authors compared the solution structure of TRBP2-dsRBD2 structure with the crystal structure of GC10RNA-bound TRBP2-dsRBD2 (PDB ID: 3ADL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang et al., 2010</xref>) and concluded that the structure of the dsRBD remains unperturbed upon RNA-binding. However, TRBP2-dsRBD2, in some cases, has shown the presence of chemical shift perturbation &lt;1.0 ppm at the three RNA-binding regions upon binding with RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benoit et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Masliah et al., 2018</xref>), indicating subtle conformational changes at the RNA-binding interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yamashita et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, there were two intriguing observations in the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC-based titrations. First, the amide signals were getting broadened at as low as 0.1 RNA equivalents, suggesting the slow-to-intermediate timescale of binding as has also been observed previously by our and other research groups in TRBP2 dsRBD1, Staufen dsRBD3, hDus2 dsRBD, MLE dsRBD2, DBR4 dsRBD1, PKR dsRBD, and Dicer dsRBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ankush Jagtap et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bou-Nader et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chiliveri et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Paithankar et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ramos et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ucci et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wostenberg et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yadav et al., 2020</xref>). Second, not only the reported RNA-binding residues but the entire backbone was undergoing line broadening, suggesting the presence of RNA-induced motions in the entire backbone. Since the protein is not saturated with the RNAs at 0.1 RNA equivalents (considering a reported <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = 1.7 Î¼M for a 22-bp dsRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acevedo et al., 2015</xref>), [protein] = 50 Î¼M, [RNA] = 5 Î¼M, fraction bound of protein &lt;10%) we can rule out an increase in the size due to the formation of a stable proteinâRNA complex causing line broadening. Upon excess addition of RNA (to 1 equivalent of miR-16-1-M), the backbone amide signals were not recovered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>, top left panel), indicating the RNAâprotein interaction does not seem to come out of the local minima of slow-to-intermediate exchange regime.</p><p>The amide NMR signals were, however, partially recovered by shortening the length of the RNA duplex to 12 bp D12 RNA. The line broadening was delayed till 0.35 equivalents of D12 RNA as compared to 0.1 equivalents for the longer RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2</xref>). The excessive line broadening all along the backbone and recovery of the same by reducing the length of the RNA hints toward the presence of the phenomenon of protein diffusing over the length of the RNA, as has been reported by Koh <italic>et. al</italic>. earlier using smFRET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Koh et al., 2013</xref>). Additionally, the phenomenon of diffusion along the length of RNA has been hinted at in other dsRBPs like Loqs-PD dsRBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tants et al., 2017</xref>), MLE dsRBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ankush Jagtap et al., 2019</xref>), DRB4 dsRBD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chiliveri et al., 2017</xref>), and RDE4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chiliveri and Deshmukh, 2014</xref>). To extract the equilibrium dissociation constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>) for the D12âTRBP2âdsRBD2 interaction, residue-wise peak intensities were plotted against the RNA concentration and tried to fit to the binding isotherm for one-site binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Due to extensive line broadening, there was a lack of data at the inflection point, affecting the data fitting. Hence, the fitted parameters had large errors and remained inconclusive and thus are not reported here.</p><p>The isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC)-based study was performed with D12 duplex RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) to get the equilibrium dissociation constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>) of the two N-terminal dsRBDs, change in enthalpy upon RNA binding (Î<italic>H</italic>), and stoichiometry (<italic>n</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1j</xref>). The differential potential against the time plot indicates that RNA did not get saturated with TRBP2-dsRBD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), while it got saturated with TRBP2-dsRBD2 as early as at the eighth injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The TRBP2-dsRBD1 data could not be fit conclusively to any binding model (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> has large errors in these data) as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>. Our studies showed that TRBP2-dsRBD2 binds to D12 RNA with an average <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of 1.18 Â± 0.32 Î¼M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1"><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1j</xref></xref>), while TRBP2-dsRBD1 did not show any significant heat exchange (weak binding) during the titration. The integrated change in injection enthalpy (Î<italic>H</italic>) versus the molar ratio of the reactants yielded an average Î<italic>H</italic> of â10.12 Â± 0.43 kcal/mol, suggesting an enthalpy-driven binding event. The entropy ÎS of the binding event was negative, indicating the absence of hydrophobic interaction between the D10 RNA and dsRBD2. ITC study was repeated for TRBP2-dsRBD1 with as high as 22 folds excess of protein, but RNA remained unsaturated. These results strongly suggest that TRBP2-dsRBD2 binds more efficiently to a small perfect A-form duplex, D12 RNA, than TRBP2-dsRBD1.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC)-based binding study of D12 duplex RNA with TRBP2-dsRBD1 and TRBP2-dsRBD2.</title><p>Top panel: the raw differential potential for each injection is plotted against the titration time for (<bold>A</bold>) TRBP2-dsRBD1 and (<bold>B</bold>) TRBP2-dsRBD2.

Backbone <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N dynamics measurements on TRBP2-dsRBD2 were carried out in the limiting concentration (RNA:protein = 0.05) of short duplex D12RNA as an increase in the RNA length and an increase in the RNA concentration, both caused line-broadening impacting dynamics measurements.

The apparent increase in the <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> rates (=<italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub>*+ <italic>R</italic><sub>ex</sub>) hinted toward a perturbation in the Î¼sâms timescale dynamics, to which only <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> rates are sensitive. This phenomenon could be attributed to either an increase in intrinsic <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub>* resulting from an increase in the residence time of the RNA on the protein, or an increase in the <italic>R</italic><sub>ex</sub> component caused by a chemical exchange between apo- and D12-bound state, or RNA-induced conformational exchange in the protein. Interestingly, such a perturbation in <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> rates was not found for the dsRBD1 upon RNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Paithankar et al., 2022</xref>). The core N- and C-terminal residues (S151, Q154, Q155, S156, E157, N159, V225, V228, L230, and A232), and a few residues in the vicinity of loop regions (E177, E183, G185, E191, and S209) harbored a lower than average bound-state <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> rates than the rest of the core indicating a faster motion induced in these residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

The overall higher S<sup>2</sup> values for TRBP2-dsRBD2 indicated a rigidification of the backbone amide vectors in the presence of D12 RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3âfigure supplement 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1l</xref>).

In the presence of RNA, there was massive induction of 10 Î¼s to 10 ms timescale conformational dynamics as reflected by the increase in the number of residues having significant <italic>k</italic><sub>ex</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1q</xref>). The extent of enhancement in <italic>k</italic><sub>ex</sub> varied along the backbone of the core protein. For instance, a <italic>k</italic><sub>ex</sub> of 5000â50,000 kHz with 10â20% <italic>p</italic><sub>B</sub> (green spheres) was observed in Î±<sub>1</sub> (G162 and L167), loop3 (R200), and Î±<sub>2</sub> (A213 and A219) and 20â40% <italic>p</italic><sub>B</sub> in Î±<sub>1</sub> (V168), and Î²<sub>3</sub> (E203), depicted by the medium and big green spheres, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B, D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1q</xref>). The residues V198 in loop 3 and M221 in the Î±<sub>2</sub> region exhibited the presence of the highest frequency of motion with a <italic>k</italic><sub>ex</sub> &gt; 50,000 Hz. Intriguingly, among these residues, L167, V168 (Î±<sub>1</sub>), and A213 (Î±<sub>2</sub>) lie in the reported RNA-binding regions 1 and 3, respectively. L167 and V168 are adjacent to the key RNA-binding residue E165 (region 1), which interacts directly with the RNA minor groove. A213 precedes the important KR-helix motif in the Î±<sub>2</sub> region of dsRBD2. The K214 and R215 residues make ionic interactions with the negatively charged phosphate backbone of the RNA major groove. The interaction between the RNA and the RNA-binding residues of the protein might induce conformational exchange within the nearby residues like in the case of G162 (region 1), A219, and M221 (region 2). Additionally, residues like R197 (Î²<sub>2</sub>); V198 and R200 (L3); E203 and G207 (Î²<sub>3</sub>) are further from RNA-binding regions with <italic>k</italic><sub>ex</sub> &gt; 5000 Hz. Thus, the ligand affected not only the RNA-binding residues but the entire protein.</p><p>Notable perturbations in terms of Î<italic>k</italic><sub>ex</sub> (<italic>k</italic><sub>bound</sub> â <italic>k</italic><sub>apo</sub>) &gt; 10,000 Hz were mapped on the structure of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). There was an enhancement of <italic>k</italic><sub>ex</sub> in the residues lying in Î±<sub>1</sub> (G162 and L167), loop 3 (V198), Î²<sub>3</sub> (E203 and G207), and Î±<sub>2</sub> (A213 and A219) region. Concomitantly, suppression of exchange was observed in Î²<sub>1</sub> (V180), loop 3 (R200), and Î±<sub>2</sub> (L212 and R224) regions. A tantalizing relay of exchange was seen between two residue pairs in close spatial proximity. For instance, exchange was induced in V198 and quenched in R200 in the loop 3 region. Similarly, in the case of A213 and L212 falling in the N-terminal RNA-binding region 3, and A219 and R224 lying in the C-terminal of Î±<sub>2</sub>, the former of the pairs underwent an increase in <italic>k</italic><sub>ex</sub> while the latter observed a decrease. Thus, the enhancement of RNA-induced conformational exchange was accommodated by allosteric quenching of the same. Altogether, there was a significant induction of 10 Î¼s to 10 ms timescale motions over the entire backbone of TRBP2-dsRBD2 in the presence of RNA. This induction of motions could be ascribed to either an exchange between the apo- and RNA-bound state of the protein, conformational dynamics in the RNA-bound state of the protein, or the previously reported diffusion motion of the protein on the dsRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Koh et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, in TRBP2-dsRBD2, the extent of dynamics perturbation, in terms of Î<italic>k</italic><sub>ex</sub>, was significantly lower (10â50 kHz) than TRBP2-dsRBD1 where at least 10 residues underwent a Î<italic>k</italic><sub>ex</sub> &gt; 50 kHz in the presence of small dsRNA. Moreover, a relay of exchange was evident only in loop 3 and Î±<sub>2</sub> regions of dsRBD2 and not in Î±<sub>1</sub> region, which was observed earlier in dsRBD1. Summing up, in the presence of RNA, dsRBD2 undergoes enhanced conformational exchange in the 10 Î¼sâ10 ms timescale. When compared to dsRBD1, dsRBD2 samples limited conformational space both in the absence and presence of D12-RNA.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Conformational exchange perturbations in core TRBP2-dsRBD2 in the presence of D12 RNA.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Î<italic>k</italic><sub>ex</sub> (D12-bound â apo) TRBP2-dsRBD2 plotted against residue numbers.

According to our model, these dsRBDs work synergistically to recognize, bind, and assist associated proteins (like Dicer) in processing the incoming dsRNA ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The first dsRBD, TRBP2-dsRBD1, has remarkable flexibility, which allows it to recognize a wide range of structurally and sequentially diverse dsRNAs. On the other hand, TRBP2-dsRBD2 firmly adheres to the RNA ligand due to its conserved RNA-binding stretches and relatively high rigidity. During their interaction with the RNA, both dsRBDs experience enhanced conformational changes on a fast timescale (picoseconds to nanoseconds) and a moderate timescale (microseconds to milliseconds), as observed through nuclear spin relaxation and rotating frame relaxation dispersion measurements. These dynamic changes likely enable the dsRBDs to diffuse along the length of the RNA, which explains the broadening of the signals observed during titration with longer RNAs. This diffusion movement is likely crucial for other associated proteins, such as Dicer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fareh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee and Doudna, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wilson et al., 2015</xref>), to carry out precise microRNA biogenesis.

However, the more significant question that has persisted is whether protein dynamics itself plays a crucial role in these intriguing interactions. Though variability in the binding affinity for the two type-A dsRBDs of TRBP has been reported, the specific contribution of conformational dynamics has remained unexplored until now. In the present investigation, we have exclusively delved into the role of conformational dynamics of the two type-A dsRBDs of TRBP2 in RNA recognition and binding. Our findings have unveiled that TRBP2-dsRBD2 samples a limiting conformational space in solution, and it is dsRBD1 that recognizes sequentially and structurally diverse RNA substrates through its high conformational plasticity. While dsRBD1 explores and engages dsRNA via its dynamically interactive RNA-binding surface, dsRBD2 holds the RNA in position via stronger canonical contacts. Once bound to the RNA, the ensuing conformational exchange in both dsRBD1 and dsRBD2 might facilitate the domains to diffuse over the length of the RNA freely, thus playing a pivotal role in assisting Dicer-mediated differential cleavage of RNA. Thus, this study not only adds valuable insights into the mechanics of RNAâprotein interactions but also underscores the significance of conformational dynamics in dictating the functional outcome in such intricate biological processes.</p><p>Exploring the intricacies of RNAâprotein interactions by delving into dynamics-based measurements across diverse RNA shapes within small RNA duplexes could offer invaluable insights into the differential recognition and binding by dsRBD1 and dsRBD2. The experimental challenge lies in the meticulous design of RNA sequences that maintain duplex stability amid the presence of bulges and internal loops of varying lengths and sequences. The task is further complicated by managing RNA length judiciously, as longer sequences can introduce line broadening in NMR spectroscopy. Navigating these complexities in the future promises to unravel the subtleties of the RNAâprotein interactions at a molecular level.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or <break/>reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene<break/> (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">TARBP2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GenBank</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HGNC:HGNC<break/>:11569</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene ID: 6895<break/>(Uniprot ID: Q15633)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, <break/>strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BL21(DE3)<break/> and DH5a</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Others</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemically <break/>competent cells <break/>obtained <break/>from Dr. Gayathri <break/>Pananghat <break/>(Indian <break/>Institute of Science <break/>Education and <break/>Research Pune, Pune,<break/> India) as kind<break/> gift and further <break/>amplified in our lab.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA <break/>reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pHMGWA (plasmid)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Others</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">TRBP2-dsRBD2 (154â234 aa) was <break/>cloned in pHMGWA vector via Gateway <break/>cloning and was<break/> obtained as a kind <break/>gift from N.

Briefly, the pHMGWA plasmid containing the cDNA for the TRBP2-dsRBD2 was transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 (DE3) cells, and plated on an LB agar plate (containing 100 Î¼g/ml ampicillin) and incubated at 37Â°C for 12 hr. A single isolated colony was inoculated into 20 ml LB broth (containing 100 Î¼g/ml ampicillin) and incubated for 12 hr at 37Â°C, 225 rpm to initiate a starter culture that was eventually used to inoculate 2 l LB broth (containing 100 Î¼g/ml ampicillin) and incubated at 37Â°C, 225 rpm till the OD<sub>600</sub> reached to 0.8â1.0. For induction, IPTG (isopropyl Î²-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside) was added at the final concentration of 1 mM, and the culture was further incubated at 37Â°C, 225 rpm for another 8 hr. The cells were harvested by centrifuging the culture at 4500 Ã <italic>g</italic>, 4Â°C for 20 min and resuspended in 25 ml of buffer A (20 mM TrisâCl, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mM DTT :dithiothreitol, 10 mM imidazole). To the resuspended cells, lysozyme (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to a final concentration of 50 Î¼g/ml and incubated in ice for 30 min. Post-incubation, 1% Triton X-100, 100 Î¼l of 1 mM PMSF (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and 10Ã Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (PIC, Roche) (2 ml per 4 g of cell pellet) were added to the cell suspension. The partially lysed cells were sonicated using an ultrasonic sonicator microprobe at 60% amplitude, with 5 s ON and 10 s OFF pulse, for a period of 60 min in an ice bath for complete lysis. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 Ã <italic>g</italic> for 2 hr, at 4Â°C, to obtain the total soluble protein (TSP). The TSP was then circulated through a pre-equilibrated (buffer A) Ni-NTA column (HisTrap, 5 ml, GE HealthCare) for 4 hr at 4Â°C. After equilibrating with the TSP, the column was washed with 40 column volumes (CVs) of buffer A containing 30 mM imidazole to remove the impurities. The fusion protein was eluted with the elution buffer B (buffer A containing 300 mM imidazole). Nucleic acids were removed from the eluted protein using polyethyleneimine precipitation. To remove imidazole, the protein solution was dialyzed against cleavage buffer C (20 mM TrisâCl, pH 7.5, 25 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mM DTT). His<sub>6</sub>-MBP-tag was cleaved using TEV protease at a final concentration of 1:100 (protease: protein) at 4Â°C for 18 hr with intermittent mixing. The completion of the cleavage reaction was tested and confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfateâpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. The cleavage mix was then passed through a sulphopropyl sepharose column (HiPrep SP FF 16/10 20 ml, GE HealthCare) and washed with buffer C. TRBP2-dsRBD2 protein was eluted from the cation-exchange column using a salt gradient ranging from 25 mM to 1 M NaCl in the buffer C. To further purify, the protein was subjected to size-exclusion chromatography using sephacryl S-100 HR 16/60 column (GE HealthCare).

CS-Rosetta structure was used since the previously reported structure (PDB ID: 2CPN) did not have the extended C-terminal sequence used in this study (2CPN has an amino acid length of 150â225, while the construct used in this study is from 154 to 234). Moreover, the buffer conditions of previously reported structures differed from what is used in this study. The lowest energy structures in the ensemble were used as the seed structure for apo TRBP2-dsRBD2 MD simulation. Briefly, GROMACS V.2019.6 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gromacs.org">https://www.gromacs.org</ext-link>) was used for all the atomistic MD simulations. All-atom additive CHARMM36 protein force field was used to build the topologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 2017</xref>), and initial structure solvation was done TIP3P water molecules in a cubic simulation box with a minimum distance of 1.2 nm from protein in all directions. Microsecond timescale simulations (1 Î¼s) were set up in triplicates in a similar way as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Paithankar et al., 2022</xref>). All analysis was performed using GROMACS and VMD.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s4"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Writing â original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing â original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Writing â original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Tables providing analyzed data numbers of all the experiments.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Amino acid length of different secondary structures in TRBP2-dsRBD1 and TRBP2-dsRBD2 CS-ROSSETA structures.

Using solution NMR spectroscopy, the authors characterize the backbone motions of dsRBD2 in the absence and presence of dsRNA and compare these with their previously published results on dsRBD1.

Even though dsRBDs preferably bind to the double-stranded region, they can still accommodate perturbation in the A-form helix due to mismatch and bulges with decreased binding affinity ([Acevedo et al., 2015]). However, it is a matter of future research to identify how much of a deviation from the A-form structure can be accommodated by the dsRBDs.

To conclusively prove the central claim of this manuscript, the authors could have considered a larger construct that carries both RBDs. With such a construct, authors can probe the characteristics of these two tandem domains (e.g., semi-independent tumbling) and their interactions with the RNA. Additionally, mutational experiments may be carried out where specific residues are altered to change the conformational dynamics of these two domains. The corresponding changes in interactions with RNA will provide additional evidence for the model presented in Figure 8 of the manuscript. Finally, there are inconsistencies in the reported data between different figures and tables.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comprehensive and insightful review. A larger construct carrying both RBDs was not used because of the multiple challenges pertaining to dynamics study by NMR spectroscopy (intrinsic R2 rates of the dsRBD1-dsRBD2 construct would be high, resulting in broadened peaks) as per our previous experience ([Paithankar et al., 2022]). There would be additional dynamics in that construct coming from domain-domain relative motions, and it is difficult to deconvolute the dynamics information. Further, the dsRNA needed to bind to this construct will be longer, causing further line broadening in NMR.</p><p>Coming to mutational studies, careful designing of domain mutants remains as a challenge because the conformational dynamics in both the domains are distributed all through the backbone rather than only in the RNA-binding residues. The mutational studies would need an exhaustive number of mutations in protein as well as RNA to draw a parallel between the binding and dynamics. Having said that, we are working on making such mutations in the protein (at several locations to freeze the dynamics site-specifically) and the RNA (to change the shape of the dsRNA) to systematically study this mechanism, which will be out of scope of this manuscript.</p><p>The reviewer has rightly pointed out some subtle superficial differences in the reported data between different figures and tables. These superficial differences are present because of the context in which we are describing the data. For example, in Figure S4, we are talking about the average relaxation rates and nOe values for only the common residues we were able to analyze between two magnetic field strengths 600 and 800 MHz. Whereas in Figure 6, we are comparing the averages of the core (159-227) dsRBD residues at 600 MHz, in the presence and absence of D12RNA. The differences, however, are minute falls well within the error range.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Suggestions for improved or additional experiments -</p><p>In regards to ITC data, dsRBD1 does not bind canonical A-form RNA with high affinity.

The study by Acevedo et al. has shown the effect of lengths of Watson-Crick duplex RNAs upon TRBP2 dsRBD binding. In this study, they have compared the ds22 RNA to miRNA/miRNA* duplex. By using EMSA, they show that the Kd,app (Î¼M) for dsRBD1 is 3.5Â±0.2 and for dsRBD2 is 1.7Â±0.1, indicating a higher affinity by the latter ([Acevedo et al., 2015]).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What was the amount of time used for the 1H saturation in the heteronuclear NOE experiment?

The amount of residues showing dynamics in the apo state is small and the number only moderately increases upon RNA binding. The observation that some residues show an increase and a neighboring residue shows a decrease (or vice versa) upon RNA binding could just be random with the small number of observations. This observation would be more convincing if it were happening to larger regions within the protein.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the number of residues showing dynamics in the apo-state of the dsRBD2 is small when compared with that of dsRBD1, and the number only moderately increases upon RNA-binding. However, we believe it is quite important to invoke the allosteric quenching as all the new residues where dynamics is induced, do lie in the spatial proximity, as also observed in the dsRBD1 ([Paithankar et al., 2022]). It is a parameter to not only compare the differences and similarities in the two domains but also to highlight the presence of this phenomenon common in both the type-A dsRBDs of TRBP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor corrections -</p><p>Introduction, page 2 - The order parameter should be defined for non-NMR experts.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion.

Additionally, the S2 order parameter for R189 was found to be 0.52 +/- 0.03, slightly lower than the core average of 0.59 +/- 0.03, indicating a more flexible region than the core (updated Table S14). Moreover, the dynamics parameters extracted from HARD experimental data using the geoHARD method for apo TRBP2-dsRBD2 shown in Table S18 depict a high kex value of 31748.72 +/- 955.20 Hz for R189.

In particular, loop 2, critical for dsRNA-binding ([Masliah et al., 2012]), is 1 residue longer in dsRBD2 and has a possible effect in enhanced substrate binding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure S8 shows severe signal attenuation for many residues upon the addition of 100 uM RNA. The most notable among these are residues M194, T195, and C196. Can the authors explain how they measure 15N-relaxation rates for these residues in the presence of 50 uM D12?</p></disp-quote><p>First, we have recorded the measured 15N-relaxation rates for these residues in the presence of 50 mM D12 (RNA:Protein = 50 mM:1000 mM), corresponding to 0.05 equivalent RNA. The amount of RNA used is less than that used for the HSQC-based titration shown in Figure S8, 0.1 equivalent RNA (RNA:Protein = 5 mM:50 mM), where we witness line broadening for residues like M194, T195, and C196. Second, we increased the overall protein concentration from 50 mM (used in HSQC-based titration) to 1000 mM (used in relaxation measurements) to ensure a better signal-to-noise ratio in all the spectra.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Use the same coloring scheme for Figures S7 and S8.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We have now edited Figure S8 accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figures are often listed out-of-order, making it difficult to follow the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We have now amended the main text to refer to the figures sequentially. While doing so, we have renumbered Figure 6 as Figure 3, Figure 3 as Figure 4, Figure 4 as Figure 5, and Figure 5 as Figure 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure captions for the relaxation data should specify the temperature at which these datasets were collected.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the valuable suggestion. We have now added the temperature wherever applicable.</p><p>References</p><p>Acevedo R, Evans D, Penrod KA, Showalter SA. 2016. Binding by TRBP-dsRBD2 Does Not Induce Bending of Double-Stranded RNA.
