In this report, we demonstrate a critical role for lung mesenchymal stromal cell (L-MSC) aging in determining the capacity to form three-dimensional organoids or âalveolospheresâ with type 2 alveolar epithelial cells (AEC2s). In contrast to L-MSCs from aged mice, young L-MSCs support the efficient formation of alveolospheres when co-cultured with young or aged AEC2s. Aged L-MSCs demonstrated features of cellular senescence, altered bioenergetics, and a senescence-associated secretory profile (SASP). The reactive oxygen species generating enzyme, NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4), was highly activated in aged L-MSCs and Nox4 downregulation was sufficient to, at least partially, reverse this age-related energy deficit, while restoring the self-organizing capacity of alveolospheres. Together, these data indicate a critical role for cellular bioenergetics and redox homeostasis in an organoid model of self-organization and support the concept of thermodynamic entropy in aging biology.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many tissues in the body are capable of regenerating by replacing defective or worn-out cells with new ones. This process relies heavily on stem cells, which are precursor cells that lack a set role in the body and can develop into different types of cells under the right conditions. Tissues often have their own pool of stem cells that they use to replenish damaged cells. But as we age, this regeneration process becomes less effective.</p><p>Many of our organs, such as the lungs, are lined with epithelial cells. These cells form a protective barrier, controlling what substances get in and out of the tissue. Alveoli are parts of the lungs that allow oxygen and carbon dioxide to move between the blood and the air in the lungs. And alveoli rely on an effective epithelial cell lining to work properly.</p><p>To replenish these epithelial cells, alveoli have pockets, in which a type of epithelial cell, known as AEC2, lives. These cells can serve as stem cells, developing into a different type of cell under the right conditions. To work properly, AEC2 cells require close interactions with another type of cell called L-MSC, which supports the maintenance of other cells and also has the ability to differentiate into several other cell types. Both cell types can be found close together in these stem cell pockets. So far, it has been unclear how aging affects how these cells work together to replenish the epithelial lining of the alveoli.</p><p>To investigate, Chanda et al. probed AEC2s and L-MSCs in the alveoli of young and old mice. The researchers collected both cell types from young (2-3 months) and aged (22-24 months) mice. Various combinations of these cells were grown to form 3D structures, mimicking how the cells grow in the lungs.</p><p>Young L-MSCs formed normal 3D structures with both young and aged AEC2 cells. But aged L-MSCs developed abnormal, loose structures with AEC2 cells (both young and old cells). Aged L-MSCs were found to have higher levels of an enzyme (called Nox4) that produces oxidants and other âpro-agingâ factors, compared to young L-MSCs. However, reducing Nox4 levels in aged L-MSCs allowed these cells to form normal 3D structures with young AEC2 cells, but not aged AEC2 cells.</p><p>These findings highlight the varying effects specific stem cells have, and how their behaviour is affected by pro-aging factors. Moreover, the pro-aging enzyme Nox4 shows potential as a therapeutic target â downregulating its activity may reverse critical effects of aging in cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Aging</kwd><kwd>senescence</kwd><kwd>mesenchymal stromal cells</kwd><kwd>epithelial stem cells</kwd><kwd>oxidative stress</kwd><kwd>regeneration</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HL152246</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thannickal</surname><given-names>Victor J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01 HL114470</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thannickal</surname><given-names>Victor J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Veteran Affairs Administration</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I01BX003056</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thannickal</surname><given-names>Victor J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AG046210</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thannickal</surname><given-names>Victor J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HL139617</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zmijewski</surname><given-names>Jaroslaw W</given-names></name><name><surname>Thannickal</surname><given-names>Victor J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 CA013148</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mobley</surname><given-names>James A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HL128502</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Deshane</surname><given-names>Jessy S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P42 ES027723</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Deshane</surname><given-names>Jessy S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Lung stem cell niche aging is associated with altered bioenergetics, metabolic dysfunction, and senescence of mesenchymal stromal cells that restricts 3D organoid, or alveolosphere formation, potentially accounting for reduced regenerative capacity with aging.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Substantial progress has been made in our understanding of the biology of aging, and these advances have the potential to improve both healthspan and lifespan, while alleviating the burden of age-related diseases. Self-organization in biological systems is a process by which cells reduce their internal entropy and maintain order within these dynamic, self-renewing systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chatterjee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kiss et al., 2009</xref>). Exhaustion of stem/progenitor cells, cellular senescence, and altered intercellular communication have been proposed as aging hallmarks that increase susceptibility to age-related disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Schultz and Sinclair, 2016</xref>). However, the interactions between these hallmarks and whether cellular bioenergetics associated with cellular senescence may account for age-associated stem cell dysfunction and altered cell-cell communication have not been well defined. In this study, we utilized an organoid model to study stem cell behavior and intercellular communication that may account for age-related phenotypes; through these studies, we identify cellular bioenergetics and redox imbalance as critical drivers of these inter-dependent aging hallmarks.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>The mammalian lung serves an essential role in organismal metabolism, uniquely by serving as the primary organ for systemic exchange of oxygen for carbon dioxide. Regeneration and maintenance of structure-function of the lung are dependent on adult, tissue-resident stem cells that reside in unique niches along the airways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basil et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hogan et al., 2014</xref>). Type 2 alveolar epithelial cells (AEC2s) serve as facultative stem/progenitor cells in adult mammalian lungs and differentiate into type 1 alveolar epithelial cells (AEC1s) in response to diverse injuries to reconstitute and reestablish the alveolar gas exchange surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barkauskas et al., 2013</xref>). AEC2 regenerative capacity declines with age, resulting in impaired lung injury repair responses, thus increasing susceptibility to various lung diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Schulte et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Watson et al., 2020</xref>). To further explore the relationship between AECs and lung mesenchymal stromal cells (L-MSCs), we developed an alveolosphere assay system that has been traditionally used to assess AEC2 stemness or regenerative potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barkauskas et al., 2013</xref>). In this assay system, L-MSCs and AEC2s are mixed together in a ratio of 100,000â5000,, respectively, and seeded in Matrigel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>); alveolospheres with a single layer of epithelial cells composed of both AEC2s (surfactant protein C [SFTPC]-positive) and AEC1s (lung type I integral membrane glycoprotein [T1Î±]-positive) surrounding a hollow sphere typically form 9â12 days following co-culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). L-MSCs expressing platelet-derived growth factor receptor-Î± (PDFGRÎ±), with a fewer number expressing Î±-smooth muscle actin (Î±-SMA), were found primarily in cells lining the outer edges of alveolospheres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). AEC2s within alveolospheres stained for both the cell proliferation marker, Ki-67, and the double-strand DNA damage repair marker, histone H2A.X, suggesting ongoing AEC2 turnover within these 3D organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>). This self-organizing behavior of L-MSCs and AEC2s is critically dependent on the presence of both cell types as AEC2s in the absence of AEC2s do not self-organize to form alveolospheres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Together, these data support the crosstalk between L-MSCs and AEC2s that permit formation of distinct alveolar organoid-like structures; this intercellular communication may be perturbed during aging accounting for age-associated loss of AEC2 regeneration/maintenance.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Aging lung-mesenchymal stromal cells (L-MSCs) impair self-organization of alveolar epithelial stem cells (AEC2s) and alveolosphere formation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Alveolosphere assay.

Quantitative analyses revealed that, while the number of alveolospheres formed was not significantly different between groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>), the size of alveolospheres was critically dependent on the age of L-MSCs, and not that of AEC2s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). These findings indicate that secreted factor(s) from young L-MSCs are capable of supporting the self-organizing behavior of alveolospheres, while aged L-MSCs do not.</p><p>Cellular senescence accumulates in tissues with advancing age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Krishnamurthy et al., 2004</xref>) and has been proposed as a key driver of aging and aging-related disease phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baker et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kennedy et al., 2014</xref>). Based on our observation that aged L-MSCs were incapable of supporting alveolosphere formation, we explored whether the emergence of cellular senescence may account for this finding. First, we confirmed the senescent features of L-MSCs from aged mice in monolayer 2D cell culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>) and in 3D alveolospheres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) by staining for Î²-galactosidase (Î²-gal) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dimri et al., 1995</xref>) and lipofuscin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Georgakopoulou et al., 2013</xref>), respectively. To characterize secreted factors that may account for the age-associated dysregulation of cell-cell communication, we first measured cytokines/growth factors secreted from both young and aged L-MSCs using antibody arrays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). A number of cytokines that have been associated with the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) were found to be released at higher levels by aged L-MSCs, including IL-6, CCL12/MCP-5, CCL11/Eotaxin, and WISP-1/CCN4; in contrast, IGFBP1 was the only secreted protein that was statistically more elevated in young L-MSCs in this cytokine array (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Aged lung mesenchymal stromal cells (L-MSCs) show redox imbalance and acquire senescence-associated secretory phenotype.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Î²-Galactosidase activity assay.

To compare the energy state between young and aged lung L-MSCs, rates of mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis were analyzed by Seahorse XF Analyzer.

We were also unable to detect significant changes in alveolosphere formation when the Nox4 inhibitor, GKT137831 (10 ÂµM), was added to an organoid culture system of young AEC2s and aged L-MSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1K-M</xref>); however, it is difficult to ascertain whether this intervention effectively inhibited Nox4 activity in this organoid model. While the phenotype of impaired alveolosphere formation in young AECs and aged L-MSCs was reversed by haploinsufficiency of Nox4 in L-MSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4IâK</xref>), this was not sufficient to completely reverse the phenotype in aged AEC2s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1N-P</xref>). This finding, along with the observation that wild-type young L-MSCs are sufficient to reverse the aged AEC2 phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), suggests that in addition to reduced expression of Nox4 in aged L-MSCs, the young mesenchyme may support niche function and recovery of alveolosphere formation of aged AEC2s through Nox4-independent mechanisms. Thus, an aging alveolar stem cell niche may involve both a gain of âpro-senescent factorsâ (Nox4) and loss of ârejuvenation factorsâ by the mesenchyme; the identification of the latter will require further study. Together, our studies support a critical role for Nox4-dependent oxidative stress, senescence, and bioenergetic insufficiency in restricting the capacity for cellular self-organization in a 3D organoid model of aging and stem/progenitor cell function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L</xref>).</p><p>A fundamental difference between non-living matter and life forms on our planet is the ability to extract energy from the environment, primarily through oxidation of carbon-based fuels. Thus, the second law of thermodynamics that governs both living and non-living matter does not strictly apply to living organisms capable of self-renewal through the continuous and dynamic exchange of energy (from exogenous nutrients) and mass (biosynthetic and degradative processes in respiring tissues/organs). It follows then that, when this capacity for energy-dependent self-renewal is diminished, the law of entropic degeneration will be operative in living organisms. Aging is associated with derangements in metabolism that influences, and may in fact control, many of the well-recognized hallmarks of aging, including cellular senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">LÃ³pez-OtÃ­n et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">LÃ³pez-OtÃ­n et al., 2013</xref>). The inter-relatedness of metabolism with these traditional aging hallmarks is difficult to untangle due to complexities of studies in living organisms and the relative simplicity of 2D cell culture models.</p><p>Organoids offer the opportunity to study complex living phenomena such as emergent properties and self-organization in biological systems while at the same time allowing for reductionist approaches that provide mechanistic understanding of these complex processes. Using a combination of methods that included a 3D organoid model, biochemical approaches, proteomics, and gene targeting, we demonstrate a critical role for the oxygen metabolizing enzyme, Nox4, in regulating cellular bioenergetics and senescence that limits stem cell function. Consistent with contemporary theories on aging, Nox4 may function as an antagonistically pleiotropic gene and contribute a number of age-related degenerative disorders, including fibrotic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Thannickal, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lambeth, 2007</xref>). Interestingly, proteomic analyses of proteins secreted by aged L-MSCs in the current study suggested alterations in cellular redox/oxidative stress (from gene ontology analysis) and lung fibrosis (as a âtoxic pathologyâ). These findings, as well as candidate SASP factors, highlight the emerging importance of intercellular communication and stem cell exhaustion as important hallmarks of aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">LÃ³pez-OtÃ­n et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Regenerative mechanisms in adult, mammalian organisms primarily rely on the activation and differentiation of tissue/organ-resident stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hogan et al., 2014</xref>). Homeostatic maintenance of these stem cells requires a tightly regulated niche that includes other supporting cell types, in particular stromal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basil et al., 2020</xref>). An important finding from our studies is the observation that L-MSC aging, relative to AEC aging, largely accounts for the age-related inability to form alveolospheres. Thus, aging of the stem cell niche may be as important, and perhaps more decisive, in promoting certain age-related pathologies. Therapeutic targeting of metabolic aging within the stem cell niche, specifically that of lung-resident fibroblasts/myofibroblasts, may offer a more effective and viable strategy for age-related degenerative disorders such as tissue/organ fibrosis.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Key resources</title><p>All reagents, antibodies, assay kits, and mice used in this study are listed in Appendix 1âkey resources table.</p><p>All animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.

broad audience of lung biology, aging biology, fibrosis and pulmonary medicine. It identified a critical mechanism under which aging of mesenchymal stromal cells deleteriously affect lung alveolar progenitor cell behavior.

They build on their previous discovery that oxidative stress is a key regulator of pulmonary fibrosis and that Nox4 is a critical regulator. These studies further support the concept of targeting oxidative stress through Nox4 as a viable therapeutic target in organ fibrosis.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Mesenchymal Stromal Cell Aging Impairs the Self-Organizing Capacity of Lung Alveolar Epithelial Stem Cells&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The team, which is well-suited to an analysis of senescence, found that aged lung MSCs exhibit altered bioenergetics compared to young L-MSCs. Altered energetics were associated with changes in the secretome of these cells reflecting many of the classical SASP. The aged MSCs express H2O2 which is associated with activation of Nox4. The team found that the phenotype on alveolospheres could be rescued with Nox4+/- aged MSCs. In general the manuscript is well-written and shares a very important message about the role of the mesenchymal compartment in regulating lung epithelial cell growth and differentiation.</p><p>The implications here are that an aging mesenchymal compartment in the lungs of older patients are unable to support epithelial cell repair. In the context of pulmonary fibrosis, these data also suggest that fibroblasts are not simply &quot;matrix factories.&quot; They are critical to the maintenance of the gas exchange surface. The authors do not overstate their conclusions, which is scientifically appropriate but these data here do lead to some very exciting speculation about lung injury and repair.</p><p>The authors do show several bioenergetic and secretome changes associated with aging MSCs. These findings do not clearly establish what the critical factors are that support the formation of alveolospheres. This is a limitation of the manuscript. finding that factor or factors may represent finding a needle in a haystack. But the association of Nox4 haploinsufficiency with rescue of the phenotype does point the team in the right direction.</p><p>1. I wonder about some of the critical mesenchyme-derived factors that support lung development like FGF7/10 or Wnts, for example? Does the team have data on these factors?

In new studies, we compared SASP-associated cytokines produced by aged wild-type and aged Nox4<sup>-/+</sup> L-MSCs. Our results indicate that a number of secreted SASP cytokines are modulated by Nox4, and these data are now included in Figure 4âfigure supplement 4I. We were unable to identify a group of cytokines (except for Coagulation Factor III) that were specifically identified in the dataset comparing young vs. aged L-MSCs based on the antibody-based cytokine array method. Further studies with an unbiased approach such as that employed by mass spectrometric analyses (Figure 2I) will be required for more in-depth analyses of Nox4 regulated SASP cytokines/growth factors. Additionally, we investigated the effect of Nox4 haploinsufficiency on cellular bioenergetics and senescence of L-MSCs. We observed significant reduction in real-time OCR, including basal, ATP-linked, proton leak, and maximal in aged Nox4-/+ L-MSCs as compared to aged L-MSCs (Figure 4G, H). Î²-gal activity, a marker of senescence, was also reduced in Nox4 deficient L-MSCs (Figure 4âfigure supplement 4H).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Although it is difficult to mimic the levels of continuous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production by aged L-MSCs in the alveolosphere model, we evaluated the effects of adding a single dose of H2O2 at a concentration of 1 Î¼M to the organoid culture of young WT L-MSCs/young AEC2s. This resulted in a reduction in alveolosphere size, without affecting alveolar numbers (Figure 4âfigure supplement 4, A-C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Interestingly, we were unable to detect significant differences in both alveolosphere size and number with GKT137831 treatment (Figure 4âfigure supplement 4, K-M). It is important to recognize that we have not confirmed that this intervention effectively inhibited Nox4 activity (as this is more difficult to assess in the 3D organoid model). We believe the genetic approach we employed (Figure 4) provides more rigorous evidence that Nox4 effects are critical in niche support of AEC2 function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

We did perform the suggested studies and found that aged L-MSCs Nox4<sup>-/+</sup> were incapable of completely rescuing impaired alveolosphere formation when combined with aged AEC2s (Figure 4âfigure supplement 4, N-P). The implications of this new data are discussed in the Results and Discussion section. While the phenotype of impaired alveolosphere formation in young AECs/aged MSCs was reversed by haploinsufficiency of Nox4 in the mesenchyme (Figure 4, I-K), this was not sufficient to reverse the phenotype in aged AECs. This finding, along with the observation that WT young L-MSCs are sufficient to reverse the aged AEC phenotype (Figure 1H) suggests that, in addition to reduced expression of Nox4 in aged L-MSCs, the young mesenchyme may support niche function and recovery of alveolosphere formation in aged AEC2s by a Nox4-independent mechanism. Thus, an aging alveolar stem cell niche may involve both a gain of âpro-aging factorsâ (Nox4) and loss of ârejuvenation factorsâ by the mesenchyme; the identification of the latter will require further study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

Our studies indicate that niche aging may involve both a GAIN of pro-senescent/aging factors and a LOSS of pro-regenerative factors. The relative contributions to these are unknown; however, we do show that suppressing pro-senescent factors (Nox4) was sufficient to recover alveolosphere formation in aged L-MSCs/young AEC2s (but not in aged L-MSCs/aged AEC2s). This may be related to the additional requirement for pro-regenerative (ârejuvenationâ) factors in aged AEC2s. Based on the suggestion by the reviewer, we did perform studies with FGF-10 to determine whether alveolosphere formation can be rescued in aged L-MSCs/aged AEC2s. Although some experiments showed significant improvement in organoid formation, we did not get consistent data to be certain that replacing this factor (FGF-10) is sufficient. As discussed above, it is possible that modulation of both LOSS and GAIN components are required for optimal alveolosphere formation.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Alveolosphere assay.
