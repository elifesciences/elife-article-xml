Cerebral trypanosomiasis is a severe form, but the mechanism underlying this severity remains unknown. We developed a mouse model of acute cerebral trypanosomiasis and characterized the cellular, behavioral, and physiological consequences of this infection. We show large parasite sequestration in the brain vasculature for long periods of time (up to 8 hr) and extensive neuropathology that associate with ICAM1-mediated recruitment and accumulation of T cells in the brain parenchyma. Antibody-mediated ICAM1 blocking and lymphocyte absence reduce parasite sequestration in the brain and prevent the onset of cerebral trypanosomiasis. Here, we establish a mouse model of acute cerebral trypanosomiasis and we propose a mechanism whereby parasite sequestration, host ICAM1, and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells play a pivotal

increasingly recognized as a key determinant of Human wellbeing and socio-economic development. This concept of ‘One Health’ gains additional relevance when tackling infectious diseases endemic to developing countries. Animal African trypanosomiasis, or nagana, a devastating neglected disease endemic to Africa, South America, and Asia, is a great example of this. Nagana costs US$ 1.0–1.2 billion per year in African livestock production losses, but the annual impact on the agricultural Gross Domestic Product is estimated at US$ 4.75 billion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Food and Agriculture Organization, 2019</xref>). <italic>Trypanosoma congolense</italic> is one of the most prevalent and pathogenic African trypanosome species in Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bengaly et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gashururu S et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Habeeb et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Katabazi et al., 2021</xref>). Whilst <italic>T. congolense</italic> infections in African cattle mostly cause a chronic, wasting disease, in exotic breeds and in other mammals, including dogs, goats, and horses, the parasite can cause a rapidly fatal, acute disease, characterized by inflammatory syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation syndrome, and neurological impairment (also called cerebral trypanosomiasis) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Calvet et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Griffin and Allonby, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harrus et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Savage et al., 2021</xref>). Currently, the field lacks an animal model that allows the study of acute <italic>T. congolense</italic>-induced trypanosomiasis, and of cerebral disease as its most severe form. Understanding the determinants of acute trypanosomiasis may help reduce the burden of disease in the long-term.</p><p>One of the key aspects that distinguishes <italic>T. congolense</italic> from human-infective <italic>T. brucei</italic> is its ability to cytoadhere to the vascular endothelium rather than to egress the bloodstream and invade tissues (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Silva Pereira et al., 2019</xref>). <italic>T. congolense</italic> cytoadhesion causes parasite sequestration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Losos et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Losos and Gwamaka, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ojok et al., 2002</xref>), which, for other pathogens, such as <italic>Babesia spp</italic>. and <italic>Plasmodium spp</italic>., is a key determinant of virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gallego-Lopez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ghazanfari et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rogerson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Van den Steen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vargas et al., 2014</xref>). Currently, very little is known about the impact of <italic>T. congolense</italic> sequestration in disease. Yet, parasite presence in the vasculature, and sequestration in particular, usually results in an inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Storm and Craig, 2014</xref>). We know that <italic>T. congolense</italic> adhesion to host cell membranes triggers antibody-complement cascades and increases vascular permeability, suggestive of endothelium damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banks, 1980</xref>). The parasite itself has also been reported to release soluble molecules, like trans-sialidases, that activate the endothelium in vitro, and enhance inflammation in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ammar et al., 2013</xref>). In turn, excessive inflammation is a common driver of pathology in many infectious diseases. It is therefore plausible that the physical damage caused by parasite sequestration in the brain and the resulting host’s immune response affect disease progression.</p><p>Here, we report the first mouse model of acute cerebral trypanosomiasis in animals and investigate its mechanism. We characterized parasite sequestration in the mouse vasculature, the consequences of parasite-endothelial cell interaction, and the drivers of cerebral trypanosomiasis. Our data showed that <italic>T. congolense</italic>-induced cerebral trypanosomiasis is caused by a combination of increased parasite sequestration in the brain and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell activation, via upregulation of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) expression in endothelial cells. These findings highlight the importance of parasite sequestration and provide the first insights into the cellular mechanism for the development of <italic>T. congolense</italic> cerebral trypanosomiasis in animals.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A virulent strain of <italic>T. congolense</italic> causes cerebral trypanosomiasis</title><p>We found that infection of C57BL/6 J mice with two independent <italic>T. congolense</italic> strains (1/148 and IL3000) resulted in dramatically different mouse survival.

To investigate whether kidney failure could contribute to early death in 1/148-infected mice, we assessed creatinine, urea, and Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) in the serum of mice infected with either strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). We observed increased levels of urea in both strains, suggestive of mild dehydration, but normal levels of creatinine, suggestive of normal kidney function. Furthermore, we detected increased levels of NGAL in 1/148-infected mice only. NGAL is a biomarker for the early detection of kidney injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Soni et al., 2010</xref>). Together, kidney biochemistry analyses show that, at the first peak of parasitemia, 1/148-infected mice show early signs of kidney damage, whereas IL3000 do not. Regardless, kidney function has not yet been compromised, so kidney failure is not the most likely cause of death. In contrast, the severity of lesions observed in the CNS of 1/148-infected mice and the large accumulation of parasites in the brain microvasculature strongly support that C57BL/6 J mice infected by <italic>T. congolense</italic> 1/148 die of cerebral trypanosomiasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title><italic>Trypanosoma congolense</italic> 1/148 preferentially sequesters in the brain vasculature</title><p>Given the severity of lesions in the host and the large accumulation of parasites in the brains of animals infected with the <italic>T. congolense</italic> strain 1/148, we hypothesized that cerebral trypanosomiasis was caused by parasite sequestration in the brain vasculature.</p><p>Therefore, we started by confirming that <italic>T. congolense</italic> parasites cytoadhered to the endothelium by intravital microscopy. Since we did not have access to fluorescent 1/148 parasites, we used FITC-Dextran to visualize the intravascular environment, Hoechst dye to mark the nuclei of circulating cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), and α-A637-CD31 to stain the vascular endothelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Hoechst dye stains the nuclei of both host cells and parasites. Within the confines of the endothelium, this includes mostly immune cells. Intravascular parasites and host cells are clearly distinguishable by their size and shape (cellular and nuclear), as well as by the presence of a kinetoplast in the parasites (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). So, this combination of markers allowed us to quantify parasites and leukocytes in vessels. A 3D reconstruction is shown in <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>. Then, based on parasite mobility during live imaging, we compared total parasite load and the percentage of sequestered parasites in major organs in the first 6 days of 1/148 infection and at three points in IL3000 infection (first parasitemia peak, second peak, and post-second peak).

We compared expression of ICAM1, ICAM2, and VCAM1 proteins in the vasculature of the brain at the first peak of parasitemia in both strains, by ex-vivo microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). ICAM1 was highly expressed in immune cells (yellow arrowheads, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), but also detectable in vessel walls (cyan arrowheads, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Consistent with the endothelium ribosome profiling data (which revealed ICAM1 to be upregulated upon 1/148 infection (FC = 1.62), but not of ICAM2 or VCAM1), we observed increased expression of ICAM1 in the endothelium of the brain (unpaired t-test with Welch’s correction, p-value = 0.0312), but not of ICAM2, nor VCAM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). In IL3000 infections, we also observed an increase in ICAM1 expression by endothelial cells (p-value = 0.003). To determine whether the increase in endothelial ICAM1 was brain-specific, we checked ICAM1, ICAM2, and VCAM1 expression in remaining organs. During 1/148 infections, we observed ICAM1 also increased in the lungs, heart, and liver (unpaired t-test with Welch’s correction, p-value &lt; 0.01), whereas ICAM2 expression increased in the heart and kidneys (unpaired t-test with Welch’s correction, p-value &lt; 0.0001), and VCAM1 in the liver, spleen, and kidneys (unpaired t-test with Welch’s correction, p-value &lt; 0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> A, left).

To distinguish and quantify the number of intra- and extravascular leukocytes, we administered α-CD45-APC antibody intravenously, 3 min prior to mouse euthanasia.

We did not stain for neutrophils because preliminary experiments revealed that neutrophil numbers do not change significantly upon infection (Figure S3B). The number of intravascular CD11b<sup>+</sup>Ly6C<sup>-</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup> dendritic cells (DC) and CD11b<sup>+</sup>Ly6C<sup>+</sup> monocytes increased by fourfold in 1/148 infections only (two-way ANOVA, p-value = 0.0005, &lt;0.0001, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). As expected, the numbers of extravascular DCs and monocytes was low, but the number of macrophages was high in both infected and non-infected conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Importantly, 73% of the intravascular monocytes expressed ICAM1 during 1/148 infection, compared to only 8% in the non-infected control and 32% in IL3000 infection, which is reflected in a significant increase (35-fold) in the number of ICAM1-expressing monocytes circulating in the brain vasculature (two-way ANOVA, p-value &lt; 0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).</p><p>The number of intravascular lymphoid cells showed only a tendency to increase, in both strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>).

These results could suggest that ICAM1 directly promotes parasite sequestration. To test if ICAM1 is a potential receptor for parasite adhesion, we immobilized recombinant ICAM1, CD36 and BSA on a plastic surface, in static conditions, and measured 1/148 parasite adherence by microscopy after a 30-min incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Parasites bound equally efficiently to recombinant ICAM1 protein, to BSA or recombinant CD36 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Whilst we cannot exclude the possibility that by collecting parasites from the blood, we are selecting those with lower sequestration capacity or lower affinity to ICAM1, these results suggest that <italic>T. congolense</italic> 1/148 parasite sequestration in static conditions is not enhanced by ICAM1 binding.</p><p>These data show that blocking ICAM1 reduces parasite sequestration in the brain, improves cerebral trypanosomiasis severity and promotes mouse survival, but this effect appears to be independent of direct parasite binding to the ICAM1 receptor. Given that ICAM1 is important in leukocyte recruitment and infiltration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lawson and Wolf, 2009</xref>), next we investigated whether the phenotypic effect of ICAM1 blocking could derive from an impaired immunological response. First, we measured the impact of ICAM1 blocking in the number of circulating nucleated cells specifically in the brain vasculature. By intravital imaging, we detected a 67% ± 5% reduction in the number of circulating nucleated cells (assumed to be leukocytes due to their size and complexity; one-way ANOVA, p-value = 0.0270), which was not observed when blocking either ICAM2 or VCAM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F and G</xref>).</p><p>Overall, these results indicate that the ICAM1 blocking may improve disease outcome by reducing parasite sequestration and the magnitude of the immune response.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Cerebral trypanosomiasis is prevented in the absence of T cells</title><p>Immunophenotyping of 1/148 infected mice showed an increase in both ICAM1<sup>+</sup> intravascular monocytes and extravascular CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. To understand if any of these cell types could be the cause of cerebral trypanosomiasis, we performed two experiments to individually deplete each of these cell types. If one of the cell types contributes to pathology, its depletion should lead to reduced disease signs and prolonged host survival. To deplete circulating monocytes and inflammatory macrophages, we administered clodronate liposomes intravenously 24 hr prior and 3 days post-infection. We observed that mice treated with clodronate liposomes showed high peripheral parasitemia earlier than mice receiving either PBS-filled liposomes or PBS only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Survival was also affected. Mice receiving clodronate liposomes died between days 6 and 7, compared to days 7–8 when receiving control liposomes, and days 7–10 if only PBS was administered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Moreover, we performed mouse behavioral assessment on day 6 post-infection and observed that monocyte/macrophage depletion increased severity of neurological impairment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). These results show that neuropathology is not caused by monocytes/inflammatory macrophages. In fact, these cells have a protective effect during infection. Furthermore, this suggests that the role of ICAM1 in cerebral disease is not dependent on innate immune cells alone, but rather on the increased expression by endothelial cells.</p><p>Then, we tested the role of lymphoid cells in neuropathology. In other parasitic diseases, like cerebral malaria, brain immunopathology is caused by small numbers of infiltrating CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Belnoue et al., 2002</xref>). Moreover, upregulation of ICAM1, IFNγ, and related cytokines is known to increase T cell adhesion and transendothelial cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sonar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">May and Ager, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sancho et al., 1999</xref>). So, to investigate the role of lymphoid cells in parasite sequestration and pathology in the brain, we used mice of the same genetic background, but that do not produce mature T and B cells (RAG2 KO mice). Although they also lack mature B cells, mice with cerebral trypanosomiasis do not survive past the first peak of parasitemia, so the antibody-mediated response is unlikely to play an important role in ICAM1-mediated neuropathology. Besides, we did not observe a significant variation in the number of B cells in the brain upon 1/148 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F–G</xref>).</p><p>So, we assessed several infection parameters in RAG2 KO mice and compared them to WT mice. First, we performed intravital microscopy in the brain of RAG2 KO mice infected with <italic>T. congolense</italic> 1/148 at day 6 p.i.

Then, we followed disease progression, and observed that RAG2 KO mice performed better than WT in every parameter of the SHIRPA test, with only one mouse (out of five) showing signs of neurological impairment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). As expected due to the absence of B cells, mice did not clear parasitemia, and remained heavily parasitized, with minor oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Remarkably, parasitemia was not increased compared to WT controls, and mice survived up to day 40 p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Brain necropsy corroborated these observations as the level of brain lesions was lower overall, despite one mouse still showing moderate neuropathology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).

In natural infections, <italic>T. congolense</italic> is the most prevalent species, yet its mechanisms of disease remain poorly explored. In this work, we established the first mouse model of <italic>T. congolense</italic> cerebral trypanosomiasis and uncovered a role of trypanosome sequestration in disease severity. We show that C57BL/6 J mice infected with <italic>T. congolense</italic> 1/148 strain show significant and quantifiable neurological clinical signs, which are associated with prolonged parasite sequestration in the brain vasculature and an overwhelming ICAM1-mediated, pro-inflammatory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response.</p><p>In the acute disease caused by strain 1/148, the brain is the site of preferential parasite sequestration. The presence of <italic>T. congolense</italic> has previously been shown to result in endothelium activation via the release of soluble factors in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ammar et al., 2013</xref>). Given our observations of <italic>T. congolense</italic> 1/148 parasites accumulating in the brain vasculature and having a prolonged interaction with the endothelium, we propose that parasite sequestration enhances endothelial activation in vivo. It is worth noting that IL3000 parasites still populate the brain vasculature in similar levels as 1/148 and they also trigger inflammatory cascades. However, most of those parasites are non-sequestered forms and we showed that the inflammatory response is very distinct from that of cerebral trypanosomiasis. Tropism to the brain vasculature is a virulence factor and is a common feature of intravascular parasites. Trypanosome sequestration on the brain endothelium seems to cause the vascular occlusion that results in ischemia and tissue hypoxia, accounting for some of the pathological lesions we observed in infected mice. In both cerebral malaria and acute babesiosis, attenuation of strain virulence is accompanied by loss of cerebral capillary sequestration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dondorp et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Medana and Turner, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sondgeroth et al., 2013</xref>), much like what we observed when comparing <italic>T. congolense</italic> strains 1/148 and IL3000. In extravascular parasites, such as <italic>T. brucei</italic>, brain tropism is also a virulence factor, albeit displayed by extravasation rather than sequestration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grab and Kennedy, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Ultimately, the fact that RAG2 KO mice, but not monocyte/macrophage-depleted mice, survive four times longer than WT, and that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell reconstitution is sufficient to restore acute disease, shows that T helper cells drive <italic>T. congolense</italic> cerebral trypanosomiasis. Interestingly, T cell activation, regardless of CD4 or CD8 expression, is essential for the development of <italic>T. brucei</italic> cerebral trypanosomiasis in humans because it allows parasite crossing of the blood-brain-barrier by temporarily opening the tight junctions of the endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Laperchia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Olivera et al., 2021</xref>). However, it is worth noting that this disease, also called second-stage sleeping sickness, only develops later in infection, and not as a manifestation of acute disease like what we report here for <italic>T. congolense</italic>.</p><p>T cell suppression by cyclosporine A administration has been shown not to alter disease course nor associated inflammation in chronic models of trypanosomiasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Noyes et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, we would expect that the same treatment in a 1/148 infection would result in prolonged survival, mimicking the effect we observed in RAG2 KO mice. Moreover, although ICAM1 is upregulated in endothelial cells both in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>) and in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ammar et al., 2013</xref>) in chronic IL3000 infections, it does not result in life-threatening neuroinflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This suggests that, whilst the exacerbated immune response may be the cause of neuropathology, 1/148 parasite tropism to the brain vasculature by sequestration seems to be the differential factor for the development of cerebral trypanosomiasis.</p><p>Based on our observations, we propose a model of acute cerebral trypanosomiasis that can serve as a basis for future studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). We propose that parasite sequestration to endothelial cells results in activation of endothelial cells. Previously, this activation has been shown to occur as a response to soluble molecules, such as the parasitic trans-sialidades, via the NF-κB pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ammar et al., 2013</xref>). Endothelial cell activation is displayed by an increase in ICAM1 expression and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. These could lead to the increase in circulating myeloid cells in the brain, particularly of ICAM1<sup>+</sup> monocytes. Some of the monocytes cross the blood-brain-barrier, accumulate in the brain and differentiate into macrophages. These cytokines, chemokines and myeloid cells can promote CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell activation and recruitment to the brain vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clark et al., 2007</xref>). The interaction of T cells with ICAM1 at the surface of endothelial cells, and possibly myeloid cells, is likely to facilitate activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell adhesion and extravasation to the brain parenchyma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dietrich, 2002</xref>), ultimately causing the neuropathology that culminates in early death.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Murine model of cerebral animal African trypanosomiasis.</title><p>Upon infection of C57BL/6 J mice with <italic>T. congolense</italic> 1/148 parasites cytoadhere to the brain vasculature (‘Parasite Sequestration’). The physical damage caused by sequestration and the release of parasitic molecules, like trans-sialidases, activates the endothelium leading to an increase in expression and secretion of pro-inflammatory molecules (e.g. ICAM1, IFNγ, CXCL9, CXCL10), as well as the recruitment of innate cells (i.e. DC, monocytes) (‘Innate Immunity’). Innate cells and activated endothelial cells recruit T cells to the brain vasculature and promote monocyte differentiation into inflammatory macrophages. Although both T cells and inflammatory macrophages can cross the blood-brain-barrier and infiltrate the brain parenchyma, only CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells cause the neuropathology associated with acute disease (‘Neuropathology’).

ICAM1 is one the endothelial cell adhesion receptors for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berendt et al., 1989</xref>), but has a multifaceted role in cerebral malaria pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Storm and Craig, 2014</xref>). Whilst we did not find evidence for ICAM1 to be an endothelial cell receptor for <italic>T. congolense</italic> parasites, this hypothesis cannot be excluded until more sensitive and complex adhesion assays are performed. Both CXCL9 and CXCL10 play important roles in the inflammation that drives cerebral malaria-associated neuropathology, namely in terms of T cell adhesion to endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sorensen et al., 2018</xref>), and recruitment to the brain parenchyma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Campanella et al., 2008</xref>).

However, whilst cerebral trypanosomiasis is not currently common in cattle, it is described in dogs, goats, and horses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Calvet et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Griffin and Allonby, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harrus et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Savage et al., 2021</xref>). Until now, its disease mechanism could not be experimentally addressed because we lacked a representative animal model. Furthermore, mitigating acute disease may allow the introduction in Africa of exotic cattle breeds that are more profitable, thus contributing to the socioeconomic development of African countries and the reduction of poverty. The lack of suitable prophylaxis and/or treatment for trypanosomiasis has resulted in a severe reduction in livestock farming in tsetse-endemic areas. Despite being less fit for farming (i.e. reduced size, meat and milk yield), the very few cattle heads being raised are African breeds (<italic>Bos indicus</italic>), which have increased tolerance to trypanosomiasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berthier et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">d’Ieteren et al., 1998</xref>). Introduction of external, perhaps more economically-appealing breeds is avoided because they could rapidly succumb to trypanosomiasis. This was very clearly observed upon the introduction of <italic>T. vivax</italic> in South America. Although <italic>T. vivax</italic> mostly causes a chronic infection in Africa (with the single exception of the <italic>T. vivax</italic> hemorrhagic fever), in Brazil it results in frequent epidemics of acute disease, with mortality rates that can reach 70% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Batista et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cadioli et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Garcia et al., 2016</xref>).

In summary, mice were anesthetized prior to surgery with a mixture of ketamine (120 mg/kg) and xylazine (16 mg/kg), by intraperitoneal injection. Reflex responses were induced, and, once these responses were non-existent, mice were injected intravenously into the retro-orbital sinus with three markers: Hoechst 33,342 to label nucleic acids (stock diluted in dH2O at 100 mg/ml, injection of 40 μg/kg mouse), 70 kDa FITC-Dextran to label the intravascular space and provide contrast within the vessel walls (stock diluted in 1 x PBS at a concentration of 100 mg/ml, injection of 500 mg/kg mouse), and a fluorescently conjugated antibody against the pan-vascular marker CD31 (PECAM1) (BioLegend, used at 20 μg/mouse). For imaging, a temporary glass window (Merk rectangular cover glass, 100 mm x 60 mm) or a circular cover glass (12 mm) of 0.17 mm thickness was implanted in each organ. The windows were secured surgically using stitches, or immobilized using surgical glue. For imaging the heart and lungs, the windows were immobilized using a vacuum to prevent collapse of the thoracic cavity. For brain imaging, semi-closed or open cranial (with cranium removed, brain parenchyma fully exposed) windows were implanted, reaching either around 190 μm or up to 300 μm of depth into the tissue, respectively.</p><p>All intravital microscopy performed with the aim of identifying flowing and circulating parasites was performed in spinning disc microscopes. These included a Zeiss Cell Observer SD (Carl Zeiss Microimaging, equipped with a Yokogawa CSU-X1 confocal scanner, and an Evolve 512 EMCCD camera and a Hamamatsu ORCA-Flash 4.0 VS camera) or a 3i Marianas SDC (spinning disc confocal) microscope (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, equipped with a Yokogawa CSU-X1 confocal scanner and a Photometrics Evolve 512 EMCCD camera). Laser units 405, 488, and 647 were used to image Hoechst, FITC-Dextran and AF67-CD31 respectively.

Imaging was performed within a humid chamber with 37 °C stable temperature and oxygen flow to delay loss of oxygenation and therefore alter parasite dynamics.

On one hand, the FITC-Dextran enabled identification of the parasite bodies by the contrast generated in the vascular space. Meanwhile, the Hoechst 33,342 which stains nucleic acids, allowed clear labeling of the nucleus and kinetoplast of <italic>T. congolense</italic> parasites. Flowing parasites were defined as those displacing along the field of view throughout the time-lapse acquisition, together with the red blood cells (also identifiable by the contrast achieved by the FITC-Dextran within the vessel wall). Sequestered parasites were defined as those not displacing throughout the time-lapse acquisition. These parasites often displayed movement of the body and flagellum, but despite these local movement, the bodies remained attached at the same spot of the vessel wall. To enable quantifications by vascular area, we determined the total area of the field of view, and extracted the vascular area using the FITC-Dextran and AF647-CD31 markers. For each organ, we estimated vascular density (D<sub>V%</sub>) as D<sub>V%</sub>=A<sub>V</sub> / <sub>AT</sub> x 100, where A<sub>V</sub> is the total vascular area imaged and A<sub>T</sub> is the sum of the areas of the field of view. Then, using the brain D<sub>v%</sub> as a normalizer, we estimated the vascular density ratio for each organ and adjusted the quantity of sequestered and flowing parasites. These measurements were performed daily in <italic>T. congolense</italic> Tc1/148-infected C57BL/6 J mice, throughout 6 days of infection, at peaks of infection in <italic>T. congolense</italic> IL3000-infected C57BL/6 J mice, and at day 6 of infection in several antibody-treated C57BL/6 J mice as well as RAG2 KO mice. In addition to vascular area, we quantified vascular diameter of vessels in each field of view, to calculate number of flowing and sequestered parasites in four categories of vessel diameters (0–10 μm, 10–20 μm, 20–40 μm, and &gt;40 μm).

The pattern of 70 kDa FITC-Dextran can allow the identification of the type of vascular damage: increased vascular permeability results in uniformly increased fluorescence of the extravascular region most proximal to the vessel, microhemorrhaging results in strong, punctual accumulation of FITC-Dextran. To determine both, we calculated MFI within the 10 µm proximal to the nearest vessel, following background correction. Additionally, we assessed in a qualitative manner whether punctual hemorrhages were present. We measured MFI of at least 60 vessels in three separate mice using an LSM 880 Zeiss microscope, and a 40 x oil objective (1.3 NA).

At the end of the incubation period, parasites were washed and resuspended in TDB, added to the previously washed pre-coated plates, and incubated for 1 hr at 34 °C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Plates were washed twice with PBS (pH 7.4) to remove unbound parasites. We added 100 μL of TDB to the washed plates, now containing only adhered parasites, and proceeded with live imaging on a Zeiss Cell Observer (Carl Zeiss Microimaging) with a 40 X water-immersion objective. We acquired 15 fields of view per replicate well (3 replicates), per condition (BSA alone, rICAM1, rCD36) using bright-field light and green laser.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting the paper &quot;Immunopathology and <italic>Trypanosoma congolense</italic> parasite sequestration cause severe cerebral trypanosomiasis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that this work will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Specifically, while the reviewers agree that the work is of high quality, they also raised important questions regarding the completeness and relevance of the study. In particular, a causative link between parasite sequestration and immunopathology and disease severity is not firmly established, and the relevance of the model as regards to animal trypanosomiasis in the field is uncertain.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is an interesting study describing a novel model of cerebral trypanosomiasis based on <italic>T. congolense</italic> 1/148 strain infection in C57BL/6 mice. The authors show that the 1/148 strain of <italic>T. congolense</italic> (but not the IL3000 strain) provokes a lethal acute disease in C57BL/6J mice, associated with neurological symptoms and brain histological lesions. Using elegant intravital imaging, the authors show that parasites sequester in the vessels of various organs, especially in the brain. Analysis of the transcriptome of brain endothelial cells revealed a pro-inflammatory response in mice infected with 1/148 as compared to uninfected mice. The authors further show that ICAM1 is overexpressed in the brain of infected mice and that blockage of ICAM1 using antibodies reduces disease severity and parasite sequestration in the brain. They also analyzed cellular responses and document that the development of cerebral trypanosomiasis is associated with the recruitment of ICAM1-expressing myeloid cells to the brain vasculature. Finally, infections performed in RAG2 KO mice revealed that cerebral trypanosomiasis is prevented in the absence of T cells. Altogether the data suggest that cerebral trypanosomiasis results from a combination of parasite sequestration and pathogenic inflammatory responses. This study reveals a remarkable similarity between cerebral trypanosomiasis and experimental cerebral malaria, where parasite sequestration and T cell responses are responsible for a lethal neuroinflammatory disease in mice.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>– This study addresses an important problem as animal African trypanosomiasis is a neglected yet devastating disease in endemic countries, for which animal models are needed. This study provides a novel and useful mouse model to study cerebral trypanosomiasis.</p><p>– The manuscript is very well written and the work is well conducted. It includes a thorough characterization of parasite behavior in vivo, based on elegant intravital imaging, as well as in-depth cellular analyses.</p><p>– The data convincingly document that 1/148 disease in mice is associated with brain lesions and neuroinflammation combined with parasite sequestration, and highlight the role of ICAM1 and T cells.</p><p>Limitations:</p><p>– The IL3000 strain shows some levels of sequestration in the brain, yet is not associated with acute lethality. This raises the question of the role of sequestration in disease onset.</p><p>– The contribution of ICAM1 expressed by endothelial versus blood cells is unclear.</p><p>– The role of T cells in the development of cerebral trypanosomiasis is not directly addressed.</p><p>Both parasite sequestration and inflammatory immune responses seem to contribute to the disease. The authors should take advantage of the IL3000 strain to dissect the pathogenic mechanisms further. In particular, although the IL3000 does not provoke a lethal acute infection, it is associated with significant parasite sequestration in the brain (figure 2). In this context, it is important to include this strain (in addition to uninfected mice) in some of the experiments addressing endothelial cell responses, ICAM1 expression and cellular responses.</p><p>The data with the RAG2 KO mice suggest an important role of T cells. This could be addressed directly, for example through antibody-mediated depletion of CD4 or CD8 T cells, or via adoptive transfer experiments.</p><p>The imaging work is beautiful, however, some additional technical explanations would be useful in the text. For example, the Hoechst dye stains all the cells, not only the parasite. In many figures (for example 2B, 5D and 7A, or movie 1) it is difficult to distinguish if cells are leukocytes or parasites. Maybe the authors could show higher magnification insets to illustrate how they could distinguish host versus parasite cells. Also, the authors could provide examples of images where one can discriminate cytoadhered versus flowing parasites (in movie 4, there seems to be a flowing cell, but it could be a leukocyte).</p><p>Previous studies in rats and mice have shown that <italic>T. brucei</italic> infection is associated with parasite and T cells extravasation. Did the authors observe similar phenomena with <italic>T. congolense</italic>? Could they document a rupture of the blood brain barrier integrity? Did they observe dextran leakage? Are they sure that the injected anti-CD45 antibody does not diffuse in extravascular compartments due to alteration of the blood brain barrier?</p><p>Is there a way to disentangle the contribution of endothelial versus leukocyte ICAM1? In Figure 4F, it seems that ICAM1 increased signal comes from intravascular cells (presumably leukocytes), not endothelial cells.</p><p>In figure 5D the vessels imaged after injection of ICAM1 antibody look very different (smaller) than with the control anti-IgG2. The authors should show similar vessels to allow comparisons.</p><p>In the in vitro binding experiments (Figure 5 F-G) the authors used parasites isolated from mouse blood. Is it possible that cytoadhered parasites represent only a fraction of the total parasite population, which would be missed by sampling only circulating parasites?</p><p>Figure 4C is too small, difficult to read.</p><p>In videos S2, S3 and S4 the time scale should be provided. In video S2, all cells look non motile, as if there was no flow, why? In video S4, only parasites are visible in the vessel lumen, no other cells (leukocytes, erythrocytes), why?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):Trypanosoma congolense</italic> is an important animal trypanosome that exhibits significant biological differences to the better studied Trypanosoma brucei. Of note, the parasites sequester by binding within the vasculature and organs, one pathological consequence of which can be cerebral trypanosomiasis. In this manuscript the authors identify a strain of Trypanosoma congolense, 1/148, that exhibits extreme virulence and cerebral pathology, resulting in mouse death within a few days. This differs from another well-studied strain, IL3000, that generates sustained infections without cerebral pathology.The study initially characterizes the pathology and distribution of the respective <italic>T congolense</italic> parasite lines, using comprehensive imaging and histology to identify the parasites and their sequestration in different tissues. The appearance of large cerebral lesions is characteristic of <italic>T congolense</italic> 1/148 although the extent to which these are certain to be the cause of the ultimate death of the animal is perhaps overstated. It was also unclear how representative this acute and drastic cerebral involvement is of infections in the field. In the text, there is also some lack of clarity regarding the distinction between sequestration and cytoadherence. The authors take care to distinguish between these two phenomena (line 142-143) but then apparently use the phrase interchangeably in describing some of their observed parasite distributions on Figure 3 and line 220 forwards. It would be helpful to be more rigorous in the distinction if indeed it is important to understand the respective phenotypes of the parasite lines. Nonetheless, the descriptions of the parasite distribution appear high quality.</p><p>After characterization of the distribution of the parasites in various tissues, the immune responses to the infection are analyzed by gene expression profiling and then the serum analysis of various cytokines. The elevation of ICAM1 is also associated with the infection although the overall strength of upregulation appears modest. Regardless, the effect of blocking ICAM1 is apparently to reduce the pathology of the infection with 1/148 and associated immune responses are also reduced, providing evidence that the ICAM1 response is disease-relevant. However, in these studies, and more broadly in the analysis of various immune responses, I would have valued a comparison of the IL3000 (non-cerebral) and 1.148 (cerebral) responses rather than infection versus non infection to gain better reassurance of the specificity of responses for the pathological measure under assessment.</p><p>I lack detailed expertise, but it seemed the analysis of several immune responses to 1/148 infection were limited to rather blunt tools in some cases. Where more targeted knock out murine strains are available, chemical inhibition of macrophage using clodronate liposomes was used. Similarly, RAG2 KO cells were used to explore general T cell contributions but this also prevents antibody responses (notwithstanding the acute infection being analyzed where B cells may be less important). Again, more targeted interventions might be possible.</p><p>It was also intriguing that chronic infections could be sustained in RAG2 KO mice in the absence of antibody control. What do the authors think is happening here? Are the antigenic variation and periodic killing of antigenic variants that characterizes African trypanosomes less important for long term infections than widely considered?</p><p>In summary, I consider this a valuable model for exploring cerebral trypanosomiasis caused by Trypanosoma congolense. The very acute nature of the infection/pathology is striking and it would be useful to know if this is typical of cerebral trypanosomiasis or another facet of 1/148 that could contribute to some of the responses measured here but less applicable in disease-relevant isolates. The immunological studies are also somewhat preliminary and potentially correlative but reviewers with expertise in this specific area would likely have a better insight into the extent to which causative effects are being studied.</p><p>I would be reassured by a more comprehensive comparison between 1/148 and IL3000 to allow a better comparison between cerebral and non-cerebral trypanosomiasis rather than comparisons between infected and uninfected mice. This relates to gene expression studies and the analysis of specific immunological responses.</p><p>I would also prefer to see more specific targeting of immune phenotypes using specific knockout mouse strains where available to improve the resolution of the study compared to ablation of macrophages using liposomal killing, or quite generic RAG2 KO lines, for example.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is the first time a detailed model for <italic>T. congolense</italic> brain pathology is being reported. The results are interesting, and a set of very well executed detailed experiments show the involvement of the ICAM1-CXCL9/10-IFNgamma- T cell axis. This is an interesting observation as it mirrors findings of the <italic>T. brucei</italic> models for human trypanosomiasis, with the big difference that the latter involves infiltration of the parasite into the brain parenchyma, while <italic>T. congolense</italic> remains in the microvasculature.</p><p>Despite the strengths of the experimental procedures, and the vast amount of data provided, it is not clear to which extent this unique mouse model is relevant for the in vivo field situation of <italic>T. congolense</italic> infections in cattle. In the case of the latter life-threatening pathology relates mostly to anaemia and a metabolic wasting disorder, rather than neuropathology. In that aspect, while interesting from a fundamental point of view, the paper might not shed new light on the true nature of animal trypanosomosis. In this context, attention should be given to the references used to support the potential role of neuropathology in AT: Tuntasuva et al. 1997 is a T. evansi paper (a very different parasite closely related to T. brucei, and not T. congolense), and so are the Rodriguez 2009 paper and the Busher 2019 paper, dealing with equine trypanosomosis caused by <italic>T. evansi</italic> and <italic>T. equiperdum</italic>. Finally, the Harrus 1995 paper is indeed a <italic>T. congolense</italic> case description of 2 dogs but is not a reference to livestock disease. Hence, none of the references support the idea that cattle or livestock trypanosomosis (the true problem of <italic>T. congolense</italic>) is hallmarked by neuropathology. For clarity towards the reading public, this section of the introduction should provide a more accurate description.</p><p>The second fundamental concern that requires a detailed discussion/consideration is the fact that only the rather unique acute 1/148 model studied in this paper seems to result in marked brain pathology in ice. In contrast, the well-described IL3000 model does not exhibit this feature. Taken than in the field <italic>T. congolense</italic> is a chronic infection, once again the question arises as to how relevant the observations of the acute rapid killing mode are.</p><p>Finally, the authors speculate on why they assume brain pathology is the cause of death of the infected mice, they acknowledge the occurrence of acute kidney disease at the time of death as ell. Hence, it is hard to see how the latter can be ignored as a cause of death as kidney failure has been described in other experimental trypanosome models and can result in t in sudden death within hours.</p><p>Overall, this is a very impressive work and it shows how modern techniques in experimental immunology can be combined to get a comprehensive vision on the development of infection-associated multi-organ pathology. It remains to be seen if this impressive knowledge truly relates to the disease of livestock trypanosomosis.</p><p>This is an impressive paper and the execution of the work is done at a level where this reviewer feels it would be almost unfair to request any additional experiments. The only concern is that the results might 'only' explain one unique condition of acute mouse T. congolese trypanosomosis. There are many models for <italic>T. congolense</italic> described in literature, and virtually all of them are characterized by multiple parasitemia peaks. And also in the field, <italic>T. congolense</italic> livestock infections are chronic wasting diseases, not acute neuropthological diseases with a quick deadly outcome. That would be a typical problem for <italic>T. equiperdum</italic>, but not T. congolense. The open discussion about this issue is missing from the paper. This could be improved, as the data itself is valuable by istelf, even if they do not represent the general pathology of livestock <italic>T. congolense</italic> AT.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Immunopathology and <italic>Trypanosoma congolense</italic> parasite sequestration cause acute cerebral trypanosomiasis&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Dominique Soldati-Favre (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>– We kindly ask you to tone down the stated general biological importance of the acute model and the risk the acute pathology generates in wider geographical areas (see comments of reviewer #2).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors made a great job and have addressed all previous comments. The comparison between 1/148 and IL3000 strains now illustrates more convincingly that differences in the immune responses, especially CD4+ T cells, are central to the acute cerebral pathology.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have made very substantial changes to the presented manuscript- particularly by increasing the comparative analysis between <italic>T. congolense</italic> isolates causing chronic (IL3000) versus acute (1/148) disease with cerebral involvement. These comparisons have been informative and addressed my main experimental comments from the last submission, further revealing the contribution of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to the pathological phenotype. I am satisfied with the changes made in the experimental work given the constraints and what is possible (e.g., the RNAseq experiments could not be extended), though a reviewer with greater immunological expertise will provide better insight.</p><p>I remain a little hesitant on the relevance and value of the model with respect to <italic>T. congolense</italic> infection and pathology however. The authors' text previously mis-stated the importance of cerebral disease in livestock infections for <italic>T. congolense</italic>. In the new introduction they have revised this to reflect the evidence that other species (dogs, horses, goats, productive Bos taurus breeds) can suffer acute disease, and invoke the 1/148 model as a tool to address this. However, it seems the acute pathology is a consequence of the host and not the parasite in these instances, and so an alternative animal model rather than an additional parasite model such as 1/148 would be the more useful tool.</p><p>The risk of tsetse range expansion to threaten livestock susceptible to acute <italic>T. congolense</italic> infection also seems overstated. Unlike many hematophagous flies- e.g., mosquitos or sandflies- the biology of tsetse limits their capacity to significantly increase their range and evidence to date suggests that climate change has rather had the opposite effect. For other African trypanosomes (<italic>T. vivax</italic> and <italic>T. brucei</italic>) spread outside the tsetse belt has been possible by mechanical transmission but I am not aware of evidence supporting persistent and sustained spread of <italic>T congolense</italic> by this mechanism (despite there being one report of inefficient spread by tabanids). Hence the potential risk to susceptible breeds in other geographical settings may be very limited.</p><p>Overall, therefore, I applaud the additional experimental data provided which usefully enhances the paper from its original form and will be of broad interest, I think. I do retain some doubts over the general value of the 1/148 model, however and some of the wider biological implications of the work which potentially remain limited.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This reviewer would like to thank the authors for addressing the concerns posted in the previous round of reviewing in a very thorough manner. Addressing the kidney and the CD4 T cell issue was done by a convincing experimental approach, and the discussion on whether or not cerebral complications are a major contributor to <italic>T. congolense</italic> livestock death is now addressed by a more balanced phrasing as well as new and recent references. Hence, all major comments put forward by the reviewer in the past have been addressed and the paper has become an even more impressive piece of work. It will probably inspire other researchers in the field of AT to pay more attention to this pathology aspect.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77440.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: The authors appealed the original decision.

ICAM2 was only increased in IL3000-infected mice and VCAM1 was not increased in any of the models. This is presented in Figure 3E.</p><p>– Serum cytokine profiling showed that CXCL10 and CXCL9 are also increased in IL3000 infections, although to lower levels than 1/148. This is presented in Figure 4A.</p><p>– We then performed immunophenotying by flow cytometry to assess the changes of leukocyte subsets upon each infection model. We observed that, in contrast to infection by IL3000, the infection by 1/148 showed increased levels of ICAM1-expressing intravascular monocytes/macrophages and higher levels of extravascular T helper cells (CD4<sup>+</sup>). Furthermore, we observed that in IL3000 infections, there is an increase in ICAM1-expressing B cells in the brain parenchyma. This is now presented in Figure 4.</p><p>These results suggest that ICAM1 is important in both acute and chronic models of disease, but for different immunological responses (humoral in IL3000 and T cells in 1/148), which is consistent with the fact that in the chronic IL3000 infection, parasitaemia waves resulting from antibody clearance of parasites are observed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The data with the RAG2 KO mice suggest an important role of T cells.

This agrees with immunophenotyping results, where we observed that brain extravascular CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were significantly increased in 1/148 infection.

Are they sure that the injected anti-CD45 antibody does not diffuse in extravascular compartments due to alteration of the blood brain barrier?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not observe any evidence of parasite extravasation either by intravital microscopy or histology. This is consistent with literature (Hornby 1929, 1932; Hornby &amp; Bailey 1930; Fiennes 1952; Losos et al. 1973; Losos &amp; Gwamaka 1973; Banks 1978).</p><p>However, we have observed dextran leakage, suggestive of changes in vascular permeability. Therefore, we went back to our images and we quantified vascular permeability in the brain at the first peak of infection with both strains. We have added these data to Figure 2 (panels D-G). We observed that vascular permeability is increased upon infection, but more prominent in the acute rather than chronic strain. We have further shown that it is higher in the posterior parts of the brain, and shows a strong correlation to parasite number (r<sup>2</sup>=0.92 for the acute strain).</p><p>We also have evidence of hemorrhages both from histological analysis and intravital microscopy. We have quantified the prevalence of hemorrhages amongst brain vessels (Figure 2F). We found that vessel damage (classified by both the presence of hemorrhages and increased permeability) is more prevalent in the acute strain than in the chronic.</p><p>Regarding a potential diffusion of the anti-CD45 antibody into the extravascular compartments, this is highly unlikely. The antibody is only left in circulation for 3 minutes, this protocol has been extensively validated by immunologists as a way to differentiate between intra- and extravascular cells in the brain (Morawski et al., 2017), even in organs where permeability is higher, like the spleen and lungs (Anderson et al. 2012 and 2014). We also show that the vast majority of macrophages, which should mostly be extravascular, is negative for APC-CD45. If this antibody were to diffuse to extravascular compartments, it would stain extravascular/tissue resident macrophages.</p><p>However, to further investigate this concern, we compared leakage of anti-ICAM1 antibody in infected and non-infected brain (shown in the table below). We observed no difference in the extravascular anti-ICAM1 Mean Fluorescent Intensity (MFI) between these conditions, suggesting that the antibody does not leak, even though the blood brain barrier is altered. We further tested this by comparing background anti-ICAM1 MFI between intact brain and after the brain is surgically dissected in several parts. Once again, we observed no difference between these conditions, showing that even when the brain is cut in pieces, the antibody that was previously bound to vessels does not leak to the extravascular tissue.</p><table-wrap id="sa2table1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><caption><title>Mean fluorescent intensity of anti-ICAM1 in the brain.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>Intact Brain</th><th>Surgically-sectioned Brain</th><th/></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>Extravascular</italic></td><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>Intravascular</italic></td><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>Extravascular</italic></td><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>Intravascular</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Non-infected</td><td align="left" valign="top">3.33 ± 0.39</td><td align="left" valign="top">165.45 ± 9.19</td><td align="left" valign="top">2.42 ± 0.15</td><td align="left" valign="top">171.6 ± 9.25</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">1/148 (acute)</td><td align="left" valign="top">3.12 ± 0.44</td><td align="left" valign="top">243.35 ± 6.18</td><td align="left" valign="top">2.65 ± 0.18</td><td align="left" valign="top">248.00 ± 7.55</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">IL3000 (chronic)</td><td align="left" valign="top">2.48 ± 0.15</td><td align="left" valign="top">235.40 ± 12.71</td><td align="left" valign="top">2.87 ± 0.27</td><td align="left" valign="top">224.50 ± 13.32</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is there a way to disentangle the contribution of endothelial versus leukocyte ICAM1?

ICAM1 in leukocytes was quantified in Figures 4C, G, J (and found to be mostly DCs and monocytes).</p><p>To further address this reviewer’s query, we went back to the images analyzed in Figure 3E, and also quantified ICAM1, ICAM2, and VCAM1 expression from leukocytes. Consistent with our immunophenotyping results, we observed a substantial increase in ICAM1 expression in leukocytes (five-fold more than non-infected). We also observed a modest increase in ICAM2 expression (2-fold). In contrast, VCAM1 was not detected in leukocytes. We have added this data to the manuscript (lines 387-388).</p><table-wrap id="sa2table2" position="float"><label>Author response table 2.</label><caption><title>Mean fluorescent intensity of anti-ICAM1, anti-ICAM2, and anti-VCAM1 in the brain vascular endothelium and circulating leukocytes.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>Endothelium</th><th/><th>Leukocytes</th><th/><th/></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>Non-infected</italic></td><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>1/148</italic></td><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>IL3000</italic></td><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>Non-infected</italic></td><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>1/148</italic></td><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>IL3000</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">ICAM1</td><td align="left" valign="top">118.96 ± 9.43</td><td align="left" valign="top">144.19 ± 12.61</td><td align="left" valign="top">155.15 ± 14.50</td><td align="left" valign="top">108.18 ± 5.54</td><td align="left" valign="top">504.50 ± 18.33</td><td align="left" valign="top">511.03 ± 17.35</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">ICAM2</td><td align="left" valign="top">153.59 ± 11.91</td><td align="left" valign="top">143.51 ± 7.72</td><td align="left" valign="top">161.87 ± 8.72</td><td align="left" valign="top">147.48 ± 10.16</td><td align="left" valign="top">336.58 ± 16.59</td><td align="left" valign="top">306.17 ± 15.56</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">VCAM1</td><td align="left" valign="top">37.99 ± 3.48</td><td align="left" valign="top">42.15 ± 2.92</td><td align="left" valign="top">36.35 ± 3.25</td><td align="left" valign="top">Undetectable</td><td align="left" valign="top">Undetectable</td><td align="left" valign="top">Undetectable</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Despite the high expression of ICAM1 phagocytic cells and their vast recruitment to the vasculature, we showed that these immune cells do not cause cerebral disease (Figure 6—figure supplement 1).

It is indeed possible that we are selecting a parasite population that cytoadheres less. It must be said, however, that <italic>T. congolense</italic> cytoadheres extremely well to every surface, including plastic. Currently, we cannot detach the sequestered parasites from vessels and test their sequestration capacity in vitro. We have made this clear in the results (line 514-517) and moved the respective figure to supplementary (Figure 5—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4C is too small, difficult to read.</p></disp-quote><p>We have increased the font of this panel.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In videos S2, S3 and S4 the time scale should be provided.

Of note, the parasites sequester by binding within the vasculature and organs, one pathological consequence of which can be cerebral trypanosomiasis. In this manuscript the authors identify a strain of <italic>Trypanosoma congolense</italic>, 1/148, that exhibits extreme virulence and cerebral pathology, resulting in mouse death within a few days. This differs from another well-studied strain, IL3000, that generates sustained infections without cerebral pathology.</p><p>The study initially characterizes the pathology and distribution of the respective <italic>T. congolense</italic> parasite lines, using comprehensive imaging and histology to identify the parasites and their sequestration in different tissues. The appearance of large cerebral lesions is characteristic of <italic>T. congolense</italic> 1/148 although the extent to which these are certain to be the cause of the ultimate death of the animal is perhaps overstated. It was also unclear how representative this acute and drastic cerebral involvement is of infections in the field. In the text, there is also some lack of clarity regarding the distinction between sequestration and cytoadherence. The authors take care to distinguish between these two phenomena (line 142-143) but then apparently use the phrase interchangeably in describing some of their observed parasite distributions on Figure 3 and line 220 forwards. It would be helpful to be more rigorous in the distinction if indeed it is important to understand the respective phenotypes of the parasite lines. Nonetheless, the descriptions of the parasite distribution appear high quality.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their appreciation of our work.</p><p>We will refine the text to clarify sequestration and cytoadherence as described in the introduction.</p><p>Regarding the representation of acute cerebral trypanosomiasis in endemic settings, we have rewritten the introduction and the discussion to clarify that, currently, it is not common in cattle, but it is reported in other livestock species, as well as dogs, horses, and exotic cattle breeds. We further argue that the introduction of more productive, exotic cattle breeds in Africa would be a major drive for the continent’s economic development. Furthermore, we refer to data that supports that climate change is likely to enlarge the distribution of tsetse flies into temperate climates, which will likely result in an increase in acute disease. Therefore, having an experimental model to address acute trypanosomiasis, and understanding how acute disease can be prevented is of foremost importance to the field.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>After characterization of the distribution of the parasites in various tissues, the immune responses to the infection are analyzed by gene expression profiling and then the serum analysis of various cytokines. The elevation of ICAM1 is also associated with the infection although the overall strength of upregulation appears modest. Regardless, the effect of blocking ICAM1 is apparently to reduce the pathology of the infection with 1/148 and associated immune responses are also reduced, providing evidence that the ICAM1 response is disease-relevant. However, in these studies, and more broadly in the analysis of various immune responses, I would have valued a comparison of the IL3000 (non-cerebral) and 1.148 (cerebral) responses rather than infection versus non infection to gain better reassurance of the specificity of responses for the pathological measure under assessment.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion of including more data on IL3000 to allow a more comprehensive comparison between models. To address this, we have performed the following experiments with the IL3000 strain: quantification of integrin ligand expression in endothelial cells by immunofluorescence analysis, serum cytokine profiling at the first peak of parasitaemia, and immunophenotyping by flow cytometry analysis. These data have now been added to Figure 3E, Figure 4, Figure 3—figure supplement 1, and Figure 4—figure supplement 1. These new data showed that the pro-inflammatory profile in the brain is common to both models of disease, including the increased expression of ICAM1 in the endothelium and the increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, the immunophenotyping experiment clearly showed that the immune responses in both models are very distinct: whilst in the acute (1/148) model we observed increased numbers of intravascular ICAM1<sup>+</sup> monocytes and extravascular CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, in the chronic (IL3000) model, we observed increase in extravascular ICAM1<sup>+</sup> B cells. We believe these experiments have added considerable value to our work, and so we are grateful for the suggestion.</p><p>For the RNAseq study, where we analyze differential gene expression in the brain endothelial cells, we considered comparing IL3000 and 1/148, but we worried that the change in expression profile would not be strong enough to be detected. This is particularly important because IL3000 parasites still populate the brain vasculature in similar levels as 1/148 (even though most as non-sequestered forms), so they are likely to also trigger inflammatory cascades. This was corroborated by the IFA and cytokine profiling results discussed above. Yet, it is our argument that there is a threshold for parasite sequestration before it triggers in an immune response that is so exacerbated that culminates in lethal neuropathology. These subtle changes would possibly not be detected if we compared IL3000 with 1/148 at the transcriptome level. Besides, we no longer have access to RiboTag.PDGFb.iCRE mice, and therefore are unable to perform this experiment with the IL3000 parasite line.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I lack detailed expertise, but it seemed the analysis of several immune responses to 1/148 infection were limited to rather blunt tools in some cases. Where more targeted knock out murine strains are available, chemical inhibition of macrophage using clodronate liposomes was used. Similarly, RAG2 KO cells were used to explore general T cell contributions but this also prevents antibody responses (notwithstanding the acute infection being analyzed where B cells may be less important). Again, more targeted interventions might be possible.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by both reviewers 1 and 2, we have refined the RAG2 KO model by performing the adoptive cell transfer experiment, now included in the new Figure 7. This has allowed us to identify CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells as the cause of acute disease, which we believe considerably strengthen our disease model.</p><p>Regarding the use of clodronate liposomes to inhibit macrophages, we agree with the reviewer that this method is rather unrefined. However, it is still the best and least damaging option available for depletion of macrophages/monocytes. Macrophages are essential in early stages of embryonic development. So, genetic ablation of macrophages, such as in the CSF1r KO line, are quite harmful for the mice, resulting in progeny with several deficiencies including lack of tooth, osteopetrosis, and reduced BM cellularity (Hua et al. 2018). The latter is a particular concern when studying trypanosomiasis because the disease is known to severely affect hematopoiesis. In contrast, chlodronate liposome ablation of macrophages is fast-acting, very effective, and widely accepted within the immunology community.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It was also intriguing that chronic infections could be sustained in RAG2 KO mice in the absence of antibody control. What do the authors think is happening here? Are the antigenic variation and periodic killing of antigenic variants that characterizes African trypanosomes less important for long term infections than widely considered?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is theoretically an unexpected result because B and T cells are expected to be necessary to avoid the host being killed. However, the sustained high parasitemia in RAG2 KO mice has also been previously described in <italic>T. brucei</italic> and shows a similar pattern to what we observed in our work (Machado et al., 2021). The lack of B cells, results in the absence of parasitaemia peaks because there is no antibody clearance. Although the mechanism remains to be studied in <italic>T. brucei</italic> and <italic>T. congolense</italic>, we suspect that parasitaemia is partially controlled by innate, as well as by the fact that parasites themselves regulate their population levels by quorum sensing (MacGregor et al. 2011; Silvester et al. 2017).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In summary, I consider this a valuable model for exploring cerebral trypanosomiasis caused by Trypanosoma congolense. The very acute nature of the infection/pathology is striking and it would be useful to know if this is typical of cerebral trypanosomiasis or another facet of 1/148 that could contribute to some of the responses measured here but less applicable in disease-relevant isolates. The immunological studies are also somewhat preliminary and potentially correlative but reviewers with expertise in this specific area would likely have a better insight into the extent to which causative effects are being studied.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comments. We hope that our revised manuscript has addressed their concerns regarding relevance and the completeness of immunological studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I would be reassured by a more comprehensive comparison between 1/148 and IL3000 to allow a better comparison between cerebral and non-cerebral trypanosomiasis rather than comparisons between infected and uninfected mice. This relates to gene expression studies and the analysis of specific immunological responses.</p></disp-quote><p>As explained above, we have performed all requested experiments with the IL3000 strain, with the exception of the RNAseq. This includes quantification of integrin ligand expression in endothelial cells by immunofluorescence analysis, serum cytokine profiling at the first peak of parasitaemia, and immunophenotyping.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I would also prefer to see more specific targeting of immune phenotypes using specific knockout mouse strains where available to improve the resolution of the study compared to ablation of macrophages using liposomal killing, or quite generic RAG2 KO lines, for example.</p></disp-quote><p>This comment was also addressed above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This is the first time a detailed model for <italic>T. congolense</italic> brain pathology is being reported. The results are interesting, and a set of very well executed detailed experiments show the involvement of the ICAM1-CXCL9/10-IFNgamma- T cell axis. This is an interesting observation as it mirrors findings of the <italic>T. brucei</italic> models for human trypanosomiasis, with the big difference that the latter involves infiltration of the parasite into the brain parenchyma, while <italic>T. congolense</italic> remains in the microvasculature.</p><p>Despite the strengths of the experimental procedures, and the vast amount of data provided, it is not clear to which extent this unique mouse model is relevant for the in vivo field situation of <italic>T. congolense</italic> infections in cattle. In the case of the latter life-threatening pathology relates mostly to anaemia and a metabolic wasting disorder, rather than neuropathology. In that aspect, while interesting from a fundamental point of view, the paper might not shed new light on the true nature of animal trypanosomosis. In this context, attention should be given to the references used to support the potential role of neuropathology in AT: Tuntasuva et al. 1997 is a <italic>T. evansi</italic> paper (a very different parasite closely related to <italic>T. brucei</italic>, and not <italic>T. congolense</italic>), and so are the Rodriguez 2009 paper and the Busher 2019 paper, dealing with equine trypanosomosis caused by <italic>T. evansi</italic> and <italic>T. equiperdum</italic>. Finally, the Harrus 1995 paper is indeed a <italic>T. congolense</italic> case description of 2 dogs but is not a reference to livestock disease. Hence, none of the references support the idea that cattle or livestock trypanosomosis (the true problem of <italic>T. congolense</italic>) is hallmarked by neuropathology. For clarity towards the reading public, this section of the introduction should provide a more accurate description.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and we acknowledge that have improved the introduction to clarify the current contribution of neuropathology to <italic>T. congolense</italic> epidemiology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The second fundamental concern that requires a detailed discussion/consideration is the fact that only the rather unique acute 1/148 model studied in this paper seems to result in marked brain pathology in ice. In contrast, the well-described IL3000 model does not exhibit this feature. Taken than in the field T. congolense is a chronic infection, once again the question arises as to how relevant the observations of the acute rapid killing mode are.</p></disp-quote><p>The relevance of the acute disease model to endemic settings is argued above and has been included in the manuscript introduction and discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the authors speculate on why they assume brain pathology is the cause of death of the infected mice, they acknowledge the occurrence of acute kidney disease at the time of death as ell. Hence, it is hard to see how the latter can be ignored as a cause of death as kidney failure has been described in other experimental trypanosome models and can result in t in sudden death within hours.</p></disp-quote><p>Brain pathology was considered the most likely cause of death for two reasons: severe brain pathology and the fact that mice present severe neurological impairment close to the time of death. However, we agree that understanding the contribution of kidney damage to acute disease is an important aspect.</p><p>To address this, we have performed a biochemical analysis of urea, creatinine, and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) from serum of mice infected with either 1/148 or IL3000 at the first peak of parasitaemia. Urea allow us to detect dehydration, creatinine is a standard indicator of kidney function, whereas NGAL is an early indicator of acute kidney injury (Soni et al. 2010, PMID: 19582588). Our results, now included in Figure 1F, show signs of acute kidney injury in the 1/148-infection only (as indicated by elevated NGAL levels), but still uncompromised kidney function in both models of disease (as suggested by normal creatinine levels). Elevated levels of urea, in the context of normal kidney function, are suggestive of mild dehydration and apply to both models. These results clearly show that so kidney failure is not the most likely cause of death. These results have been described in Results section, lines 139-149.</p><p>Furthermore, we have strengthened our pathology results by conducting an additional experiment to increase the N, showing individual values, rather mean values, as well as p-values to assess differences between lesion scores in each organ (Figure 1C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, this is a very impressive work and it shows how modern techniques in experimental immunology can be combined to get a comprehensive vision on the development of infection-associated multi-organ pathology. It remains to be seen if this impressive knowledge truly relates to the disease of livestock trypanosomosis.</p><p>This is an impressive paper and the execution of the work is done at a level where this reviewer feels it would be almost unfair to request any additional experiments. The only concern is that the results might 'only' explain one unique condition of acute mouse T. congolese trypanosomosis. There are many models for T. congolense described in literature, and virtually all of them are characterized by multiple parasitemia peaks. And also in the field, T. congolense livestock infections are chronic wasting diseases, not acute neuropthological diseases with a quick deadly outcome. That would be a typical problem for T. equiperdum, but not T. congolense. The open discussion about this issue is missing from the paper. This could be improved, as the data itself is valuable by istelf, even if they do not represent the general pathology of livestock T. congolense AT.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comments. We hope that our revised manuscript has addressed their concerns regarding relevance of acute trypanosomiasis.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>– We kindly ask you to tone down the stated general biological importance of the acute model and the risk the acute pathology generates in wider geographical areas (see comments of reviewer #2).</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewers for their positive assessment of our work. We have addressed all of their final concerns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors have made very substantial changes to the presented manuscript- particularly by increasing the comparative analysis between T. congolense isolates causing chronic (IL3000) versus acute (1/148) disease with cerebral involvement. These comparisons have been informative and addressed my main experimental comments from the last submission, further revealing the contribution of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to the pathological phenotype. I am satisfied with the changes made in the experimental work given the constraints and what is possible (e.g., the RNAseq experiments could not be extended), though a reviewer with greater immunological expertise will provide better insight.</p><p>I remain a little hesitant on the relevance and value of the model with respect to T. congolense infection and pathology however. The authors' text previously mis-stated the importance of cerebral disease in livestock infections for T. congolense. In the new introduction they have revised this to reflect the evidence that other species (dogs, horses, goats, productive Bos taurus breeds) can suffer acute disease, and invoke the 1/148 model as a tool to address this. However, it seems the acute pathology is a consequence of the host and not the parasite in these instances, and so an alternative animal model rather than an additional parasite model such as 1/148 would be the more useful tool.</p><p>The risk of tsetse range expansion to threaten livestock susceptible to acute <italic>T. congolense</italic> infection also seems overstated. Unlike many hematophagous flies- e.g., mosquitos or sandflies- the biology of tsetse limits their capacity to significantly increase their range and evidence to date suggests that climate change has rather had the opposite effect. For other African trypanosomes (<italic>T. vivax</italic> and <italic>T. brucei</italic>) spread outside the tsetse belt has been possible by mechanical transmission but I am not aware of evidence supporting persistent and sustained spread of <italic>T. congolense</italic> by this mechanism (despite there being one report of inefficient spread by tabanids). Hence the potential risk to susceptible breeds in other geographical settings may be very limited.</p><p>Overall, therefore, I applaud the additional experimental data provided which usefully enhances the paper from its original form and will be of broad interest, I think. I do retain some doubts over the general value of the 1/148 model, however and some of the wider biological implications of the work which potentially remain limited.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their positive assessment of our work.</p><p>We agree with this reviewer that the outcome of the disease will depend on the pair animal species + parasite strain. In the papers describing acute disease in dogs, horses, goats the parasite strains were not identified and thus we do not know how different they are from 1/148 and IL3000. The specific contributions of parasite and host factors and their synergies is a very important question that awaits to be answered by several groups in the field.</p><p>To tone down the general importance of the acute model, we have rephrased the final paragraph of the discussion. We have also completely removed the paragraph in the discussion mentioning the potential spread of T. congolense to current temperate regions due to climate change (lines 574-594). We have checked that we do not mention this hypothesis anywhere else in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This reviewer would like to thank the authors for addressing the concerns posted in the previous round of reviewing in a very thorough manner. Addressing the kidney and the CD4 T cell issue was done by a convincing experimental approach, and the discussion on whether or not cerebral complications are a major contributor to T. congolense livestock death is now addressed by a more balanced phrasing as well as new and recent references. Hence, all major comments put forward by the reviewer in the past have been addressed and the paper has become an even more impressive piece of work. It will probably inspire other researchers in the field of AT to pay more attention to this pathology aspect.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their positive assessment of our work.</p></body></sub-article></article>
