However, its role in the clinically evident vascular component of disease aetiology remains poorly explained. We have now dissected mycolactone’s effects on human primary vascular endothelial cells in vitro. We show that mycolactone-induced changes in endothelial morphology, adhesion, migration, and permeability are dependent on its action at the Sec61 translocon. Unbiased quantitative proteomics identified a profound effect on proteoglycans, driven by rapid loss of type II transmembrane proteins of the Golgi, including enzymes required for glycosaminoglycan (GAG) synthesis, combined with a reduction in the core proteins themselves. Loss of the glycocalyx is likely to be of particular mechanistic importance, since knockdown of galactosyltransferase II (beta-1,3-galactotransferase 6; B3GALT6), the GAG linker-building enzyme, phenocopied the permeability and phenotypic changes induced by mycolactone. Additionally, mycolactone depleted many secreted basement membrane components and microvascular basement membranes were disrupted in vivo during <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> infection in the mouse model. Remarkably, exogenous addition of laminin-511 reduced endothelial cell rounding, restored cell attachment and reversed the defective migration caused by mycolactone. Hence supplementing mycolactone-depleted extracellular matrix may be a future therapeutic avenue, to improve wound healing rates.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mycobacterium ulcerans</kwd><kwd>mycolactone</kwd><kwd>Sec61</kwd><kwd>endothelium</kwd><kwd>basement membrane</kwd><kwd>microvasculature</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WT202843/Z/16/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Simmonds</surname><given-names>Rachel E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM116032</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shi</surname><given-names>Wei Q</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/W02618X/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Simmonds</surname><given-names>Rachel E</given-names></name><name><surname>Hall</surname><given-names>Belinda S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

The disease is most common in West Africa but is also found in other tropical and subtropical regions including Australia. Although the lesion can be sterilised by a minimum 2-month antimicrobial treatment course with rifampicin and clarithromycin, the wounds can take up to a year to heal and can lead to permanent disfigurement, especially when diagnosed late (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yotsu et al., 2018</xref>). The polyketide-derived toxin mycolactone, generated by <italic>M. ulcerans</italic>, is the critical driver of BU pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">George et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sarfo et al., 2016</xref>). Continuous production of this virulence factor causes widespread coagulative necrosis and fibrin deposition in patient skin tissue, as it diffuses through tissue away from the infecting bacteria. Mycolactone is also responsible for the restricted immune response seen in BU. As well as showing long-term cytotoxicity to immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">George et al., 1999</xref>), mycolactone causes a rapid suppression of antigen presentation, co-stimulation and cytokine secretion at low doses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guenin-Macé et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Simmonds et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Many clinical features of BU can be attributed to the inhibitory action of mycolactone on the Sec61 translocon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baron et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hall et al., 2014</xref>), the complex that translocates most membrane, secretory and organellar polypeptides into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">O’Keefe et al., 2022</xref>). In co-translational translocation, nascent proteins are targeted to the ER surface by a signal peptide sequence at the N-terminus; the interaction between the signal peptide and the pore-forming protein of the translocon, Sec61α, opens a central channel that allows access to the ER lumen and a lateral gate through which transmembrane sequences can enter the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Voorhees and Hegde, 2016</xref>). Mycolactone docks to Sec61, preventing signal peptide engagement and locking the translocon in an inactive state with the lateral gate open but the channel blocked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gérard et al., 2020</xref>). The biogenesis of most secretory proteins and Type I and II membrane proteins is inhibited by mycolactone, while polytopic membrane proteins are largely unaffected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McKenna et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Morel et al., 2018</xref>). Type III and tail-anchored proteins, which utilise alternative translocation pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">O’Keefe et al., 2021</xref>), are also resistant to mycolactone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hall et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McKenna et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grotzke et al., 2017</xref>). The proteins whose translocation into the ER is blocked are synthesized in the cytosol where they are degraded by the proteosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hall et al., 2014</xref>) and selective autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hall et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gama et al., 2014</xref>). Sec61 blockade induces an integrated stress response by activation of eIF2α kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Morel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ogbechi et al., 2018</xref>) and an increase in autophagic flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hall et al., 2022</xref>) and without resolution the cells eventually undergo apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ogbechi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bieri et al., 2017</xref>). The time from initial exposure to cell death varies between cell types, but for most human cells takes 3–5 days.</p><p>We have previously shown that endothelial cells are particularly sensitive to mycolactone. At low nanomolar concentrations, mycolactone depletes the anticoagulant receptor thrombomodulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ogbechi et al., 2015</xref>) and junction proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hsieh et al., 2022</xref>). It also increases the permeability of monolayers formed from endothelial cells derived from both vascular and lymphatic origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hsieh et al., 2022</xref>). While thrombomodulin depletion has also been observed in BU patient skin biopsies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ogbechi et al., 2015</xref>), this seems not to be the cause of the widespread fibrin deposition commonly seen within the skin tissue. Instead, this is linked to aberrant staining for the extrinsic clotting pathway initiator tissue factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hsieh et al., 2022</xref>). Tissue factor is normally located in the sub-endothelium where it is segregated from both the plasma proteins that drive coagulation and the surrounding dermal tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Butenas et al., 2009</xref>). However, in BU patients, tissue factor was observed within the connective tissue distant from vessels and this spatially associated with fibrin deposition and early signs of necrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hsieh et al., 2022</xref>). Our working model leading up to the current work was that mycolactone action at Sec61 in endothelial cells leads to vascular dysfunction and promotes the pathogenesis of BU. The current work seeks to explore the molecular mechanisms driving these events.</p><p>The integrity of the endothelium greatly depends on adequate production and maintenance of the extracellular matrix (ECM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davis and Senger, 2005</xref>), junctional complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wallez and Huber, 2008</xref>) and the glycocalyx, a highly charged coating of proteoglycans, glycolipids, glycoproteins and glycosaminoglycans (GAG) including heparan sulphate (HS), chondroitin sulphate (CS) and hyaluronic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zeng et al., 2012</xref>) covering the luminal side of the endothelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reitsma et al., 2007</xref>). The enzymatic glycosylation of heparan and chondroitin sulphate is initiated in the Golgi apparatus by transferase enzymes. This is also the site of the isomerisation and sulfation reactions needed to achieve the rich diversity of GAGs expressed at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yilmaz et al., 2019</xref>). The glycocalyx acts as an exclusion zone for blood cells and controls interactions with platelets, blood clotting factors and immune cells as well as modulating fluid exchange and acting as a sensory system for the endothelial monolayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yilmaz et al., 2019</xref>). On the basal side of the endothelium, is the basement membrane (BM), an ECM consisting of collagen type IV and laminins, crosslinked by perlecan, a HS proteoglycan, and/or nidogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yousif et al., 2013</xref>). This sheet-like network forms a scaffold that interacts with integrins on the cell surface, controlling structural stability, cell adhesion and angiogenesis as well as preventing leukocyte extravasation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yousif et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Song et al., 2017</xref>). Production of these complex structures, which preserve and regulate the barrier between blood and tissue, relies heavily on Sec61-dependent proteins.</p><p>In order to determine the molecular mechanisms driving mycolactone-induced endothelial cell dysfunction, we have undertaken a detailed phenotypic and proteomic study of the changes it induces both in vitro and in vivo. Using primary human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC), we found that, as well as increasing monolayer permeability, mycolactone caused rapid changes in endothelial cell morphology and migration, accompanied by loss of glycocalyx, adhesion and ECM proteins. Notably, structurally unrelated Sec61 inhibitors, Ipomoeassin F, and its derivatives induced comparable phenotypes in a similar time frame, highlighting the Sec61 dependency of ECM composition and function. We have dissected the roles of these different components in the response to mycolactone and found that loss of an enzyme critical for GAG biosynthesis phenocopied the changes seen in cell morphology and monolayer permeability. On the other hand, the effects on cell adhesion and migration were dependent on ECM interactions and could be ameliorated by application of exogenous laminin-511. Hence the current work presents a novel pathogenic mechanism in BU, driven by Sec61-dependent effects on endothelial cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sec61 blockade impacts endothelial cell morphology and adhesion</title><p>We recently observed that mycolactone induces morphological changes in primary endothelial cells in vitro, leading to a dose-dependent increase in monolayer permeability at 24 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hsieh et al., 2022</xref>). To understand the longer-term effects of mycolactone, we performed time-lapse imaging of HDMECs exposed to mycolactone (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>) or solvent (DMSO) control (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video2">Figure 1—video 2</xref>) every 30 min for 48 hr. As in previous observations, the cells began to take on an ‘elongated’ phenotype after 8 hr. The proportion of elongated cells increased with time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and after 24 hr exposure, approximately half the cells (51.63 ± 2.89%) had this phenotype. The average ratio of cell length to width doubled in 16 hr, and quadrupled after 24 hr exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). At 24 hr, a small proportion (9.73 ± 4.01%) had acquired a rounded appearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) similar to that reported for mycolactone exposure of fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gama et al., 2014</xref>) and epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guenin-Macé et al., 2013</xref>).

However, after this time their ability to re-adhere declined and the proportion of detached cells steadily increased.

The preparations showed equivalent potency against HDMEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) and caused similar changes in phenotype in live cell imaging assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Next, we investigated how mycolactone affected HDMEC migration using scratch assays. While control cells were successfully able to close the scratch area within 24 hr, mycolactone-exposed cells displayed a gradual cessation in migration into the cell-free gap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Thus, while at 16 hr similar numbers of cells had migrated into the scratch regardless of treatment, no further migration could be detected at 24 hr in the presence of mycolactone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). However, it should be noted that mycolactone has previously been reported to cause cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">George et al., 1999</xref>), which can be a confounding factor in such migration assays and may explain this finding.</p><p>To determine whether Sec61 inhibition by mycolactone was driving these abnormal phenotypes, we exposed endothelial cells to Ipomoeassin F or its more potent derivative, ZIF-80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zong et al., 2020</xref>). These are structurally distinct to mycolactone but inhibit Sec61α in a very similar manner since they compete for the same binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pauwels et al., 2021</xref>). Importantly, both compounds phenocopied the ‘elongated’ appearance preceding detachment in HDMEC within 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E &amp; F</xref>). Unbiased analysis of time-lapse data using zenCELL owl built-in algorithms allowed continuous estimation of cell coverage and detachment, although it could not be trained to recognise the elongated phenotype. As expected, cell coverage increased with time under control conditions, while the proportion of detached cells remained constant at approximately 5%. However, all three Sec61 inhibitors showed similar effects on both readouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G &amp; H</xref>), with a similar effect of biologically purified mycolactone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Interestingly, both measures remained similar to the control for approximately 24 hr, after which cell coverage declined with a corresponding increase in cell detachment. Taken together, this data strongly supports that these changes are driven by Sec61 inhibition and that endothelial cell homeostasis is dependent on adequate Sec61 function.</p><p>As the responses of endothelial cells grown in static culture plates may not accurately reflect in vivo behaviour where the cells lining blood vessels are subject to shear stress, HDMEC were cultured on an orbital shaker to more closely mimic conditions experienced under flow. Cells were imaged at the periphery of wells where they experience uniaxial shear stress. Cells were grown to confluency and incubated on a rotary shaker for 24 hr then mycolactone was added. Cell elongation and a uniform alignment of the endothelial cells was maintained for 48 hr in the presence of DMSO, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). By contrast, cells exposed to mycolactone became increasingly disorganised over time and by 48 hr a significant proportion were rounded and detached (42.6%, p&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Although mycolactone did not cause a change in the proportion of elongated cells under these conditions, the pattern of cell rounding was similar to that seen in static cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). There was no detectable difference in the length:width ratio at 24 hr, but by 48 hr mycolactone-exposed HDMEC that remained adhered were significantly elongated compared the DMSO control (p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). Thus, although the kinetics are slightly different, the phenotypic changes induced by mycolactone in static culture are reproducible in endothelial cells under flow conditions.</p><p>To establish the in vivo relevance of these findings, we performed fibrinogen immunostaining in the pre-ulcerative mouse footpad model of <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Fibrinogen is a high molecular weight (~330 kDa) plasma protein that is normally retained within the lumen of intact vessels and, indeed, in uninfected (vehicle control) mouse feet, fibrinogen was rarely detected, and then only within the vessel lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In contrast, at 21 days post infection (Grade 1 lesions; metatarsal thickness increase ~10%), fibrin(ogen) was seen within the blood vessel wall surrounding the endothelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). After 28 days (Grade 2/3 lesions, metatarsal thickness increase 50–100%), widespread fibrin(ogen) staining was seen outside blood vessels within the dermis, in foci consistent with its conversion to insoluble fibrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The lack of signal in isotype control-stained tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) confirms the specificity of staining. This penetration of fibrinogen between the endothelial monolayer lining the vessel, then through the vessel wall and conversion to fibrin by other components of the coagulation cascade within deeper tissue is consistent with our previous findings in human BU patient punch biopsies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hsieh et al., 2022</xref>). Furthermore, the changes in endothelial cell morphology and monolayer integrity described here and previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hsieh et al., 2022</xref> demonstrates that the extravascular deposition of fibrin is an early feature of infection.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Fibrinogen penetrates the vascular wall at early stages of mouse infection.</title><p>Immunohistochemistry for fibrin(ogen) in the feet of C57BL/6 J mice that received vehicle control (PBS) (A1-2) or intradermal injection of 1x10<sup>5</sup> colony forming units <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> at 21 (Grade 1; B1-3) or 28 days (Grade 3; C1-3) post-infection.

A small number (51 out of 606 detected) of multi-pass membrane proteins were also &gt;twofold downregulated by mycolactone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). This group was relatively enriched for signal peptide-bearing proteins (42% vs 4% amongst unchanged and upregulated multi-pass proteins; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). The rules governing sensitivity of this subgroup to mycolactone appear to be similar to those reported for single pass type I proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Morel et al., 2018</xref>), with higher signal peptide hydrophobicity and a shorter distance between the signal peptide and first transmembrane domain being associated with increased resistance to the effects of mycolactone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Of the remaining mycolactone-sensitive multi-pass proteins, 80% contained at least one long loop (&gt;50 aa) between transmembrane domains. Among the upregulated proteins, 88% of the integral membrane proteins were multi-pass membrane proteins, and only one of the predicted single pass proteins contained a signal peptide. Likewise, the four upregulated secreted proteins identified are all secreted by non-conventional pathways.</p><p>Overall, the data support the recently described model for the biogenesis of multi-pass proteins whereby the majority of multimembrane spanning proteins utilise an alternative translocon that includes Sec61 and the PAT, GEL and BOS complexes but, crucially, bypasses the lateral gate, instead relying on generation of a lipid-filled cavity on the opposite side of Sec61 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Smalinskaitė et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sundaram et al., 2022</xref>). Here, only those multi-pass proteins possessing a signal peptide or long internal loops require insertion into the membrane via the Sec61 channel, and therefore only these are sensitive to mycolactone.</p><p>Our membrane targeted approach identified a higher number of Sec61-dependent proteins in our control cells compared to previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baron et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Morel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grotzke et al., 2017</xref>) thus achieving our goal of wider capture of mycolactone-sensitive proteins. Moreover, when compared to siRNA-based Sec61α knockdown in Hela cells, despite the differences in cell type and methodology, 100 of the downregulated proteins were common to both datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nguyen et al., 2018</xref>). While possession of a signal peptide or anchor appears to be crucial to mycolactone sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Morel et al., 2018</xref>), overall, no specific signal peptide sequence features were associated with downregulation. In keeping with this, there was very little overlap between mycolactone downregulated proteins and those lost following knockdown of translocon-associated proteins TRAPβ or knockout of Sec62/Sec63 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nguyen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schorr et al., 2020</xref>), which assist gating of the translocon by weak signal peptides. Thus, as suggested by analysis of the structure of the inhibited translocon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gérard et al., 2020</xref>), mycolactone acts via direct interaction with the Sec61α signal peptide binding site rather than through interference with accessory proteins.</p><p>Gene ontology (GO) analysis of mycolactone-upregulated proteins supported previous observations by ourselves and others of cellular stress responses, with significant enrichment of terms associated with oxidative stress and detoxification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Morel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ogbechi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Förster et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grönberg et al., 2010</xref>).

However, in the significantly downregulated fraction a distinct pattern emerged, with GO terms associated with glycosylation, matrix organisation, adhesion and cell migration showing the greatest over-representation compared to the whole genome. Within these GO groups, the vast majority of proteins detected in our proteome were downregulated by mycolactone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Similar results were obtained when the downregulated proteins were compared to the total detected proteome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>), showing this pattern was not an artefact resulting from membrane enrichment.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Mycolactone disproportionately targets Golgi-resident proteins involved in glycosylation and glycosaminoglycan chain synthesis leading to the loss of surface GAGs</title><p>The Golgi is the site of higher order protein glycosylation and GAG synthesis and, of the intracellular organelles, is the most affected by mycolactone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

As a control, chondrointinase ABC was used to remove surface CS, resulting in fluorescence levels 60% lower than untreated cells. Remarkably, CS fluorescence intensity was even lower in cells exposed to mycolactone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Similarly, using an antibody specific for a neoepitope of HS generated by heparinase III digestion, dHS, disrupted surface HS expression was observed in mycolactone-exposed cells (14.11 ± 7.40% vs. DMSO solvent control 105.30 ± 9.79%, p=0.0006, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). In addition, HS-containing proteoglycans were detected by immunoblot using the anti-dHS antibody. Heparinase III digestion revealed an abundance and diversity of heparan sulphate containing proteins present in untreated or DMSO-exposed HDMECs that decreased progressively with mycolactone exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata2">Figure 4—source data 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata3">Figure 4—source data 3</xref>).

On uncoated wells, mycolactone caused the expected phenotypic changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B–C</xref>), and remarkably, exogenous laminin α5 significantly reduced mycolactone-driven cell rounding, even after 48 hr (7.7 ± 1.5% vs 17.6 ± 2.4%, p=0.0153, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Similarly, while the relative number of attached cells did not increase steadily with time as for the DMSO control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>), laminin-511 coating prevented the decrease in attached cells seen between 36 and 48 hr in uncoated wells (p=0.0123). These effects were absent in laminin-411 and –111-coated wells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). Laminin coating did not impact HDMEC survival in the presence or absence of mycolactone at 48 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref>), although as mentioned before, cell death due to mycolactone is minimal prior to 72 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ogbechi et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>For migration, we performed a scratch assay on HUVECs in wells coated or not with laminins prior to mycolactone exposure. Monitoring cell migration using time-lapse imaging revealed that control HUVECs took less than 16 hr to close a 600–800 µm gap (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig8video1">Figure 8—video 1</xref>). By contrast, the leading edge of wounded HUVEC monolayers exposed to mycolactone gradually stopped migrating into the cell-free region after ~7 hr; at this point the cells began to migrate randomly before undergoing the previously described morphological changes (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig8video2">Figure 8—video 2</xref>). However, strikingly, in HUVEC monolayers plated onto laminin-511, cells continued to migrate into the gap in the presence of mycolactone, with a leading edge still evident after 16 hr (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig8video3">Figure 8—video 3</xref>). Cell counts per unit scratch area at 8 and 16 hr showed that cells plated onto laminin-511 were able to migrate back at a rate comparable to that seen in monolayers exposed to DMSO in uncoated wells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>, p=0.286). We did not see these same effects on laminin-411 and –111-coated wells (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig8video4">Figure 8—video 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig8video5">Figure 8—video 5</xref>) where migration rates remained significantly lower than the control (p=0.0054 and 0.0003, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s4">Figure 8—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>This ability of laminin α5 to reverse or diminish the impact of mycolactone on endothelial cell adhesion, morphology and migration highlights the contribution of the loss of basement membrane proteins to the phenotypic changes induced by mycolactone and presents an unanticipated potential for use in wound care in Buruli ulcer skin lesions, although such therapies are currently in their infancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Iorio et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Until recently, the pathogenesis of BU was thought to rely on two factors; immunosuppression due to the action of mycolactone on innate and adaptive immunity, and direct cytotoxic action of mycolactone on the cells present within the subcutis leading to cell death and necrosis. Our findings provide further evidence supporting a third and vital pathway to tissue necrosis; the induction of endothelial dysfunction that drives an indirect mechanism leading to tissue necrosis via the breakdown of vessel integrity and fibrin-driven ischemia within tissue.</p><p>The current work reaffirms the critical role that Sec61 inhibition plays in the virulence mechanism of mycolactone. In this post-transcriptional, co-translational mechanism responsible for changes in protein abundance, proteins are made in the wrong cellular compartment (the cytoplasm) and degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system or removed by autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hall et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hall et al., 2022</xref>). During the current studies we tried, without success, to express examples of our library of SEC61A1 mutants that confer resistance to mycolactone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gérard et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ogbechi et al., 2018</xref>) in primary endothelial cells. This suggests that the endothelium is particularly sensitive to functional perturbation of the Sec61 translocon and perhaps explains why these cells are so exquisitely sensitive to the compound. As an alternative approach, we tested two analogues of the structurally unrelated Sec61 inhibitor Ipomoeassin F that was first isolated as a natural product of the ‘Morning Glory’ flower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zong et al., 2019</xref>). Across multiple readouts, this induced comparable phenotypes to mycolactone, in the same time frame, including changes in morphology, loss of GAGs, matrisome proteins required for their synthesis, proteoglycan core proteins and basement membrane proteins. Hence, we are confident that the primary target of mycolactone in endothelial cells is Sec61, as it has already been shown in immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baron et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hall et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grotzke et al., 2017</xref>), fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hall et al., 2022</xref>) and epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ogbechi et al., 2018</xref>). Since epithelial cells showed similar effects on migration to those we report here, these effects probably depend on its action on the Sec61 translocon rather than other previously proposed mechanisms such as WASP activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guenin-Macé et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Although the Sec61 translocon is thought to be required for the biosynthesis of approximately 30% of the proteome, mycolactone only inhibits production of specific subsets of proteins that traffic through the ER. As their depletion rate depends on protein turnover, inhibitory effects cannot be predicted a priori. Therefore, we performed quantitative proteomic analysis of total membrane fractions of primary endothelial cells to identify as many of the targets of mycolactone as possible, since ‘whole cell’ approaches can bias against membrane proteins, particularly insoluble ones. Indeed, this approach was successful, more than doubling the number of detected proteins classified as membrane, secretory, ER/ERGIC, Golgi or endolysosomal compared to previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Morel et al., 2018</xref>). Significant depletion of our previously discovered protein targets including loss of CDH5, TIE-1, TEK, JAM-C, CD31, vWF, TFPI, and TM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ogbechi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hsieh et al., 2022</xref>), and induction of SQSTM1/p62 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hall et al., 2022</xref>) validates this data set. The pattern of protein topologies affected by mycolactone reflected that seen in in vitro translocation assays and whole cell proteome analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baron et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McKenna et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Morel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gama et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McKenna et al., 2016</xref>), further supporting mycolactone selectivity towards secreted, Type I and Type II single pass membrane proteins, with few multi-pass proteins and no Type III or tail- anchored membrane proteins showing any reduction in expression.</p><p>GO analysis confirmed induction of cytoplasmic/oxidative stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ogbechi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Förster et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kwaffo et al., 2021</xref>) amongst &gt;220 up-regulated proteins in mycolactone-exposed endothelial cells. However, in this work, we focussed on the &gt;480 down-regulated proteins, which represented a striking inadequacy in components of glycoprotein biosynthesis and metabolism and ECM organization, many of which we have validated individually. Taking together the cellular compartment analysis and our understanding of mycolactone’s cellular target, we were able to correctly hypothesise that the effects on endothelial cell function were exacerbated by loss of Golgi-localised Type II transmembrane enzymes involved in GAG (CS, DS, and HS) production. Up to now, the impact of mycolactone on Golgi function has been underappreciated, but the wider ranging effect on protein glycosylation may explain why mycolactone has such a strong effect on glycosylated protein production irrespective of topology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hall et al., 2014</xref>). It also suggests that the effects of mycolactone may be even more far-reaching than expected, as even molecules resistant to the Sec61 blockade at the protein level may be functionally affected due to the loss of glycosylation.</p><p>Since GAG biosynthesis is a sequential process, and the endothelial glycocalyx is essential to maintain monolayer permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harding et al., 2019</xref>), we reasoned that loss of one of the GAG linker-building enzymes common to CS, DS, and HS could be sufficient to explain the mycolactone-induced phenotype. This was supported by siRNA-mediated knockdown of B3GALT6, which transfers galactose to substrates such as galactose-beta-1,4-xylose, that is the third step in this process. B3GALT6 knockdown phenocopied the elongated appearance seen in primary endothelial cells exposed to mycolactone. The intermediate phenotype seen in some experiments suggests that depletion of junctional molecules by mycolactone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hsieh et al., 2022</xref>), also plays an important contributory role. In the context of BU, it is interesting to note that children born with ‘linkeropathies’, who have a reduced ability to synthesise GAG linker regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Colman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mihalic Mosher et al., 2019</xref>), display phenotypes such as skin fragility and delayed wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Malfait et al., 2013</xref>) that are similar to antibiotic-treated <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> infections. As well as increasing permeability, the loss of the glycocalyx could exacerbate the inhibition of leukocyte homing caused by mycolactone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guenin-Macé et al., 2011</xref>). Notably other viral and bacterial pathogens promote colonisation by degrading the endothelial glycocalyx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Puerta-Guardo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chiu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tang et al., 2021</xref>); however, here the mechanism is via inducing the production of heparanase and other proteinases.</p><p>Importantly, it is not only the GAGs of the apical glycocalyx that are depleted by mycolactone. Many proteoglycan core proteins are also lost. The secretory protein perlecan is notable for being a component of the glycocalyx as well as the BM and was profoundly and rapidly lost from the surface of primary endothelial cells following mycolactone exposure. Other BM components, particularly laminins and their cellular receptors, were also found to be depleted. Excitingly, providing an exogenous coating of laminin α5-containing laminin-511 complex to tissue culture wells protected endothelial cells from mycolactone-driven changes, improving adhesion, and reversing the migration defect. We have not been able to ascribe this to the retention of a specific adhesion molecule, and instead postulate that rescue could be via residual expression of a wide variety of laminin α5 receptors. This is supported by previous work showing that laminin α5 is more promiscuous than laminin α4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Di Russo et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Adequate adhesion to the BM is critical for endothelial cell proliferation, migration, morphogenesis and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davis and Senger, 2005</xref>). Furthermore, loss of perlecan and laminin α4, or reduced binding to fibronectin, disturbs the structural integrity and maturation of microvessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Thyboll et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gustafsson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nicosia et al., 1993</xref>), Finally, laminin α5 not only guides tissue patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Spenlé et al., 2013</xref>) and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Miner et al., 1998</xref>) but also maintains vascular homeostasis by stabilising endothelial cell tight junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Song et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, it is perhaps not surprising that we found the BM to be disturbed in <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> infected footpads. Moreover, this was seen in more advanced infections where fibrin deposition was also present within tissue, due to disturbance of the boundary between damaged vessels and dermal connective tissue. It is possible that these effects are exacerbated by IL-1β in vivo; this Sec61-independent pro-inflammatory cytokine has been shown to be induced in macrophages by mycolactone and <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Foulon et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hall et al., 2021</xref>) and is known to have profound effects on endothelial cell function, including the downregulation of anticoagulant and junctional proteins, induction of vascular permeability and upregulation of BM degrading proteinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cottam et al., 1996</xref>). There is considerable overlap in the endothelial cell responses to IL-1β and mycolactone, although the former’s effects are mediated predominantly at the transcriptional level. An additive effect of mycolactone has been shown for some of these phenotypes in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ogbechi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hsieh et al., 2022</xref>), although the in vivo situation is likely more complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hall et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In summary, this study identifies loss/disruption of the endothelial glycocalyx and BM as a critical molecular process in the pathogenesis of Buruli ulcer. These effects were the same with mycolactone extracted from <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> bacteria and chemically synthesised material, supporting the physiological relevance of our findings. Since these changes occur prior to mycolactone-driven apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ogbechi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bieri et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ogbechi et al., 2015</xref>), they provide further support for our working model whereby mycolactone builds a hyper-coagulative environment alongside disruption of the endothelial monolayer and BM integrity. We propose that this leads to leakage of high molecular weight plasma proteins into the connective tissue where they activate the coagulation cascade leading to fibrin deposition and tissue ischemia. The detection of extravascular fibrinogen at early stages of infection prior to widespread tissue damage and necrosis provides further evidence that endothelial dysfunction could be a driver of disease progression. Rethinking of BU as a vascular disease may ultimately lead to improved therapies that support better wound healing, alongside antibiotic treatment. However, it should be remembered that tissue repair requires a controlled progression through a series of different stages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barker and Engler, 2017</xref>; following injury, under normal circumstances, platelet accumulation in a fibrin and fibronectin rich matrix is followed by an inflammation phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clark et al., 1982</xref>). Therefore, ameliorating the coagulative features with anticoagulants alongside the standard antimycobacterial drugs may be of most value in the initial stages of treatment, while bioactive dressings containing laminin-derived peptides might be more useful to promote healing at later stages. In this context, laminin-derived bioactive peptides have recently been proposed as a treatment for defective tissue repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Iorio et al., 2015</xref>) and indeed, accelerate re-epithelialisation in wounds of diabetic animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ishihara et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting this novel approach may be an effective complement to current therapies and could alleviate the long wound healing times experienced by BU patients.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Fluorescence intensity was normalised to untreated control wells with an intact monolayer of endothelial cells and expressed as a % of subtracted value obtained from wells where no cells were seeded to the insert.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Adhesion assay</title><p>HDMECs were harvested, incubated with anti-integrin β1 (clone P4C10, NBP2-36561, Biotechne) or isotype control mouse IgG1 (P3.6.2.8.1; 14-4714-81 from Invitrogen) for 5 min, then 1.5x10<sup>4</sup> cells were added to the wells of a 96-well plate that had been coated or not with different laminins as described above. After 1 hr, each well was washed three times with serum free medium and attached cells were imaged with a digital microscope camera (Micropix) attached to an AE31E inverted microscope (Motic). The cell count per image was determined using ImageJ.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All data, with exception of the live-cell imaging using the ZenCell OWL (see above), were analysed using GraphPad Prism Version 9.4.1 and 10.2.3.

The study follows up on previous work by the same group, which highlighted alterations in vascular permeability and coagulation in patients with Buruli ulcer. It provides a mechanistic explanation for these clinical observations, and suggests that blockade of Sec61 in endothelial cells contributes to tissue necrosis and slow wound healing.</p><p>Overall, the generated data support their conclusions and I only have two major criticisms:</p><p>- Replicating the effects of mycolactone on endothelial parameters with Ipomoeassin F (or its derivative ZIF-80) does not demonstrate that these effects are due to Sec61 blockade. This would require genetic proof, using for example endothelial cells expressing Sec61A mutants that confer resistance to mycolactone blockade. The authors claimed in the Discussion that they could not express such mutants in primary endothelial cells, but did they try expressing mutants in HUVEC cell lines? Without such genetic evidence all statements claiming a causative link between the observed effects on endothelial parameters and Sec61 blockade should be removed or rephrased. The same applies to speculations on the role of Sec61 in epithelial migration defects in discussion. Data corresponding to Ipomoeassin F and ZIF-80 do not add important information, and may be removed or shown as supplemental information.</p><p>- While statistical analysis is done and P values are provided, no information is given on the statistical tests used, neither in methods nor results. This must be corrected, to evaluate the repeatability and reproducibility of their data.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully but fundamentally disagree with the comments regarding the Sec61 dependence of the effects that we observed. We showed that loss of glycocalyx and basement membrane components underpinned the phenotypic changes in endothelial cells (morphological changes, loss of adhesion, increased permeability, and reduced ability to repair scratch wounds). We demonstrated that we could phenocopy permeability increases and elongation phenotype by knocking down the type II membrane protein B3Galt6, and reverse the adhesion defect by exogenous provision of the secreted laminin-511 heterotrimer.</p><p>Our conclusion that mycolactone mediates these effects via Sec61 inhibition is not based solely on the use of alternative inhibitors but is built on several pillars of evidence:</p><p>First, the proteomics data conforms entirely to predictions based on the topology of affected vs. non-effected proteins, and agrees with independently published proteomic datasets from T lymphocytes, dendritic cells and sensory neurons (ref.12), as well as biochemical studies performed using in vitro translocation assays (ref.11,34). Furthermore, the pattern of membrane protein down regulation observed in our experiments fits perfectly with established models of protein translocation mechanisms, particularly with respect to the lack of effect on specific topologies of multipass membrane proteins, tail anchored- and type III membrane proteins (ref.34-36).</p><p>Second, since Sec61 very highly conserved amongst mammals and is found in all nucleated cells, it is hard to conceptualise a framework in which mycolactone targets Sec61 in some cells and not others, as this reviewer suggests might be the case for epithelial cells [noting that the work being referred to (ref.29) predates our 2014 work showing that mycolactone is a Sec61 inhibitor (ref.7)]. Indeed, mycolactone has been shown to target Sec61 in multiple independent approaches including forward genetic screens involving random mutagenesis and CRISPR/Cas9 (ref.10, PMID: 35939511). Genetic evidence has previously been provided for the Sec61 dependence of mycolactone effects in epithelial cells (ref.10,17). We have unpublished genetic evidence that the rounding and detachment of epithelial cells due to mycolactone is reduced when resistance mutations are over expressed, and will consider including this in the next version of the manuscript.</p><p>Third, given this weight of evidence, one would be hard-pressed to provide an alternative explanation for the specific down-regulation of glycosaminoglycan-synthesising enzymes and adhesion/basement membrane molecules while most cytosolic and non-Sec61 dependent membrane proteins are unchanged or upregulated. However, seeking to be as rigorous as possible we have here shown that a completely independent Sec61 inhibitor produces the same phenotype at the gross and molecular level. Ipomoeassin F (Ipom-F) is a glycolipid, not a polyketide lactone, yet they both compete for binding with cotransin in Sec61α (ref.6). There is significant overlap in the cellular responses to mycolactone and Ipom-F, including the induction of the integrated stress response (ref.17, PMID: 34079010), which we observed again in the current data, providing further evidence that this approach is useful when genetic approaches are technically unattainable.</p><p>Therefore, we are confident the effects seen on endothelial cells are Sec61-dependent. We are happy to provide more detail on our lengthy attempts at over-expressing mycolactone resistant SEC61A1 genes in HUVECs; primary endothelial cells derived from the umbilical vein. We are highly experienced in this area, and have previously stably expressed these proteins in epithelial cell lines, reproducing the resistance profile (ref.10,17). Notably though, these cells do not have normal ‘fitness’ in the absence of challenge. Since endothelial cells (and endothelial cell lines; PMID: 12560236) are extremely hard to transfect with plasmids, with efficiency routinely 5-10% (including in our hands), we developed a lentivirus system. We were eventually (after multiple attempts using different protocols) able to transduce primary HUVECs with constructs expressing GFP (at an efficiency of about 10-20%) and select/expand these under puromycin selection. Never-the-less, we never recovered any cells that expressed the flag-tagged SEC61A1 wild type or SEC61A1 carrying the resistance mutant D60G. We also attempted to select D60G-transduced cells with mycolactone epimers, an approach that can help the cells compete against non-transduced cells in culture flasks (ref.10). We concluded that primary endothelial cells are unable to tolerate the expression of additional Sec61α, and this was incompatible with survival.</p><p>It’s also important to note that most endothelial cell specialists would agree that endothelial cell lines are not good models of endothelial behaviour. We tested the HMEC-1 cell line, but found it did not express prototypical endothelial marker vWF in the expected way. Therefore we focussed our efforts on primary endothelial cells. Should we be able to overcome the dual challenge of the necessity to work in primary cells, and the difficulty of over-expressing Sec61, we will update this paper at a later date with this data, and will also expand the above arguments.</p><p>We apologise for the embarrassing oversight of not including information about the statistical analyses we used, which of course we will correct in full in the revised version.

The main clinical sign is a massive tissue necrosis subsequent to an edema stage. The main virulence factor called mycolactone is a polyketide with a lactone core and a long alkyl chain that is released within vesicles by the bacterium. Mycolactone was already shown to account for several disease phenotypes characteristic of Buruli ulcer, for instance tissue necrosis, host immune response modulation and local analgesia. A large number of cellular pathways in various cell types was reported to be impacted by mycolactone. Among those, the Sec61 translocon involved in the transport of certain proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum was first identified by the authors of the study and is currently the most consensual target. Mycolactone disruption of Sec61 function was then shown to directly impact on cell apoptosis in macrophages, limited immune responses by T-cells and increased autophagy in dermal endothelial cells and fibroblasts. In their manuscript, TzungHarn Hsieh and their collaborators investigated the Sec61- dependent role of mycolactone on morphology, adhesion and migration of primary human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC). They used a combination of sugar and proteomic studies on a live imagebased phenotypic assay on HDMEC to characterize the effect of mycolactone. First, they showed that upon incubation of monolayer of HDMEC with mycolactone at low dose (10 ng/mL) for 24h, the cells become elongated before rounding and eventually detached from the culture dish at 48h. Next, mycolactone was probed on a scratch assay and migration of the cells ceased upon a 24h incubation. The same effect as mycolactone on these two assays was observed for two other Sec61 inhibitors Ipomoeassin F and ZIF-80. Then, the authors resorted to the widely established mouse footpad model of M. ulcerans infection to evidence fibrinogen accumulation outside the blood vessel within the endothelium at 28 days postinfection, correlating with severe endothelial cell morphology changes.</p><p>To dissect the molecular pathways involved in these phenotypes, the authors performed an HDMEC membrane protein analysis and showed a decrease in the numbers of proteins involved in glycosylation and adhesion. As protein glycosylation mainly occurs in the Golgi apparatus, a deeper analysis revealed that enzymes involved in glycosaminoglycan (GAG) synthesis were lost in mycolactone treated HDMEC. A combination of immunofluorescence and flow cytometry approaches confirmed the impact of mycolactone on the ability of endothelial cells to synthesize GAG chains. The mycolactone effect on cell elongation was phenocopied by knock-down of galactosyltransferase II (B3Galt6) involved in GAG biosynthesis. A second extensive analysis of the endothelial basement membrane component and their ligands identified multiple laminins affected by mycolactone. Using similar functional studies as for GAG, the impact of mycolactone on cell rounding and migration could be reversed by the addition of laminin α5.</p><p>The major strengths of the study relies on a combination of cleverly designed phenotypic assays and in-depth cleverly designed membrane proteomic studies and follow-up analysis.</p><p>The results really support the conclusions.

The same measurement could also better validate the therapeutic effect of laminin.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this great suggestion, and respectfully remind the reviewer that these experiments take place in CL3 containment. This often completely precludes certain procedures due to the availability of equipment inside the containment, and our ability to sterilise it. Where we are able to perform procedures, it greatly increases their complexity since any procedures on live animals must take place inside of a cabinet. Therefore, we can only use equipment that we have at our animal facility. It is not trivial to set up the regulatory permissions to perform these experiments at other facilities where more specialist equipment is located due to the containment restrictions.</p><p>Never-the-less we have attempted to perform ultrasound imaging of mouse feet using the VivoF and have set up a collaboration with other researchers at Surrey who have developed a novel imaging instrument to measure microvascular circulation call optical coherence tomography (OCT; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34882760/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34882760/</ext-link><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34882760/">)</ext-link>, and we are working with them to develop a protocol that be used in small rodents.</p><p>However, while we have dedicated considerable time to trying to perform the suggested experiment, we have not been successful within a reasonable time frame. Consequently, if we are able to establish this technique in the <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> infection model, and/or OCT in small rodents, this will likely be beyond the scope of the current manuscript and will be a publication in its own right. We note that we have been able to perform almost all of the other requested experiments (see below), and have also been able to undertake transmission electron microscopy of <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> infected mouse footpads, which confirms the loss of the basement membrane at high resolution (Fig 7E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Figure 1 -D. Endothelial cells were exposed to mycolactone, Ipomoeassin F or ZIF-80. The effect on the cells is clear and impressive. Nevertheless, endothelial cells in no flow conditions are considered &quot;diseased&quot; cells as in the areas of low flow or no flow are prone to atherosclerosis in vivo. Would the authors expect similar effects in cells submitted to flow? In this conditions cells would be already elongated in the direction of flow.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that flow is usually experienced by endothelial cells <italic>in vivo</italic>, and have repeated a selection of our experiments under conditions that mimic flow and produce uniaxial shear stress. All showed a similar pattern of response to mycolactone, including the phenotypic changes (Fig 1I-K), loss of perlecan (Fig S6C) and laminin α4 (Fig S7B). It is true that the elongation phenotype is not as striking in a cell monolayer that already contains many elongated cells, but qualitatively the cells become disorganised and at 48 hours, their length/width ratio had increase. These results provide reassurance that our findings are physiologically relevant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Discuss the possible consequences of your findings on vascular reactivity and especially on flow-mediated dilation and/or flow-mediated remodeling which as both are important in tissue repair and wound healing.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this reviewer that there are likely to be broad consequences to endothelial and vascular function as a result of our findings here. Vascular reactivity is not something we directly considered in this manuscript, and is probably better linked to our planned future work, laid out above, regarding vascular flow in the infected animals. While a key mediator of vascular tone, endothelin 1, is a Sec61-dependent secreted peptide mediator (and is likely to also be affected by mycolactone’s actions), this was not one of the &gt;6500 proteins we identified in our proteomic study. On the other hand, it has been shown by others that mycolactone can induce NO production by in other types of cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>- The authors use a mouse model of M. ulcerans infection of footpads to assess the in vivo relevance of their results. It would be useful to comment on any differences between human and mouse with regard to endothelial cell biology and vessel wall architecture. Since the authors have access to patients samples, parallel stainings in human lesions would have strengthened the study.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important issue, and is one we have already addressed in our two previous articles <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35100311/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35100311/</ext-link> <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26181660/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26181660/</ext-link> . Indeed, this latter work already included a detailed analysis of fibrin staining in these Buruli ulcer patient biopsies and underpinned the hypothesis that we have now tested in the current manuscript.</p><p>It is worth noting that our data supports that the critical step is at an early (pre-clinical) stage, for which patient samples are not available. The proposed human challenge model <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37384606/">(</ext-link><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37384606/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37384606/</ext-link>) may well provide a suitable platform such studies in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The authors should provide in the Discussion some explanation for the differential effects of Laminin-11, -411 and -511 in Fig. 7</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point, and probably related to the expression of laminin binding proteins by mycolactone-exposed endothelial cells. We pursued several candidates based on the proteomic data but could not identify a unique gene that explained this observation. Mostly likely they are explained by partial (be it low or high) loss of a combination of integrin binding proteins. Since this was rather inconclusive and we preferred not to present this data, and already said (p34-35) “We have not been able to ascribe this to the retention of a specific adhesion molecule, and instead postulate that rescue could be via residual expression of a wide variety of laminin α5 receptors.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The word &quot;catastrophic&quot; in the title is very dramatic given the limited impact on the vital prognosis of patients</p></disp-quote><p>This word has been changed to “destructive”</p><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Several points could be further discussed:</p><p>-In mouse model of M. ulcerans infection, in 5% of cases, animals heal spontaneously. How could the authors results contribute to bring hypothesis to this phenomenon?</p><p>Others have shown that the ability of some mice to control <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> infection is related to loss of mycolactone production by an unknown mechanism. It is not something we have ever observed in the infection experiments we have performed, although this may be due to the humane endpoints of our licence. However, this seems somewhat outside the main focus of the paper and we have not discussed this further.</p><p>-Mycolactone was also reported to induce analgesia in the mouse model. There is still controversy about the precise mechanisms involved in this mycolactone mediated painless effect. Could the data obtained here help to resolve the controversy?</p><p>We agree that analgaesia in <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> infection (both in mouse models and in clinical infections) is an extremely interesting area. However, we cannot mechanistically link loss of vascular integrity with the analgaesia based on the data generated in the current manuscript. Therefore we prefer not to speculate on this.</p><p>The quantification of the microscopy images and videos should be provided as well as the script used to quantify them.</p><p>The reviewer is not specific about which microscopy images are being referred to in this comment, but the reference to videos leads us to assume this is related to the ZenCell OWL images/videos presented in Figure 1 and Figure S1. We had already provided quantification of these in the graphs provided, and the algorithms use for % coverage and % detached cells were provided in the instrument software used to gather the data, the ZenCell OWL (which are proprietary). Other counts were made manually, and the length:width ratio is simple arithmetic as already described in the methodology.</p><p>The authors performed their work using chemically synthesized mycolactone obtained from the very generous Professor Kishi (Harvard University). Would the same phenotype and proteomics analysis be obtained with biologically purified mycolactone?</p><p>Our lab has extensive experience of both biologically purified and synthetic mycolactone, and the phenotypes observed have always been identical when using the chemically synthesised form. Therefore we did not repeat the proteomics experiments as we do not believe it would provide any greater insight into the disease mechanism. However, we have now replicated a range of findings using mycolactone biologically purified from <italic>M. ulcerans</italic>. In particular, we confirmed that the cytotoxic activity of synthetic and biological mycolactone are inseparable (Figure S1A), and the main phenotypic changes induced by mycolactone in endothelial cells (Phenotypes; Figures S1D-F, B3GALT6/perlecan/laminin α5 loss; S5A, S6B, S7A).</p><p>Although already very comprehensive, a kinetic study of their proteomic analysis over time could strengthen the analysis (from 2H to 48H).</p><p>We agree that more data is always better, but since we validated our proteomic data set over multiple timepoints between 2 and 48 hrs, we do not believe this would alter the main conclusions of our work.</p><p>The siRNA transfection protocol could be better described. A Table listing all the reagents would help the reader.</p><p>A more detailed siRNA transfection protocol has been added to the methods section, and we now include a Key Resources Table at the start of the Materials &amp; Methods section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
