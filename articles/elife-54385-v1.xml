The mechanisms used by such long-lived cells to deal with aging-related damage are poorly understood. The brain of the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> is an ideal context to examine this since the fly has a relatively short lifespan and the adult fly brain is nearly entirely postmitotic with well understood development and excellent tools for genetic manipulations.</p><p>The adult central nervous system of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> comprises ~110,000 cells, most of which are generated in the larval and early pupal stages of development from various progenitor cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Truman and Bate, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">White and Kankel, 1978</xref>). By late metamorphosis, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> pupal brain is normally completely non-cycling and negative for markers of proliferation such as thymidine analog incorporation and mitotic markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Awasaki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pahl et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Siegrist et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In the adult, very little neurogenesis and gliogenesis are normally observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Awasaki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ito and Hotta, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">von Trotha et al., 2009</xref>). A population of about 40 adult neural progenitors has been reported in the optic lobe and a population of glial progenitors has been reported in the central brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fernández-Hernández et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Foo et al., 2017</xref>). Upon damage or cell loss, hallmarks of cycling have been shown to be activated, although the overall level of proliferation in the adult brain remains very low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crocker et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fernandez-Hernandez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fernández-Hernández et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Foo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Li et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, the brain of the adult fly is thought to be almost entirely postmitotic with most cells in G0 with a diploid (2C) DNA content. One known exception to this are the cells that constitute the ‘blood-brain barrier’ of <italic>Drosophila.</italic></p><p>The ‘blood-brain barrier’ in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is made up of specialised cells called the Sub-perineurial glia (SPGs). These cells are very few in number and achieve growth without cell division by employing variant cell cycles termed endocycles, that involve DNA replication without karyokinesis or cytokinesis, as well as endomitotic cycles that involve DNA replication and karyokinesis without cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Unhavaithaya and Orr-Weaver, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Von Stetina et al., 2018</xref>). The SPGs undergo these variant cell cycles to increase their size rapidly to sustain the growth of the underlying brain during larval development. The polyploidization of these cells plays an important role in maintaining their epithelial barrier function, although it remains unclear whether these cells continue to endocycle or endomitose in the adult.</p><p>Polyploidy can also confer an increased biosynthetic capacity to cells and resistance to DNA damage induced cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Edgar and Orr-Weaver, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mehrotra et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Several studies have noted neurons and glia in the adult fly brain with large nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Robinow and White, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Winberg et al., 1992</xref>) and in some cases neurons and glia of other insect species in the adult CNS are known to be polyploid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nordlander and Edwards, 1969</xref>). Rare instances of neuronal polyploidy have been reported in vertebrates under normal conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Morillo et al., 2010</xref>) and even in the CNS of mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">López-Sánchez and Frade, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Shai et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Polyploidization is employed in response to tissue damage and helps maintain organ size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cohen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tamori and Deng, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Losick et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Losick et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, polyploidy may be a strategy to deal with damage accumulated with age in the brain, a tissue with very limited cell division potential. Here we show that polyploid cells accumulate in the adult fly brain and that this proportion of polyploidy increases as the animals approach middle-age. We show that multiple types of neurons and glia which are diploid at eclosion which become polyploid specifically in the adult brain. We have found that the optic lobes of the brain contribute to most of the observed polyploidy. We also observe increased DNA damage with age, and show that inducing oxidative stress and exogenous DNA damage can lead to increased levels of polyploidy. We find that polyploid cells in the adult brain are resistant to DNA damage-induced cell death and propose a potentially protective role for polyploidy in neurons and glia in adult <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> brains.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Cell ploidy often scales with cell size and biosynthetic capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Edgar and Orr-Weaver, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Orr-Weaver, 2015</xref>). The brain is thought to be a notable exception to this rule, where the size of postmitotic diploid neurons and glia can be highly variable. We wondered whether alterations in ploidy during late development or early adulthood may contribute to the variability in neuronal and glial cell size in the mature <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain. We therefore developed a sensitive flow cytometry assay to measure DNA content in <italic>Drosophila</italic> pupal and adult brains. Briefly, this assay involves dissociating brains with a trypsin or collagenase based solution followed by quenching the dissociation and labeling DNA with DyeCycle Violet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grushko and Buttitta, 2015</xref>) in the same tube, to avoid cell loss from washes. Samples are then immediately run live on a flow cytometer for analysis. We employed strict gating parameters to eliminate doublets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">López-Sánchez et al., 2017b</xref>). This assay is sensitive enough to measure DNA content from small subsets of cells (e.g. <italic>Mz19-GFP</italic> expressing neurons) from individual pupal or adult brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Using this approach we confirmed that under normal culturing conditions, cell proliferation and DNA replication ceases in the pupal brain after 24 hr into metamorphosis (24 hr APF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>), and that only the previously described mushroom body neuroblasts continue to replicate their DNA and divide in late pupa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Siegrist et al., 2010</xref>). The brains of newly eclosed adult flies are 98–99% diploid and we, like others, only rarely observe EdU incorporation during the first week of adulthood in wild-type flies under normal conditions but not later in adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fernández-Hernández et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Foo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kato et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Siegrist et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">von Trotha et al., 2009</xref>). We were therefore surprised to find a distinct population of cells with DNA content of 4C and up to &gt;16C appearing in brains of aged animals of various genotypes under normal culture conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Polyploid cells accumulate in the adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain</title><p>We performed a systematic time-course to measure accumulation of polyploid cells in the adult brain in isogenic <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> male and female flies cultured under standard conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Linford et al., 2013</xref>). We measured the percentage of polyploid cells in individual brains from the day of eclosion until 56 days (8 weeks) at weekly intervals. Polyploid cells appear as early as 7 days into adulthood, and the proportion of polyploidy continues to rise until animals are 21 days old (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This increase in polyploidy is only observed until week 3, after which the proportion of polyploid cells observed remains variable from animal to animal, but on average, does not increase. We observe similar patterns of polyploidy accumulation in males and females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To ensure that the polyploidy we observe is not an artefact of one particular strain, we performed similar measurements across the lifespan in other commonly used lab ‘wild-type’ strains <italic>Canton-S</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and <italic>Oregon-R</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>Oregon-R</italic> flies show lower levels of polyploidy in the first two weeks than <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> and <italic>Canton-S</italic> suggesting that different genetic backgrounds may influence polyploidy in the brain. We also performed DNA content measurements of brains from the distantly related <italic>D.americana</italic> which diverged ~50 million years ago and a more closely related species, <italic>D.mauritiana</italic>, which diverged ~2 million years ago (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). While both species show accumulation of polyploidy, it is interesting to note that they show differences in levels of polyploidy.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Polyploid cells accumulate in the adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain.</title><p>(<bold>A,B</bold>) Percentage of cells in individual brains exhibiting polyploidy in <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> (<bold>A</bold>) and <italic>Canton-S</italic> (<bold>B</bold>) male and female whole brains. Age in days indicates days post-eclosion.

The majority of the polyploid cells appear to be tetraploid, and the fraction of cells exhibiting &gt;4C DNA content increases during the first week of adulthood, but remains relatively consistent with age.</p><p>We next asked whether polyploid cells are located in a specific region of the brain. We dissected the <italic>Drosophila</italic> central nervous system (CNS) into the central brain, optic lobes, and ventral nerve cord (VNC) and measured levels of polyploidy in each region from day of eclosion to 2 weeks into adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We found that while there is a low level of polyploidy in the central brain and VNC that increases with age, most of the polyploidy comes from the optic lobes. Strikingly, by 3 weeks, over 20% of the cells in the optic lobes can exhibit polyploidy.</p><p>Since the optic lobes contribute to most of the polyploidy observed, we wondered if this phenomenon may be dependent on light. <italic>Canton-S</italic> animals reared in complete darkness did not show difference in polyploidy compared to age-matched controls raised in regular 12 hr light/12 hr dark cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Next, we hypothesized that polyploidy accumulation may depend on proper photoreceptor function. However, <italic>glass<sup>60j</sup></italic> flies devoid of photoreceptors and pigment cells in compound eyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Helfrich-Förster et al., 2001</xref>) still show polyploidy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Multiple cell types exhibit adult-onset polyploidy in the brain</title><p>To identify which cell types in the brain are becoming polyploid, we used the binary GAL4/UAS system to drive the expression of a nuclear-localised green or red fluorescent protein (nGRP or nRFP) with cell type-specific drivers. We then measured DNA content using Dye-Cycle Violet in the GFP or RFP-positive populations.</p><p>We first examined the SPGs, as previous work from the Orr-Weaver lab identified these to be highly polyploid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Unhavaithaya and Orr-Weaver, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Von Stetina et al., 2018</xref>). When we used the SPG driver <italic>moody-GAL4</italic>, we found that the SPGs are highly polyploid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Unhavaithaya and Orr-Weaver, 2012</xref>), but contributed to less than 5% the polyploid cells observed in mature adult brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,C</xref>). Another class of cells previously shown to be polyploid in some contexts are tracheal cells that carry oxygen to tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>). Using the tracheal driver <italic>breathless-GAL4</italic>, we found that in 10 day old adult brains, tracheal cells comprise less than 3% of all polyploid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). Thus, 90% of the polyploid cells we observe in the brain arise from cell types not previously known to become polyploid.</p><p>The adult fly brain is thought to be composed almost entirely of neurons (90% of total population) and glia (10% of total population). First, we asked if neurons become polyploid by using a pan-neuronal driver, <italic>nSyb-GAL4</italic> to drive <italic>UAS-nGFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We found that indeed, by two weeks ~ 5–6% of cells expressing nSyb-GAL4 show &gt;2C DNA content. Similarly, we used the pan-glial driver <italic>Repo-GAL4</italic> and found that by 2 weeks ~ 6–7% of glia also become polyploid in the adult brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Neurons outnumber glial cells in the fly brain, and we find that the relative proportions of polyploid cells reflect the total ratio of neurons vs. glia in the adult brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We next asked whether specific types of neurons or glia show higher levels of polyploidy. We measured the proportion of polyploid vs diploid cells in various classes of neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and glia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) in 7 day old optic lobes. Interestingly, we found that most differentiated cell types we assayed in the optic lobes show some level of polyploidy by one week of age.

To examine whether cell fusion occurs, we used a genetic labeling tool called CoinFLP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bosch et al., 2015</xref>). The CoinFLP genetic cassette contains two overlapping but exclusive Flippase Recombination Target (FRT) sites flanking a stop cassette that can be ‘flipped -out’ using FRT mediated recombination to give rise to cells expressing either a LexGAD driver or a GAL4 driver, which can be used to drive expression of <italic>lexA<sub>op</sub>-GFP</italic> (green) and <italic>UAS-RFP</italic> (red). In animals heterozygous for CoinFLP, a diploid cell has only one copy of the transgenic cassette which can only be ‘flipped’ to give rise to a cell permanently labeled with either red or green fluorescent proteins, hence the name CoinFLP. If labeling is induced in the brain early during development before eclosion, cells become stochastically and permanently labeled with either red or green fluorescent proteins. If cells fuse in the ageing brain, up to ⅓ of cells undergoing fusion could fuse a red-labeled cell with a green cell and appear yellow. We used a FLP recombinase (flippase) under the control of the <italic>eyeless</italic> promoter (ey-FLP) to label most of the cells red or green in the optic lobes early in development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B’</xref>) and did not observe any double labeled (yellow) cells in young adult brains or older brains. We also expressed flippase enzyme more broadly under the control of a heat-shock promoter (hs-FLP) and labeled cells using a nuclear GFP or RFP at larval L2-L3 stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) and measured the number of double-labeled cells in the optic lobes at on the day of eclosion or after aging at 14 days post-eclosion. We never observed more than 10–12 cells per optic lobes exhibiting double-labeling under these ‘early-FLP’ conditions. These double-labeled cells under the larval hs-FLP conditions likely include the SPG cells which become polyploid early in larval development and do not express ey-FLP.

Since dead cells are cleared in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kurant, 2011</xref>), we expect this steady rate of cell death to result in a predictable rate of cell loss in the brain with age, which closely agrees with our total cell counts performed using flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>We next examined whether the polyploid cells in aged brains are protected from cell death.

We then exposed these flies to 480mJ UV to induce DNA damage and measured the levels of cell death and polyploidy from 24 hr – 5 days post exposure to UV. We observe high levels of PI incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H,I</xref>) at 24 hr post exposure, but normal levels by 48 hr, indicating an acute response of DNA damage induced cell death in the brain. Many diploid cells die in response to this dose of UV (~24.5%). In contrast, the polyploid cells show very low levels of PI incorporation (~3.1%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>), suggesting that the polyploid cells in older adult brains are also resistant to DNA damage induced cell death. We next examined whether the exposure to DNA damage also altered polyploidy, as we had observed in younger animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). At 48 hr we observed, on average, a 4% increase in polyploidy for UV exposed animals. This early increase can be almost entirely attributed to the loss of the diploid cells that are PI positive at 24 hr post exposure (a loss of 24.5% of diploid cells increases the proportion of polyploid cells from 18.9% to 23%). When comparing 48 hr to 5 days post exposure, we see no significant increase in polyploidy, suggesting that after 3 weeks of age, animals lose the ability to further increase polyploidy in response to damage. This is in contrast to our experiment in young animals, using a low dose of paraquat to cause oxidative damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,D</xref>) where we see an earlier accumulation of polyploid cells without any obvious increase in cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The work described in this study supports a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref>) where cells in the early adult fly brain undergo endoreplication and polyploidization in response to DNA damage and oxidative stress accumulated with age.

We have identified several classes of neurons as well as glia that exhibit adult-onset polyploidy. We have also characterized which regions of the brain show increased polyploidy, and find that polyploidy is closely correlated with the expression of a DNA damage response signature. Other work has also shown that a small population of about 40 stem cells in the optic lobes of <italic>Drosophila</italic> respond to acute injury by generating adult-born neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fernández-Hernández et al., 2013</xref>). We considered the possibility that a fraction of cells with 4C DNA content may be in G2 and poised to undergo mitosis. We stained for G2 and mitotic cell cycle markers (phospho-histone H3 and Cyclin A) in over 100 adult brains at different ages and never observed a convincing G2 or mitotic event. However, we may have missed rare, transient cell cycle events that are captured by permanent lineage tracing approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crocker et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fernández-Hernández et al., 2013</xref>). Both our cell number counts and cell death measurements indicate a steady decline in cell number in the adult brain with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), and suggest that under normal ageing conditions mitoses are likely rare. Moreover, we observe hundreds to thousands of tetraploid or polyploid cells by FACS or CoinFLP, suggesting that only a very small proportion of tetraploid cells would be expected to be in G2. We suggest that multiple mechanisms are employed in this brain region to ensure proper function and tissue integrity with age.</p><p>Polyploidy in neurons has previously been reported in the mouse cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">López-Sánchez et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">López-Sánchez and Frade, 2013</xref>) and chick retinal ganglion cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Morillo et al., 2010</xref>). Whether purkinje cells in the mammalian cerebellum are polyploid has been a matter of considerable debate over the past several decades.

These cell types have distinct physiology and functions. How polyploidization affects the function of these various cell types is an exciting avenue for future research. Polyploidy can confer cell-type and context specific benefits in various tissues. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, polyploid intestinal enterocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Miguel-Aliaga et al., 2018</xref>), SPGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Unhavaithaya and Orr-Weaver, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Von Stetina et al., 2018</xref>) and cells in the wounded epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Losick, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Losick et al., 2013</xref>) undergo endoreduplication and do not undergo cytokinesis to maintain the integrity of the blood brain barrier and the cell-cell junctions in the epithelium respectively. One possibility is that polyploidy in neurons or glia may allow cells to compensate for cell loss while maintaining established cell-cell contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Unhavaithaya and Orr-Weaver, 2012</xref>). The compound eye and optic lobes of <italic>Drosophila</italic> contain ~750–800 ommatidial ‘units’ that form a highly organized and crystalline structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bates et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nériec and Desplan, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pecot et al., 2014</xref>). Numerically and topographically matched cells in the medulla cortex of the optic lobes receive inputs from the lamina which in turn receives inputs from the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bates et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pecot et al., 2014</xref>). We observe polyploidization in multiple neuronal types found in the medulla, yet several cell types in the brain show a decline in number with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bates et al., 2019</xref>). In neurons, polyploidy could play a role in helping cells increase their soma size and dendritic arbors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Morillo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Szaro and Tompkins, 1987</xref>). It is possible that polyploidy allows neurons to form more presynaptic and postsynaptic connections to compensate for lost cells while maintaining the integrity of existing connections in the visual system.</p><p>Nurse cells in the egg chamber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lilly and Spradling, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wattiaux and Tsien, 1971</xref>), cells in the accessory gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Box et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sitnik et al., 2016</xref>), salivary gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Edgar and Orr-Weaver, 2001</xref>) and fat body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guarner et al., 2017</xref>), on the other hand become polyploid to fulfill increased biosynthetic demands. In addition to an upregulation of DNA damage and cell cycle in the optic lobes, our RNAseq data suggest compromised metabolism with age in all parts of the brain. One of the main functions of glial cells is to provide metabolic support to neurons in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kremer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schirmeier et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Volkenhoff et al., 2015</xref>). Polyploidization in astrocyte and cortex glial cells might also serve to increase their metabolic output and compensate for the reduced metabolic output in the ageing brain.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>DNA damage accumulates in the optic lobes with age</title><p>We observe higher levels of expression of DNA damage-associated genes in the optic lobes than in other parts of the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We also see higher levels of DNA damage foci in the optic lobes than the central brain. We observe this signature even at 7 days in the OL, but it becomes stronger by 21 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This is consistent with other studies that report that signatures of ageing appear gradually over the course of an organism’s lifespan and not abruptly at later chronological ages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ben-Zvi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Labbadia and Morimoto, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shavlakadze et al., 2019</xref>). We do not know whether the increased DNA damage signature we observe in the optic lobes is because the optic lobes intrinsically sustain higher levels of DNA damage or whether other parts of the brain are better equipped to resolve DNA lesions. We also see an upregulation of cell cycle-associated genes specifically in the optic lobes with age. The transcription of cell cycle genes and genes involved in the DNA damage response and repair are intimately coordinated and can be controlled by intersecting pathways. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Herrup et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Uxa et al., 2019</xref>). Homology-directed repair of DNA lesions occurs in S and G2 phases of the cell cycle in actively dividing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Herrup and Yang, 2007</xref>). In other phases of the cell cycle, and after cell cycle exit, cells have to rely on error-prone non-homologous end joining mediated repair. It is tempting to speculate that re-entering the cell cycle allows postmitotic cells to repair DNA damage better and survive.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Is polyploidy protective?</title><p>We and others observe a steady decline in the number of cells in the adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bates et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Foo et al., 2017</xref>). The continual loss of cells in the ageing brain may be analogous to wounding, which induces polyploidization or compensatory cellular hypertrophy in other <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bretscher and Fox, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cohen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Losick et al., 2013</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tamori and Deng, 2013</xref>). We suggest neurons and glia in the adult brain may employ a similar strategy, to compensate for cell loss in a non-autonomous fashion. When we induce damage that does not increase cell death in young brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,D</xref>) we observe an earlier increase in polyploidy, suggesting that in younger animals polyploidy can be an adaptive response to damage. By contrast in older animals, we find that polyploidy can protect from acute cell loss. However, levels of subsequent polyploidy do not further increase in aged animals, suggesting there is a permissive window for damage-induced polyploidy during adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This may explain why levels of polyploidy plateau after 3–4 weeks of age in various strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). It will be interesting to further test the nature of this compensation for cell loss in early adulthood by performing genetic experiments to ablate specific cell types or sub-populations of cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>How does polyploidy relate to neurodegeneration?</title><p>Over the past two decades, several studies have reported an interesting correlation between neurodegeneration and cell cycle re-entry in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Frade and Ovejero-Benito, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Herrup, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Moh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rimkus et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yang and Herrup, 2005</xref>). Most of these observations are from post-mortem brains containing neurons expressing cell cycle genes or exhibiting hyperploidy (&gt;2N DNA content). More hyperploidy is observed in brains of patients with preclinical Alzheimer’s compared to age-matched controls, which has led to the hypothesis that cell cycle re-entry may precede cell death and neurodegeneration. Whether cell cycle re-entry is a cause or a consequence of neurodegeneration has been difficult to test, since both are associated with age and damage. Our data suggest that re-entry into the cell cycle may be a normal physiological response to the accumulation of damage in early adulthood and that it can serve a beneficial and protective function in neurons and glia. However, we do not know how polyploidy may impact neuronal and glial function and whether it may become detrimental over time. In geriatric animals (beyond 4 weeks) we observe increased variation in the levels of polyploidy and we note that a subset of animals also exhibit extreme levels of cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). It is possible that these animals represent a fraction of the aged population that exhibit neurodegeneration. Our single-animal assays will be essential to identify these outliers for further study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="bottom">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="bottom">Designation</th><th valign="bottom">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th valign="bottom">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom"><italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic></td><td valign="bottom">Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center</td><td valign="bottom">BDSC 5905</td><td valign="bottom">isogenic</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom"><italic>Canton-S</italic></td><td valign="bottom">O.

DAPI staining was performed after washes, brains were wet-mounted in vectashield H1000. All imaging was performed on either a Leica SP5 or SP8 laser scanning confocal microscopes. For EdU incorporation assays, flies were placed on 10 mM EdU containing food with food coloring for 3 days prior to dissection. Only flies with visibly colored abdomens were dissected.

Average Intensity of pH2AV and DAPI per ROI were computed on individual channels using ImageJ. All brains were imaged at the same laser intensity and gain settings at different ages.</p><p>CoinFLP double-labeled cell counting was performed manually. Individual optic lobes were imaged at 100x magnification with 0.5 micron Z-sections. Quantification was performed by cropping 2–5 confocal Z-sections at a time, performing maximum intensity projections of each cropped image, and counting cells that showed DAPI, GFP and RFP signal overlap. Lamin staining was used to discern nuclear boundaries for DAPI Integrated Intensity measurements of 132 cells using FIJI. DAPI intensity was normalized to diploid cells (2N) measured on the same slide.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Heat shock protocol</title><p>CoinFLP labeling was induced with heat shock induction. Flies were placed in plastic vials and completely submerged in 37°C water bath for 15 min. For ‘early-FLP’, flies were moved back to 23°C and dissected at day 1 or day 10. For ‘late-FLP’, heat shock induction was performed 24 hr prior to dissection. All incubations and culturing except heat shock was performed at 23°C. We noted that the frequency of CoinFLP flipping resulted in a ratio of LexA:GAL4 expressing cells that is between 4:1 and 4.6:1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bosch et al., 2015</xref>). We calculated the expected number of double labeled cells for ‘late-FLP’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> as follows: If flipping is complete (100% of cells flip), we would expect 80% of diploid cells to label red and ~20% to label green. Only 4% of all polyploid cells will label green/green (probability of green is 0.2 therefore 0.2* 0.2 = 0.04*100), 64% red/red (probability of red is 0.8 thus, 0.8*0.8 = 0.64*100) and 32% will label green/red or red/green and appear yellow or ‘double-labeled’. If we assume that about 20% of cells in the optic lobes are tetraploid (20% of ~30,000 = 6,000 cells), we can expect 1,920 cells (32% of 6,000) to label yellow per optic lobe under 100% flipping conditions. If we flip ~50% of cells, we expect about 900 yellow cells per optic lobe. In our measurements the amount of flipping was variable from animal to animal and we estimate that in our samples with the lowest flipping we flip about ⅓ of cells and with our strongest flipping we label about ¾ cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>Fly brains were dissected in PBS and transferred to 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube caps containing 100 uL of solution containing 9:1 Trypsin-EDTA: 10XPBS with 1 µL Dyecycle Violet and/or 1.12 µL PI or 1 µL Sytox green. Brains were incubated for 20 min in the microcentrifuge tube caps, triturated using low retention p200 pipette tips for 60 s then transferred into the microcentrifuge tubes containing 400 µL of the trypsin-EDTA solution with dyes and capped, and incubated further for 45 min at room temperature without agitation. After incubation, each sample was diluted with 500 µL 1XPBS and gently vortexed at speed eight before being loaded onto Attune or Attune NxT flow cytometer for flow cytometry analysis. The Attune had a laser configuration of a violet laser (VL,405nm) with six bandpass (BP) filters and a blue laser (BL,488nm) with three bandpass filters. The Attune NxT is configured with VL (6 BP filters), BL with 2 BP filters, a yellow laser (YL, 561 nm) with 3 BP filters and a red laser (RL, 637 nm) with 3 BP filters. The detection of DyeCycle Violet was performed using VL1 (Emission filter 450/40), GFP and Sytox Green using BL1 (Emission filter 530/30), RFP and PI using BL2 (Emission filter 574/24) on the Attune and YL1 (585/16) on the Attune NxT. A flow rate of 100 to 500 µl/second was used for sample acquisition and a minimum of 20,0000 events gated as ‘non doublets’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) were acquired per sample. Gating Strategy is graphed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. Briefly, all cells were plotted on forward vs side scatter (FSC vs. SSC), gated to eliminate debris. Subsequently, ‘non-debris’ were plotted on VL1(DNA) vs FSC and gated to eliminate unstained events. A third gate was applied plotting VL1(DNA)-H vs VL1(DNA)-A (voltage pulse area vs.height) to eliminate doublets. All events in gate three were further subjected to GFP/DNA/PI content analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>RNA sequencing</title><p>10 CNSs from <italic>Canton-S</italic> females and males raised at 25°C on Cornmeal/Dextrose food under normal 12 h L/D cycles at ZT = 2, were dissected into optic lobes, VNC and central brain at the indicated ages with three biological replicates for each sex, age and region (72 samples total).

Quality of the raw reads data for each sample was checked using FastQC(version v0.11.7). 3. Adaptors and poor quality bases were trimmed from reads using bbduk from the BBTools suite (v37.90).4. Quality processed reads were aligned to the Ensembl Dm6 genome using STAR (v2.6.1a) with quantMode GeneCounts flag option set to produce gene level counts. MultiQC (v1.6a0) was run to summarize QC information for raw reads, QC processed reads, alignment, and gene count information. Differential expression analyses were carried out using DESeq2 (v1.14.1). Data were pre-filtered to remove genes with 0 counts in all samples. Normalization and differential expression was performed with DESeq2, using a negative binomial generalized linear model. Plots were generated using variations or alternative representations of native DESeq2 plotting functions, ggplot2, plotly, and other packages within the R environment.</p><p>Genes called as at least 2-fold differentially expressed between day 2 and day 21 were examined for enriched GO terms using target and background unranked lists in GOrilla and redundant GO terms were filtered using ReviGO.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by K VijayRaghavan as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Grace E Boekhoff-Falk (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript entitled &quot;Polyploidy in the adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain&quot; by Nandakumar and colleagues describes the age-related accumulation of polyploid cells in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain and proposes this mechanism as a response to DNA damage. Polyploidization is hypothesized to promote survival in response to the accumulation of age-related DNA damage.</p><p>Polyploid and aneuploid cells in the brain have been described before, as is their accumulation during aging and disease. However, the idea of this being a response to DNA damage is novel. The authors make an effort to associate ploidy changes in adult animals with brain regions and cell types, which is an important unaddressed question in the field. The experiments aiming to demonstrate that polyploid cells in the brain are a consequence of cell cycle reentry are also of interest. Overall, while the study is of interest, it lacks quantitative follow-up experiments and includes several correlative studies as well as overstatements of many conclusions. These and other concerns are outlined below. The reviews also involve suggestions for experiments. The authors should decide which are best suited to speedily and robustly address the requirements for clear evidence for their assertions, or where discussion of previous work from their labs will suffice. In any event, the experiments are doable in a 2-month period. The authors should make every effort to firmly address the reviewers' concerns so that a decision can be taken by avoiding further revisions. The work will represent a strong contribution to the field if the substantive concurs are well-addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The study is entirely based on ploidy detection by FACS using a custom assay to measure DNA content; however, this assay has not been benchmarked to determine its sensitivity and specificity. The only validation is correlative with the frequency of EdU positive cells shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1F. The FACS based method needs to be validated with an independent technique (i.e. FISH, single cell sequencing) in order to strengthen the following statement &quot;We were therefore surprised to find a distinct population of cells with DNA content of 4C and up to &gt;16C appearing in brains of aged animals of various genotypes under normal culture conditions (Figure 1—figure supplement 1G)&quot;. We recommend that polyploidy be also shown in a second way such as high resolution imaging and single cell fluorescence measurements of DNA, or using DNA FISH probes.</p><p>2) The animals analyzed in this study are 1 week increment up to 8 weeks; the age related increased in polyploidy begins at 7 days and continues to accumulate up to 21 days (week 3) after which reaches a plateau. This age group should be considered middle age and therefore the data do not support the statement in the Abstract &quot;that &quot;polyploidy protects against DNA damage-induced cell death&quot;.</p><p>3) The COINFLP system applied to demonstrate that cells reenter the cell cycle shows correlative data; green, red and yellow cells should be FACS enriched to measure the frequency of polyploid cells in the yellow fraction. This is important because while it is understood that yellow labelled cells are assumed to be polyploid this has not been formally demonstrated. Likewise, in the silencing experiments (cdc6 and Geminin) yellow cells are assumed polyploid and even labelled as such in Figure 4G but no quantification of DNA content is ever provided.</p><p>4) The RNA seq data have not been validated, and again show correlative results.</p><p>5). There are three main part to the model presented.</p><p>a) DNA damage accumulating with age. This result is not surprising and there are several examples that show this in various tissues, including in brains. We also think that the staining and imaging for pH2AV must be greatly improved. There are several other experiments that could benefit from images, or better images. The authors must look at their experiments and see where this can be added meaningfully or experiments done.</p><p>b) &quot;Exogenous&quot; DNA damage leading to increased polyploidy. I think the authors were very careful to use the exogenous damage here as their analysis of ploidy after PQ treatment might not reflect normal polyploidy due to normal levels of stress and age. In addition, their analysis is done in bulk tissue and not on a single cell basis to correlate a cell's DNA damage with its ploidy. It would be interesting to further test the idea that DNA damage induces polyploidy by over-expressing or knocking down a DNA repair factor such as Prp19 and then measuring the proportion of cells that are polyploid. Again, this is experimentally feasible speedily, but if the authors choose not to do this, these must have a cogent and strong reasoning.</p><p>c) Polyploidy protecting from cell death. We think this idea is founded in the literature from other cell types, and thus it is a reasonable hypothesis in the fly brain. However, we do not think the experiment presented is sufficient to make this a solid conclusion. A change in the percent of dying cells from 7 to 2.5 (diploid vs polyploid) from cell counts that are already very small and from brains that are pooled does not seem like a reliable experiment. We think additional experiments should be done. For example, the authors could use a GAL4 expressed in a restricted sub-population of cells (ex. SPGs via R54C07-GAL4 which was used in Kremer et al., 2017) to label and directly count the number of cells in the optic lobes via light microscopy (it should be &lt;100 cells per lobe). Then, RNAi against cdc6 and geminin (as in Figure 4G) could be used to manipulate the proportion of cells that are polyploid. Using such an approach would allow the authors to link the proportion of cells that are polyploid to the total number of cells and thus directly show that polyploidy protects the cells from DNA damage-induced cell death.</p><p>6) A criticism of the work as presented is that the vast majority of the polyploid cells are tetraploid, yet the authors do not address the possibility that these cells simply have replicated their DNA prior to dividing (i.e. are transiently polyploid) as versus remaining indefinitely polyploid. Earlier work from other laboratories suggests that this unlikely, and the manuscript would be improved by a discussion of the possibilities.</p><p>7) The authors state that up to 20% of the cells in the optic lobes are polyploid. However, later in the text (and the figure legends) the number is 25%. Please be consistent.</p><p>8) In the Discussion, the authors propose that polyploidization may permit cells to maintain contacts when some of their neighbors die. This hypothesis also was proposed by Unhavaithaya and Orr-Weaver who should be cited. The BBB example is particularly compelling b/c the contacts create the barrier.</p><p>9) The authors state “It is also possible that we see higher levels of DNA damage foci in the optic lobes because they have more polyploid cells” but do not offer an explanation for why this could be biologically relevant.</p><p>10) Also, the authors state “We see an upregulation of cell cycle-associated genes specifically in the optic lobes with age. The transcription of cell cycle genes and genes involved in the DNA damage response and repair are intimately coordinated and can be controlled by the same factors.” Please complete the argument – namely that upregulation of DNA damage response and cell cycle genes may share an upstream regulatory mechanism.</p><p>11) The authors state “Whether cell cycle re-entry is a cause or a consequence of neurodegeneration has been difficult to test since both are associated with age and damage.” An earlier paper would seem to be relevant and could be cited: Mutations in String/CDC25 inhibit cell cycle re-entry and neurodegeneration in a <italic>Drosophila</italic> model of Ataxia-telangiectasia. Rimkus et al., 2008.</p><p>12) In Figure 1, there is an intriguing dip in the % polyploidy after day 21 in males and day 28 in females. What are the authors' thoughts about this? Could the initial wave of polyploidization result in death and then be followed by a wave of polyploidization that results in persistent, stress-resistant cells?</p><p>13) In Figure 3, the # of double-labeled cells from early flp significantly increases from Day 1 to Day 14 – doesn't this suggest there is some cell fusion? Also, image B' is from a 30 day animal, while the quantitation in C is from 14-day animals. What does the quantitation look like at 30 days? Does the number of yellow cells increase further?</p><p>14) For the data presented in Figure 4, the labeling of 300 cells/optic lobe is impressive. However, if there are ~20,000 cells/optic lobe, then the 300 cells would be only ~1-2% of the total, not the estimated 25% that you measure as &gt;4N. Can you explain the discrepancy? (BTW, we think lineage tracing methods such as Permatwin under-report dividing cells in the adult brain).</p><p>15) For Figure 6, it would be interesting to pulse the flies with paraquat, then chase a few days without paraquat before assessing ploidy. What if the polyploid cells are en route to dying? This seems unlikely for UV irradiated flies, b/c the irradiation was done 5 days prior to dissection. However, in Figure 5D, the fact that the control and paraquat-treated lines cross at 21 days seems to support the idea that some of the polyploid cells in the paraquat-treated animals die and/or divide. Please comment.</p><p>16) In Figure 6—figure supplement 1. It appears that pH2AV levels are elevated in all neurons in the paraquat treated brains. However, only a fraction of these die. Why might this be?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.54385.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The study is entirely based on ploidy detection by FACS using a custom assay to measure DNA content; however, this assay has not been benchmarked to determine its sensitivity and specificity.

We found this to be impossible using high resolution confocal microscopy, due to constitutive somatic homologue pairing (Joyce et al., 2012; McKee, 2004; Metz, 1916; Stevens, 1908). We therefore attempted to resolve homologues using STORM super-resolution microscopy and large FISH probes (~10kb). However we could not image deeper than the most superficial layer of cells using STORM. Despite several months of work, we were ultimately unable to apply FISH to conclusively resolve chromosome copy number in adult brains.</p><p>Image-based quantification of Dapi nuclear intensity is another common way to measure ploidy in tissues, but this is most accurate in flat epithelial tissues, where individual nuclei can be resolved and segmented for intensity measurements. This was extremely challenging in the adult brain, where many cells are closely overlapping in all three dimensions. However we agree confirming polyploidy with another method is an important issue, so we revisited this approach. This time we used nuclear lamin staining and nuclear Coin-FLP labeling to aid in manually resolving individual nuclei for Dapi measurements. In this revision, we present new high magnification confocal images of optic lobes from CoinFLP “late-FLP” animals where we induced labelling 24h prior to dissection and labeling with anti-lamin and Dapi. We used the lamin staining to mark nuclear boundaries and Dapi intensity to measure ploidy (normalized integrated intensity). We manually measured over 100 cells and found that the CoinFLP double positive or “yellow” cells always have a greater than diploid DNA content. This also agrees with new FACS data we have added on CoinFLP cells to address point #3. However it should be clarified that due to the stochastic nature of CoinFLP labeling, polyploid cells can also be single-labeled (e.g. green/green or red/red) or unlabeled (did not flip), which are also included in our ploidy measurements (Described in detail in point #14). This new data can be found in Figure 4—figure supplements 1 and 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The animals analyzed in this study are 1 week increment up to 8 weeks; the age related increased in polyploidy begins at 7 days and continues to accumulate up to 21 days (week 3) after which reaches a plateau.

We do agree that 7day animals cannot be considered “old” and we have changed the Abstract to read “in the adult brain” instead of “in the ageing brain”. We have also made a much clearer distinction in this revision about polyploidy in the early adult vs. aged brains (see Results section, Figure 6 and Discussion). Our RNA sequencing shows that 7day old optic lobes already exhibit a DNA damage-associated gene expression signature (Figure 5—figure supplement 1), suggesting that even early adult animals are coping with accumulating DNA damage and this is an issue we discuss further in this revision. This is similar to defects in proteostasis associated with aging that are already detectable during early adulthood, as described for <italic>C. elegans</italic> (Morimoto, 2020)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The COINFLP system applied to demonstrate that cells reenter the cell cycle shows correlative data; green, red and yellow cells should be FACS enriched to measure the frequency of polyploid cells in the yellow fraction.

To address this we have performed additional FACS and have added a supplemental figure showing &gt;97% of all CoinFLP double-labelled cells display &gt;2C DNA content (Figure 4—figure supplement 2). We also provide verification of these FACS results with direct DAPI intensity measurements from confocal images (please see response to point #1 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1).</p><p>With regard to the knockdown experiments, we apologise for the lack of clarity. The changes in ploidy for the cdc6 and geminin experiments were measured by flow cytometry, not CoinFLP. We knocked down the respective genes in neurons (which are ~90% of cells in the brain) using the driver nSybGAL4 and measured changes in the % of cells showing &gt;2C DNA content by flow cytometry. (Figure 4G) We have clarified this in the figure legend as well as the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The RNA seq data have not been validated, and again show correlative results.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for encouraging us to provide additional information on the RNAseq dataset to strengthen the paper. There are two commonly used types of validation, 1. Comparison to an external dataset to verify sample quality/comparisons and 2. Individual gene fold-change confirmation by another method – most commonly qRT-PCR. Over the past 3 years we have anecdotally found that qRT-PCR is actually less reproducible and accurate for measuring gene expression across 3-6 biological replicates than RNAseq (e.g. data within (Flegel et al., 2016) ). This has been explored more thoroughly by others, which have also come to the conclusion that RNAseq with 3 or more replicates is more reproducible and accurate to measure gene expression change than qRT-PCR, especially when no accurate, unchanged reference gene is available for normalization, as is the case for brain aging. (See for examples: (Griffith et al., 2010;Pombo et al., 2017;Zhang et al., 2019)) We therefore focused on ensuring the accuracy of our comparisons by using external datasets to confirm that our RNAseq correctly identifies previously published age-specific gene expression changes, region-specific expression and sex-specific gene expression patterns. See new Figure 5—figure supplement 2 and Supplementary file 3 and references therein.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) There are three main part to the model presented.</p><p>a) DNA damage accumulating with age.

We have also included more and higher resolution images of CoinFLP labeled cells in Figure 4—figure supplement 1. Please note that ELAV immmuno-fluorescence in older brains does not look as strongly nuclear as in young brains and appears as subnuclear puncta. This has also been observed in work from other labs studying the fly brain at ages beyond 1 week. (Frost et al., 2016).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) &quot;Exogenous&quot; DNA damage leading to increased polyploidy.

However we received the reviewers comments a few weeks before our research operations shut down due to COVID-19. Our lab has only partially re-opened under a part-time shift schedule as of July 1st and we have finally acquired several lines to attempt to address this issue. These lines include UAS-Prp19 from Dr.Thomas Flatt’s lab, and other lines from various stock centers to knock down key players in the DNA damage response that show changes with age such as <italic>Irbp, Ku80, xrp1, rad51b, lig3, mus308</italic> and <italic>xpd</italic>. We plan to knock these factors down in neurons as well as glia to interrogate which DNA damage pathways may play a role in inducing polyploidy. Since these experiments require 1-3 week age adult animals, we have written to the editor that a realistic timeline for these experiments is an additional 2-3 months. We would like to propose to perform these experiments and submit our findings as a preprint linked to this manuscript. We suspect DNA damage leads to increased polyploidy non-autonomously, however at this time we cannot rule out cell-autonomous effects. In this revision we also provide additional data addressing this issue (see response to point 5C and response to point #9).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Polyploidy protecting from cell death. We think this idea is founded in the literature from other cell types, and thus it is a reasonable hypothesis in the fly brain.

Using such an approach would allow the authors to link the proportion of cells that are polyploid to the total number of cells and thus directly show that polyploidy protects the cells from DNA damage-induced cell death.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for suggesting this experiment. Using a driver for SPG may not be ideal because the SPGs become polyploid very early in development, and their endocycles and endomitoses are critical for the growth of the brain in the larval stages (Unhavaithaya and Orr-Weaver, 2012). Since these cells will already be highly polyploid at eclosion, we will not be able to manipulate their ploidy specifically in the adult brain. We would instead like to manipulate the ploidy of a cell type that is diploid during development and becomes polyploid specifically in the adult, such as the glia of the optic chiasm. We have finally obtained lines to allow us to manipulate ploidy in these cells, and we propose to include our findings in a preprint linked to this manuscript.</p><p>We have also added new data that addresses this question in another way. To show that polyploid cells are protected from cell death induced by DNA damage, we performed an experiment similar to that shown in Figure 6G. We induced DNA damage in flies 21d old (a time when the OL shows high levels of polyploidy). We then performed a timecourse to identify the window where cells show high levels of death in response to UV. We see very high levels of cell death (&gt;15% of cells incorporate PI) 24h post UV exposure. When we measured the ploidy of the dying cells, we see that while ~24% of diploid cells undergo cell death, only ~3% of the polyploid cells do. This much more convincingly shows that polyploid cells are protected from DNA damageinduced cell death. This data is now included in Figure 6.</p><p>With regards to pooling brains, we understand that it does not give us information about individual brains, but since the proportion of polyploid cells that are dying are so low, we needed to pool brains to ensure that our statistics are robust.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) A criticism of the work as presented is that the vast majority of the polyploid cells are tetraploid, yet the authors do not address the possibility that these cells simply have replicated their DNA prior to dividing (i.e. are transiently polyploid) as versus remaining indefinitely polyploid. Earlier work from other laboratories suggests that this unlikely, and the manuscript would be improved by a discussion of the possibilities.</p></disp-quote><p>We have considered the possibility that the cells with 4C DNA content are simply in G2 and poised to undergo mitosis. However, we have stained for PH3 to look for mitosis in nearly 100 adult brains at different ages and have never observed a convincing mitotic event. We have also stained for G2 markers (e.g. CycA protein) many times at many ages and we have never resolved any convincing, reproducible staining. Importantly, most of the polyploid cells are neurons. We know from other experiments in the developing brain that pushing a neuron into mitosis is catastrophic and results in neuronal death. It is possible that a low level of mitoses occur that we have missed due to rapid cell death. We address this further in the revised Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors state that up to 20% of the cells in the optic lobes are polyploid.

During the original manuscript drafting we considered the possibility that polyploid cells accumulate DNA damage without dying, and therefore may over time, ultimately acquire more DBSs than diploid cells thereby biasing the pH2Av staining pattern. To test whether this is true, we measured pH2Av fluorescence and Dapi integrated intensity to examine the correlation of ploidy and number of DSBs. We found no correlation between ploidy and pH2Av staining (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>), so we have removed this comment.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-54385-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Also, the authors state “We see an upregulation of cell cycle-associated genes specifically in the optic lobes with age.

We have included this citation in our Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) In Figure 1, there is an intriguing dip in the % polyploidy after day 21 in males and day 28 in females. What are the authors' thoughts about this? Could the initial wave of polyploidization result in death and then be followed by a wave of polyploidization that results in persistent, stress-resistant cells?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point. We looked closely and we do not observe any significant difference in cell death between 21 and 28 days in males or 28 and 35 days in females (Figure 6). In both cases, most of the cells that die are diploid, so we do not have evidence for a wave of cell death eliminating polyploid cells. Although it is possible that it is transient and rapid, and therefore missed in our timecourse.</p><p>Another possibility is that there is a wave of mitosis, reducing tetraploid cells to diploid. We have examined this time window for mitoses using PH3 staining and have never observed any mitoses at this age. However, it is again possible that we have missed a transient wave of mitosis. If this is the case, we would expect higher ploidies (e.g. above tetraploid) to remain or increase, while tetraploid cells decrease. We examined the data more carefully to see if this occurs. When we look at male or female Canton-S after 28 days we see both tetraploid and &gt;4N cells dip, suggesting the dip in polyploidy cannot be solely explained by a wave of mitosis resolving tetraploid cells (Figure 1D shows data for males). We do not have an explanation for this dip after 28 days, but a more detailed analysis of alternative modes of cell division or a finer timecourse analysis of cell death at these ages is needed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) In Figure 3, the # of double-labeled cells from early flp significantly increases from Day 1 to Day 14 – doesn't this suggest there is some cell fusion? Also, image B' is from a 30 day animal, while the quantitation in C is from 14-day animals. What does the quantitation look like at 30 days? Does the number of yellow cells increase further?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. Although we believe the majority of these yellow cells from the early flip are sub-perineurial glia we do not rule out a very low level of cell fusion. However, the level of fusion does not account for the vast majority of the polyploid cells we observe in later stages. We have changed our language to clarify this point.</p><p>The representative image in Figure 4B shows CoinFLP “late-FLP” labelled OLs from 30 days from the original CoinFLP lines which express membrane tagged UAS-RFP and LexA<sub>op</sub>-GFP. The membrane GFP and RFP posed two issues for quantifications; 1. We encountered membrane staining that was difficult to discern due to cell wrapping and 2. Like (Bosch et al., 2015) we observed unequal labeling, leading to far more LexA<sub>op</sub> labelled cells than GAL4 labelled cells, resulting in far fewer RFP positive cells, compounded by the RFP signal being weaker than the GFP fluorescence. To overcome this, we generated a fly line in our lab that had nuclear-localized fluorescent proteins for better identification of polyploid nuclei and switched the colors of the lexA and Gal4 expressing cells (LexA<sub>op</sub>-RFP<sub>nls</sub> and UAS-GFP<sub>nls</sub>). This greatly improved our ability to resolve double labeled cells (Fiugre 5—figure supplement 1). We performed our quantification in 14 day animals because older brains frequently have aggregates of fluorescent proteins that show up as puncta in images (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>). We think this is because RFP accumulation over time eventually becomes toxic to cells. We have performed flow cytometry on 21d Coin-FLP labeled optic lobes and indeed we see an increase of polyploid, double-labeled CoinFLP cells from 4.4% (14d) to 7% (21d). We did not include this data since we only had one replicate and we have not performed additional quantifications at later ages due to the lab Covid-19 shut down.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-54385-resp-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) For the data presented in Figure 4, the labeling of 300 cells/optic lobe is impressive.

We do agree that the number of 300 per lobe is lower than expected and we think that this is, in part, because we were very conservative in our quantification and identification of double labelled cells in images. However, the numbers actually are roughly in line with what we observe via imaging and flow cytometry when the stochastic nature and biases of CoinFLP labeling are taken into account.</p><p>Here is a sample calculation to explain: If we assume 100% of cells “flip” to label with CoinFLP (which we know based on FACS and imaging we are not approaching 100%) the flipping of LexA (red) : GAL4 (green) ratio is biased 4:1 (Bosch et al., 2015). Thus if flipping is complete, we would expect 80% of diploid cells to label red and ~20% to label green. If (for simplicity) we assume that all the polyploid cells are tetraploid, and that 20% of the cells in the OL (20% of 30,000 = 6000 cells) are tetraploid, 4% of all polyploid cells will label green/green (probability of green is 0.2 therefore 0.2* 0.2=0.04*100), 64% red/red (probability of red is 0.8 thus, 0.8*0.8=0.64*100) and 32% will label green/red or red/green and appear yellow or “double-labelled”. The expectation would be then, that 1,920 cells will label yellow per optic lobe under complete 100% flipping conditions. However, as mentioned above, with our heat-shock protocol we do not label 100% of cells. The amount of flipping is variable from animal to animal and we estimate that in our samples with the lowest flipping we flip about ⅓ of cells and with our strongest flipping we label about ¾ cells. If we label ~50% of cells, we would expect about 900 yellow cells per optic lobe, which is much closer to what we observe for CoinFLP by FACS and in our imaging (Fiugre 5—figure supplement 1 and 2). We have tabulated some of these numbers comparing CoinFLP quantification by imaging and by FACS in <xref ref-type="table" rid="resptable1">Author response table 1</xref> to clarify.</p><table-wrap id="resptable1" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>Expected theoretical <break/>outcome (100% <break/>flipping)</th><th>Expected theoretical outcome (70% <break/>flipping)</th><th>Expected theoretical <break/>outcome (50% <break/>flipping)</th><th>Actual outcome from <break/>imaging and manual <break/>counting</th><th>Actual outcome measured <break/>by flow cytometry (~70% <break/>labelled)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Diploid cells flipping red</td><td>80%</td><td>56%</td><td>40%</td><td>ND</td><td>54.3%</td></tr><tr><td>Diploid cells flipping green</td><td>20%</td><td>14%</td><td>10%</td><td>ND</td><td>11.9%</td></tr><tr><td>Ratio of red:green</td><td>4:1</td><td>4:1</td><td>4:1</td><td>ND</td><td>4.6:1</td></tr><tr><td>% double labelled <break/>nuclei per OL</td><td>6.4%</td><td>4.48%</td><td>3.2%</td><td>1-2%</td><td>4.4%</td></tr><tr><td>“Yellow” <break/>cells per OL</td><td>1,920</td><td>1,344</td><td>960</td><td>~317</td><td>1,320</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) For Figure 6, it would be interesting to pulse the flies with paraquat, then chase a few days without paraquat before assessing ploidy. What if the polyploid cells are en route to dying? This seems unlikely for UV irradiated flies, b/c the irradiation was done 5 days prior to dissection. However, in Figure 5D, the fact that the control and paraquat-treated lines cross at 21 days seems to support the idea that some of the polyploid cells in the paraquat-treated animals die and/or divide. Please comment.</p></disp-quote><p>This would be an interesting experiment to perform because we think that the animals cultured on low dose of PQ for an extended period of time may be exhibiting adaptations to chronic oxidative stress. In Figure 6D, we do observe a slightly lower % of polyploidy at 21d than at 14d, but this is not statistically significantly different from either of those two timepoints. We interpret the results of this experiment as flies treated with PQ reaching “peak” polyploidy levels earlier than their untreated counterparts (at 7d instead of 21 or 28). We also see (Figure 6—figure supplement 1) that there is no significant difference in % of cell death between control and PQ treated animals. However, in all time points (21d shown below), most of the dying cells are diploid.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) In Figure 6—figure supplement 1. It appears that pH2AV levels are elevated in all neurons in the paraquat treated brains. However, only a fraction of these die. Why might this be?</p></disp-quote><p>This is in interesting observation and there are two parts to address. The first is specific to our paraquat treatment. The dose is intentionally low to mimic chronic oxidative stress with age and this might be inducing a low “below threshold” level of DNA damage in neurons. The second part to address is that this is widely observed with DNA damage – where damage occurs in many cells, but only some cells of a tissue die while others can be protected from death, despite sustaining high levels of DNA damage. Work from other labs has shown that not all the cells exposed to DNA damage undergo cell death and that various factors such as cell type, cell signaling etc. can influence this (Jaklevic and Su, 2004; Verghese and Su, 2017). Finally, recent work from the Abrams lab (DOI: 10.1091/mbc.E18-12-0791) has shown that high levels of DNA damage to the postmitotic adult fly brain does not induce cell death with the canonical kinetics established in embryos or wings. Our data also agrees with this and instead of death at 1-8h post damage (which they examine) we observe very delayed kinetics (16-24h post damage, see new data in Figure 6) with death resolving after 24h, despite high levels of DNA damage persisting. The Abrams work attributes this lack of cell death to noncanonical functions of p53 in the adult brain (which undoubtedly is true), but here we show there actually is an acute death response in the adult brain, at time later than what they examined. We believe this response is likely p53independent. There is a whole area of work to be done here to resolve how postmitotic tissues signal and cope with DNA damage, which we hope to pursue in the future.</p></body></sub-article></article>
