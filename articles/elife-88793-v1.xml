Here, we use iterative laboratory evolution to generate several distinct autotrophic strains. Utilising this genetic diversity, we identify that just three mutations are sufficient for <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> to grow autotrophically, when introduced alongside non-native energy (formate dehydrogenase) and carbon-fixing (RuBisCO, phosphoribulokinase, carbonic anhydrase) modules. The mutated genes are involved in glycolysis (<italic>pgi</italic>), central-carbon regulation (<italic>crp</italic>), and RNA transcription (<italic>rpoB</italic>). The <italic>pgi</italic> mutation reduces the enzyme’s activity, thereby stabilising the carbon-fixing cycle by capping a major branching flux. For the other two mutations, we observe down-regulation of several metabolic pathways and increased expression of native genes associated with the carbon-fixing module (<italic>rpiB</italic>) and the energy module (<italic>fdoGH</italic>), as well as an increased ratio of NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> - the cycle’s electron-donor. This study demonstrates the malleability of metabolism and its capacity to switch trophic modes using only a small number of genetic changes and could facilitate transforming other heterotrophic organisms into autotrophs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>synthetic autotrophy</kwd><kwd>metabolic rewiring</kwd><kwd>carbon fixation</kwd><kwd>sustainability</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EXC 2124</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pahl</surname><given-names>Vanessa</given-names></name><name><surname>Link</surname><given-names>Hannes</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Mary and Tom Beck Canadian Center for Alternative Energy Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Milo</surname><given-names>Ron</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Schwartz-Reisman Collaborative Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Milo</surname><given-names>Ron</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ullmann Family Foundation and the Yotam Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Milo</surname><given-names>Ron</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Sustainability and Energy Weizmann Doctoral Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ben Nissan</surname><given-names>Roee</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ariane de Rothschild Women Doctoral Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Milshtein</surname><given-names>Eliya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Cluster of Excellence EXC 2124 from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Link</surname><given-names>Hannes</given-names></name><name><surname>Pahl</surname><given-names>Vanessa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Achieving autotrophy in <italic>E. coli</italic> by introducing a small number of genetic changes crosses a milestone in engineering major metabolic transitions and paves a way for sustainable bio-production from CO<sub>2</sub>.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Anthropogenic interference and intensive burning of fossil fuels releases large amounts of sequestered carbon in the form of CO<sub>2</sub>, a main driver of climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Olofsson and Hickler, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Friedlingstein et al., 2022</xref>). Direct air carbon capture, by any means, is urgently needed to help reduce emissions. Here, we focus on biology-based carbon fixation as a potential avenue for CO<sub>2</sub> capture, which has been shown to be a potentially efficient production platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leger et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Van Peteghem et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schwander et al., 2016</xref>). Specifically, we suggest using microbes for CO<sub>2</sub> valorization and produce a diverse repertoire of products including food, fuel, bio-plastics or other commodities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Claassens et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gleizer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nielsen and Keasling, 2016</xref>). Natural autotrophs already metabolise CO<sub>2</sub> efficiently, yet most are challenging to cultivate and manipulate genetically compared to heterotrophic model organisms like <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Here, we explore an emerging alternative approach – converting heterotrophic model organisms into tractable autotrophs for bio-production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gleizer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Baumschabl et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gassler et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gleizer et al., 2019</xref>). In addition to promising engineering applications, studying the transition from heterotrophic to autotrophic metabolism can uncover fundamental principles about the structure and regulation of carbon fixation metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gleizer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gassler et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Antonovsky et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barenholz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flamholz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Herz et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Recently, with the increasing interest in platforms for sustainable production, synthetic biologists have been able to successfully manipulate different organisms to enable major metabolic transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gassler et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gleizer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Keller et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Satanowski et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yishai et al., 2018</xref>). These efforts resulted in the successful introduction of non-native C1 utilisation pathways, and even included successful transitions from heterotrophic into completely autotrophic metabolisms in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gleizer et al., 2019</xref>) and yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gassler et al., 2020</xref>). These previous studies introduced the reductive pentose phosphate (rPP) cycle, the most prominent carbon fixation pathway in nature (also known as the Calvin-Benson cycle), into <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>E. coli</italic>) and <italic>Komagataella phaffii</italic> (previously <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic>). Indeed, we showed that <italic>E. coli</italic> was able to utilise the rPP cycle for the synthesis of all biomass carbon - thus converting it from a heterotroph to an autotroph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gleizer et al., 2019</xref>). However, this transition required continuous culture in selective conditions for several months (adaptive lab evolution) and resulted in many uninterpretable mutations, exposing a large knowledge gap.</p><p>Using adaptive lab evolution presents a challenge as it is hard to isolate the changes necessary for a given phenotype from the overall set of accumulated mutations. Here, we aimed to characterise the landscape of mutations required for autotrophic growth. Studying mutations that arise in multiple lineages can help us better understand the biological basis for the heterotroph-to-autotroph transition. To achieve this goal, we created a pipeline that enabled us to distinguish mutations essential for autotrophy from unspecific low-frequency mutations, that is ones that are generally promoted by the physiological conditions in evolution experiments. The final outcome of this pipeline is a compact essential set of changes permitting autotrophy in <italic>E. coli</italic>. We then proceeded with further analyses to shed light on the mechanism behind this compact set of essential mutations. We show the phenotype included a change in the activity of a central carbon metabolism enzyme and intracellular changes of the non-native carbon fixation cycle’s metabolite and co-factors pools. We conclude by speculating about the role of these metabolic changes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A compact set of mutations that enable autotrophic growth was identified using rational design, iterative lab evolution and genetic engineering</title><p>Adaptive lab evolution is an effective tool that enables integration of non-native metabolic pathways. In order to harness the power of adaptive lab evolution, a selection system must be implemented to direct the evolution towards the desired function. In our case, the selection for the activity of the non-native rPP cycle. To ensure that some level of carbon fixation by RuBisCO becomes essential for growth, we knocked out phosphofructokinase (<italic>pfkA</italic> and <italic>pfkB</italic>), and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (<italic>zwf</italic>) which creates a stoichiometric imbalance and growth arrest when growing on five-carbon sugars such as xylose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gleizer et al., 2019</xref>). This imbalance could be rescued by a metabolic bypass - the phosphorylation of ribulose-5-P by Prk and the subsequent carboxylation by RuBisCO, thereby coupling growth to the heterologously expressed rPP enzymes. Critically, this setup allowed us to evolve <italic>E. coli</italic>, a natural heterotroph, into an autotroph, using a non-native rPP cycle to utilise CO<sub>2</sub> as a sole carbon-source. This system also requires formate dehydrogenase to oxidise formate for energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gleizer et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Although adaptive lab evolution is a powerful tool, it also presents a challenge - once a new phenotype has been achieved, it is hard to separate the essential changes required for its appearance from the overall set of accumulated mutations. In many cases, mutations occur on the background of highly adaptive ones, leading to a spread of neutral ‘hitchhiker’ mutations in the population. In other cases, mutations that appeared at the beginning of the evolution are no longer needed for the final phenotype. Our goal was to find a set of mutations that, if introduced into a heterotrophic wild type <italic>E. coli</italic>, would result in the successful integration of the non-native carbon fixation and energy modules. This would enable autotrophic growth based solely on genetic engineering without the need for further evolutionary adaptation and potentially uncovering the mechanism behind this metabolic transition.</p><p>To isolate the essential genetic changes, we used a workflow that included three main stages as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. (A) rational design - introduction of required heterologous genes and metabolic knockouts to enforce RuBisCO-dependent growth; (B) adaptive lab evolution -revealing mutation candidates by growing the designed strain in autotrophic-selecting conditions over many generations until an autotrophic phenotype is obtained; (C) evolution-inspired genetic engineering - introducing the most promising mutations revealed in stage B into the designed strain and testing it for autotrophic growth. Stages B and C were repeated until no further evolution was required, that is the designed strain in stage C had an autotrophic phenotype.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Autotrophic phenotype achieved by introducing 3 mutations on top of a rationally designed ancestor.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) We rationally designed the ‘wild-type’ <italic>E. coli</italic> background strain (BW25113, depicted as a black bacterium) by introducing 4 enzymes: RuBisCO (<italic>cbbM</italic>), phosphoribulokinase (<italic>prkA</italic>), carbonic anhydrase (<italic>CA</italic>) and formate dehydrogenase (<italic>fdh</italic>), and 3 genomic knockouts: glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (<italic>zwf</italic>) and phosphofructokinase A&amp;B (<italic>pfkAB</italic>). We denote the resulting strain as ‘Ancestor’ (brown bacterium). (<bold>B</bold>) We tested the resulting strain for autotrophic growth and, since it didn't grow, we used it for adaptive lab evolution in xylose-limited chemostats - that is, conditions that select for higher carbon fixation flux. Altogether, we were able to isolate three evolved clones (two distinct strains from one chemostat experiment, Evolved I and II, and another strain from a second experiment, Evolved III, step B1). (<bold>C</bold>) Out of four consensus mutations that we identified, two - <italic>rpoB</italic> and <italic>pgi</italic> - were incorporated into the ancestor, giving ‘Ancestor 2.0’ (light blue bacterium, step C1). Once more, we tested for autotrophic growth and were unsuccessful. Therefore, we initiated another round of adaptive lab evolution experiments using Ancestor 2.0 growing in two xylose limited chemostats and isolated two evolved clones (one from each chemostat, step B2). The two clones shared a single consensus mutation, in <italic>crp</italic>. We thus created a new strain from Ancestor 2.0 by introducing the <italic>crp</italic> mutation into it (blue bacterium, step C2). This strain could grow autotrophically and thus we achieved a compact autotrophic strain.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-88793-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>To find the most promising mutations in stage B, we applied at least one of two criteria: mutations in genes that occur repeatedly in different autotrophic lineages (but are uncommon in other adaptive lab evolution experiments) or mutations that when reverted, result in a loss of phenotype. We discovered these ‘consensus’ mutations by sequencing isolated autotrophic clones, obtained from repeated adaptive lab evolution experiments - similar to the conditions we used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gleizer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; steps B1, B2.</p><p>In practice, we inoculated the strain denoted as ‘Ancestor’ into a chemostat with limited xylose and excess formate. After ≈3 months (≈60 chemostat generations) we isolated from the chemostat a clone able to grow under autotrophic conditions (methods), and compared its mutation set to those of two previously evolved autotrophic clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gleizer et al., 2019</xref>). The intersection of the three clones contained four genes that were mutated in all autotrophic isolated clones: the central carbon metabolism enzyme phosphoglucoisomerase (<italic>pgi</italic>), the beta subunit of the RNA polymerase (<italic>rpoB</italic>), poly A polymerase (<italic>pcnB</italic>) and the MalT DNA-binding transcriptional activator (<italic>malT</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, step B1). <italic>rpoB, pcnB</italic> and <italic>malT</italic> are genes that are commonly mutated in adaptive lab evolution experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Phaneuf et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting that they have little relevance for autotrophic growth. Therefore, we chose to focus on the <italic>pgi</italic> mutation.</p><p>We introduced the H386Y <italic>pgi</italic> mutation into the rationally designed ancestor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, step C1), and the engineered strain was tested for growth in autotrophic conditions (Materials and methods). No growth was observed in those conditions, which meant that additional mutations were necessary in order to achieve autotrophy.</p><p>Genomic sequencing revealed that during the genetic manipulation for introducing the <italic>pgi</italic> mutation, another mutation in <italic>rpoB</italic> (A1245V) appeared in the genome. In parallel, reverting a variety of RNA polymerase mutations in other evolved strains back to their wild-type allele, showed that mutations in RNA polymerase are in fact essential to the phenotype. Therefore, despite the fact that it was unintentional, and different from the other <italic>rpoB</italic> mutations observed in the ALE experiments, we left the mutation in the genome and proceeded with this strain.</p><p>This strain, mutated in both <italic>pgi</italic> and <italic>rpoB</italic> (denoted ‘Ancestor 2.0’) was then used as the starting point for another round of evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, step B2). Since it had already contained two mutations that were likely to be relevant for the desired phenotype, we expected to observe evolved autotrophic strains after fewer generations, compared to the first round, and to find fewer mutations in them. Indeed, on two separate experiments, it took roughly 1 month until autotrophic growth was observed, as opposed to more than 90 days in previous attempts. Even though these strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, ‘Evolved 4’ and ‘Evolved 5’) both had multiple mutations, only one mutation was shared between these independent evolution experiments - a non-synonymous mutation in the cAMP receptor protein, <italic>crp</italic> (H22N). When we introduced this mutation to the ‘Ancestor 2.0’ background in the evolution-inspired genetic engineering stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, step C2), the strain was immediately able to grow under autotrophic conditions.</p><p>Since the RNA polymerase mutation was introduced into this strain (<italic>rpoB</italic> A1245V) as a byproduct of genetic engineering and never observed in the adaptive evolution experiments, we needed to verify its essentiality to the autotrophic phenotype. We found that a reversion of <italic>rpoB</italic> A1245V back to the wild-type allele causes a loss of the autotrophic phenotype. We therefore could conclude that three mutations (<italic>pgi</italic>*, <italic>crp</italic>*, and <italic>rpoB</italic>*) are sufficient to facilitate the autotrophic phenotype on top of the heterotrophic ancestor background. We denote the final engineered autotrophic <italic>E. coli</italic> strain, the ‘Compact autotrophic <italic>E. coli</italic>’.</p><p>We verified the genotype using whole genome sequencing (Materials and methods). The results included the rationally designed knockouts (Δ<italic>pfkA,</italic> Δ<italic>pfkB</italic>, Δ<italic>zwf</italic>), heterologous plasmids (energy and carbon-fixing modules) and the three introduced mutations (<italic>pgi</italic>*, <italic>crp</italic>*, and <italic>rpoB</italic>*). During the genetic engineering process, two additional mutations occurred unintentionally in the genes <italic>uhpT</italic> and <italic>yejG. uhpT</italic> is a hexose transporter and is unlikely to have any effect on the autotrophic phenotype, especially because the mutation was an early stop codon (Q7*) and likely a loss of function. As the function of <italic>yejG</italic> is unknown, we wanted to ensure that it is not essential to the autotrophic phenotype. Therefore, we reverted the mutation back to its wild-type allele and found that indeed the cells were still autotrophic.</p><p>Thus, we constructed a new autotrophic strain with three essential mutations (<italic>pgi</italic>, <italic>crp,</italic> and <italic>rpoB</italic>), which we denoted the <italic>compact</italic> strain.

Accordingly, wild type Pgi catalyses a reaction that is causing a strong efflux of F6P from the cycle, diminishing the regeneration of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) which is usually not needed in the native metabolism but is essential for the rPP autocatalytic activity. In the mutated version of Pgi the efflux capacity is diminished, which can stabilise the cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><p>Following the same logic, we can expect an increase in the F6P substrate metabolite pool due to reduced consumption by Pgi.

These genes were upregulated in both the evolved strain and in the strain with the <italic>crp</italic> H22N and <italic>rpoB A1245V</italic> double mutation (≈fivefold increase in both cases). The FDH-O enzyme complex takes part in the respiratory chain formed by formate dehydrogenase and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) reductase. Here, the transfer of electrons from formate to DMSO (via a quinone electron carrier) is coupled to the generation of a proton-motive force across the cytoplasmic membrane for energy formation.</p><p>Another observed upregulated protein was ribose-phosphate-isomerase B (<italic>rpiB</italic>), which was up-regulated in the evolved strain (&gt;40-fold increase) and in the double mutant ≈fivefold increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). <italic>rpiB</italic> is an inducible isoenzyme of the constitutively expressed ribose-phosphate-isomerase A, a core enzyme in the rPP cycle. This might serve as evidence for a higher flux requirement through the pentose-phosphate-pathway, supported by expressing a second isoenzyme. Other explanations may include some form of regulation, perhaps allosteric, inhibiting RpiA activity, making the strain dependent on RpiB activity, or non-specific enzymatic activity of RpiB which is required by the cell. The fourth up-regulated gene - <italic>ftsI</italic>, a peptidoglycan DD-transpeptidase - does not have a clear explanation at this time.</p><p>At the other end of the expression spectrum, several pathways were down-regulated in both the evolved and in the BW double mutant strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Down-regulation of the starvation response, metabolic and PTS component genes seems to be at the heart of the adaptation to autotrophic growth, with several operons experiencing &gt;fourfold decrease in expression. Most notably the <italic>gat</italic>, <italic>ara</italic> and <italic>man</italic> operons responsible for galactitol, arabinose and mannose degradation, respectively. Again, this is evident in both the evolved and the double mutant strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Other highly down-regulated metabolic pathways include amino acid biosynthesis, specifically valine and leucine, moreover we observed a down regulation in <italic>rspA and rspB</italic>, which encode for starvation sensing proteins. We suggest these results mean that many pathways usually up-regulated in <italic>E. coli</italic> during starvation may be redundant or even counter-productive in an autotrophic context, and decreasing their expression could result in increased fitness.</p><p>We additionally tested whether separating between the two regulatory mutations (<italic>crp</italic> and <italic>rpoB</italic>) might provide a clearer picture, for example if different up- or down-regulated genes are targeted by only one of these mutations and not the other. Therefore, we used single-mutant BW strains and compared them to the same BW wild-type as before. Essentially, the results did not change our conclusions and although in most cases the effect of the two mutations was cumulative, we did find at least one case where they were antagonistic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). For example, <italic>fdoG</italic> and <italic>fdoH</italic> showed a ≈fourfold <italic>decrease</italic> compared to wild type when the <italic>crp</italic> mutation was introduced, but (as stated earlier) had a ≈fivefold abundance <italic>increase</italic> in the double mutant, suggesting an epistatic effect between the <italic>rpoB</italic> and <italic>crp</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>).

The specific reason for the increase in final OD or lag time remains inconclusive at this point but we hypothesise that it is related to the increased expression of Fdo observed in the proteomic analysis. We also note that as the proteomics results suggest - the mutations in global transcriptional machinery like Crp and RpoB could have many other effects on the autotrophic phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Haverkorn van Rijsewijk et al., 2011</xref>) which await future exploration.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we demonstrated how iterative evolution and engineering were able to narrow down the genomic mutations required for autotrophy in <italic>E. coli</italic> from tens of mutations to only three mutated genes. The three mutated genes - <italic>pgi</italic>, <italic>crp</italic> and <italic>rpoB</italic> - serve as a compact set, which when introduced into a wild-type background and supplemented with the carbon-fixing and energy modules, achieve an autotrophic phenotype. By metabolic, proteomic and physiological characterisation we were able to distil some of the effects of these mutations and understand their role in facilitating the autotrophic phenotype. We suggest that the three main effects achieved by the autotrophy-enabling mutations are: (i) integrating the non-native carbon fixation cycle by enhancing flux within the cycle over outgoing flux; (ii) facilitating the integration of the energy module via decoupling of formate harvesting into energy and redox, thereby increasing the NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio, which could have both thermodynamic and kinetic benefits (iii) and freeing protein resources by decreasing unneeded expression.</p><p>The mutation in <italic>pgi</italic> affects the activity of its gene product phosphoglucoisomerase - a metabolic enzyme that catalyses a reaction that branches out of the non-native rPP cycle. The enzyme converts F6P (a cycle intermediate) to G6P (a precursor required for membrane biosynthesis). In a previous study, this mutation was found to be essential for the integration of the rPP autocatalytic cycle and was part of a minimal set for hemi-autotrophic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gleizer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gassler et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Antonovsky et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barenholz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flamholz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Herz et al., 2017</xref>). As our results suggest, the mutated enzyme shows a significant reduction in activity, which decreases the efflux from the rPP cycle to biosynthesis. We hypothesised that its role is to generate a new, higher, steady-state concentration for the rPP cycle metabolites, thus stabilising the cycle. This was supported by our observation that introducing a <italic>pgi</italic> mutation into a metabolically rewired RuBiCO-dependent strain resulted in increased concentration of rPP cycle intermediates. This exemplifies the key role branch-points play in autocatalytic cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gleizer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gassler et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Antonovsky et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barenholz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flamholz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Herz et al., 2017</xref>), making them a leading target for rational attempts to integrate non-native autocatalytic cycles into metabolism.</p><p>The remaining two mutations act as global regulators, which presents a challenge in distinguishing their specific adaptive impacts from their broader effects on cellular expression patterns. Using proteomic analyses, we have managed to identify certain genes that had a major change in expression when one of the regulating mutations was introduced, and when both were introduced together.</p><p>One main observation was the down-regulation of several metabolic pathways including catabolism of alternative carbon sources and amino acid biosynthesis. We suggest this is an adaptive role in improving cell resource allocation, and a means to modulate resource allocation, possibly freeing up proteome resources from alternative carbon metabolism proteins. This includes proteins such as PTS system components or ATP dependent transporters, that tend to incur high energetic costs.</p><p>Other reasons these catabolic and transport pathways may result in reduced fitness could include competition over metabolites with the rPP cycle, or by causing other metabolic blunders such as dead-end products with potential toxicity effects under the new flux regime. Another observed effect the <italic>crp</italic> mutation shows is the up-regulation of <italic>rpiB</italic>, a typically unexpressed isoenzyme to one of the reactions in the rPP cycle. This expression increase could be beneficial or even essential in a scenario where <italic>rpiA</italic>, the main enzyme catalysing this reaction, cannot support the flux required by the rPP cycle, for example due to kinetic capacity limitations or allosteric inhibition. Further work is needed to investigate if up-regulation of <italic>rpiB</italic> is indeed essential for the autotrophic phenotype.</p><p>We also suggest these mutations play a role in improving the utilisation of formate, which is supported by the up-regulation of <italic>fdoG &amp; fdoH.</italic> We found that a strain introduced with both the <italic>crp</italic> and <italic>rpoB</italic> mutations demonstrated a pronounced up-regulation of over 4-fold and also a concrete fitness advantage in growth conditions which include formate. Metabolomics analysis showed this strain also has a significant increase in the NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio. NADH is the essential cofactor for the electron transfer reaction of the non-native rPP cycle (catalysed by the D-glyceraldehyde-3P dehydrogenase GAPDH) and a product of the non-native formate-based energy module. The importance of this up-regulation is also supported by natural chemolithoautotrophic metabolism, which uses two distinct ways to harvest energy and reducing power from the electron-donor. For example, in the model chemolithoautotroph <italic>Cupriavidus necator</italic>, the oxidation of formate is catalysed by two distinct types of FDH: a soluble, NAD<sup>+</sup>-linked enzyme (S-FDH; EC <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://enzyme.expasy.org/EC/1.2.1.2">1.2.1.2</ext-link>) and a membrane-bound enzyme coupled directly to the respiratory chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Friedrich et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Oh and Bowien, 1998</xref>).</p><p>We suspect utilising formate dehydrogenase O (FDH-O) in the periplasm is enabling the cell to also utilise formate directly on the membrane to create a proton motive force for energy production without the need to exhaust the intracellular NADH pool, thus allowing for its accumulation. Increased levels of NADH creates favourable thermodynamics for the rPP cycle flux and could also offer improved kinetics. This result is in line with previous models, predicting that high cofactor levels are required for a stable metabolic state of the rPP cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Janasch et al., 2019</xref>). We suggest this observation offers an avenue for future rational design attempts.</p><p>We continue by hypothesising that such regulatory mutations are to be expected in adaptive laboratory evolution experiments, especially during selection for a major shift (novelty) in the phenotype. A major shift will often necessitate a modulation of the activity of many cellular components. Lab evolution is limited by population size and number of generations, which means it can only explore a small part of the genotypic space. Therefore, sets of three or more mutations, where each mutation on its own does not confer an advantage, have a negligible probability to occur. On the other hand, a single mutation in a global regulator could concurrently perturb the activity of hundreds of components and might be the only viable solution to capture several required changes simultaneously.</p><p>Another reported observation is how metabolic rewiring can serve as a ‘metabolic scaffold’ to direct lab evolution. Since scaffold mutations are put in place for the purposes of selection, they can be removed once the goal is achieved. A common limitation of lab evolution is its tendency to follow evolutionary trajectories which increase fitness by deactivating or losing the heterologously expressed genes, thereby arriving at ‘dead-end’ local optimum. A ‘metabolic scaffold’ as utilised here can block these dead-end trajectories by coupling a target activity (here RuBisCO carboxylation) to growth, thereby increasing the likelihood of trajectories that lead to the desired phenotype. Once the phenotype is achieved, removal of the metabolic scaffold should be possible since growth is by definition dependent on the non-native genes. Using metabolic growth-coupling as a temporary ‘metabolic scaffold’ that can be removed, could serve as a promising strategy for achieving minimally perturbed genotypes in future metabolic engineering attempts.</p><p>The approach presented here, of harnessing iterative lab evolution to find a compact set of essential mutations, strikingly shows the extreme malleability of metabolism and evolution’s capacity to switch trophic modes in laboratory time-scales with very few mutations. It can also serve as a promising pipeline for other genetic engineering attempts. Having a compact and well-defined genotype in a model organism allowed us to reveal metabolic adaptation steps needed for autotrophic growth, and could be used for future exploration of the design principles of the rPP cycle operation and its components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aigner et al., 2017</xref>). The harnessing and rationalisation of the lab evolution process and metabolic adaptation steps elucidated here could facilitate the introduction of the rPP cycle and other carbon fixation cycles into other organisms of interest. Next steps could include integrating metabolic bio-production modules and alternative energy sources. Now that synthetic autotrophy in <italic>E. coli</italic> can be achieved with only a few defined steps, it expands the playground for more labs to join the quest for sustainable bio-production from CO<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains</title><p>We generated an engineered ancestor strain for chemostat evolution based on the <italic>E. coli</italic> BW25113 strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grenier et al., 2014</xref>).

Genotyping was performed using Sanger sequencing.

The M9 pre-cultures were adjusted to a starting OD600 of 0.05 into 10 mL culture in 250 mL glass shake flasks. The flasks were placed inside an elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (10%) shaker-incubator (New Brunswick S41i CO<sub>2</sub> incubator shaker, Eppendorf, Germany) at 37 °C.</p><p>For NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> measurements: Single colonies were transferred into 10 mL M9 xylose streptomycin from fresh M9 xylose streptomycin plates, and cultivated for 24 hr while shaking at 37 °C. M9 pre-cultures were adjusted to a starting OD600 of 0.1 into 12-well plates, with 2 mL of medium in each well. Strains were cultivated in triplicates with or without formate (30 mM), added at the beginning of the culture. Optical density at 600 nm was monitored every 10 min using a plate reader (Tecan, Spark). Plates were then rapidly transferred to a thermostatically controlled hood at 37 °C and kept shaking during the sampling procedure.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Metabolomics measurements</title><p>Cultivations were performed as described above. Culture aliquots were vacuum-filtered on a 0.45 μm pore size filter (HVLP02500, Merck Millipore). Filters were immediately transferred into a 40:40:20 (v-%) acetonitrile/methanol/water extraction solution at –20 °C. Filters were incubated in the extraction solution for at least 30 min. Subsequently, metabolite extracts were centrifuged for 15 min at 13,000 rpm at –9 °C and the supernatant was stored at –80 °C until analysis. For measurements of NADH, NAD<sup>+</sup>, sedoheptulose-7P and the pool of pentose phosphates, extracts were mixed with a <sup>13</sup>C-labeled internal standard in a 1:1 ratio. LC-MS/MS analysis was performed with an Agilent 6495 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Donati et al., 2021</xref>). An Agilent 1290 Infinity II UHPLC system (Agilent Technologies) was used for liquid chromatography. Temperature of the column oven was 30 °C, and the injection volume was 3 μL. LC solvents in channel A were either water with 10 mM ammonium formate and 0.1% formic acid (v/v) (for acidic conditions, NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup>), or water with 10 mM ammonium carbonate and 0.2% ammonium hydroxide (for basic conditions, sedoheptulose-7P and pool of pentoses). LC solvents in channel B were either acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid (v/v) (for acidic conditions) or acetonitrile without additive (for basic conditions). LC columns were an Acquity BEH Amide (30x2.1 mm, 1.7 μm) for acidic conditions, and an iHILIC-Fusion(P) (50x2.1 mm, 5 μm) for basic conditions. The gradient for basic and acidic conditions was: 0 min 90% B; 1.3 min 40% B; 1.5 min 40% B; 1.7 min 90% B; 2 min 90% B. The ratio of <sup>12</sup>C and <sup>13</sup>C peak heights was used to quantify metabolites. <sup>12</sup>C/<sup>13</sup>C ratios were normalized to OD at the time point of sampling. For the measurements of intracellular glucose-6-P and fructose-6-P, metabolic extracts were 10 x concentrated using a vacuum evaporation (Eppendorf Concentrator plus) and resuspended in 40:40:20 (v-%) acetonitrile/methanol/water extraction solution. Temperature of the column oven was 30 °C, and the injection volume was 5 μL. LC solvent in channel A was water with 10 mM ammonium formate and 0.1% formic acid (v/v), and in channel B was acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid (v/v). The LC column was a Shodex HILICpak VG-50 2D (2.0x150 mm). The gradient was: 0 min 90% B;3min 30% B; 58 min 30% B; 61min 90% B;63 min 90% B. The <sup>12</sup>C peak heights were used to quantify metabolites. Retention time of hexose-phosphates were determined with authentic standards of glucose-6-P.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Chemostat proteomics experiment</title><p>The growth was conducted in a DASBox mini fermentation system (Eppendorf, Germany). The starting volume of each bioreactor was 150 ml M9 media supplemented with either 30 mM and 10 mM D-xylose for the evolved and ancestor samples or only 10 mM D-xylose for BW including compact set mutations and/or the deletions used for their insertions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The minimal media also included trace elements, vitamin B1 was omitted. In experiments including the evolved strain and the ancestor strain, the atmosphere had elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (10%), and the chemostat dilution rate was set to 0.03 h<sup>–1</sup> corresponding to a doubling time of 24 hr.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Proteomics analysis</title><p>The cell pellets were lysed and subjected to in-solution tryptic digestion using the S-Trap method (by Protifi). The resulting peptides were analyzed using nanoflow liquid chromatography (nanoAcquity) coupled to high resolution, high mass accuracy mass spectrometry (Thermo Q Excative HFX). Each sample was analyzed on the instrument separately in discovery mode in a random order. Raw data was processed with MaxQuant v1.6.6.0. The data was searched with the Andromeda search engine against the <italic>E. coli</italic> BW25113 (K12) protein database as downloaded from Uniprot, appended with the mutant protein sequences and common lab protein contaminants. Search parameters included the following modifications: Fixed modification- cysteine carbamidomethylation. Variable modifications- methionine oxidation, and asparagine and glutamine deamidation. The quantitative comparisons were calculated using Perseus v1.6.0.7. Decoy hits were filtered out and only proteins that were detected in at least 2 replicates of at least one experimental group were kept.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Data, materials, and software

Using two rounds of experimental evolution, the authors identify mutations in three genes - pgi, rpoB, and crp - that allow cells to metabolise CO<sub>2</sub> in their engineered strain background. The authors make a strong case that mutations in pgi are loss-of-function mutations that prevent metabolic efflux from the reductive pentose phosphate autocatalytic cycle. The authors also use proteomic analysis to probe the role of the mutations in crp and rpoB. While they do not reach strong conclusions about how these mutations promote autotrophic growth, they provide some clues, leading to valuable speculation.</p><p>Comments on revised version:</p><p>The authors have thoroughly addressed the reviewers' comments. The major addition to the paper is the proteomic analysis of single and double mutants of crp and rpoB. These new data provide clues as to the role of the crp and rpoB mutations in promoting autotrophic growth, which the authors discuss. The authors acknowledge that it will require additional experiments to determine whether the speculated mechanisms are correct. Nonetheless, the new data provide valuable new insight into the role of the crp and rpoB mutations. The authors have also expanded their description of the crp and rpoB mutations, making it clearer that the effects of these mutations are likely to be distinct, albeit with potential for overlap in function.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.88793.4.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author Response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ben Nissan</surname><given-names>Roee</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Weizmann Institute of Science</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Rehovot</named-content></addr-line><country>Israel</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Milshtein</surname><given-names>Eliya</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Weizmann Institute of Science</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Rehovot</named-content></addr-line><country>Israel</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Pahl</surname><given-names>Vanessa</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Tübingen</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Tübingen</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>de Pins</surname><given-names>Benoit</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Weizmann Institute of Science</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Rehovot</named-content></addr-line><country>Israel</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Jona</surname><given-names>Ghil</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Weizmann Institute of Science</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Rehovot</named-content></addr-line><country>Israel</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Levi</surname><given-names>Dikla</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Weizmann Institute of Science</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Rehovot</named-content></addr-line><country>Israel</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yung</surname><given-names>Hadas</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Weizmann Institute of Science</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Rehovot</named-content></addr-line><country>Israel</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Nir</surname><given-names>Noga</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Weizmann Institute of Science</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Rehovot</named-content></addr-line><country>Israel</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ezra</surname><given-names>Dolev</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Weizmann Institute of Science</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Rehovot</named-content></addr-line><country>Israel</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Gleizer</surname><given-names>Shmuel</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Weizmann Institute of Science</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Rehovot</named-content></addr-line><country>Israel</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Link</surname><given-names>Hannes</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Tübingen</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Tübingen</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Noor</surname><given-names>Elad</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Weizmann Institute of Science</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Rehovot</named-content></addr-line><country>Israel</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Milo</surname><given-names>Ron</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Weizmann Institute of Science</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Rehovot</named-content></addr-line><country>Israel</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p>The single-mutant and double-mutant crp/rpoB strains were made by co-transduction with a nearby gene deletion (kanR-marked). I couldn't tell from the methods section whether these mutants, e.g., crp-H22N delta-chiA, were compared to wild-type cells or deletion mutants, e.g., delta chiA, in the proteomics experiments. I encourage the authors to explain this more clearly in the methods section, and to briefly mention in the Results section and relevant figure legends that the crp/rpoB mutant strains (and possibly the &quot;wild-type&quot; strains) also have gene deletions. If the comparison &quot;wild-type&quot; strains are fully wild-type (i.e., not deleted for chiA/yjaH), it is especially important to mention this in the Results section and the figure legends since the phenotypic changes could be due to the gene deletions rather than the mutations in crp/rpoB</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate and agree with the editor's suggestion to clarify this point.</p><p>Accordingly, we have made the following changes to the text:</p><p>p11 L30-34 in the main text:</p><p>&quot;The second experiment similarly compared an engineered BW25113 (BW) strain, containing the two regulatory mutations from the compact set (i.e., crp H22N and rpoB A1245V) together with the deletions used to insert them (see methods and DataS1 file), to a “wild type” BW strain (a corresponding knockout strain without the mutations, see methods).&quot;</p><p>p28 under Chemostat proteomics experiment L13-16 in methods:</p><p>&quot;The starting volume of each bioreactor was 150 ml M9 media supplemented with either30 mM and 10mM D-xylose for the evolved and ancestor samples or only 10mMD-xylose for BW including compact set mutations and/or the deletions used for their insertions (DataS1 file).
