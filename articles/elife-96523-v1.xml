infertility in females of reproductive age. Despite its high prevalence, the molecular mechanisms underlying EM pathogenesis remain poorly understood. The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is known to influence several cardinal features of this complex disease including pain, vascularization, and overall lesion survival, but the exact mechanisms are not known. Utilizing CNR1 knockout (k/o), CNR2 k/o, and wild-type (WT) mouse models of EM, we reveal contributions of ECS and these receptors in disease initiation, progression, and immune modulation. Particularly, we identified EM-specific T cell dysfunction in the CNR2 k/o mouse model of EM. We also demonstrate the impact of decidualization-induced changes on ECS components, and the unique disease-associated transcriptional landscape of ECS components in EM. Imaging mass cytometry (IMC) analysis revealed distinct features of the microenvironment between CNR1, CNR2, and WT genotypes in the presence or absence of decidualization. This study, for the first time, provides an in-depth analysis of the involvement of the ECS in EM pathogenesis and lays the foundation for the development of novel therapeutic interventions to alleviate the burden of this debilitating condition.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>immunoregulation</kwd><kwd>knockout animals</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>cell proliferation</kwd><kwd>imaging mass cytometry</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>394340</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tayade</surname><given-names>Chandrakant</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cannabinoid receptors CNR1 and CNR2 play distinct roles in endometriosis pathogenesis, potentially contributing to disease initiation and progression through differential modulation of T cell function and the lesion microenvironment.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>EM is a chronic gynecological disorder characterized by the presence and growth of endometrial-like tissue outside the uterus, referred to as ectopic lesions. Despite its global impact on approximately 200 million individuals and the profound reduction in their quality of life, the exact origins of EM remain elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Giudice and Kao, 2004</xref>). Accumulating evidence, including our previous studies, highlights that components of the ECS are dysregulated within the EM lesion microenvironment as well as in the systemic circulation of EM patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lingegowda et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bilgic et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shen et al., 2019</xref>). The ECS is a complex signaling network comprised of canonical receptors (CNR1 and CNR2) and endocannabinoid (EC) ligands, along with a non-canonical extended signaling network of ligands and enzymes extensively reviewed elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Di Marzo et al., 2004</xref>). CNR1 and CNR2 are primarily expressed in nerve tissues, immune cells, and reproductive tissues, where they regulate various physiological processes, including pain perception, immune responses, and reproductive functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zou and Kumar, 2018</xref>). Consequently, EM pathogenesis has been postulated as a consequence of EC deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Russo, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lingegowda et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Even though the precise etiology of EM is not known, the widely accepted Sampson’s theory of retrograde menstruation suggests that EM lesions originate from refluxed, endometrial fragments deposited during menstruation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sampson, 1927</xref>. Both pregnancy and menstruation depend on spontaneous decidualization of endometrial stroma that is extensively remodeled under the influence of hormones, growth factors, and select cytokines that orchestrate immune cell recruitment and vascular adaptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gellersen and Brosens, 2014</xref>). There is clear evidence that EM patients have defects in eutopic endometrium, including differential expression of key endometrial receptivity markers such as leukemia inhibitory factor (<italic>LIF</italic>), protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (<italic>PRMT5</italic>), and homeobox protein hox-A10 (<italic>HOXA10</italic>), that have been associated with EM and subsequent infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cai et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tomassetti and D’Hooghe, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zutautas et al., 2023</xref>). Evidence also suggests that components of the ECS, including CNR1 and CNR2, are important in maintaining tissue integrity during decidualization and successful implantation of the embryo. Indeed, several reports indicate that mice lacking cannabinoid receptors, CNR1 and CNR2, displayed impaired implantation, increased pregnancy failure rates, heightened edema, and inadequate primary decidual zone formation, highlighting the crucial role of ECS signaling in successful decidualization, implantation, and pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sun et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In EM, CNR1 and CNR2 activation aids in controlling lesion proliferation, pain, and vascularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lingegowda et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Leconte et al., 2010</xref>). Keeping in view dysregulated ECS signaling and their central role in decidualization and fertility, we hypothesize that altered CNR1 and CNR2 expression will disrupt ECS signaling dynamics, leading to further lesion development. Furthermore, the involvement of ECS in modulating immune response and homeostasis, may disrupt the immune dynamics and foster lesion establishment.</p><p>We conducted a comprehensive investigation into the role of the dysregulated ECS in EM establishment and progression by utilizing CNR1 k/o and CNR2 k/o mouse models. To address the underlying causes of ECS dysfunction, we induced artificial decidualization in WT, CNR1 k/o, and CNR2 k/o mice and used the endometrial fragments from decidualized (DD) and undecidualized (UnD) uterine horns to induce EM in recipient mice of their respective genotypes. Furthermore, we explored the immunomodulatory potential of the ECS in EM, shedding light on how alterations in EC signaling may influence immune cell behavior within the localized peritoneal milieu in mice induced with EM. Our study contributes to the foundational knowledge around ECS dysregulation in EM and paves the way for potential therapeutic strategies targeting ECS for disease management.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ligands of the ECS are dysregulated in a mouse model of EM lacking CNR1 and CNR2 receptors</title><p>Based on our previous work demonstrating dysregulated ligands of the ECS in both patients and our mouse model of EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lingegowda et al., 2021b</xref>), we first evaluated whether the absence of CNR1 or CNR2 led to ECS ligand alterations. To do this, we performed targeted mass spectrometry on plasma and EM lesions obtained from CNR1 k/o, CNR2 k/o, and their WT controls. In these mice, EM was induced using UnD and DD tissues obtained from their respective strains into matched recipients (for example, UnD and DD from CNR1 k/o donor mice was implanted into CNR1 k/o recipient mice). We detected some of the major EC ligands such as, 2-Arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), N-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA), Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), and Oleoylethanolamide (OEA) in plasma and EM lesions from all genotypes. All identified ECS ligands are predominantly anti-inflammatory and the range of 2-AG, AEA, PEA, and OEA in the plasma and lesions were comparable to our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lingegowda et al., 2021b</xref>). In the plasma, we found no significant differences in ECS ligands across all groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–F</xref>), which could be due to the rapid homeostasis achieved in circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lu and Mackie, 2016</xref>). However, in the lesion microenvironment, we captured higher levels of several EC ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–J</xref>). In CNR1 k/o mice, significantly higher concentrations of OEA were observed in the DD compared to UnD lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>), and overall, was on average twofold higher compared to both lesions from WT and CNR2 k/o mice. 2-AG, which selectively binds to the CNR2 receptor was significantly higher in both the UnD and DD EM lesions from CNR2 k/o mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) compared to the CNR1 k/o counterparts. This could indicate a compensatory response in the absence of CNR2. Together, these findings provide insights into the potential dysregulation of ECS ligands in the absence of CNR1 and CNR2 and their involvement in the DD vs UnD scenario during EM lesions establishment.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Characterization of endocannabinoid ligands in a modified syngeneic mouse model of endometriosis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overview of the modified syngeneic mouse model of endometriosis (EM) where pseudo-pregnant wild-type (WT), CNR1 k/o, and CNR2 k/o mice were induced with decidualized (DD) by injecting sesame oil into the lumen of one uterine horn and the contralateral horn served as undecidualized (UnD) control.

Bulk RNA sequencing was performed on both UnD and DD lesions from WT, CNR1 k/o, and CNR2 k/o mice as detailed earlier to elucidate the molecular alterations associated with the disruption of these two-receptors signaling. Differential expression analysis revealed changes in gene expression profiles among the different genotypes and lesion types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). A total of 1100 and 639 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found in both UnD and DD lesions of CNR1 k/o and CNR2 k/o mice, respectively, compared to WT controls (UnD data is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). To gain insights into the biological implications of the observed gene expression changes, we conducted a Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis on the DEGs identified in UnD and DD lesions of CNR1 k/o and CNR2 k/o mice compared to WT mice. In the DD lesions from CNR1 k/o mice, KEGG pathway analysis revealed significant alterations in several pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Notably, the cell adhesion molecules pathway was prominently affected, indicating a potential role for CNR1 in mediating cell-cell interactions and tissue remodeling processes. Additionally, the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling emerged as another negatively impacted pathway, implicating CNR1 in modulating intracellular signaling cascades. In DD lesions from the CNR2 k/o mice, the analysis highlighted distinct pathways affected in the context of inflammation and EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) including the cytokine receptor interactions pathway, pointing to the involvement of CNR2 in immune responses and inflammatory processes associated with EM.

A total of 59 key genes in ECS signaling were selected, as identified in a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tanaka et al., 2022</xref>. Surprisingly, despite the central role of CNR1 and CNR2 in ECS signaling, we found a limited number of DEGs related to this system. Out of 59 genes directly associated with ECS, only 3 (<italic>Cnr1, Plch1,</italic> and <italic>Plch2</italic>) and 2 (<italic>Cnr2</italic> and <italic>Plag2ge</italic>) DEGs were identified in the DD lesions of CNR1 k/o (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and CNR2 k/o (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), respectively, compared to DD lesions from WT controls. This result suggests that CNR1 and CNR2 modulate the EM microenvironment through intricate interactions with other signaling pathways beyond the canonical ECS pathway. A comprehensive gene ontology (GO) classification analysis on the 59 identified ECS genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) unveiled their multifaceted roles in reproductive functions, immune system regulation, and cellular processes. The genes exhibited enrichment in molecular functions such as receptor activity and lipid binding. In terms of cellular components, these genes were associated with plasma membrane structures, and intracellular compartments, signifying their diverse subcellular localization and potential involvement in dynamic cellular processes. Furthermore, GO analysis highlighted their participation in biological processes such as immune response modulation, lipid metabolism, cell communication, and intracellular signaling pathways, indicating the broader impact of ECS beyond its canonical functions. The results of the UnD comparisons between the genotypes are provided in the supplementary data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). While the UnD lesions exhibited distinct gene expression patterns compared to DD lesions, common trends in the effects of CNR1 k/o and CNR2 k/o on gene expression were observed across both lesion types. Specifically, the cytokine receptor interaction, complement cascade, and inflammatory mediator pathways were significantly altered in the UnD lesions from CNR1 k/o and CNR2 k/o mice compared to UnD lesions from WT mice.

Notably, CNR1 k/o DD lesions exhibited 39 downregulated (e.g. <italic>Nlrp6</italic> and <italic>Il1a,</italic> pivotal regulators of inflammatory response) and 14 upregulated genes (e.g. <italic>Cxcl9</italic> and <italic>Cxcl10,</italic> chemokines involved in immune cell recruitment), while CNR2 k/o DD lesions showed 40 downregulated (e.g. <italic>Siglecg</italic> and <italic>Il6,</italic> involved in immune regulation and pro-inflammatory response) and 25 upregulated genes (e.g. <italic>C8a</italic>, <italic>C9,</italic> and <italic>Masp2</italic>, part of the complement system), highlighting substantial changes in gene expression associated with CNR1 and CNR2 disruption compared to the DD lesions from WT mice. Of particular interest, we observed significant downregulation of T cell-related genes (<italic>Cd3e</italic>, <italic>Cd3g</italic>, <italic>Gata3,</italic> and <italic>Ctla4</italic>) in the CNR2 k/o DD lesions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>), aligning with the CD3 + T cell dysfunction observed in the PF and spleen and further validations from in-vitro functional assay (mentioned below). However, we did not find the same differences (T cell-related genes) in the UnD lesions of CNR2 k/o mice. Moreover, UnD lesions of CNR2 k/o mice showed a significantly low number of DEGs (11 compared to 65 in the DD lesions from CNR2 k/o mice) suggesting a decidualization-dependent response (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). This observation clearly emphasizes a potential link between CNR2 dysfunction with decidualization characterized by T cell signaling issues within the EM microenvironment. To understand the functional implications of the DEGs, we conducted KEGG pathway analysis on specific differentially expressed immune genes in DD lesions from CNR1 k/o and CNR2 k/o mice. Notably, in CNR1 k/o DD lesions compared to WT DD, the chemokine signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, and toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways were negatively affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). These findings provide insights into the impact of CNR1 disruption on immune cell function within the DD environment. Conversely, CNR2 k/o DD lesions were associated with significant alterations in cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, Th17, Th1, and Th2 cell differentiation pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). These pathways are proven to be involved in T cell development, differentiation, and effector functions, aligning with our observed dysregulation of T cell-related genes. Together, these findings further elucidate the roles of CNR1 and CNR2 in modulating immune responses within the context of EM.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Bulk RNA sequencing revealed alterations in immune-related gene expression and pathway in endometriosis (EM) lesions from CNR1 k/o and CNR2 k/o mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Bar plot overview of the differentially expressed (DE) immune-related genes among different genotypes and lesion types.

The etiology of EM has been speculated to be routed in defective decidualization and retrograde menstruation of the endometrial fragments combined with ECS dysregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lingegowda et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sampson, 1927</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maia et al., 2020</xref>). While it is plausible that decreased ECS function influences EM lesion initiation, progression, and severe pain experience, it is not clear whether ECS dysfunction actively contributes to EM pathogenesis, or whether it represents a secondary consequence of alterations occurring within the refluxed endometrial tissue, leading to the establishment of EM lesions.</p><p>Keeping this central dogma in view and to provide insights into early events of EM pathogenesis, we induced EM in both CNR1 k/o and CNR2 k/o mice utilizing syngeneic, DD, and UnD uterine endometrial fragments. Absence of CNR1 and CNR2 did not influence systemic levels of ECS ligands but the lesion microenvironment displayed significant changes in the levels of OEA and PEA, suggesting a tissue-specific response.</p><p>One intriguing aspect of ECS involvement in EM is its role in decidualization, a process pivotal for uterine receptivity to embryo implantation and successful pregnancy, that may also contribute to EM establishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Correa et al., 2016</xref>). Although both CNR1 and CNR2 are active in decidualization, CNR1 may have a more prominent role. Absence of CNR1 and CNR2 shows compromised decidualization in mice in a CNR1-dependent manner validated through in-vitro studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2020</xref>). Similarly, in our study, EM lesions (both UnD and DD) from mice lacking CNR1 showed significantly more DEGs (2088), compared to CNR2 (287) and WT (2). Genes essential for decidualization such as <italic>Igfbp2</italic>, <italic>Bmp3</italic>, <italic>Ptgdr</italic>, <italic>Wnt7a,</italic> and <italic>Esr1</italic> were downregulated in the DD, EM lesions from CNR1 k/o mice compared to their UnD counterparts. This further reinforces the role of CNR1 in the uterine and EM lesion microenvironment, including their role in decidualization response. Moreover, the interplay between CNR1 and CNR2 are important since CNR2 contributes to immunomodulation, which is a key process during decidualization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Turcotte et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Taylor et al., 2010</xref>). Even though retrograde menstruation is considered the main mechanism by which endometrial fragments reach the peritoneal cavity and implant to form EM lesions, the retrograded menstrual debris itself does not undergo decidualization. However, some EM lesions in the peritoneal cavity, under the influence of estrogen and progesterone, can undergo decidualization as the lesions can exist in different evolutionary stages, from active red lesions to quiescent white lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Leone Roberti Maggiore et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Given the complexity of ECS signaling and compensatory mechanisms, we focused our investigation on the immune dysregulation aspect of EM pathophysiology. Our findings suggest that altered ECS dynamics during decidualization disrupt ECS signaling, leading to dysregulation of immune responses and aberrant cellular behavior. Indeed, immune dysfunction is a hallmark of EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Symons et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahn et al., 2015</xref>), and ECS could play a crucial role in shaping immune responses, particularly through its impact on T cell function yet there is no clear evidence.

Our flow cytometry analysis revealed significant alterations in immune cell populations in mice bearing EM lesions, with a notable absence of CD3 + T cells, CD4 + helper T cells, and CD8 + cytotoxic T cells specifically in CNR2 k/o mice. Mechanistic in-vitro studies further confirmed an aberrant T cell response in CNR2 k/o mice, as with T cell receptor activation and stimulation there was decreased viability. Combined, our findings show that CNR2 is critical in T cell survival upon TCR activation with pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)/danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) or antigen-mediated signals. These findings also shed light on a previously unrecognized role of CNR2 in EM-associated adaptive immune dysfunction given the critical role of T cells in immune surveillance and regulation. Furthermore, speculation of EM being a cause of ECS dysfunction could be of importance since CNR2 was found to be reduced in the lesions of EM patients, as shown by our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lingegowda et al., 2021b</xref>). In addition, the bulk RNA sequencing strengthens the finding of dysregulation of T cell-related genes in CNR2 k/o EM lesions. The observed downregulation of T cell-related genes such as <italic>Cd3e</italic>, <italic>Cd3g</italic>, <italic>Gata3,</italic> and <italic>Ctla4</italic> is consistent with the diminished CD3 + T cell populations and highlights the relevance of CNR2 in T cell-mediated immune responses within the endometriotic microenvironment.</p><p>KEGG pathway analysis of differentially expressed immune-related genes in CNR2 k/o DD lesions further revealed that Th1, Th2, and Th17 cell differentiation pathways were impacted, and the previous literature confirms the dysregulation of these pathways in EM pathophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andreoli et al., 2011</xref>). Additionally, our in-vitro functional assay showing CD4 + helper T cells being affected (proliferation) more than the CD8 + cytotoxic T cell subset further adds to the subset-specific behaviour of CNR2. Our results provide a missing link between the ECS and immune system functioning during EM.</p><p>To gain insights into the early features of lesion initiation and establishment, we conducted an IMC analysis of EM lesions across genotypes and different lesion types (DD and UnD). DD lesions from CNR1 and CNR2 k/o mice showed higher T-cell residing in the lesions with increased stromal compartments and monocytes/macrophages population compared to WT lesions. Stromal cells contribute to the early development of EM lesions by promoting inflammation, angiogenesis, fibrosis, and immune modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McKinnon et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Queckbörner et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zondervan et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, the interaction between macrophages and stromal cells is important in EM, with the NLRP3 inflammasome playing a role in lesion development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guo et al., 2021</xref>). Studies have implicated macrophages in EM lesion growth where they support angiogenesis (formation of blood vessels) by producing pro-angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ding et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sun et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McLaren et al., 1996</xref>). Given the combined increase in proliferation, endothelial markers, and monocytes/macrophages in EM lesions from mice potentially indicates that they could modulate the early lesion microenvironment in the event of CNR1 and CNR2 dysregulation. Based on the proportion of these macrophages to certain phenotypes, such as M1 or M2, would dictate lesion development and subsequent progression. Further studies are required to tease out molecular interactions of CNR1 and CNR2 with specific immune cell subsets in a complex EM lesion microenvironment and determine how it contributes to the establishment of blood supply and lesion survival.</p><p>The dysregulation of the ECS, as evidenced by the altered expression of CNR1 and CNR2 in our mouse model of EM, appears to have far-reaching consequences on the cellular and molecular landscape of endometriotic lesions. Since CNR1 is widely expressed in the central nervous system where it regulates pain perception, mood, and other neurological processes, the dysregulation of CNR1 signaling may impact the sensory innervation and pain responses associated with the EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rodríguez de Fonseca et al., 2005</xref>). Additionally, CNR1 has been shown to modulate immune cell function, including the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Klein, 2005</xref>. The loss of CNR1 signaling in immune cells infiltrating the endometriotic lesions likely contributes to the altered immune profiles observed in our study. In contrast, CNR2 is predominantly expressed in immune cells, such as macrophages, lymphocytes, and natural killer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Turcotte et al., 2016</xref>). This receptor plays a crucial role in the regulation of immune responses, including the modulation of cytokine production, cell migration, and proliferation. The significant reduction in CD3 + T cells in the peritoneal cavity and spleen of CNR2 knockout mice suggests that the loss of CNR2 may have a profound impact on T cell homeostasis and function in EM dependent manner, as this was not the case in sham-operated mice. This impairment in T cell function has direct consequences on the adaptive immune response, as evidenced by the altered gene expression profiles and pathways related to immune function in our transcriptomic analysis. But we haven’t conducted specific mechanistic experiments to tease out the interplay between immune response and endometriosis lesion development in our model systems.</p><p>Several limitations should be acknowledged in our study. Firstly, understanding the homeostatic aspects of ECS, both with and without the presence of CNR1 and CNR2, remains a complex challenge. While our global k/o mouse models provide valuable insights, further research utilizing targeted k/o specific to the uterus could offer a more precise understanding of their contributions to uterine physiology and further implications in EM establishment. The use of mouse models to study EM has inherent limitations due to species differences and the inability to fully recapitulate the human disease. The molecular and cellular complexities associated with DD and UnD endometrial tissues, as well as the timing of EM induction in these mice, may not perfectly mirror the human condition. No significant baseline alterations were observed in the immune profile between the CNR1 and CNR2 k/o and the WT mice without EM induction. However, the uterine environment has not been assessed to understand the baseline immune profile between the k/o and WT mice. These limitations emphasize the need for future investigations to enhance the translational relevance of our findings and further our understanding of the complex interplay between ECS, decidualization, and EM pathogenesis.</p><p>In conclusion, our study offers evidence for the involvement of CNR1 and CNR2 dysregulation in EM pathogenesis. Through an integrative analysis of transcriptomic profiles, immune cell dynamics, and spatial relationships within EM lesions from mice, we unveil the intricate interactions between ECS, immune responses, and cellular changes in EM. By identifying potential mechanisms through which ECS disruption could impact EM, our research provides a foundation for the development of targeted therapies addressing the ECS’s influence on EM. These findings will advance our understanding of EM and lead to innovative therapeutic strategies to manage this complex disorder.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Experiments described in this work were approved by the Queen’s University Institutional Animal Care Committee as per the guidelines provided by the Canadian Council of Animal Care for protocol number 2021–2228. All animals were assigned randomly to the surgical procedures. All studies were performed using adult female mice at ages between 7–10 weeks. CNR1 k/o (B6.129P2(C)-<italic>Cnr1</italic>tm1.1Ltz/J) and CNR2 k/o (B6.129P2-<italic>Cnr2</italic>tm1Dgen/J) male and female breeder mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, USA) and were housed in the Queen’s University animal facility. CNR1 k/o and CNR2 k/o experimental female mice were obtained by trio breeding with their respective homozygous k/o male counterparts. C57BL/6 j (WT) control female mice and vasectomized male mice at 7–10 weeks were obtained from Jackson Laboratory. All breeder mice were housed in standard breeding cages in a barrier facility and the experimental animals were housed in a conventional holding area. Animals were housed at constant temperature (22 ±1°C) and relative humidity (50%), with a 12:12 hr light: dark cycle (light on 07.00–19.00  hr). Food and water were available ad libitum. All experimental animals were acclimatized at the conventional housing facility for 1 week before starting the experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>In vivo decidualization</title><p>In this study, we have used a modified syngeneic mouse model of EM, where the donor fragments were obtained from artificially decidualized uterine horns. The method of artificial decidualization used in this study has been previously established and utilized by several research studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cai et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2022</xref>). To artificially induce decidualization, female mice were allowed to mate with vasectomized male mice to induce pseudopregnancy. After day 4 of pseudopregnancy, female mice were subjected to laparotomy to receive a 30 μL injection of sesame seed oil (S3547, Sigma, USA), intra-luminally into one uterine horn to induce DD. The contralateral, uninjected horn served as an UnD control. After the sesame seed oil injection, animals were rested for 4 days, after which the DD was successfully induced in one uterine horn as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. These uterine horns were utilized as donor fragments to induce EM in recipient mice of their respective genotype. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> shows the representative images of EM lesions 7 days post-surgical induction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Mouse model of EM</title><p>EM was surgically induced as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lingegowda et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lingegowda et al., 2021a</xref>). Two independent groups (DD and UnD) per genotype were used in this study (n=8–16). Briefly, the DD and UnD uterine horns from the donor mice were harvested, and uterine horns were longitudinally dissected to reveal the endometrium. Uterine fragments were obtained using a 3.0 mm epidermal biopsy punch (33–32, Integra Miltex, USA). Recipient mice were anesthetized under 3.5% isoflurane vaporizer anesthesia to make a midline incision in the abdomen (n=8–16) and two 3.0 mm DD or UnD uterine fragments were implanted on the right inner peritoneal wall using a veterinary grade tissue bonding glue (1469 SB, 3 M, USA). WT, CNR1 k/o, and CNR2 k/o control groups (n=4) were sham-operated with a midline incision in the abdomen without implantation of uterine fragments. Mice were sacrificed 7 days after EM induction surgery since the focus of the study was on the earlier time point of EM initiation after induction. Based on the previous studies, 7 days after EM induction appears to be the log phase of tissue repair and immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Symons et al., 2020</xref>). Blood was harvested through cardiac puncture to assess EC ligands. Peritoneal fluid (PF) was collected by injecting 3 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) into the peritoneal cavity. Spleens were collected in ice-cold RPMI media (11875093, ThermoFisher, Canada) before processing to obtain single-cell suspension. EM lesions were either snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80℃ or processed using 4% paraformaldehyde overnight (12–20 hr), kept at 4 °C in 70% ethanol, and then embedded in paraffin.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Lipid extraction and targeted mass spectrometry</title><p>Plasma was undiluted and ~10 mg of tissue per sample were homogenized with RIPA buffer (89900, Thermo Fisher, Canada) with 1:100 of protease inhibitor cocktail (535140–1 ML, Sigma, Canada) to obtain tissue lysates. Both plasma and tissue lysates obtained were individually subjected to solid phase extraction (SPE). Internal standards, both deuterated and non-deuterated used in the study to assess the ECS ligands were purchased from Cayman Chemicals, USA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). Aliquots of 100 µL of plasma and tissue lysates were added to a protein precipitation plate (CE0-7565-R, Phenomenex, USA) along with 200 µL of cold acetonitrile containing the deuterated internal standards. The filtrate was diluted with 500 μL of water and submitted to SPE extraction on an Oasis HLB 96-Well Plate (WAT058951, Waters, Canada). Samples were washed with 60% methanol prior to elution with acetonitrile. The eluate was dried, reconstituted in 100 μL of mobile phase A and analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS as described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>).

Splenic cells and cells from PF were resuspended in a staining buffer (PBS with 2% fetal bovine serum) at a concentration of 0.5×10^6 cells/mL. All antibodies used for flow cytometry analyses were purchased from BioLegend, USA, unless otherwise mentioned. The antibodies included CD45-FITC (103107), CD3-BV510 (100234), CD4-BV785 (100551), CD8-BV605 (100744), CD11b-AF700 (101222), F4/80-PE/Cy7 (123114), NK1.1-APC/Cy7 (108724), and CD19-PE/Dazzle 594 (115554). Staining was performed following the manufacturer’s recommendations. For each sample, 50 μL of the antibody cocktail was added to 50 μL of cell suspension in 96-well plates. The mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 20 min in the dark, along with an anti-CD16/32 Fc block antibody (101319). After incubation, cells were washed twice with staining buffer and centrifuged before fixing the cells with fixation buffer (00-8222/49, Thermo Fisher, Canada). Flow cytometry analysis was carried out using a Beckman Coulter CytoFlex S flow cytometer. Compensation controls were established using single antibody-stained cells. Isotype controls provided baseline levels of non-specific staining and cell populations were defined using fluorescence minus one (FMO) control. Data analysis employed FlowJo software (v 10.9; FlowJo, USA) as well as SPECTRE (v 1.0) computational toolkit in R (v 4.2.3) to obtain t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) plots based on the unsupervised flowSOM clusters generated by marker expression.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>In-vitro T cell functional assay</title><p>Total CD3 + T cells were isolated from splenocytes of naive WT and CNR2 k/o mice using a negative selection magnetic kit (19851 A, StemCell, Canada) following the manufacturer’s instructions.

Subsequently, 250,000T cells per well were seeded into a 96-well plate coated with anti-mouse CD3 [(2 μg/ml), (100340)]. RPMI-1640 media supplemented with rmIL-2 [(10 ng/ml), (575404)], anti-mouse CD28 [(5 μg/ml), (102116)], 10% fetal bovine serum, β-mercaptoethanol (50 µM), and penicillin/streptomycin (100 U/ml) was used as the growth medium. T cells were then activated non-specifically with or without the cell activation cocktail consisting of Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and ionomycin [(50 ng/ml PMA and 1 μM ionomycin), (423301)] in the presence and absence of TNFα [(100 ng/ml), (410-MT-010/C, R&amp;D Systems, USA)] to simulate a sterile inflammatory challenge. Following a 48 hr incubation period, brefeldin A [(10 μg/ml), (11861, Cayman Chemicals, USA)] was introduced to the cells to measure intracellular interferon-gamma (IFNγ) levels at the 42 hr time point. Flow cytometry analysis was conducted using a panel of markers, purchased from Biolegend, USA unless otherwise mentioned, including CD3e-FITC (100306), CD4-AF700 (100430), CD8-PE/fire700 (100792), Ki67-PB (151223), FoxP3-PE (126404), IFNγ -BV605 (505840), and Live/dead-K0525 (L304966, Thermo Fisher, Canada), to assess various T cell subsets and viability. Flow cytometry staining and acquisition was carried out as described above with the addition of permeabilization (00-8333-56, Thermo Fisher, Canada) buffer to stain for intracellular markers (Ki-67 and IFNγ), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Briefly, ~20 mg EM lesion tissues were placed individually in PowerBead Ceramic Tubes (13113–50, Qiagen, Canada) along with lysis buffer. Lesions were homogenized using a Bead Ruptor homogenizer (Omni International, USA) and lysates were extracted after centrifugation at 10,000 RCF. Lysate was mixed with 70% ethanol, added to the RNeasy spin column, and then centrifuged to bind the RNA to the column. Spin column was washed twice, and RNA was isolated using an elution buffer. Total RNA quality was measured using the nanodrop spectrophotometer and stored at –80℃ before shipping to BGI Global (Boston, USA) for bulk RNA analysis. RNA integrity was determined using the Agilent 4150 TapeStation System Agilent, USA for sample quality control, and only samples with RNA quality number ≥7 were considered for library preparation and further sequencing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>RNA library preparation, sequencing, and analysis</title><p>Library preparation began with mRNA enrichment using oligo dT beads, which selectively capture mRNA molecules. Next, the enriched mRNA was fragmented, and first-strand cDNA was synthesized using random N6 primers, followed by second-strand cDNA synthesis using deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP). After cDNA synthesis, end repair was performed to generate blunt ends, and 3' adenylation was carried out to facilitate adaptor ligation. Adaptors were ligated to the 3' adenylated cDNA fragments. To enrich the cDNA library for sequencing, PCR amplification was conducted. Prior to amplification, the dUTP-marked strand was specifically degraded by Uracil-DNA-Glycosylase (UDG). The remaining first-strand cDNA was then amplified using PCR primers. Following amplification, single-strand separation was achieved through denaturation by heat. The single-stranded DNA was cyclized using a splint oligo and DNA ligase. DNA nanoball synthesis was performed on the cyclized single-stranded DNA templates. This process facilitated the generation of clonal DNA clusters, providing the material necessary for subsequent sequencing. Sequencing was executed using the DNBSEQ Technology platform. The prepared DNA libraries were loaded onto the DNBSEQ sequencer and sequenced at an average depth of 30 million paired-end reads (2 × 100) per library. The sequencing data was filtered with SOAPnuke by removing reads containing sequencing adapter; removing reads whose low-quality base ratio (base quality less than or equal to 15) is more than 20%, and removing reads whose unknown base ('N' base) ratio is more than 5%. Next, clean reads were obtained and stored in FASTQ format. Clean reads were mapped to the mouse reference genome (NCBI: GRCm38.p6) using HISAT2 (v2.0.4). The subsequent analysis and data mining were performed on Dr. Tom Multi-omics Data mining system (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://biosys.bgi.com">https://biosys.bgi.com</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Imaging mass cytometry: Labeling</title><p>A comprehensive panel of antibodies identifying innate and adaptive immune cell populations and cell types that are integral to the EM lesion microenvironment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c</xref>) was designed and optimized as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McDowell et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sorin et al., 2023</xref>). The formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections (n=2–3 per tissue type) underwent deparaffinization and heat-mediated antigen retrieval on the Ventana Discovery Ultra auto-stainer platform (Roche Diagnostics, Canada), following the below instructions. Initially, the slides were exposed to a temperature of 70°C in a pre-formulated EZ Prep solution (Roche Diagnostics, Canada), followed by a subsequent incubation at 95°C in pre-formulated Cell Conditioning 1 solution (Roche Diagnostics, Canada). Following this, the slides were washed in 1x PBS and then exposed to Dako Serum-free Protein Block solution (Agilent, USA) for 45 min at room temperature. An antibody cocktail, containing metal-conjugated antibodies, was prepared using Dako Antibody Diluent (Agilent, USA) at specified dilutions. The primary antibodies within this cocktail were applied to the slides and left to react overnight at 4°C, after which the slides were washed with 0.2% Triton X-100 and 1x PBS. For the subsequent step, a secondary antibody cocktail comprising metal-conjugated anti-biotin antibodies was created in Dako Antibody Diluent, at a predetermined dilution. The slides were treated with this anti-biotin cocktail for 1 hr at room temperature and then washed with 0.2% Triton X-100 and 1x PBS. For counterstaining, the slides were exposed to Cell-ID Intercalator-Ir (Fluidigm, Canada) diluted at a ratio of 1:400 in 1x PBS for 30  min at room temperature. After a 5 min rinse with distilled water, the slides were air-dried in preparation for IMC acquisition.

IMC data analysis methods employed in this study follow established procedures as outlined in the Steinbock toolkit (Spatial Experiment v 1. 12. 0) for data preprocessing, image segmentation, and object quantification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Windhager et al., 2021</xref>). Cell segmentation utilized a deep learning approach described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Greenwald et al., 2022</xref>. Briefly, dual-channel images were generated using nuclear and cytoplasmic markers, representing respective signals. The DeepCell tool with Mesmer, a pre-trained deep learning segmentation algorithm from TissueNet, was used to automate cell mask generation, requiring no additional user input. Given the IMC data was acquired in batches, we performed batch effect corrections using the harmony algorithm as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Korsunsky et al., 2019</xref>). This involved iterative clustering and correction of cell positions in the principal component analysis (PCA) space. Subsequently, unsupervised PhenoGraph clustering in R (v 4. 3. 2) was used to categorize cell types. For this, signals including αSMA, B220, CD19, β-catenin, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD11b, CD11c, CD31, CD68, E-cadherin, MPO, pan-cytokeratin, and vimentin were utilized, employing a k-value of 60. To ascertain cell interactions, imcRtools (v 1. 8. 0) and cytomapper (v 1. 14. 0) in R were employed for visualization. A permutation test evaluated interactions with neighboring cells. Neighboring cells were defined as those within a five-pixel radius (5 µm), and the buildSpatialGraph function established the number of one cluster neighbors interacting with another cluster. A default of 1000 permutations was set. Each iteration led to an interaction score and p-value computation, and the significant outcomes (at alpha 1% risk) were depicted in heatmaps. To delineate spatial cellular neighborhoods, neighbor windows were computed, representing the N nearest cells to each cell. This process followed previous protocols. Employing imcRtools, cellular neighborhood grouping was conducted, leading to the identification of 8 cellular neighborhoods in the lesions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistical analyses performed to compare the concentration of EC ligands through targeted LC-MS and evaluation of the immune cell population via flow cytometry were conducted using Prism GraphPad.

We have also noted the suggestion on providing comparison of differentially expressed genes in the eutopic endometrium vs ectopic lesions. Since there are publications comparing the eutopic vs ectopic gene expression patterns (PMIDs: 33868805 and 18818281), including a study exploring the ECS genes in the endometrium throughout different menstrual cycles (PMID: 35672435), we believe additional analysis using the same dataset may not yield new information.

This would help elucidate specific pathways by which dysregulated ECS leads to the alterations in immune cell populations, gene expression profiles, and other key aspects of endometriosis development and progression. This is a rapidly evolving field and at this stage, we do not have published information to reflect on this aspect in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1) As mentioned in the text, the ECS components being studied are widely expressed and may affect multiple aspects of endometriosis pathogenesis and symptomatology. However, the cell or tissue-specific effects of the CNR1 and CNR2 are not incorporated into the experimental design of the studies. Although these limitations are mentioned in the discussion, it is important to know if global CNR1 and CNR2 KO affect normal female reproductive tract function, ovarian steroid hormone levels, decidualization response, or if preexisting alterations in host or donor tissues affect lesion development in the surgically induced, syngeneic mouse model of endometriosis. This would also be the case in studies on immune system dysfunction or lesion microenvironment, as it is possible preexisting immune system dysfunction following CNR1 or CNR2 loss could alter the disease trajectory and lead to a misinterpretation of the findings. Some of these potential confounders could be addressed using crossover approaches in Figure 1A experimental design, but the donor tissues are reported to be matched to the recipients based on genotype.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raised an excellent point that the widespread expression of the ECS components studied in our manuscript may affect multiple aspects of endometriosis pathogenesis and symptomatology. Indeed, the cell or tissue-specific effects of CNR1 and CNR2 knockout are not fully incorporated into our experimental design, which could lead to potential confounding factors that may affect the interpretation of some of our findings. However, as outlined in our previous comments, we will incorporate the tissue/cell specific knockout, as well the crossover approaches to elucidate if the loss of CNR1 and CNR2 function is lesion driven in future studies. We agree that it is important to understand the impact of global CNR1 and CNR2 knockout on normal female reproductive tract function, ovarian steroid hormone levels, decidualization response, and other potential preexisting alterations in the host or donor tissues that could influence lesion development in the syngeneic mouse model of endometriosis. As outlined in the MS (lines 59-62), there are studies highlighting pregnancy specific impact including implantation and impaired primary decidual zone formation. We did not find any baseline alterations in the systemic immune profiles between the CNR1 and CNR2 knockout mice and the WT mice without EM induction. However, the uterine environment has not been assessed to understand the baseline immune profile between the knockout mice and WT mice. We agree with the reviewer that, the possibility of preexisting immune system dysfunction following CNR1 or CNR2 loss could alter the disease trajectory related to immune system dysfunction or lesion microenvironment. We have highlighted this in the limitations section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The phenotypic characterization of the endometriosis mouse model with or without CNR1 or CNR2 KO is very limited. To better understand how the observed cellular and molecular alterations correlate with endometriosis pathogenesis and severity CNR1 and CNR2 K/O mice, a detailed characterization of lesion size differences and histopathology should be made. Importantly, the histopathological characterization of the lesions would complement the imaging mass spectrometry findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that more detailed characterization of the endometriosis lesions in our CNR1 and CNR2 knockout mouse models are required. As evident for our several previous publications, we have focused on detailed histopathological characterization of endometriotic lesions in our syngeneic mouse model of endometriosis including a multiple time course study (Symons et al, 2020, FASEB). In the present investigation, we focused on cataloging spatial and transcriptomic changes as we do not currently have any information on the global influence of CNR1 and CNR2 knockout on endometriosis lesion microenvironment, since we prioritized this aspect, we were not able to provide detailed histological assessment of lesions. However, the IMC analysis provides a detailed, spatially resolved profile of the cellular composition and interactions within the endometriotic lesions, which we believe offers valuable insights into the mechanisms by which the dysregulated ECS may contribute to endometriosis pathogenesis. This quantitative, high-dimensional approach complements the transcriptional profiling and other analyses we have performed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Given the effect sizes and variance observed with the ECS ligand measurements, an N = 4-5 biological samples for mouse phenotypic studies seems too low.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises a valid point about low sample size. As elaborated earlier, this was a proof of principle study to capture biologically significant alterations within lesion and surrounding peritoneal microenvironment in the absence of CNR1, CNR2 receptors. This information is crucial for establishing the potential mechanisms by which the dysregulated ECS may contribute to the pathogenesis of endometriosis. Now that we have established the framework and baseline understanding of immune-inflammatory alterations, we will refine our future experimental approaches and include more samples if becomes necessary.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>It is hard to read the labeling of figures.
