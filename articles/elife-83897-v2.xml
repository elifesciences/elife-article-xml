Here, we investigated the role of CCK in motor learning using a single pellet reaching task in mice. Mice with a knockout of <italic>Cck</italic> gene (<italic>Cck<sup>−/−</sup></italic>) or blockade of CCK-B receptor (CCKBR) showed defective motor learning ability; the success rate of retrieving reward remained at the baseline level compared to the wildtype mice with significantly increased success rate. We observed no long-term potentiation upon high-frequency stimulation in the motor cortex of <italic>Cck<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice, indicating a possible association between motor learning deficiency and neuroplasticity in the motor cortex. In vivo calcium imaging demonstrated that the deficiency of CCK signaling disrupted the refinement of population neuronal activity in the motor cortex during motor skill training. Anatomical tracing revealed direct projections from CCK-expressing neurons in the rhinal cortex to the motor cortex. Inactivation of the CCK neurons in the rhinal cortex that project to the motor cortex bilaterally using chemogenetic methods significantly suppressed motor learning, and intraperitoneal application of CCK4, a tetrapeptide CCK agonist, rescued the motor learning deficits of <italic>Cck<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice. In summary, our results suggest that CCK, which could be provided from the rhinal cortex, may surpport motor skill learning by modulating neuroplasticity in the motor cortex.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cholecystokinin</kwd><kwd>entorhinal cortex</kwd><kwd>motor cortex</kwd><kwd>single pellet reaching task</kwd><kwd>motor skill learning</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Hong Kong Research Grants Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GRF11103220M</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Jufang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Hong Kong Research Grants Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GRF11101521M</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Jufang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Hong Kong Research Grants Council, Collaborative Research Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C1043-21GF</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Jufang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010428</institution-id><institution>Innovation and Technology Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MRP/053/18X</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Jufang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010428</institution-id><institution>Innovation and Technology Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GHP_075_19GD</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Jufang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005847</institution-id><institution>Health and Medical Research Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HMRF09203656</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Jufang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NSFC31671102</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Jufang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Innovation Technology Commission of the Hong Kong SAR, China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Health@InnoHK</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Jufang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>CCK released from the neural projections from the rhinal cortex to the motor cortex modulates neural plasticity and facilitates motor skill learning.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Learning to perform motor skills is essential for survival and high quality of life, such as hunting, running, escaping, fighting, playing music, dancing, drawing, and performing an operation. Evidence from electrical stimulation, lesions, imaging, and more targeted manipulation shows that the motor cortex is the center that controls motor behaviors and motor skill learning in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Papale and Hooks, 2018</xref>). Changes among neuronal circuits, such as synaptic strength, circuit connectivity, neuronal excitability, and neuronal structure, which occur through all layers of the motor cortex, contribute to motor skills learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Papale and Hooks, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biane et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Peters et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Costa et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huber et al., 2012</xref>). Different layers exhibit various neuronal changes with motor skill learning, corresponding with various layer-specific inputs and descending outputs. However, it is not completely clear how neuroplasticity in the motor cortex is regulated.</p><p>Cholecystokinin (CCK), distributed throughout the whole brain, has been suggested to be important in neuroplasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). Activation of the CCK-B receptor (CCKBR) by infusion of agonist in the auditory cortex regulated visuo-auditory associative memory formation in awake rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2014</xref>). Projections from the entorhinal cortex of the medial temporal lobe release CCK in the neocortex, hippocampus, and amygdala, enabling the encoding of long-term associative, spatial, and fear memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Meunier et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Su et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feng et al., 2021</xref>). <italic>N</italic>-Methyl-<sc>D</sc>-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the presynaptic membrane control the release of the entorhinal CCK in the auditory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Motor memory, known as a subset of procedural memory, is quite distinct from declarative memory examined in previous studies of CCK functions, but both types involve neuronal changes in the neocortex caused by task training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Squire, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackermann and Rasch, 2014</xref>). In this study, we examined the role of CCK from the rhinal cortex, including the entorhinal cortex and perirhinal cortex, to the motor cortex in neuroplasticity and motor skill learning. We evaluated whether the motor learning ability of mice is affected by the genetic elimination of the <italic>Cck</italic> gene or administration of the CCKBR antagonist. We implemented calcium imaging of the motor cortex to establish whether the absence of CCK function disrupts the refinement of the neuronal activation pattern during motor training. We further examined immunohistochemically the CCK-positive neuronal projections from the rhinal cortex to the motor cortex, including the laminar specificity of these projections in their target regions. In the final set of behavioral studies, we investigated whether the loss-of-function by inactivating CCK neurons from the rhinal cortex to the motor cortex suppresses motor learning ability and the gain-of-function by CCK4 administration rescues the motor learning ability of <italic>Cck<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The role of CCK in motor learning</title><p>A previous study has demonstrated that CCK is a key factor regulating neuroplasticity that enhances long-term memory formation in the auditory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2019</xref>).

In the rhinal cortex, the EYFP-labeled soma spread from AP: −2.54 mm to AP: −4.30 mm, and local clusters were observed in layers 3 and 5, where the neurons are expected to project to the neocortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Both anterograde and retrograde tracking results indicated that CCK-expressing neurons in the rhinal cortex projecting to the motor cortex were asymmetric, showing a preference for the ipsilateral hemisphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Primary antibodies against GAD67 and CaMKIIa were used for immunostaining of the rhinal cortex sections to determine the characteristics of CCK neurons projecting to the motor cortex. None of the retrograde EYFP-labeled neurons merged with GAD67 staining but completely colocalized with CaMKIIa staining, indicated by the white arrowhead, suggesting that the neurons projecting to the motor cortex are all excitatory neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E, F</xref>). Therefore, CCK neurons in the rhinal cortex may affect motor skill learning by regulating the plasticity of neurons in the motor cortex.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Labeling of cholecystokinin (CCK) neuron projections from the rhinal cortex (RC) to the MC.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Coronal section showing the virus injection site.

Thalamocortical projections in the motor cortex are widely distributed in all layers, including inputs to corticospinal neurons in layer 5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hooks et al., 2013</xref>). With single pellet reaching task training, thalamocortical neurons are biased in activating the corticospinal neurons that control the performance of the task, though the unbiased activation of corticospinal neurons was observed before training, suggesting that the thalamus selectively activates corticospinal neurons to generate better control of the forelimb movement with motor learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biane et al., 2016</xref>).

The success rate alone is not sufficient to describe the function of CCK in motor skill learning; therefore, the reaching result of the task is divided into four types, ‘miss’, ‘no-grasp’, ‘drop’, and ‘success’. ‘Miss’ is caused by defects in ‘aiming’ and ‘advance’, indicating a low probability of hitting the pellet. Miss rate of the <italic>Cck</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice had no significant change with learning and showed significant difference for the WT mice, suggesting that the brain areas controlling the ‘aiming’ and ‘advance’ are affected by CCK defect.

While this effect is similar to that of chemogenetic inhibition of RC-to-MC CCK+ neurons, we cannot rule out the possibility that this CCK antagonist might also affect CCK+ inhibitory neurons locally in the motor cortex.

In the mirror tracking task, the performance of H.M. was on par with normal people, suggesting that the motor learning ability was not affected without the hippocampus system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Corkin, 1968</xref>). But in the other two motor learning tasks, rotary pursuit and bimanual tracking, the performance of H.M. was much worse than the control.

Indeed, Corkin herself thought that the H.M. could perform tasks that required less demanding motor skills, but not the tasks demanding better motor skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Corkin, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Brigard, 2019</xref>).</p><p>The single pellet reaching task is a complex and dexterous motor task requiring the motor cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and the whole motor system. Chemogenetic inactivation of CCK neurons in the rhinal cortex significantly impaired the mice’s motor learning ability compared to the two control groups. Besides, the specificity of the projections from the rhinal cortex to the motor cortex for motor skill learning was studied. Over 98% of neurons in the rhinal cortex that projected to the motor cortex are CCK positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>), enabling us to inhibit CCK projections from the rhinal cortex to the motor cortex specifically by injecting the retro-Cre virus in the motor cortex and the Cre-dependent hM4Di in the rhinal cortex in C57BL/6 mice. Compared to two control groups, the learning ability of the experimental group was significant suppressed, suggesting that CCK projections from the rhinal cortex to the motor cortex are critical for motor skill learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Whereas, specifically inhibiting the projections from the rhinal cortex to the motor cortex contralateral to the dominant forelimb alone is not enough to significantly suppress the motor learning ability, suggesting that the bilateral motor cortex is involved in motor skill learning and the ipsilateral motor cortex may compensate the contralateral motor cortex. This is consistent with the previous finding that the number of increased synaptic GluA1 in the ipsilateral motor cortex after motor skill learning is comparable to that in the contralateral motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Roth et al., 2020</xref>). Whereas, the result was contradictory to the result of antagonist manipulation, which could be because when the antagonist was locally infused in the contralateral motor cortex through a drug cannula, it might have diffused to the ipsilateral motor cortex. Another possibility is that locally infused CCK antagonist might have inhibited CCK released from other cell types, in addition to RC-to-MC projections, resulting in a more severe phenotype difficult to compensate.</p><p>The motor cortex is considered as the main area generating motor memory when training in the single pellet reaching task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Komiyama et al., 2010</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Peters et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dhawale et al., 2021</xref>). Our results suggest that the plasticity of the motor cortex is important for motor learning, but did not imply that other brain areas which also receive CCK-positive neural projections from the rhinal cortex are not important for the performance of this task, such as the hippocampus, visual cortex, and basal ganglia. The hippocampus plays a critical role in reactivation of motor memories in the quiet-rest period in motor sequence learning and the dysfunctional dentate gyrus caused reduced success rate everyday but the learning rate is comparable to the control group in the single pellet reaching task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jacobacci et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hong et al., 2007</xref>). The visual cortex was critical for mice to perform the single pellet reaching task when light was available, whereas visual cortex was not required when trained in the dark condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Roth et al., 2020</xref>). The basal ganglia, considered to control action selection or vigor modulation, specifies and controls the learned skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dhawale et al., 2021</xref>). However, the role played by CCK in these brain areas during motor learning is unknown.

All experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Subjects Ethics Sub­Committee of the City University of Hong Kong under the Animals (Control of Experiments) Ordinance (Cap. 340) (Licence number (21-206) in DH/HT&amp;A/8/2/5 Pt.7).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Single pellet reaching task</title><p>The behavioral experiment, single pellet reaching task, was modified based on a previously established procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). A clear and transparent Plexiglas chamber (5 mm thickness, dimensions 20 cm × 15 cm × 8.5 cm) was built for mice training, with three 5 mm wide slits on the front wall: one is in the middle, the other two are 1.9 cm to the side, respectively. A 1.0-cm-height exterior shelf was affixed in front of the front wall to hold the chocolate pellets (#1811223, 20 mg, TestDiet) for reward. The food pellet was placed 0.7 cm away from the front wall and 0.4 cm away from the midline of the slit, to encourage the mouse to use the dominant hand for catching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The task has two periods, shaping and training. Mice were food restricted to keep approximately 90% body weight of the original weight during the whole process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). On shaping Day 1, two mice from the same cage were placed into the chamber for 20 min to acclimate to the environment; on shaping Day 2, an individual mouse was placed into the chamber for 20 min. During shaping, 10 food pellets were fed for each mouse every day to train mice eating food pellets. On shaping Day 3, a food tray full of food pellets was placed in front of the middle slit. The mouse can get the food reward by catching it through the slit with either hand. The experiment stopped when 20 times of reaching attempts were finished for each mouse. The dominant hand should be the one that shows over 70% preference. During the training period, mice reached for food pellets through the slit by the dominant hand, 40 attempts within 20 min every day. Only attempts by the dominant hand were counted. Based on the results of the attempts, the reaching attempts show four types: miss, no-grasp, drop, and success. A ‘miss’ means that the hand does not touch the food pellet. A ‘no-grasp’ means that the hand of the mouse touches the food pellet, but it does not successfully grasp the pellet. A ‘drop’ represents the mouse grasps the pellet, but it dropped due to whatever reasons during the retrieval. A ‘success’ was a reach in which the mouse successfully retrieved the pellet and put it into the mouth of the mouse. A high-speed camera was placed on the side of the chamber to videotape the reaching behavior of mice at 60 frames per second. The success rate was calculated as the number of successful attempts/the total attempts. The miss rate, the no-grasp rate, and the drop rate were also calculated to evaluate the performance of each step of mice. Hausdorff distances, the greatest of all the distances from a point in one set to the closest point in the other set, were calculated to assess the variation of trajectories.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>CCKBR antagonist injection</title><p>C57BL/6 mice were implanted a cannula in the motor cortex (coordinates: AP, 1.4 mm, ML, −/+1.6 mm, DV, 0.2 mm) contralateral to the dominant hand of the mice, followed by 3 days of recovery.

Mice were used for single pellet reaching task training 4 weeks post virus injection. Thirty minutes before behavior training, clozapine (0.4 mg/kg, Sigma-Aldrich, dissolved with 0.1% DMSO) was intraperitoneally injected to inactivate the activity of the CCK-positive neurons in the rhinal cortex. The same volume of vehicle (0.9% saline solution with 0.1% DMSO) was injected into mice injected with Cre-dependent hM4Di as a sham control group.

The mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital, and their fur between two ears trimmed and they were fixed on a stereotactic apparatus (RWD, China). Firstly, the head skin of the mouse was cleaned and sterilized with 70% alcohol and open to fully expose the skull. To accurately locate the regions of interest, the head was adjusted between the middle and the lateral, and the anterior and the posterior. To completely inactivate the rhinal cortex, two injection sites per hemisphere were determined for virus injection using the following coordinates: site 1, anteroposterior (AP), −3.52 mm from Bregma, mediolateral (ML), 3.57 mm, dorsoventral (DV), −3.33 mm from the brain surface; site 2, AP, −4.24 mm from Bregma, ML, 3.55 mm, DV, −2.85 mm from the brain surface. Additionally, to specifically inhibit the projections from the RC to the MC, retro-Cre virus was injected using the coordinates as: site 1, AP, 0.5 mm, ML, 1.35 mm, DV, 0.3 mm; site 2, AP, 1.2 mm, ML, 1.5 mm, DV, 0.3 mm; site 3, AP, 1.2 mm, ML, 1.5 ml, DV, 1.0 mm; site 4, AP, 1.8 mm, ML, 1.3 mm, DV, 0.3 mm. Microinjections were carried out using a microinjector (World Precision Instruments, USA) and a glass pipette (Cat#504949, World Precision Instruments, USA).

The coordinates is: site 1: AP, 1.8 mm to the Bregma, ML, 1.2 mm, DV, 0.2 and 0.6 mm; site 2: AP, 1.0 mm to the Bregma, ML, 1.5 mm, DV, 0.2 and 0.6 mm. The volume of each site at each DV was 200 nl and the flow rate was 20 nl/min to protect the fluid from flowing out. An anterograde AAV-hSyn-DIO-mCherry is also used for projection tracking by injecting the virus into the rhinal cortex of the hemisphere. The specific coordinates are as that for chemogenetic virus injection. After virus injection, skins were seamed with sterilized sutures, and an antibiotic ointment was applied to the incision to prevent infection and promote healing.</p><p>The surface virus infusion process for the calcium imaging was performed as described previously with slight modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2017</xref>). A wide-tip glass pipette was prepared by a micropipette puller and then cut, polished, and flame treated to make it even and smooth. Mice were intraperitoneally injected with dexamethasone (0.2 mg/kg, s.c.) and carprofen (5 mg/kg, s.c.) to protect the brain from swelling and inflammation. Three hours later, mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital. The periosteum covered on the skull was removed, cleaned, and dried with 100% alcohol to prevent the skull and tissues from growing. A 3 × 3 mm<sup>2</sup> window above the motor cortex contralateral to the dominant hand was opened with a hand drill, and the bone debris was carefully removed with fine forceps. After that, the dura around the injection area was removed (open a dura hole of about 1 mm<sup>2</sup>) to expose the pial tissue for virus infusion. The tip of the pipette tightly covered the brain surface by lowering 400–500 µm, and 0.6 µl virus was infused at the speed of 0.06 µl/min. A 3 × 3 cover glass (thickness, around 150 µm) was attached to the brain surface, and gentle pressure was applied to keep the cover glass at the level same as the skull. The edge of the cover glass was sealed with superglue. After the glue totally hastened, the skin was stretched back and sutured.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Baseplate implantation</title><p>Two to three weeks after cranial window implantation, the scalp over the skull was totally removed with surgical scissors.

We turned on the LED and adjusted the focal distance of the electrowetting lens to 0 on the software. The position of the miniscope was adjusted until the brain tissue was observed in the data acquisition system. Dental acrylic was used to fix the baseplate to the acrylic cap covering the skull around the window.

Then a MATLAB algorithm, NoRMCorre, was applied for piecewise rigid motion correction before data analysis. The calcium signals were extracted with the MATLAB code of Constrained Nonnegative Matrix Factorization for microEndoscopic (CNMF-E) (code availability: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/zhoupc/CNMF_E">https://github.com/zhoupc/CNMF_E</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>). The scaled fluorescent calcium signal overtime was extracted as C_raw. The raw data were then deconvolved. The activity higher than three times the standard deviation of baseline fluctuation is deemed as a calcium event which has been revealed to be associated with neuronal spiking activity, and the rising phase of which was searched and used for further neuronal activity analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Peters et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Timestamps from both the behavior videos and the calcium imaging videos were aligned to find out the time window when the mouse performed the reaching task. Neuronal activity in the time window from 100 ms before reaching to 100 ms after retrieval was considered the activity related to the movements. Wilcoxon ranksum test was conducted between activity inside the time window and activity outside (p &lt; 0.05) to exclude the neurons that activated indiscriminately or not correlated with the reaching task. Neurons with the average activity in the time window higher than the average outside the time window were considered movement-related neurons. The neurons were aligned based on each neuron’s sorted time of peak event to visualize each and all the neuronal activity patterns during the reaching task. The recurrence of neuronal activity related to the movements was also elevated by pairwise comparison of the population neuronal activity between trials using the Pearson correlation coefficient.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Four weeks after virus injection, mice were perfused with 50 ml cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (1×) to remove the blood and 50 ml 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS to fix the brain tissue.

The authors provide convincing evidence combining behavioural assays, brain recording and stimulation experiments, knock out models, and targeted manipulations of several relevant pathways that support a contribution of rhinal CCK projections to motor cortex during learning in mice. This paper thus identifies a potential novel pathway involved in motor learning, but the specific contribution of rhinal CCK still needs to be fully characterised in future work given the extensive projections of rhinal CCK neurons to brain areas other than motor cortex.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83897.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Gallego</surname><given-names>Juan Alvaro</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/041kmwe10</institution-id><institution>Imperial College London</institution></institution-wrap><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Xulu</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/043mz5j54</institution-id><institution>UCSF</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.11.21.517378">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.21.517378v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Tamar Makin as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Xulu Sun (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>Below follow the main points that should be addressed by the authors.</p><p>1) The authors should establish/discuss whether it can be concluded that the behavioral consequence of their various CCK manipulations is learning-specific.</p><p>2) The paper implicates motor cortex-projecting CCK neurons in the rhinal cortex as being a key component in motor learning. However, the relative importance of this pathway in motor learning is not pinned down, especially in terms of sufficiency and specificity. The Public Reviews have several specific comments about this, including adding new analyses and controls.</p><p>3) Related to the above: normal neural plasticity should be essential to motor skill learning throughout development not just during the current task. Did these CCK knock-out mice present any motor deficits that could have resulted from a lack of CCK-mediated neural plasticity during development?</p><p>4) The CCK4 rescue experiment demonstrates the sufficiency of CCK in promoting motor learning. However, it lacked specificity: IP injection did not allow specific &quot;gain of function&quot; in the motor cortex but instead, the improved learning ability in CCK knock-out mice could be a result of a global effect of CCK4 across multiple brain regions.</p><p>5) The Discussion has statements that are only weakly supported by the results (for example, lines 429-431, lines 432-433, and lines 447-448).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The paper is generally written and presented well, and the conclusions are interesting in principle, though it would substantially strengthen the paper to provide evidence for specificity both in the learning and in the CCK rhinal-motor cortex pathway. For example, in the experiments injecting CCK receptor antagonists, injections into the ipsilateral motor cortex would evidence area specificity, and injections after learning would demonstrate learning specificity. Likewise, in the experiments inhibiting rhinal CCK neurons, inhibiting specifically the motor cortex-projecting neurons would show pathway specificity, and performing this manipulation after learning would show learning specificity.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) Based on the literature, CCK is widely distributed across multiple brain regions. I understand that the authors here focus on the motor system, but providing a more comprehensive behavioral assessment of CCK knock-out mice could be very useful to strengthen the claim that the impaired performance in the pellet-reaching task was not due to weakened overall learning ability (e.g., memory deficits) or pre-existing motor deficits but specific to learning new motor skills. It could also help readers have a better understanding of how CCK knock-out mice behave similarly or differently in the current study compared to mice injected with CCK antagonists only in the motor cortex, as well as compared to knock-out mice in previous studies.</p><p>2) To corroborate the claim that the observed motor learning deficits are specifically related to the rhinal-motor cortical projections, I'd suggest the following chemogenetic experiments: express hM4Di in rhinal cortical neurons and inject clozapine in the motor cortex to specifically inhibit the axon terminals of rhinal neurons there. Alternatively, if hM4Di cannot be sufficiently expressed in axon terminals, maybe express inhibitory opsins in rhinal cortical neurons and implant optic fibers in the motor cortex to inhibit the axon terminals of rhinal cortical projections. Then observe if animals with targeted inhibition of the rhinal-motor cortical projection also express motor learning deficits.</p><p>3) Histology: similar to my point in 1), I think providing a more complete picture of anatomical projections of CCK neurons would be helpful for comparing the current study to the literature. Therefore, I was wondering: in addition to Figure 4, could the authors show 3.1) the major downstream targets of rhinal CCK neural projections, and 3.2) the major upstream CCK-expressing brain regions that project to the motor cortex?</p><p>4) To hopefully help enhance the specificity of the rescue experiments (corresponding to my comments in public review point 5), I'd suggest that the authors inject CCK4 into the motor cortex of 4.1) CCK knock-out mice, and 4.2) mice with hM4Di-mediated rhinal cortical inhibition.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Cholecystokinin from the Rhinal Cortex Facilitates Motor Skill Learning&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Tamar Makin (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1) The specific role of CCK from the RC to MC is still not entirely demonstrated. The activity of the RC-MC pathway is causally tested, and these neurons are shown to be almost entirely CCK positive, but the CCK antagonist and rescue manipulations are either systemic or MC-localized. It is therefore not directly shown that CCK in RC-MC neurons is the critical factor for learning. The paper is still interesting, although since this claim is the title of the paper, it may be worth reconsidering the title.</p><p>2) Another concern about the CCK antagonist experiment is that there might be CCK-positive, GABAergic neurons locally in the motor cortex, in addition to the axons projected from the rhinal CCK neurons. Injecting a CCK antagonist would thus likely lead to mixed effects from inhibiting local inhibitory neurons (i.e., disinhibition) + suppressing excitatory input from the rhinal cortex. I understand that this might be beyond the scope of the current study, but it would be important if the authors could point out this limitation when discussing their CCK antagonist results in the main text.</p><p>3) The major deficit in KO mice appears to be decreased variability and reach distance (Figure 1D), which results in increased misses (Figure 1G). This is mentioned in the discussion (lines 568-9), but not stated or quantified in the main text. If this is the case, it seems that this is an important point to make, since it gives clues about specific behavioral deficits that may be the source of impaired learning.</p><p>4) There seems to be missing figure panels in Figure 2 supplement 1. Both the main text and the figure legend referenced panels D and E, but I didn't see them in the actual figure. Related, I was wondering if the results described in lines 225 – 229 were from Antagonist vs. Vehicle mice rather than CCK-KO vs. WT mice; if so, please add panels D and E to Figure 2 and fix the relevant text.</p><p>5) The statistical tests in Figure 3H were done within each group and aimed to show whether there was any cross-day increase in neural activity correlation. However, it seems that if we compare the WT and antagonist groups, their day 6 neural activity correlations would be around the same level. Could the authors explain why? Was it because the antagonist group repetitively executed the same wrong movements (which could also be controlled by highly correlated, although &quot;incorrect&quot; neural activity)? If that's the case, the neural activity correlation score might not be an applicable indicator of motor learning in this context. If the authors were trying to show the neural plasticity underlying learning, then one metric that might be useful to measure is the correlation between neural activity on day 1 vs. day 6 (low cross-day correlations may suggest neural plasticity), assuming that the same neurons could be tracked across days.</p><p>6) The authors have provided evidence that restoring CCK in knock-out mice rescues motor function. However, they do not provide direct evidence that CCK enables motor cortical plasticity that causes this learning to happen -as claimed in the last sentence of the abstract, which should be edited. Showing this would require, for example, doing calcium imaging in the CCK-KO CCK4-injected mice and showing that motor cortical plasticity is also rescued in vivo. While we are not asking the authors to perform these additional experiments, they should discuss whether motor cortex is the only region responsible for the observed deficits, as well as how other areas not studied here could be confounding their results.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83897.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>Below follow the main points that should be addressed by the authors.</p><p>1) The authors should establish/discuss whether it can be concluded that the behavioral consequence of their various CCK manipulations is learning-specific.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your comments and suggestions.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Movement ability of WT and <italic>Cck<sup>-/-</sup></italic></p></list-item></list><p>We test the stride length, stride time, step cycle ratio and the grasp force of both <italic>Cck<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and WT mice.The result showed that the performance of <italic>Cck<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and WT mice was comparable in terms of these four parameters, indicating that knockout of <italic>cck</italic> gene did not affect the basic movement ability (Figure1-figure supplement 1C, D, E, F).

We first determined that over 98% of neurons in the rhinal cortex that projected to the motor cortex are CCK positive (Figure 6A, Figure 6-figure supplement 2A, D). Next, we injected the retro-Cre virus in the motor cortex and the Cre-dependent hM4Di in the rhinal cortex in C57BL/6 mice to specifically inhibit the CCK neurons from the rhinal cortex to the motor cortex. Compared to two control groups, the learning ability of the experimental group was significantly suppressed, suggesting that CCK projections from the rhinal cortex to the motor cortex are critical for motor skill learning (Figure 6). Detailed description was added in the part of &quot;Result&quot; in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Related to the above: normal neural plasticity should be essential to motor skill learning throughout development not just during the current task. Did these CCK knock-out mice present any motor deficits that could have resulted from a lack of CCK-mediated neural plasticity during development?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your comments and suggestions.</p><p>Development is mainly gene-guided which prepares the physical structure for learning, while learning is dependent on the neural plasticity and a period of experience (such as motor training in this research). Besides, development is deemed as &quot;experience-expectant&quot;, using common environmental information, while learning is &quot;experience-dependent&quot;, sensitive to the specific individual experiences (Greenough et al., 1987; Galván, 2010). Moreover, development costs longer time to form a specific ability of a species in general. The role played by CCK in the development is not clear. Duchemin et al. (1987) studied the <italic>cck</italic> gene expression level in the brain of rats pre- and postnatally. They found that the <italic>cck</italic> mRNA was detectable on embryonic day 14 (E14) and gradually increased to the maximum level on postnatal day 14 (P14), indicating that CCK might participate in the development of rats. Paolo et al. (2007) mapped the expression of CCK in the mouse brain. Plentiful CCK expression was observed at E12.5 in the thalamus and spinal cord, and by E17.5, CCK expression extended to the cortex, hippocampus and hypothalamus, suggesting that CCK might also regulate the development of mice. Paolo et al. (2004) found that CCK suppressed the migration of GnRH-1 through CCK-A receptor in the brain. Besides, postnatal early learning may participate in development. CCK-B receptor antagonist administration (postnatal 6 hours) suppressed lambs get mother preference, indicating that CCK might be important for the development of mother preference of sheep. However, what the role played by CCK in the development of motor system is not well studied.</p><p>In this study, the performance of both <italic>Cck<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and WT mice is at the same level without significant difference on Day one, in terms of the percentage of &quot;miss&quot;, &quot;no-grasp&quot;, &quot;drop&quot; and &quot;success&quot;. Besides, the movement abilities, including stride length, stride time, step cycle ratio and grasp force, were comparable for both <italic>Cck<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and WT mice (Figure 1-figure supplement 1C, D, E, F), suggesting that knockout of <italic>cck</italic> gene did not affect the basic movement ability. This could be because the development of basic movement ability is not learning-guided, but is physical structure-determined. We further applied CCK-BR antagonist and chemogenetic method to make up the potential defects of <italic>Cck<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The CCK4 rescue experiment demonstrates the sufficiency of CCK in promoting motor learning. However, it lacked specificity: IP injection did not allow specific &quot;gain of function&quot; in the motor cortex but instead, the improved learning ability in CCK knock-out mice could be a result of a global effect of CCK4 across multiple brain regions.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your suggestions.</p><p>First, the specificity of the circuit were studied by injecting a Cre virus in the MC and a Cre-dependent hM4Di virus in the RC. After injection with clozapine, the motor learning ability were significantly suppressed compared with the saline control and the control virus combined with clozapine.</p><p>Besides, we emphasized that the importance of the motor cortex in motor learning, not meant that other brain areas where also receive CCK-positive neuronal projections from the rhinal cortex, for example hippocampus (spatial memory), are not important for the performance of this task. Specific infusion the drug into the motor cortex is hard to rescue the motor learning ability of <italic>Cck<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice because the motor cortex is very large, varying from AP: -1.3 to 2.46 mm and ML: ±0.5 to ±2.75 mm and other areas receiving CCK projections from the rhinal cortex also could be important for motor learning. Direct infusion the drug into the motor cortex through a drug cannula, is hard to compensate the knock out of <italic>cck</italic> gene in the whole brain (Figure 7-figure supplement 1D, E). Besides, cannula implantation causes inescapable injury to the motor cortex, because the cannula must be inserted into the brain, so that the drug could be infused into the brain.

For example, in the experiments injecting CCK receptor antagonists, injections into the ipsilateral motor cortex would evidence area specificity, and injections after learning would demonstrate learning specificity. Likewise, in the experiments inhibiting rhinal CCK neurons, inhibiting specifically the motor cortex-projecting neurons would show pathway specificity, and performing this manipulation after learning would show learning specificity.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your comments and suggestions.</p><p>In this study, we focus on the role played by CCK from the rhinal cortex, and how CCK affects motor learning. The single pellet reaching task was selected to study the role of CCK from the rhinal cortex in motor skill learning and the motor cortex is considered as the main area generates motor memory when training in this task (Komiyama et al., 2010; Peters et al., 2014; Richard et al., 2019). We emphasized that the importance of the contrallateral motor cortex in motor learning, not meant that other brain areas where also receive CCK-positive neural projections from the rhina cortex, for example hippocampus (spatial memory), are not important for the performance of this task. In fact, specifically inhibiting the projection from the rhinal cortex to the contrallateral motor cortex is not enough to suppress the motor learning ability, but inhibiting projecting in both sides of motor cortex (contro- and ipsi-lateral) could suppress the learning ability of mice, suggesting that the whole motor cortex is critical for motor skill learning (Figure 6, Figure 6-figure supplement 3). In this paper, we studied the relationship between the rhinal cortex and the motor cortex and the role played by CCK in this circuit. The specificity of the motor cortex is task-dependent, not the main purpose in this study.</p><p>The antagonist and chemogenetic manipulations were carried out after mice learned the skill of the task as you suggested, and the results suggested that antagonist or chemogenetic manipulation did not cause any defects to the movement ability of mice (Fgiure 2-figure supplement 1D, Figure 6-figure supplement 3D).</p><p>The specificity of the CCK-projection from the rhinal cortex to the motor cortex for motor skill learning was studied using chemogenetic methods in the revised version of the paper. We first determined that over 98% of neurons in the rhinal cortex that projected to the motor cortex are CCK positive (Figure 6A, Figure 6-figure supplement 2A, B). Next, we injected the retro-Cre virus in the motor cortex and the Cre-dependent hM4Di in the rhinal cortex in C57BL/6 mice to specifically inhibit the CCK neurons from the rhinal cortex to the motor cortex. Compared to two control groups, the learning ability of the experimental group was significant suppressed, suggesting that CCK projections from the rhinal cortex to the motor cortex are critical for motor skill learning (Figure 6).

I understand that the authors here focus on the motor system, but providing a more comprehensive behavioral assessment of CCK knock-out mice could be very useful to strengthen the claim that the impaired performance in the pellet-reaching task was not due to weakened overall learning ability (e.g., memory deficits) or pre-existing motor deficits but specific to learning new motor skills. It could also help readers have a better understanding of how CCK knock-out mice behave similarly or differently in the current study compared to mice injected with CCK antagonists only in the motor cortex, as well as compared to knock-out mice in previous studies.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your comments.</p><p>We test the stride length, stride time, step cycle ratio and the grasp force of both <italic>Cck<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and WT mice.

Alternatively, if hM4Di cannot be sufficiently expressed in axon terminals, maybe express inhibitory opsins in rhinal cortical neurons and implant optic fibers in the motor cortex to inhibit the axon terminals of rhinal cortical projections. Then observe if animals with targeted inhibition of the rhinal-motor cortical projection also express motor learning deficits.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your comments and suggestions.</p><p>We added some experiments based on your suggestions. We injected a retrograde AAV- Cre virus into the motor cortex and a Cre dependent hM4Di virus into the rhinal cortex to specifically inhibit the CCK projection from the rhinal cortex to the motor cortex. The superficial neurons in the motor cortex is very important for motor skills learning, as it receives CCK projection from the rhinal cortex (Figure 4B).

Therefore, I was wondering: in addition to Figure 4, could the authors show 3.1) the major downstream targets of rhinal CCK neural projections, and 3.2) the major upstream CCK-expressing brain regions that project to the motor cortex?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your comments and suggestions.</p><p>The motor cortex also receive CCK projections from other cortices, such as the contralateral motor cortex, the deep layer of visual cortex and auditory cortex, and thalamus (Figure 4-figure supplement 1A, B, C). The downstream targets of rhinal CCK projections, including the auditory cortex, visual cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala, were studied in our lab before (Li et al.,2014; Chen et al., 2019; Su et al. 2019; Feng et al. 2021).

Specific infusion the drug into the motor cortex is hard to rescue the motor learning ability of <italic>Cck<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice because the motor cortex is very large, varying from AP: -1.3 to 2.46 mm and ML: ±0.5 to ±2.75 mm and other areas receiving CCK projections from the rhinal cortex also could be important for motor learning. Actually, we tried to inject CCK into the motor cortex through a drug cannula, but the result showed that it is hard to compensate the knock out of <italic>cck</italic> gene in the whole brain, and rescue the motor learning ability (Figure 7-figure supplement 1D, E). Moreover, cannula implantation causes inescapable injury to the motor cortex, because the cannula must be inserted into the brain, so that the drug could be infused into the brain.

The activity of the RC-MC pathway is causally tested, and these neurons are shown to be almost entirely CCK positive, but the CCK antagonist and rescue manipulations are either systemic or MC-localized. It is therefore not directly shown that CCK in RC-MC neurons is the critical factor for learning. The paper is still interesting, although since this claim is the title of the paper, it may be worth reconsidering the title.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your comments and suggestions. The title was revised to &quot;Cholecystokinin facilitates motor skill learning by modulating neuroplasticity in the motor cortex&quot;.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Another concern about the CCK antagonist experiment is that there might be CCK-positive, GABAergic neurons locally in the motor cortex, in addition to the axons projected from the rhinal CCK neurons. Injecting a CCK antagonist would thus likely lead to mixed effects from inhibiting local inhibitory neurons (i.e., disinhibition) + suppressing excitatory input from the rhinal cortex. I understand that this might be beyond the scope of the current study, but it would be important if the authors could point out this limitation when discussing their CCK antagonist results in the main text.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your suggestions.

This is mentioned in the discussion (lines 568-9), but not stated or quantified in the main text. If this is the case, it seems that this is an important point to make, since it gives clues about specific behavioral deficits that may be the source of impaired learning.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your comments and suggestions.</p><p>In our manuscript, Figure 1E shows that the variability of reach trajectories (Hausdorff Distance) is significantly reduced with training in WT mice, but not in <italic>Cck<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice.

The behavioral variations between individual animals of the same genotype might require larger sample size to detect any potential significance in between-subject comparisons. On the other hand, what we reported in Figure 1E is based on within-subject comparison of learning-related reduction in motor variability, which is present in WT mice but impaired in <italic>Cck<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice.

Both the main text and the figure legend referenced panels D and E, but I didn't see them in the actual figure.

However, it seems that if we compare the WT and antagonist groups, their day 6 neural activity correlations would be around the same level. Could the authors explain why? Was it because the antagonist group repetitively executed the same wrong movements (which could also be controlled by highly correlated, although &quot;incorrect&quot; neural activity)? If that's the case, the neural activity correlation score might not be an applicable indicator of motor learning in this context. If the authors were trying to show the neural plasticity underlying learning, then one metric that might be useful to measure is the correlation between neural activity on day 1 vs. day 6 (low cross-day correlations may suggest neural plasticity), assuming that the same neurons could be tracked across days.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your comments and suggestions.</p><p>Layer 2/3 of motor cortex is considered as the main layer driving neurons in the deep layer to produce motor cortex output. The neuronal activity of layer 2/3 is correlated with the movement of mice and the correlation increases with motor training (Peters et al., 2014). We compared the trial-to-trial population activity correlation of Day 1 to that of Day 6 to demonstrate that the neuroplasticity of neurons in layer 2/3 of <italic>Cck</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and Antagonist group was significantly suppressed due to the lack of CCK. We deemed the neuronal activity correlation on Day 1 without prior motor training as the baseline, and the increase of correlation on Day 6 compared with that on Day 1 as an index of motor learning, similar to the previous study (Peters et al. 2014).</p><p>The baseline of neuronal activity correlation of <italic>Cck</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and Antagonist groups may be directly affected by CCK, as many CCK-positive neurons, including inhibitory and excitatory neurons, are located in the layer 2/3 of the motor cortex (Watakabe et al., 2012). Higher baseline of <italic>Cck</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and Antagonist may be because the fact that deficiency of CCK suppressed the exploration of the optimal path and abandonment of ineffective movements that would otherwise occur in wildtype mice. Because the neuroplasticity was suppressed in <italic>Cck</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and Antagonist groups, the neuronal correlation did not increase with training.</p><p>Besides, the correlation between trials is only one dimension for assessing the neuronal activity changes with learning. The “activated population activity” (Figure 3E, F) was also applied to show that CCK deficiency could suppress the neuronal plasticity of <italic>Cck</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and Antagonist groups.</p><p>The correlation of neuronal activity between Day 1 and Day 6 also can be used to assess the neuronal activity changes with learning. However, neurons detected by one-photon miniscope on Day 1 and Day 6 were not totally the same because motor training also shaped the pattern of activated neurons: some neurons were activated on Day 1, but quiescent on Day 6, vice versa. Therefore, it is hard to definitively track all the same neurons through the training period using the miniscope.</p><p>To address the limitation highlighted in the reviewer’s comments, we calculated the &quot;increase of trial-to-trial population activity correlation&quot; to make it more comprehensible for readers (Figure 3—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors have provided evidence that restoring CCK in knock-out mice rescues motor function. However, they do not provide direct evidence that CCK enables motor cortical plasticity that causes this learning to happen -as claimed in the last sentence of the abstract, which should be edited. Showing this would require, for example, doing calcium imaging in the CCK-KO CCK4-injected mice and showing that motor cortical plasticity is also rescued in vivo. While we are not asking the authors to perform these additional experiments, they should discuss whether motor cortex is the only region responsible for the observed deficits, as well as how other areas not studied here could be confounding their results.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your comments and suggestions.
