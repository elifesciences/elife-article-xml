Recently, G-protein-coupled receptors have been involved in myogenic vasoconstriction, but the downstream signalling mechanisms and the in-vivo-function of this myogenic autoregulation are poorly understood. Here, we show that small arteries from mice with smooth muscle-specific loss of G<sub>12</sub>/G<sub>13</sub> or the Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor ARHGEF12 have lost myogenic vasoconstriction. This defect was accompanied by loss of RhoA activation, while vessels showed normal increases in intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. In the absence of myogenic vasoconstriction, perfusion of peripheral organs was increased, systemic vascular resistance was reduced and cardiac output and left ventricular mass were increased. In addition, animals with defective myogenic vasoconstriction showed aggravated hypotension in response to endotoxin. We conclude that G<sub>12</sub>/G<sub>13</sub>- and Rho-mediated signaling plays a key role in myogenic vasoconstriction and that myogenic tone is required to maintain local and systemic vascular resistance under physiological and pathological condition.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>myogenic vasoconstriction</kwd><kwd>vascular smooth muscle</kwd><kwd>G-protein</kwd><kwd>Rho/Rho-kinase</kwd><kwd>myogenic tone</kwd><kwd>signal transduction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Open-access funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Offermanns</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This study was funded by the Max Planck Society.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic mouse models identify a critical mechanism of myogenic vasoconstriction and reveal the in vivo function of myogenic autoregulation in protecting from organ overperfusion and in maintaining vascular resistance.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The tone of arterial blood vessels controls blood flow and is constantly regulated by multiple stimuli including the blood flow itself as well as various neural and humoral stimuli. A particular form of autoregulation, the myogenic response, was first described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bayliss (1902)</xref>, who observed that stretch imposed on the vascular wall by an increase in intraluminal pressure induced a contraction of the vessel. This ability of vascular smooth muscle cells to respond to mechanical stretch has been observed in a variety of vascular beds. It has been suggested that myogenic vasoconstriction is involved in maintaining basal vascular tone to promote constant perfusion despite fluctuations in perfusion pressure and to prevent tissue damage in cases of overperfusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davis and Hill, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Loutzenhiser et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Walsh and Cole, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carlström et al., 2015</xref>). However, in vivo evidence for this is still lacking.</p><p>As any vascular smooth muscle contraction, the myogenic response goes along with phosphorylation of the myosin light chain (MLC), which allows myosin to interact with actin and to generate contractile forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Somlyo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vetterkind and Morgan, 2012</xref>). MLC phosphorylation can be increased by activation of the MLC kinase (MLCK) through a Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and calmodulin-dependent mechanism or by inhibition of myosin phosphatase via the Rho/Rho-kinase pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Somlyo and Somlyo, 2000</xref>). How these two pathways are regulated during myogenic constriction of vascular smooth muscle cells is incompletely understood. Both stretch-activated ion channels and mechanically activated G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have been shown to play a role in the initiation of the myogenic response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kauffenstein et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schubert et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mederos Y Schnitzler et al., 2016</xref>). It is widely believed that induction of vascular myogenic contraction requires membrane depolarization through activation of mechanically activated ion channels which would then induce opening of voltage-dependent calcium channels resulting in an increase in intracellular calcium concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davis and Hill, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kauffenstein et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Knot and Nelson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Welsh et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jensen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hill et al., 2010</xref>). Although several ion channels have been involved in stretch-induced depolarization, including the transient receptor potential (TRP) channels TRPC6 and TRPM4, the molecular nature of the channel responsible for stretch-induced depolarization of vascular smooth muscle cells has remained elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kauffenstein et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Earley and Brayden, 2015</xref>).</p><p>More recently, several GPCRs have been involved in the myogenic response of vascular smooth muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kauffenstein et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mederos Y Schnitzler et al., 2016</xref>). These include the purinergic P2Y<sub>6</sub> receptor, the thromboxane A<sub>2</sub> (TP) receptor, sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors as well as the angiotensin AT<sub>1</sub> receptor and the cysteinyl leukotriene one receptors (CysLT<sub>1</sub>Rs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mederos y Schnitzler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schleifenbaum et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Storch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kauffenstein et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kroetsch and Bolz, 2013</xref>). While stretch-induced activation of P2Y<sub>6</sub>, TP and S1P receptors is believed to involve the release of agonistic ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kauffenstein et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kauffenstein et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kroetsch and Bolz, 2013</xref>), evidence has been provided that mechanical activation of AT<sub>1</sub> and CysLT<sub>1</sub> receptors occurs in an agonist-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mederos Y Schnitzler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mederos y Schnitzler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Storch et al., 2015</xref>). The GPCRs implicated in vascular myogenic contraction can couple to several G-proteins including G<sub>q</sub>/G<sub>11</sub> and G<sub>12</sub>/G<sub>13</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kauffenstein et al., 2012</xref>). Previous work has shown that in vascular smooth muscle cells coupling of receptors to G<sub>q</sub>/G<sub>11</sub> through stimulation of phospholipase C-β results in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and calmodulin-dependent activation of MLCK, whereas coupling to G<sub>12</sub>/G<sub>13</sub> via activation of the Rho/Rho-kinase pathway results in the inhibition of myosin phosphatase and that these two pathways can synergize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gohla et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Somlyo and Somlyo, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wirth et al., 2008</xref>). Myogenic contraction can be strongly reduced by pharmacological inhibition of Rho-kinase downstream of G<sub>12</sub>/G<sub>13</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schubert et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li and Brayden, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moreno-Domínguez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schubert et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gokina et al., 2005</xref>) as well as of G<sub>q</sub>/G<sub>11</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Storch et al., 2015</xref>). However, since these approaches also affect the function of other vascular cells, including endothelial cells, and since pharmacological tools are in many cases not specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bain et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gao and Jacobson, 2016</xref>), the role of the two major G-protein-mediated signaling transduction pathways inducing vascular smooth muscle contraction in myogenic tone regulation remains unclear.</p><p>To understand the function of G<sub>q</sub>/G<sub>11</sub>- and G<sub>12</sub>/G<sub>13</sub>-mediated signaling pathways in vascular myogenic contraction and to better understand the role of myogenic vasoconstriction in vivo, we studied vessels and animals with inducible smooth muscle-specific Gα<sub>q</sub>/Gα<sub>11</sub> and Gα<sub>12</sub>/Gα<sub>13</sub> deficiency. Using in vitro and in vivo experiments, we found that G<sub>12</sub>/G<sub>13</sub> and the Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor ARHGEF12 are required for the myogenic response. By using mice lacking G<sub>12</sub>/G<sub>13</sub> or ARHGEF12 in smooth muscle cells as a model for defective myogenic vasoconstriction, we found that myogenic tone is critical for maintaining basal peripheral resistance and proper organ perfusion under physiological and pathophysiological conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Myogenic autoregulation in arteries depends on smooth muscle G<sub>12</sub>/G<sub>13</sub> function</title><p>To analyze the role of G<sub>q</sub>/G<sub>11</sub> and G<sub>12</sub>/G<sub>13</sub> in vascular myogenic contraction, we used tamoxifen-inducible smooth muscle-specific Gα<sub>q</sub>/Gα<sub>11</sub>- and Gα<sub>12</sub>/Gα<sub>13</sub>-deficient mice described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wirth et al., 2008</xref>), henceforth called Sm-q/11-KO and Sm-12/13-KO, respectively. To analyze myogenic contraction in these animals, we performed pressure myography on first or second order mesenteric arteries from wild-type, Sm-q/11-KO and Sm-12/13-KO mice treated for five days with tamoxifen. Mesenteric arteries were exposed to stepwise (20 mmHg) increases in intraluminal pressure between 20 and 140 mmHg in the presence and absence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> to determine active and passive vessel diameter, respectively. A difference between the diameter in the presence and absence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> at each pressure step was defined as an active vasoconstriction. Stepwise increases in intraluminal pressure generated active contraction at pressures higher than 60 mmHg in mesenteric arteries from wild-type mice reaching peak contractions at about 80 to 120 mmHg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref> and Suppl. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Our data indicate that G<sub>q</sub>/G<sub>11</sub>-mediated signaling in vascular smooth muscle cells does not critically contribute to increases in intracellular free Ca<sup>2+</sup> or smooth muscle contraction during myogenic tone development whereas the role of G<sub>12</sub>/G<sub>13</sub>-mediated signaling and its downstream RhoA-dependent signaling pathway is important for myogenic tone development but does not contribute to mechanically induced increases in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. These data are consistent with a model of dual regulation of MLC-phosphorylation during myogenic contraction through a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and a Rho/Rho-kinase-dependent pathway, in which Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through mechanically activated plasma membrane ion channels is primarily responsible for inducing Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent MLC phosphorylation, whereas activation of GPCRs via G<sub>12</sub>/G<sub>13</sub> leads to activation of the Rho/Rho-kinase pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). It is possible that the relevance of these two pathways differs between different vascular beds. While we observed a complete loss of myogenic vasoconstriction in mesenteric arteries from Sm-12/13-KO mice, the myogenic response in cerebral arteries was not lost but reduced by about 50%. This may be due to a more dominant role of pressure-induced depolarization and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in cerebral arteries. G<sub>q</sub>/G<sub>11</sub>-mediated signaling downstream of GPCRs may contribute to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent signaling but is not required for myogenic vasoconstriction.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49374.017</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model of the role of G<sub>12</sub>/G<sub>13</sub> in vascular myogenic tone.</title><p>VDCC, voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels; TRP, transient receptor potential channels; PLC-β, phospholipase C-β; PIP<sub>2</sub>, phosphatidyl inositol bisphosphate; DAG, diacyl glycerol, IP<sub>3</sub>, inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate; LARG, RhoGEF protein ARHGEF12; MYPT1 and PPC1, regulatory and catalytic subunit of myosin phosphatase, respectively; ROCK, Rho-kinase.

Early observations showed that Sm-12/13-KO mice have a normal basal blood pressure but do not respond with arterial hypertension to desoxycorticosterone (DOCA)/NaCl treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wirth et al., 2008</xref>). The present study indicates that Sm-12/13-KO mice have an increased cardiac output due to an increased stroke volume, suggesting that loss of myogenic tone in Sm-12/13-KO mice results in a reduced vascular resistance compensated by increased cardiac output. Interestingly, we did not find signs of increased sympathetic activity or changes in angiotensin II and aldosterone levels. Thus, the increased stroke volume and increased cardiac output might just be the result of a reduced afterload. Similar observations have been made during physical exercise or after pharmacological inhibition of peripheral resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersen and Vik-Mo, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Radovits et al., 2013</xref>). The increased cardiac output was accompanied by myocardial hypertrophy resembling other forms of physiological hypertrophy as it did not go along with the expression of fetal genes such as those encoding natriuretic peptide A and B as well as the cardiac myosin heavy chain (Myh7) or skeletal muscle α-actin (Acta1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nakamura and Sadoshima, 2018</xref>). As described before, Acta1 expression was rather reduced 4 weeks after induction of smooth muscle-specific Gα<sub>12</sub>/Gα<sub>13</sub> deficiency typical for physiological cardiac hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nakamura and Sadoshima, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McMullen and Jennings, 2007</xref>). Also, 35 weeks after induction, no expression of fetal genes was observed, while 2 of 6 fibrosis marker genes showed a slight increase in expression. However, no fibrosis could be seen in histological sections of hearts 35 weeks after induction.</p><p>Our data clearly show that the reduced peripheral resistance in Sm-12/13-KO and Sm-Larg-KO mice resulting in increased cardiac output was accompanied by increased perfusion of the brain or the hind limb under basal conditions. This indicates that G<sub>12</sub>/G<sub>13</sub>-mediated myogenic tone protects organs against overperfusion. However, even 34 weeks after induction of smooth muscle-specific Gα<sub>12</sub>/Gα<sub>13</sub> deficiency and loss of myogenic tone, we did not observe any obvious morphological or functional defects in other organs than the heart. No formation of edema was observed as would have been expected from a loss of myogenic tone. This indicates that the myogenic vasoconstriction primarily functions to establish an underlying vascular tone on which humoral or neural vasodilatory and vasocontractile stimuli act to control the vascular diameter and to also compensate to some degree alterations of myogenic tone. However, under pathological conditions when these modulatory stimuli are dysregulated such as in severe cases of hypertension or hypotension myogenic autoregulation can only partially compensate the activity of vasoactive mediators. This is also indicated by earlier observations that loss of smooth muscle G<sub>12</sub>/G<sub>13</sub>-mediated signaling had no effect on basal blood pressure but strongly suppressed mineralocorticoid hypertension in the deoxycorticosterone/salt (DOCA/salt) model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wirth et al., 2008</xref>). Similarly, in the present study we show that endotoxin-induced hypotension is aggravated in Sm-12/13-KO mice suggesting that under septic conditions, which result in strong vasodilatation and hypotension, G<sub>12</sub>/G<sub>13</sub>-mediated myogenic tone is still intact and provides partial resistance against vasodilatory influences.</p><p>In conclusion, our findings indicate that G<sub>12</sub>/G<sub>13</sub>-mediated signaling through Rho and Rho-kinase in vascular smooth muscle plays a key role in mediating myogenic vasoconstriction, whereas G<sub>q</sub>/G<sub>11</sub>-mediated signaling plays no or only a minor role and appears not to be required for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated signaling in myogenic tone development. Our data suggest that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent signaling leading to myogenic contraction mainly relies on Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through plasma membrane ion channels, whereas the calcium-independent Rho/Rho-kinase-mediated signaling is induced through G<sub>12</sub>/G<sub>13</sub>-coupled receptors of which several have been reported to be involved in myogenic vasocontraction. Our data also indicate that myogenic vasoconstriction is required to maintain vascular tone as well as local and systemic vascular resistance under normal and disease conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

To assess the capillary density, heart sections were incubated with DAPI (1:1000) and IB4-AF488 conjugate (1:200) in PBS overnight and quantified using ImageJ software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Determination of catecholamine, angiotensin II and aldosterone levels</title><p>Two weeks after tamoxifen treatment, blood was collected from different experimental groups and plasma was prepared and snap-frozen. Plasma samples were stored at −80°C. To assess dopamine, noradrenaline and adrenaline concentrations 3 Catecholamines ELISA kit (BA-E-5600) from ImmuSmol was used. Plasma angiotensin II and aldosterone levels were determined using an ELISA from ENZO Life Sciences (ADI-900–204 and ADI-900–173). Analyses were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>qRT-PCR</title><p>Quantitative RT-PCR was performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sivaraj et al., 2013</xref>). Hearts were collected 4 weeks and 35 weeks after tamoxifen induction. RNA was isolated using Qiagen RNeasy mini kit, and cDNA was preamplified using ProtoScript II Reverse Transcriptase (M0368S, New England BioLabs).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Mark T Nelson as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Harry Dietz as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Chennupati et al. investigate the role of G<sub>12/13</sub> and Gq/11 signaling pathways downstream of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in myogenic constriction of resistance arteries (First/Second-order mesenteric, cerebral). Using mice with an inducible, smooth muscle-specific deficiency of Gαq/11 or Gα<sub>12/13</sub>, they found that G<sub>12/13</sub> signaling plays a major role in myogenic constriction, whereas Gq/11 signaling does not. These results are somewhat surprising given numerous literature reports that Gαq/11-coupled GPCRs act as mechanosensors in the myogenic response, sharpening the impact of the manuscript. A role for the ARHGEF12 (Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor) and RhoA-mediated signaling in Gα<sub>12/13</sub>-dependent myogenic responses was confirmed using inducible, smooth muscle-specific Arhgef12-deficient animals and biochemical (RhoA kinase activity measurements) and pharmacological (Rho-kinase inhibitor Y-27632) approaches. Chennupati et al. further demonstrated that the reduced systemic vascular resistance associated with the loss of myogenic constriction in Gα<sub>12/13</sub>-deficient mice was accompanied by a compensatory increase in cardiac output and physiological cardiac hypertrophy, with the net result being an increase in the perfusion of peripheral organs. The experimental approaches used are sound and compellingly support the authors' conclusion that G<sub>12/13</sub>- and RhoA-mediated signaling plays a key role in myogenic vasoconstriction and that myogenic tone is required to maintain local and systemic vascular resistance.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Why first/second-order mesenteric arteries? A subset of experiments in third order mesenteric arteries should be done (or shown, if already performed), given the previous report (cited by the authors) that inhibition of Gq/11 signaling blunts myogenic tone in third order mesenteric arteries.</p><p>2) There appears to be at least two mechano-sensitive processes: 1) Membrane depolarization and opening of voltage-dependent calcium channels. 2) G<sub>12/13</sub>- and RhoA-mediated decrease in MLC dephosphorylation. The authors suggest that based on one supplementary figure without original data that neither Gαq/11 or Gα<sub>12/13</sub> is involved in the pressure-induced increase in calcium in larger mesenteric arteries, which require relatively high pressures for a myogenic response. This would be a significant result on its own if there were more data. Furthermore, what is swept under the rug, is that the pressure-induced constrictions of cerebral arteries are only attenuated in the Gα<sub>12/13</sub> KO, and there are no accompanying calcium or membrane potential measurements. Possible explanations should be discussed, e.g. more robust engagement of pressure-induced depolarization/calcium elevation in cerebral arteries. This should be discussed. It is possible that a balance between two mechanisms may determine the sensitivity to pressure.</p><p>3) Image of brain perfusion in SM-q/11-KO mice does not appear to be representative of summary data (overall impression of high intensity areas is closer to that of the other KOs than it is to the control). Should replace image with one that is more representative and provide additional detail on how images were quantified.</p><p>4) G<sub>12/13</sub> would presumably need to be activated in order to signal to RhoA and downstream response to inducers of myogenic constriction. It is not clear how this pathway is turned on. Ex vivo the authors use increasing vascular pressure. While it is possible that there is mechanical input the authors state the more likely physiological mechanism in their conclusion, indicating that &quot;RhoA/Rho kinase mediated signaling is induced through G<sub>12/13</sub> coupled receptors&quot;. The schematic also shows black dots which are unlabelled but perhaps meant to connote some GPCR ligand? The authors should clarify what they think is happening ex vivo, as well as in vivo where absence of G<sub>12/13</sub> (thus presumably loss of signaling through a GPCR coupled to it) leads to changes in perfusion and ultimately alterations in cardiac function. The literature, or the authors own findings, using KOs for G<sub>12/13</sub> linked receptors such as S1P, TXA2, PAR1 should be reviewed and used to provide a more scholarly discussion of myogenic vascular control mechanisms.</p><p>5) The schematic in Figure 5 leaves out some of the molecules involved in the transduction pathways under study. In light of the particular focus on the RhoA/Rho Kinase pathway, the myosin binding subunit MYPT-1 which is not depicted is the known substrate of Rho kinase and it has been widely used as a readout for activation of this pathway. Phospor-Abs are available. Evidence that this substrate is regulated – both increased in response to transmural pressure and lost in the G<sub>12/13</sub> knockout, should be provided. Measurement of myosin phosphorylation is also possible but less useful since it reflects both the Ca increase in MLCK and Rho-mediated decrease in MLC phosphatase. The schematic in Figure 5 could be enhanced.</p><p>6) The Myh7, Acta1, and other fibrosis-related genes were not increased in the hypertrophied heart of the Sm-12/13 mice. How do cardiomyocytes become hypertrophic without an increase of contractile proteins? The authors should discuss this point.</p><p>7) What are the consequences of hyper-perfusion of blood in kidney and brain? Is urine volume comparable between the Sm-12/13 and control mice? Did the authors check the sleep-wakefulness? Although the functional PET imaging is unnecessary, those regular physiological examinations might be done by the authors?</p><p>8) The main target of RhoA is likely to be Rho-kinase in the regulation of vascular resistance in the present study; however, there has no obvious data in the present study. Therefore, the authors should tone down the description in the Discussion section.</p><p>9) Can the authors overexpress constitutive active RhoA in the vascular smooth muscle in the Sm-12/13 KO to see whether high output is changed or unchanged by the vascular tones? (this is not a mandatory experiment).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49374.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Why first/second-order mesenteric arteries?

The literature, or the authors own findings, using KOs for G<sub>12/13</sub> linked receptors such as S1P, TXA2, PAR1 should be reviewed and used to provide a more scholarly discussion of myogenic vascular control mechanisms.</p></disp-quote><p>We have not performed experiments to identify the G-protein-coupled receptors involved in myogenic tone regulation in mesenteric and cerebral arteries. Several studies have shown particular GPCRs to be involved in these responses, and we are now discussing this aspect in an own paragraph in the Discussion (see Discussion, second paragraph). We also have added some more explanation to the schematic in order to better describe the principal mechanisms of GPCR involvement in myogenic vasoconstriction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The schematic in Figure 5 leaves out some of the molecules involved in the transduction pathways under study. In light of the particular focus on the RhoA/Rho Kinase pathway, the myosin binding subunit MYPT-1 which is not depicted is the known substrate of Rho kinase and it has been widely used as a readout for activation of this pathway. Phospor-Abs are available. Evidence that this substrate is regulated – both increased in response to transmural pressure and lost in the G<sub>12/13</sub> knockout, should be provided. Measurement of myosin phosphorylation is also possible but less useful since it reflects both the Ca increase in MLCK and Rho-mediated decrease in MLC phosphatase. The schematic in Figure 5 could be enhanced.</p></disp-quote><p>We have improved the schematic in Figure 6 (we assume this is the figure the reviewer meant) to better show the mechanism of Rho-kinase-regulated myosin phosphatase activity. We have also performed additional experiments to determine MYPT-1 phosphorylation in pressurized arteries from wild-type and Sm-12/13-KO mice. We found the MYPT-1 phosphorylation seen in response to induction of myogenic vasoconstriction of mesenteric arteries from wild-type mice was not seen in vessels from Sm-12/13-KO animals. These data are now presented in Figure 1G.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The Myh7, Acta1, and other fibrosis-related genes were not increased in the hypertrophied heart of the Sm-12/13 mice. How do cardiomyocytes become hypertrophic without an increase of contractile proteins? The authors should discuss this point.</p></disp-quote><p>What we measured was actually the relative expression of several genes, including Myh7 and Acta1 compared to Gapdh. Thus, the total amount of contractile proteins may well increase. An increase in the relative expression of skeletal muscle actin (ACTA1) and of the -myosin heavy chain (MYH7), which is predominant in the embryonic heart, is a hallmark of a pathological hypertrophy, whereas a physiological hypertrophy goes along with reduced relative expression of these genes or no expression change (Song et al., PLoS ONE 7, e35552 (2012); Nakamura and Sadoshima, 2018). We now discuss this point in the Discussion (see Discussion, fourth paragraph), and conclude that the cardiac hypertrophy seen in our model resembles physiological hypertrophy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) What are the consequences of hyper-perfusion of blood in kidney and brain? Is urine volume comparable between the Sm-12/13 and control mice? Did the authors check the sleep-wakefulness? Although the functional PET imaging is unnecessary, those regular physiological examinations might be done by the authors?</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed some basal analysis of kidney and brain function in Sm-12/13-KO and wild-type mice. This includes determination of urine volume, glomerular filtration rate, blood urea nitrogen and plasma creatinine levels. We also analyzed circadian activity to determine sleep-wakefulness as well as total activity and performed rotarod, bar cross and mesh grip tests to evaluate motoric functions. In none of the tests did we observe a significant difference between both groups. Thus, we conclude that the organ overperfusion within the time period studied does not lead to major kidney or brain dysfunction. These data are now presented in Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The main target of RhoA is likely to be Rho-kinase in the regulation of vascular resistance in the present study; however, there has no obvious data in the present study. Therefore, the authors should tone down the description in the Discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>We have in fact used the Rho-kinase inhibitor Y-27632 and tested its effect on myogenic vasoconstriction in mesenteric arteries (see Figure 1F). Y-27632 completely blocked myogenic vasoconstriction. This has already been shown in other vessels before (e.g. Gokina et al., 1985; Dubroca et al., 2005). Thus, we conclude that Rhokinase plays a critical role downstream of G<sub>12</sub>/G<sub>13</sub> and RhoA. However, this does not exclude other signaling pathways being involved downstream of G<sub>12</sub>/G<sub>13</sub>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Can the authors overexpress constitutive active RhoA in the vascular smooth muscle in the Sm-12/13 KO to see whether high output is changed or unchanged by the vascular tones? (this is not a mandatory experiment).</p></disp-quote><p>We have not performed this experiment. We are also skeptical whether overexpression of a constitutively active small GTPase would be an appropriate tool since the overactivation of RhoA signaling will certainly lead to various other effects, which would indirectly affect vascular tone. One might think of using an inducible system, which allows to titrate the levels of constitutively active RhoA. However, this is a technically very challenging approach, and it would probably require about a year to establish it.</p></body></sub-article></article>
