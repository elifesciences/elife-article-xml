those of HIV. While P-TEFb is regulated by 7SK snRNA in proliferating cells, P-TEFb is absent due to diminished levels of CycT1 in quiescent and terminally differentiated cells, which has remained unexplored. In these cells, we found that CycT1 not bound to CDK9 is rapidly degraded. Moreover, productive CycT1:CDK9 interactions are increased by PKC-mediated phosphorylation of CycT1 in human cells. Conversely, dephosphorylation of CycT1 by PP1 reverses this process. Thus, PKC inhibitors or removal of PKC by chronic activation results in P-TEFb disassembly and CycT1 degradation. This finding not only recapitulates P-TEFb depletion in resting CD4+ T cells but also in anergic T cells. Importantly, our studies reveal mechanisms of P-TEFb inactivation underlying T cell quiescence, anergy, and exhaustion as well as proviral latency and terminally differentiated cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>P-TEFb</kwd><kwd>PKC</kwd><kwd>PP1</kwd><kwd>phosphorylation</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>anergy</kwd><kwd>exhaustion</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AI049104</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Fang</given-names></name><name><surname>Cary</surname><given-names>Daniele C</given-names></name><name><surname>Paculova</surname><given-names>Hana</given-names></name><name><surname>Peterlin</surname><given-names>Boris Matija</given-names></name><name><surname>Fujinaga</surname><given-names>Koh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01 AI091580</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nguyen</surname><given-names>Trang TT</given-names></name><name><surname>Weiss</surname><given-names>Arthur</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P50AI150476</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Fang</given-names></name><name><surname>Echeverria</surname><given-names>Ignacia</given-names></name><name><surname>Paculova</surname><given-names>Hana</given-names></name><name><surname>Sali</surname><given-names>Andrej</given-names></name><name><surname>Peterlin</surname><given-names>Boris Matija</given-names></name><name><surname>Fujinaga</surname><given-names>Koh</given-names></name><name><surname>Cary</surname><given-names>Daniele C</given-names></name><name><surname>Rakesh</surname><given-names>Ramachandran</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nguyen</surname><given-names>Trang TT</given-names></name><name><surname>Weiss</surname><given-names>Arthur</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001021</institution-id><institution>Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nguyen</surname><given-names>Trang TT</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Nora Eccles Treadwell Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Fang</given-names></name><name><surname>Fujinaga</surname><given-names>Koh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cyclin T1 phosphorylation determines levels of P-TEFb via stabilizing interactions between cyclin T1 and CDK9.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In eukaryotic cells, coding gene expression starts with transcription of DNA to RNA by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) in the nucleus. This process consists of initiation, promoter clearance, capping, elongation, and termination upon which the transcribed single-strand RNA is cleaved and poly-adenylated before transport to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lis, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Peterlin and Price, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Proudfoot, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>). Clearance of RNAPII from promoters requires the phosphorylation of its C-terminal domain (CTD) at position 5 (Ser5) in tandemly repeated heptapeptide (52 repeats of Tyr1-Ser2-Pro3-Thr4-Ser5-Pro6-Ser7) by cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) from the transcription factor-II H (TFIIH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chapman et al., 2008</xref>). Of interest, promoters of most inactive and inducible genes are already engaged by stalled RNAPII, which departs from the transcription start site (TSS) but pauses after transcribing 20â100-nucleotides-long transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rahl et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The pause of RNAPII is caused by two factors, the negative elongation factor (NELF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yamaguchi et al., 1999</xref>) and DRB sensitivity-inducing factor (DSIF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wada et al., 1998a</xref>). The release of RNAPII for productive elongation requires the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), which is composed of cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) and C-type cyclins T1 or T2 (CycT1 or CycT2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>). Compared to the largely restricted expression of CycT2, CycT1 is expressed ubiquitously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Peng et al., 1998</xref>). N-terminus of CycT1 contains two highly conserved cyclin boxes for CDK9 binding, followed by the Tat-TAR recognition motif (TRM), a coil-coiled motif, the histidine (His)-rich motif that binds to the CTD, and a C-terminal PEST motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Taube et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wei et al., 1998</xref>). CDK9 is a Ser/Thr proline-directed kinase (i.e., PITALRE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">GraÃ±a et al., 1994</xref>) that phosphorylates Spt5 in DSIF and NELF-E, which relieve the pausing of RNAPII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fujinaga et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ivanov et al., 2000</xref>). After phosphorylation, NELF is released and DSIF is converted to an elongation factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wada et al., 1998b</xref>). Serine at position 2 (Ser2) in the CTD is also phosphorylated by CDK9 before RNAPIIâs transition to productive elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Peterlin and Price, 2006</xref>). Thus, P-TEFb is a critical factor for transcriptional elongation and co-transcriptional processing by RNAPII.</p><p>In the organism, the kinase activity of P-TEFb is kept under a tight control to maintain the appropriate state of growth and proliferation of cells. To ensure this balance, a large complex, known as the 7SK small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (7SK snRNP), sequesters a large amount of P-TEFb (from 50 to 90% in different cells) in an inactive state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Peterlin et al., 2012</xref>). 7SK snRNP consists of the abundant 7SK small nuclear RNA (7SK snRNA), hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA)-inducible mRNAs 1 and 2 (HEXIM1/2) proteins, La-related protein 7 (LARP7), and methyl phosphate capping enzyme (MePCE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Michels and Bensaude, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>). Proper levels and activities of P-TEFb ensure appropriate responses to external stimuli. They also maintain states of differentiation, growth, and proliferation of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">C Quaresma et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fujinaga, 2020</xref>). Dysregulation of the P-TEFb equilibrium contributes to various diseases such as solid tumors (mutation in LARP7), leukemias and lymphomas (DNA translocations leading to aberrant recruitment of P-TEFb), and cardiac hypertrophy (inactivation of HEXIM1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Franco et al., 2018</xref>). Cellular stresses such as ultraviolet (UV) irradiation and heat, as well as various small compounds such as histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), HMBA and bromodomain extra-terminal domain (BET) inhibitors (JQ1), also promote the release of P-TEFb from the 7SK snRNP in a reversible manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>). Despite these important cellular responses, different viruses, such as HIV, HTLV, EBV, HSV, HCMV, and others, have evolved different strategies to utilize P-TEFb for their own replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mbonye et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zaborowska et al., 2016</xref>). For example, the HIV transactivator of transcription (Tat) not only binds to free P-TEFb but also promotes the release of P-TEFb from 7SK snRNP. Tat:P-TEFb then binds to the trans-activation response (TAR) RNA stem loop to activate the transcription of viral genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Selby and Peterlin, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wei et al., 1998</xref>). Additionally, the establishment of viral latency in quiescent cells parallels the disappearance of P-TEFb, which can be reversed by cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rice, 2019</xref>).</p><p>In activated and proliferating cells, high levels of P-TEFb are found. In contrast, they are vanishingly low in resting cells, especially monocytes and memory T cells. While levels of CDK9 persist, those of CycT1 are greatly reduced. At the same time, transcripts for CycT1 and CDK9 remain high in all these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Garriga et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ghose et al., 2001</xref>). Based on existing studies, one can conclude that P-TEFb falls apart when cells become quiescent. In these cells, CDK9 is stabilized by chaperone proteins HSP70 and HSP90 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">OâKeeffe et al., 2000</xref>). For CycT1, it was thought that its translation is inhibited by RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chiang and Rice, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sung and Rice, 2009</xref>). In contrast, we find that CycT1 is rapidly degraded in these cells. We also identified post-translational modifications that lead to the assembly and disassembly of P-TEFb, which involves specific kinases and phosphatases. Importantly, the unbound CycT1 protein can be stabilized by proteasomal inhibitors. This situation appears uncannily reminiscent of cell cycle cyclins/CDKs that are also regulated by similar post-translational mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Critical residues in CycT1 (Thr143 and Thr149) are required for its binding to CDK9</title><p>Previously, residues in the N-terminal region of CycT1 (positions 1â280, CycT1(280), including cyclin boxes, positions 30â248) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) were found to be required for interactions between CycT1 and CDK9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Garber et al., 1998</xref>).

Of note, the mutant CycT1(280)TT143149AA protein migrated to a similar extent as WT CycT1(280) in the presence of okadaic acid, which implies that there are additional phosphorylation sites in CycT1 besides these two threonines.

For the purpose of tryptic peptide mapping, we chose a further truncated CycT1 protein to position 192 (CycT1(192)). In contrast to two predicted tryptic fragments of equivalent size for CycT1(280) protein, only one large tryptic peptide with a predicted mass 4.3 kD (a.a. 123â159, containing Thr143 and Thr149 residues) is found in the CycT1(192) protein, all others being of much smaller size. These predictions were generated by the Expasy website. Next, WT CycT1(192) and mutant CycT1(192)TT143149AA proteins were expressed in 293T cells with or without okadaic acid, and purified by IP.

Importantly, no phosphorylated peptide of the corresponding size was detected with the same peptide from the mutant CycT1(192)TT143149AA protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, right panel, lane 4) or undigested samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, right panel, lanes 3 and 5).

As presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, the side chain of Thr143 is placed internally towards helices in the cyclin box 1 of CycT1, where Gln73 is its nearest contact residue, suggesting that Thr143 is involved in intramolecular interactions with Gln73. On the other hand, Thr149 is located in the interface between CycT1 and CDK9 where Lys68 in CDK9 is its nearest contact residue, suggesting that Thr149 is involved in intermolecular interactions between CycT1 and CDK9. The space between CycT1âs Gln73 and Thr143, and between CycT1âs Thr149 and CDK9âs Lys68 readily accommodates phosphate molecules on Thr143 and Thr149 in CycT1. Indeed, the predominant contribution to the increased binding energy of the complex comes from electrostatic (ÎE<sub>elec</sub>) and polar solvation (ÎE<sub>solvâpolar</sub>) energies, which is consistent with the stabilizing interactions described in previous figures.

Nevertheless, interactions between CycT1 and CDK9 remain lower than in activated primary CD4+ T cells. To extend these findings to anergic T cells that lose the ability to respond to agonist antigen or stimulation of the T cell antigen receptor, we examined W131AOTII T cells from mice where the endogenous ZAP70 protein was substituted by a constitutively active mutant ZAP70-W131A protein. Introduction of this mutant protein into the OTII transgenic background (W131AOTII) results in high numbers of anergic and CD4 regulatory T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hsu et al., 2017</xref>). As presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, levels of CycT1 protein were significantly lower in W131AOTâ¡ than in control OTâ¡ T cells (panel 1, compare lane 2 to lane 1, ~7.8-fold decrease). Levels of the CDK9 were largely unchanged in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, panel 2, compare lane 2 to lane 1). Meanwhile, levels of CycT1 and CDK9 transcripts in W131AOTâ¡ and OTâ¡ cells remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), which is consistent with previous observations that mRNA levels of CycT1 and CDK9 do not vary between resting and activated CD4+ T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cary and Peterlin, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sung and Rice, 2006</xref>). Moreover, since these W131AOTII T cells exhibit impaired T cell receptor signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nguyen et al., 2021</xref>), activating these cells with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies did not increase levels of CycT1 (data not presented).</p><p>It was demonstrated that treatment of T cells with calcium ionophores such as ionomycin also depletes PKC and induces anergy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heissmeyer et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, we examined whether sustained ionomycin treatment of primary activated CD4+ T cells causes depletion of CycT1. As presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, CycT1 expression in activated primary T cells from a donor began to decrease at 24 hr (panel 1, compare lane 2 to lane 1, ~1.8-fold reduction) after the addition of ionomycin (1 Î¼M) and continued at 48 hr (panel 1, compare lane 3 to lane 1, ~4.5-fold reduction) and 72 hr (panel 1, compare lane 4 to lane 1, ~9.1-fold reduction). Levels of CDK9 were largely unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, panel 2, lanes 1â3). Similar changes were also observed with donor 2 treated with ionomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Taken together, the absence of active PKC correlates with significant decreases of CycT1, which prevents the assembly of the functional P-TEFb complex.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we found that mutations of two critical residues in CycT1 (Thr143 and Thr149 to alanine) impair its binding to CDK9. Phosphorylation of these residues promotes CycT1:CDK9 interactions. Structural modeling indicated that phosphates on Thr143 and Thr149 in CycT1 increase intramolecular and intermolecular binding to specific residues in CycT1 and CDK9, respectively, which contributes to P-TEFb assembly. This prediction was confirmed experimentally. Thr143 and Thr149 are located in PKC consensus sequences. Indeed, PKC inhibitors inhibited CycT1 phosphorylation. Of PKC isoforms, PKCÎ± and PKCÎ² were found not only to bind to CycT1 but to promote CycT1:CDK9 interactions and stabilize CycT1 in vivo and in vitro. Finally, depleting PKC or its inactivity led to CycT1 dissociation from CDK9 and its degradation in transformed cell lines as well as primary activated and anergic T cells. We conclude that the assembly and stability of P-TEFb are potentiated by the phosphorylation of CycT1, which is regulated by PKCÎ±, PKCÎ², and PP1.</p><p>Ours is the first study that addresses the reversible phosphorylation of CycT1 that helps to regulate P-TEFb. Based on previous mutageneses of CycT1, three threonine residues (Thr143, 149, and 155) could affect CycT1 stability and P-TEFb assembly. They are conserved in over 142 mammalian species and in CycT2 (sequences are picked out from NCBI and aligned). Moreover, previous reports indicated that these residues play critical roles in P-TEFb function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jadlowsky et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kuzmina et al., 2014</xref>). Of these, we identified Thr143 and Thr149 to be key residues for P-TEFb assembly. Dephosphorylation of these residues was blocked by a high dose of okadaic acid, which inhibits PP1 and PP2A, or the general PP inhibitor calyculin A, but not by a low dose of okadaic acid, which inhibits only PP2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). These results indicate that PP1, and not PP2A, is the candidate for CycT1 dephosphorylation. PP1 contains 3 catalytic and over 50 regulatory subunits, whose genetic inactivation is lethal to cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cohen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ferreira et al., 2019</xref>). Indeed, they are phosphatases that regulate cell cycle cyclins, such as CycB, CycD1, and AIB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Edelson and Brautigan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ferrero et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vorlaufer and Peters, 1998</xref>). As to kinases, PKCÎ± and PKCÎ² isoforms phosphorylate these two threonine residues in CycT1 in vitro. Previous studies and our experiments including mutagenesis, using anti-phospho-threonine antibodies, in-gel Phospho-Tag staining, in vivo and in vitro PKC binding assays, and PKC inhibition strongly indicate that both Thr143 and Thr149 of CycT1 are involved in P-TEFb assembly. Further studies including mass spectrometry and/or specific anti-CycT1 phospho-peptide antibodies could confirm our findings. However, given that these two residues are adjacent to each other, it would complicate these further studies. Nonetheless, since its degradation and assembly have to occur in most if not all cells of the organism, the involvement of ubiquitously expressed and redundant kinases and phosphatases in this post-translational regulation of P-TEFb is not unexpected. Importantly, our study also reveals that the depletion of PKC, as occurs after chronic activation or phorbol ester treatment, results in P-TEFb disassembly and CycT1 degradation, which explains cells becoming unresponsive to external stimuli. It also explains why Tat, whose coactivator is P-TEFb, no longer functions in such cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jakobovits et al., 1990</xref>). Anergic cells also lack P-TEFb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), which contributes to their unresponsive phenotype. From our and other studies, we also know that resting and memory T cells lack P-TEFb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Garriga et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ghose et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, proviral latency is maintained in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fujinaga and Cary, 2020</xref>). This situation most likely pertains to other DNA viruses, such as HSV and HTLV1/2, in yet other resting or terminally differentiated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kulkarni and Bangham, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nicoll et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Although unphosphorylated CycT1 dissociates from P-TEFb and is degraded, CDK9 remains and is stabilized by HSP70 and HSP90 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">OâKeeffe et al., 2000</xref>). This observation presents uncanny similarities to the regulation of cell cycle cyclins/CDKs, whose levels are also regulated by reversible phosphorylation, disassembly, and degradation. For example, CycE unbound to its kinase partner CDK2 is rapidly degraded via SCF E3 ligase-mediated proteasomal pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clurman et al., 1996</xref>). Thus, the transcriptional cyclins/CDKs display and mimic regulatory paradigms of cell cycle cyclins/CDKs. This regulation is also very different from the P-TEFb equilibrium in growing, proliferating cells, where 7SK snRNP plays the major role. There, P-TEFb partitions between the active free state, bound to activators and/or the super-elongation complex, and the inactive state, where 7SK snRNA coordinates its sequestration with HEXIM1/2, LaRP7, MePCE in the 7SK snRNP. In this RNP, HEXIM1 or HEXIM2 inhibit CDK9 by binding to its ATP pocket, a situation that is reminiscent of CDK2 inhibition by p21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Russo et al., 1996</xref>). Thus, our study has revealed an additional important aspect of the regulation of transcriptional elongation in cells.</p><p>Global mRNA sequencing studies examine changes in levels of specific transcripts between and in different states, that is, activation, proliferation, and differentiation of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sung and Rice, 2009</xref>). However, levels of CycT1 and CDK9 mRNAs do not vary between resting and activated T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marshall et al., 2005</xref>), between responsive and anergic T cells or exhausted T cells. This finding is important as these global studies do not look at levels of resulting proteins. Thus, they underestimate contributions of P-TEFb and/or other transcriptional CDKs in their evaluations of target genes. Additionally, P-TEFb must be recruited by transcription factors to the paused RNAPII at promoter-proximal regions. Indeed, P-TEFb can mediate short and long distance interactions between enhancers and promoters to promote transcription elongation and co-transcriptional processing of individual and clusters of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Taube et al., 2002</xref>). In this scenario, the C-terminal His-rich region of CycT1 interacts directly with the CTD of RNAPII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Taube et al., 2002</xref>). Thus, these post-translational modifications of P-TEFb play critical roles in activated transcription and for growth and proliferation of cells. In quiescent cells, only basal transcription is detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheung and Rando, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Roche et al., 2017</xref>). Importantly, external stimuli can reverse this phenotype via this reversible phosphorylation of P-TEFb. As a result, effects of potent activators, such as cMyc, NF-ÎºB, steroid hormones, CIITA, etc., are translated to the productive transcription of their target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fujinaga, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Finally, since our study revealed families of kinases and phosphatases that affect P-TEFb, it is possible that the use of more targeted phosphatase inhibitors could block this transition to quiescence and terminal differentiation of cells. Their use might even prevent the establishment of proviral latency. Although the phosphomimetic substitution of one of these two threonine residues was not successful (data not presented), it is possible that further modifications of CycT1 and CDK9 could create a constitutively active P-TEFb complex. If successful, modified P-TEFb complexes could be studied for effects on immune responses as well as latency induction and reversal in many different scenarios. The other approach would be to identify the E3 ligase that is responsible for the degradation of the unphosphorylated CycT1 protein. To this end, bortezomib and other proteasomal inhibitors have been examined already for the reversal of HIV latency in resting CD4+ T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cary and Peterlin, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2019</xref>). Taking all these findings into account, the understanding of complex post-translational regulation of P-TEFb promises to reveal additional approaches not only to proviral latency, but to host immune responses, cellular regeneration and dedifferentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key

Models of the four P-TEFb complexes were built based on the crystallographic structure of the human P-TEFb complex (PDB code 3MI9) using the AmberTools leap tool. All systems were neutralized with Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> ions and solvate is a cubic box with periodic boundary conditions. Simulations were performed using the AMBER19 force-field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Case et al., 2005</xref>) and TIP3P water model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jorgensen et al., 1983</xref>).</p><p>Simulations of each system were conducted according to the following protocol. First, each system was energy minimized for 5000 steps using the steepest-descent method while constraining solute non-hydrogen atoms with a 10 kcal/mol/Ã<sup>2</sup> harmonic potential, followed by 5000 steps without restraints. Second, systems were heated from 10 K to 303.15 K for 50 ps in the NVT ensemble with heavy atom restraints applied. The temperature was controlled by Langevin dynamics, with a collision frequency of 5 ps<sup>-1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pastor et al., 2006</xref>). Third, positional restraints were slowly released and densities were equilibrated over the course of 500 ps in the NPT ensemble at a temperature of 303.15 K and pressure conditions of 1 atm. The pressure was controlled using a MC barostat. Finally, unrestrained production simulations in the NPT ensemble were run for 500 ns for each system, yielding a cumulative sum of 2 Âµs of simulation time across systems. All calculations were carried out using an integration step of 2 fs. The SHAKE algorithm was applied to all hydrogen-containing bonds. MD simulations were conducted using the pmemd engine, with CUDA acceleration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Salomon-Ferrer et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>For each production trajectory, the AmberTools <italic>cpptraj</italic> module was used to calculate root-mean-square deviations (RMSD) and root mean-squared fluctuation (RMSF) to monitor system equilibration and assess the local flexibility of the systems, respectively.</p><p>The binding energies of the four P-TEFb complexes were calculated by the MM-GBSA method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Genheden and Ryde, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Massova and Kollman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Miller et al., 2012</xref>), implemented in Ambertools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Case et al., 2005</xref>).

However, in resting cells the levels of Cyclin T1 are vanishingly low but the mechanism underlying this is poorly understood. The authors set out to understand how Cyclin T1 stability is regulated and uncovered a key role for two specific threonine, which are subject to phosphorylation by PKC and de-phosphorylation by PP1. The major strengths of the paper include determining that phosphorylation of the two threonines in Cyclin T1 not only contribute to its stability but are required for interaction with CDK9. Moreover, the authors show that PKC activity is a key regulated component in the transition from resting to activation that triggers p-TEFb assembly.

First of all, it doesn't look like OA enhanced CyCT coIP much at all in panel 2A and in 2B, that enhancement appears minor. Can the authors state explicitly how this was quantified and if it was done so using replicate IPs so that reproducibility can be determined?</p><p>Figure 2C â The T143/T149A mutant is convincing that the pThr signal is diminished. But it is confusing why the input CycT1 signal in the T143/T149AA is identical to the wt-280 protein ('input' CyCT1 bottom blot, lanes 3vs4). This would suggest that mutation of these two threonines does not substantively alter overall phosphorylation of the 280 cycT1 protein. This result almost seems ignored, can the authors clarify this interpretation?</p><p>Figure 3A: the authors could consider a slightly different or additional perspective in their image.

The data in 4C demonstrates that treatment with staurosporine eliminates any pThr signal present on CycT1. While this is convincing, it is also apparent that all aberrantly migrating CycT1 that appears after OA treatment is collapsed into a single band suggesting that all phosphorylation of CycT1 is sensitive to staurosporine. This doesn't seem likely given the authors showed in panel 3C (bottom) that TT143,149AA, which diminishes pThr signal has no apparent impact to the remaining phosphorylations of CycT1 as the aberrant migrating form is unchanged. This speaks to the concern of staurosporine specificity but could be mitigated if the authors also conduct a PKC RNAi experiment followed by transfection of their HA-CycT1.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This study addresses an important question regarding the regulation of positive transcription elongation factor b-P-TEFb, the complex of cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) and cyclin T1. In proliferating cells, this complex is the major rate-limiting regulator of transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and target of HIV Tat protein-which co-opts P-TEFb to drive expression of viral genes-and is negatively regulated by an inhibitory 7SK ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. This axis does not appear to operate in quiescent cells, including resting or exhausted T cells that are refractory to Tat, apparently because of decreased levels of cyclin T1 protein despite high levels of the mRNA. The authors propose a novel regulatory mechanism with the potential to explain the differences in P-TEFb regulation between proliferating and quiescent cells: phosphorylations on two Thr residues in cyclin T1 that stabilize its binding to Cdk9, which are placed by protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms and removed by protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), and which become dephosphorylated in quiescent cells, leading to disassembly of the P-TEFb complex and subsequent proteasomal degradation of the free cyclin. This is an attractive hypothesis, both because it would solve a longstanding puzzle in the field and yield insights into potential antiviral drug targets, and because the proposed mechanism of CDK regulation it posits is novel and surprising (possibly unprecedented). The data are for the most part consistent with the proposed model but fall short of proving it; many of the functions of the individual players or modifications, and relationships between them, are inferred rather than demonstrated. There are questions of specificity-about the kinase and phosphatase inhibitors used, and about the phosphorylated residues being targeted-that would need to be answered more definitively before this mechanism can be considered validated. Below I list my major, specific concerns and comments:</p><p>1. The implication of PKC and PP1, the two key enzymatic players in the P-TEFb regulatory network proposed here, rests heavily on experiments with inhibitory small molecules that are at best only partially selective for their intended targets. For example, staurosporine, the &quot;PKC inhibitor&quot; used for most of their experiments, is a relatively promiscuous protein kinase inhibitor. Likewise, okadaic acid is a potent inhibitor of PP2A with reduced but significant potency towards PP1 and other phosphoprotein phosphatase (PPP) family members; the authors' argument for its PP1-specificity in this setting is that it influences cyclin T1 stability at high but not low concentrations. I do not find this reasoning compelling; at the higher concentrations needed to inhibit PP1 in vivo, PP2A would also be more completely inactivated.</p><p>2. The use of dominant negative, kinase-dead variants of PKC somewhat allays the concerns regarding specificity of the kinase inhibitors, and suggests that PKC activity might indeed be influencing cyclin T1 phosphorylation state, but a demonstration that PKC can directly phosphorylate cyclin T1, specifically on Thr143 and Thr149, is missing, and would be needed to justify some of the stronger conclusions drawn here (e.g. on p. 10, p. 14 and p. 15, last sentence of first paragraph in each case).</p><p>3. There is in fact no demonstration that Thr143 and Thr149 are actually phosphorylated in vivo or in vitro, only that their mutation to Ala diminishes reactivity of cyclin T1 with anti-pThr antibodies. This could be an indirect effect on phosphorylation of a different residue due to conformational changes caused by the mutations. The authors state, on p. 20 of Discussion, that these sites &quot;were missed&quot; in previous studies but to justify that assertion would need to show unambiguously that they are indeed phosphorylated (i.e., not merely the computational prediction in Figure S1 and the circumstantial evidence obtained from mutagenesis studies). Importantly, recombinant, highly active and apparently stable P-TEFb can be purified-and crystallized-in the absence of these phosphorylations (e.g. in Baumli et al., 2008). There is precedent for phosphorylations (on the CDK) being required to stabilize CDK-cyclin complexes in vivo but dispensable in vitro or in overexpression conditions, but to conclude that is the case here would require proof that these residues are indeed phosphorylated in vivo.</p><p>4. There is a circularity to the logic behind the choice of PKC isoforms to target specifically (p. 13): Thr143 and Thr149 looked like PKC sites, leading the authors to test a panel of PKC inhibitors that were specific for the isoforms they selected for further studies. A more cogent argument would be based on both positive and negative data, i.e., inhibitors of different isoforms (and different kinases entirely) not having the same effects.</p><p>5. Selectivity in phosphatase inhibition is notoriously hard to achieve. Nonetheless, there are small molecules with some selectivity for PP1 over PP2A (e.g. tautomycetin), greater selectivity for PP2A (e.g. cytostatin) or ~equal potency towards both (e.g. calyculin A); the authors should try these inhibitors and/or targeted depletion of PP1 catalytic (or regulatory) subunits to test PP1 involvement more rigorously.</p><p>6. The authors should test potentially phosphomimetic substitutions of these residues (e.g. T143E, T149E)-a manipulation they allude to in the Discussion but did not attempt. Although Glu is not guaranteed to mimic pThr, the upside if it does would be considerable: if a constitutive negative charge is sufficient to stabilize P-TEFb, it should increase cyclin T1 in quiescent cells (perhaps conferring sensitivity to Tat) and, if the proposed model is correct, make cyclin T1 in proliferating cells resistant to degradation induced by PKC inhibition.</p><p>7. The study would be greatly strengthened by measurements of CDK9 activity after the various manipulations tested, i.e., cyclin T1 mutations, PKC ablation, PP1 inhibition.</p><p>8. The effectiveness of PKC inhibitors or dominant-negative alleles should be gauged with measurements of phosphorylation on known PKC substrates, if phosphospecific antibodies are available for these targets.</p><p>9. The second sentence of the abstract is ambiguously worded: it should be made clearer that what is absent in quiescent cells is P-TEFb, not 7SK RNP (if that is what the authors mean).</p><p>10. Pp. 2-3, non-expert readers might not appreciate distinction between promoter clearance and promoter-proximal pause release (and thus between functions of CDK7 and -9), which are conflated to a significant degree in the authors' description.</p><p>11. P. 3, first paragraph, sentence starting &quot;CDK9 isâ¦&quot; &quot;DRB&quot; should be &quot;DRB sensitivity inducing factor (DSIF)&quot; (referred to in the next sentence).</p><p>12. P. 6 and elsewhere, the authors should avoid the nomenclature &quot;T3A&quot; and T2A&quot; to refer to different combinatorial mutations (i.e., of two or three different Thr residues) because it will be confused with single point mutations, i.e., of &quot;Thr3&quot; or &quot;Thr2&quot; (which are nonexistent). I suggest the more conventional shorthand &quot;3TA&quot; and &quot;2TA&quot; to refer to these alleles.</p><p>13. I am just a bit skeptical about the quantification of immunoblot signals: some of the numbers reported for fold-differences do not match the visual evidence (i.e., the band intensities). They appear to be using ECL (rather than fluorescence) for detection and quantification, so these numbers should probably be taken with a grain of salt. I would recommend the authors provide more detail about the quantification, e.g. the raw data for the blot scanning, preferably with error bars.</p><p>14. There is a sentence fragment on p. 13, starting with &quot;Since the catalytic domainsâ¦&quot;</p><p>15. The precedent of cyclin E degradation cited on p. 20 is interesting but not quite apt: in that case degradation is promoted by phosphorylation of cyclin E (on a sequence motif known as a phosphodegron), and I am not aware of any requirement for cyclin E phosphorylation in binding to CDK2, so its relevance to the proposed mechanism of cyclin T1 degradation is not clear.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Huang and colleagues describes two phosphorylations sites in human Cyclin T1, which regulate the interaction to CDK9 and contribute to the binding and stability of Cyclin T1 in quiescent and terminally differentiated cells. The author describe that the pool of free Cyclin T1 is rapidly degraded when it is not phosphorylated on these two respective sites in the cyclin boxes of cyclin T1. The PP1 phosphates inhibitor okadaic acid leads to P-TEFb stabilization, as less CycT1 is degraded, whereas kinase inhibitors targeting PKC result in P-TEFb disassembly and degradation of CycT1. Using a set of different kinase inhibitors, the authors find that PKC-Î± and PKC-Î² are responsible for CycT1 phosphorylation.</p><p>The findings described in this study bring the transcription regulating cyclins, as CycT1, closer to the cell cycle regulating cyclins, which are long known for the tight regulation between expression upregulation and ubiquitination downregulation. These findings are potentially important, as they could shift our view on the transcriptional cyclins and the need for transcriptional CDK regulators (as 7SK/Hexim1 and Brd4, HIV Tat, AFF4 â¦), if gene expression and degradation is indeed another layer of regulation of these cyclins.</p><p>There is one major conundrum to this study: Multiple biochemical and structural studies on CDK9 and Cyclin T1 have been performed, often by co-expression and co-purification of these two subunits. In none of them (to my knowledge) a phosphorylated T143 or T149 residue was identified. The sentence &quot;Unphosphorylated CycT1 dissociates from P-TEFb and is degraded.&quot; (page 20 and similar in the abstract) seems therefore farfetched. If pT143 and pT149 stabilizes the complex in such a profound degree, why are researchers able to form the non-phosphorylated complex in the first place? CycT1 can be expressed from <italic>E. coli</italic> exhibiting no phosphorylation and binds properly well to CDK9. It would be very beneficial and in support of this study to know the dissociation constants for the interaction partners in a CycT1 phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated state.</p><p>I am surprised that a phosphorylated threonine mimetic, as glutamic acids (E) or aspartic acid (D), was not analyzed in these experiments. To this reviewers' opinion the authors should analyze how a double mutation of CycT1 (T143E/T149E) acts on CDK9 binding, P-TEFb complex formation and the stability of Cyclin T1. Using only the T143A/T149A mutant but not a phosphorylation mimetic is a lack in the design of the study.</p><p>Throughout the entire manuscript, the authors are unprecise and ambiguous with predictions (computational, structural, â¦) and 'real' experimental findings. E.g.: Page 18, Discussion, 3 sentence: &quot;Structural analyses revealed that phosphates on Thr143 and Thr149 in CycT1 increase intramolecular and intermolecular binding to specific residues in CycT1 and CDK9, respectively, which potentiates P-TEFb assembly and stabilizes CycT1.&quot; In Figure 3A, a model is displayed but not an experimentally determined structure with phosphorylated residues, as 3MI9 does not contain any phosphorylation in Cyclin T1. The figure legend to 3A should clearly say this. The description in the main text is okay, but the text of the figure legend is clearly misleading and almost fraud. This is a model only!</p><p>Another example is on page 8: &quot;An online database for phosphorylation site prediction (NetPhos 3.1, developed by Technical University of Denmark) scores Thr143 and Thr149 above the threshold value (default 0.5), indicating that these threonines are potential phosphorylation sites (Figure S1). To verify that Thr143 and Thr149 are the main phosphorylation sites in CycT1, â¦&quot; The second sentence starting with &quot;To verify â¦.&quot; suggests, that the first observation are real data but not simply predictions. Moreover, the prediction has been made on a 43-residue sequence but not the full CycT1 structure (Figure S1) as I understand. This does not account for any tertiary structure etc. and is therefore not to the highest standard. I would not consider this analysis good evidence for phosphorylation sites.</p><p>There are clearly dissociation constants missing for the statement that the threonine phosphorylation in cyclin T1 is increasing its binding capacity to CDK9 and the stability of the cyclin. From the model it seems that pT143 could also only act indirectly as it forms internal contacts within the cyclin but is not in the direct interface to the kinase.</p><p>[Editorsâ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Assembly and levels of P-TEFb depend on reversible phosphorylation of cyclin T1&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

However, there was still a shared concern that stronger data is needed to demonstrate that these two threonine residues are phosphorylated in cells. In light of these counter-balancing thoughts, the Editors have decided on an additional round of revision to address this specific concern. We highlight essential revisions below and provide specific feedback from the Reviewers.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Conduct mass spectrometry on preferably full-length Cyclin T1 to demonstrate phosphorylation at T143 and T149 or provide convincing evidence for their phosphorylation using phospho-specific antibodies if such a reagent is in hand.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This is a revision of a manuscript I reviewed previously. The authors have addressed one of my major concerns by providing evidence that PKC can phosphorylate a cyclin T1 fragment in T143/149-dependent fashion in vitro (Figure 5G). I am less persuaded by the evidence implicating PP1 in dephosphorylating cyclin T1, but this is largely owing to the technical difficulty of proving phosphatase specificity in cell-based experiments. Taken together, there is substantial reason to believe, based on the data presented, that presence or absence of PKC-dependent signaling is a determining factor in P-TEFb activity levels in different settings (e.g. resting or exhausted versus activated T cells).</p><p>My biggest concern remains, however, that the mechanism the authors propose for this regulation-phosphorylation of two specific residues on cyclin T1 that stabilize an interaction with CDK9-is only incrementally closer to being validated in the revised version. The new data addressing this point were obtained in a complicated setup, in which a severely truncated cyclin T1 fragment (missing residues needed for interaction with CDK9) was expressed in 293T cells and then pulled down and detected in gels by a commercial phosphoprotein-staining reagent, either intact (Figure 2D) or after tryptic digestion (2E). Mutation of T143 and T149 to A abolished the signal, which is promising but still preliminary evidence that these sites might be phosphorylated in intact cyclin T1 under physiologic conditions. This does not address the concern, also expressed by Reviewer 3, that this requirement-and the phosphorylations themselves-have escaped previous detection. The authors dismiss this concern by pointing out that structures of P-TEFb were solved for complexes expressed in insect cells, but this is not persuasive; in those structures, phosphorylation on T186 of the CDK9 activation segment was readily observed (Baumli et al., 2008; Tahirov et al., 2010). Fully active, stable P-TEFb complexes can also be reconstituted from purified CDK9 expressed in insect cells and cyclin T1 purified from bacteria. Finally, a quick check of the PhosphoSite online data base did not turn up either of these sites. So I must reiterate my initial position that, because the authors are proposing a novel and highly detailed mechanism for regulating an essential transcription regulator, the existence, necessity and sufficiency of T143 and T149 phosphorylation simply must be proven and not merely inferred. Typically, a study such as this would include dispositive supporting data obtained via mass spectrometry, phospho-specific antibodies, or both, to gain acceptance at a top-tier journal.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors present a thoroughly revised version of their manuscript that addresses the main concerns from the previous review process. Particularly the second point regarding stronger evidence that T143 and T149 are directly phosphorylated is now supported by additional data. However, I miss any new data within the revised manuscript regarding the first main point on the use of phosphomimetic mutants in Cyclin T1. The authors state in their reply letter that the CycT1 T149D or T149E mutants maintained CDK9 binding, T143 to E or D instead did not. I think that this first mutant site T149(E/D) that sustains binding clearly strengthen their findings. Why don't they show these binding data, or did I miss it? The contribution of the T149 position to the interaction would be anyhow more indirect as shown from the modelling and it is well accepted, that these phosphomimetic mutants must not work. But as one of them seems to work, I am confused that these data are not contained in the manuscript. The new molecular dynamics simulations and MM-GBSA binding energy calculations are nice complementary data but cellular binding/precipitation data would be very convincing. The other points are well addressed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.68473.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Test the effect of phosphomimetic mutants because if these mutants function as predicted, it could add significant strength to the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We created phosphomimetic mutants for Thr143 and Thr149. While Thr149 to aspartic or glutamic acid restored this binding, the same substitutions for Thr143 did not. Indeed, we agree with Reviewer 2 that not all phosphomimetic substitutions work, which also happened in our hands.</p><p>After investigating many published phosphorylation-related papers, there emerges no consistent picture for acidic amino acid substitutions to mimic phosphorylated serine, threonine or tyrosine residues. As we know, the charge densities, distributions and pKas of the carboxyl group of aspartic acid or glutamic acid are quite different from a phosphate group. There are some good examples such as MEK and PKB/Akt where such substitutions work quite well (to ~10-30% of fully phosphorylated wild type proteins). In other cases, it doesn't work in related proteins such as MKK4 (Thr234) (Khan M., et al., Brassinosteroid-regulated GSK3/Shaggy-like kinases phosphorylate mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinases, which control stomata development in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. J Biol Chem. 2013 Mar 15;288(11):7519-7527.). Itâs also worth considering what phosphorylated amino acids are doing in a given protein. For example, hosphor-specific antibodies do not recognize substituted aspartates or glutamates â indicating quite different structural epitopes represented by these substitutions (perspectives given by James R Woodgett, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto). The most recent publication also demonstrated that phosphomimetic substitutions were not able to restore the activation loop of RSK (Somale, D., et al., Activation of RSK by phosphomimetic substitution in the activation loop is prevented by structural constraints. Sci Rep 10<bold>,</bold> 591 (2020)).</p><p>Consistent with our further Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area calculations (MM-GBSA) for the P-TEFb complex,, the predominant contribution to the increased binding energy of the complex comes from electrostatic (ÎE<sub>elec</sub>) and polar solvation (ÎE<sub>solvâpolar</sub>) energies. This finding is consistent with the stabilizing interactions described in Figures 1 and 2.

Also, the band shift of the phosphorylated CycT1 protein was confirmed by the actual size change in comparison to the untreated condition (no upper/phosphorylated bands detected). Combining all these data, the upper bands of CycT1 detected by anti-pThr antibodies represent phosphorylated CycT1 proteins (especially after the treatment with protein phosphatase inhibitors).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2- the statement that OA enhanced co-IP by ~5 fold for the full length and truncation mutant is not convincing as stated.

Can the authors state explicitly how this was quantified and if it was done so using replicate IPs so that reproducibility can be determined?</p></disp-quote><p>All WB images were captured by the LI-COR imaging system. Luminescent signals corresponding to each protein band were processed with their analysis program. They were within the linear range of measurements according to Li-COR instructions. Relative protein-protein interactions in co-IP were calculated by normalizing the IPed proteins with indicated antibodies targeted proteins. Quantification data were presented as fold changes over values obtained with control samples (values set as â1â) (more details were added in the âMaterials and methodsâ). For example, in Figure 2A, relative CycT1:CDK9 interactions were calculated by normalizing intensities of IPed CycT1 bands with IPed CDK9 bands. Data are from three independent experiments with excellent reproducibility. In addition, we repeated experiments by using low and high concentrations of okadaic acid as well as calyculin A, which is another protein phosphatase inhibitor. These new co-IPs are provided in the revised Figures 2A and 2B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2C â The T143/T149A mutant is convincing that the pThr signal is diminished. But it is confusing why the input CycT1 signal in the T143/T149AA is identical to the wt-280 protein ('input' CyCT1 bottom blot, lanes 3vs4). This would suggest that mutation of these two threonines does not substantively alter overall phosphorylation of the 280 cycT1 protein. This result almost seems ignored, can the authors clarify this interpretation?</p></disp-quote><p>Our interpretation of the data is that there are additional phosphorylation sites in CycT1 that are not involved in P-TEFb assembly and/or CycT1 degradation, and these phosphorylation sites are also stabilized by okadaic acid and/or calyculin A. They could contribute to the much clearer band shift of CycT1. Indeed, we compared levels of other phosphorylated residues between WT CycT1(280) and mutant CycT1(280)TT143149AA, and they were only slightly different between these two proteins, supporting this interpretation. New data in the revised manuscript address this issue more directly (see comments to editor, above).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3A: the authors could consider a slightly different or additional perspective in their image.

The data in 4C demonstrates that treatment with staurosporine eliminates any pThr signal present on CycT1. While this is convincing, it is also apparent that all aberrantly migrating CycT1 that appears after OA treatment is collapsed into a single band suggesting that all phosphorylation of CycT1 is sensitive to staurosporine. This doesn't seem likely given the authors showed in panel 3C (bottom) that TT143,149AA, which diminishes pThr signal has no apparent impact to the remaining phosphorylations of CycT1 as the aberrant migrating form is unchanged. This speaks to the concern of staurosporine specificity but could be mitigated if the authors also conduct a PKC RNAi experiment followed by transfection of their HA-CycT1.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for pointing out the concerns about the specificity of the PKC inhibitor staurosporine. First, staurosporine is a very strong and general PKC inhibitor, which can neutralize robustly increased phosphorylation effects by protein phosphatase inhibitors. Indeed, staurosporine removed all threonine phosphorylation and the resulting CycT1 proteins collapsed into one single band. As mentioned above, our interpretation is that there are multiple phosphorylation sites that are sensitive to staurosporine, and among them are Thr143 and Thr149 that are involved in P-TEFb assembly and CycT1 degradation. To obtain results with more specific PKC inhibitors, we employed two other PKC inhibitors (bisindomaleinide IX and HBDDE) and one non-PKC inhibitor MEK 1/2i which also inhibited interactions between CycT1 and CDK9, and diminished phosphorylation of Thr143 and Thr149 (Figure 4B and 4C), confirming that these residues are phosphorylated by PKC, which is important for P-TEFb assembly. Meanwhile, with other three PKC inhibitors (not inhibiting PKCÎ± and PKCÎ²), only these selected PKC inhibitors were able to decrease the endogenous levels of CycT1 proteins in activated primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (Figure 4-figures supplement 1C, 1D and 1E). In addition, experiments with dominant negative PKCs and the new in vitro PKC kinase assay (Figure 5G) also support the involvement of PKC in this process.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This study addresses an important question regarding the regulation of positive transcription elongation factor b-P-TEFb, the complex of cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) and cyclin T1. In proliferating cells, this complex is the major rate-limiting regulator of transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and target of HIV Tat protein-which co-opts P-TEFb to drive expression of viral genes-and is negatively regulated by an inhibitory 7SK ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. This axis does not appear to operate in quiescent cells, including resting or exhausted T cells that are refractory to Tat, apparently because of decreased levels of cyclin T1 protein despite high levels of the mRNA. The authors propose a novel regulatory mechanism with the potential to explain the differences in P-TEFb regulation between proliferating and quiescent cells: phosphorylations on two Thr residues in cyclin T1 that stabilize its binding to Cdk9, which are placed by protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms and removed by protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), and which become dephosphorylated in quiescent cells, leading to disassembly of the P-TEFb complex and subsequent proteasomal degradation of the free cyclin. This is an attractive hypothesis, both because it would solve a longstanding puzzle in the field and yield insights into potential antiviral drug targets, and because the proposed mechanism of CDK regulation it posits is novel and surprising (possibly unprecedented). The data are for the most part consistent with the proposed model but fall short of proving it; many of the functions of the individual players or modifications, and relationships between them, are inferred rather than demonstrated. There are questions of specificity-about the kinase and phosphatase inhibitors used, and about the phosphorylated residues being targeted-that would need to be answered more definitively before this mechanism can be considered validated. Below I list my major, specific concerns and comments:</p><p>1. The implication of PKC and PP1, the two key enzymatic players in the P-TEFb regulatory network proposed here, rests heavily on experiments with inhibitory small molecules that are at best only partially selective for their intended targets. For example, staurosporine, the &quot;PKC inhibitor&quot; used for most of their experiments, is a relatively promiscuous protein kinase inhibitor. Likewise, okadaic acid is a potent inhibitor of PP2A with reduced but significant potency towards PP1 and other phosphoprotein phosphatase (PPP) family members; the authors' argument for its PP1-specificity in this setting is that it influences cyclin T1 stability at high but not low concentrations. I do not find this reasoning compelling; at the higher concentrations needed to inhibit PP1 in vivo, PP2A would also be more completely inactivated.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above (to Reviewer 1), the revised manuscript, we added data with more specific PKC inhibitors including bisindomaleinide IX and HBDDE and a non-PKC kinase inhibitor (MEK1/2 inhibitor) as well as with another protein phosphatase inhibitor, calyculin A. They all support our conclusions. Moreover, we now include data with low concentrations of okadaic acid that have no effect on CycT1 phosphorylation and P-TEFb assembly. This concentration inhibits PP2A, not PP1. While we do agree with the reviewer's comment &quot;at the higher concentrations needed to inhibit PP1 in vivo, PP2A would also be more completely inactivated&quot;, the fact that there is no such effect with low concentrations of okadaic acid clearly indicates that PP2A has a minor, if any, involvement in this process. Elucidation of PP isotypes involved in biological processes is very difficult because of the large numbers of isoforms and subunits and the lack of highly specific phosphatase inhibitors. However, using high vs low concentration of okadaic acid to separate between PP1 and PP2A is generally accepted by the field; indicated papers are listed below:</p><p>1).

The use of dominant negative, kinase-dead variants of PKC somewhat allays the concerns regarding specificity of the kinase inhibitors, and suggests that PKC activity might indeed be influencing cyclin T1 phosphorylation state, but a demonstration that PKC can directly phosphorylate cyclin T1, specifically on Thr143 and Thr149, is missing, and would be needed to justify some of the stronger conclusions drawn here (e.g. on p. 10, p. 14 and p. 15, last sentence of first paragraph in each case).</p></disp-quote><p>We performed direct phosphorylation studies in vivo and in vitro (Figures 2 and 5). They are included in the revised manuscript. See also comments to the editor above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. There is in fact no demonstration that Thr143 and Thr149 are actually phosphorylated in vivo or in vitro, only that their mutation to Ala diminishes reactivity of cyclin T1 with anti-pThr antibodies. This could be an indirect effect on phosphorylation of a different residue due to conformational changes caused by the mutations. The authors state, on p. 20 of Discussion, that these sites &quot;were missed&quot; in previous studies but to justify that assertion would need to show unambiguously that they are indeed phosphorylated (i.e., not merely the computational prediction in Figure S1 and the circumstantial evidence obtained from mutagenesis studies). Importantly, recombinant, highly active and apparently stable P-TEFb can be purified-and crystallized-in the absence of these phosphorylations (e.g. in Baumli et al., 2008). There is precedent for phosphorylations (on the CDK) being required to stabilize CDK-cyclin complexes in vivo but dispensable in vitro or in overexpression conditions, but to conclude that is the case here would require proof that these residues are indeed phosphorylated in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and we performed additional studies to confirm the phosphorylation of Thr143 and Thr149 in vivo and in vitro. See answers to comment 2 and to the editor, above. Moreover, examining the literature and talking to direct participants in these crystallographic studies, no-one has been able to express P-TEFb from bacteria. Johnston and Tahirov (as well as Alber and Hurley) groups used P-TEFb purified from baculovirus, where these residues in CycT1 are most likely already phosphorylated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. There is a circularity to the logic behind the choice of PKC isoforms to target specifically (p. 13): Thr143 and Thr149 looked like PKC sites, leading the authors to test a panel of PKC inhibitors that were specific for the isoforms they selected for further studies. A more cogent argument would be based on both positive and negative data, i.e., inhibitors of different isoforms (and different kinases entirely) not having the same effects.</p></disp-quote><p>Better descriptions are provided in the revised manuscript. Moreover, we did include more PKC inhibitors for comparison, and one non-PKC inhibitor (MEK 1/2 inhibitor) as the negative control. As the new Figures 4B and 4C demonstrate, the MEK1/2 inhibitor had no effect on interactions between CycT1 and CDK9 and Threonine phosphorylation levels of CycT1. In contrast, other more specific PKC inhibitors bisindolylmaleimide IX and HBDDE decreased these interactions and phosphorylation levels. Moreover, the MEK1/2 and other PKC inhibitors were also tested in primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells for further confirmation of our conclusions. As presented in the new figure (Figure 4âfigure supplement 1E), the MEK 1/2 inhibitor had no effect on endogenous CycT1 protein levels. Three new PKC inhibitors (not inhibiting PKCÎ± and PKCÎ²) (enzastaurin, VTX-27 and bisindolylmaleimide IV) also did not decrease CycT1 protein levels. In contrast, other PKC inhibitors (PKCÎ± and PKCÎ² related) demonstrated consistent effects as presented in Figure 4âfigure supplement 1D. Taking all these data together, we can draw the conclusion that phosphorylation of Thr143 and Thr149 in CycT1 is PKC dependent.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Selectivity in phosphatase inhibition is notoriously hard to achieve. Nonetheless, there are small molecules with some selectivity for PP1 over PP2A (e.g. tautomycetin), greater selectivity for PP2A (e.g. cytostatin) or ~equal potency towards both (e.g. calyculin A); the authors should try these inhibitors and/or targeted depletion of PP1 catalytic (or regulatory) subunits to test PP1 involvement more rigorously.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we added effects of calyculin A, as suggested. Furthermore, low concentrations of okadaic acid did rule out the involvement of PP2A, compared to the high concentration of okadaic acid and calyculin A (Figures 2A and 2B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The authors should test potentially phosphomimetic substitutions of these residues (e.g. T143E, T149E)-a manipulation they allude to in the Discussion but did not attempt. Although Glu is not guaranteed to mimic pThr, the upside if it does would be considerable: if a constitutive negative charge is sufficient to stabilize P-TEFb, it should increase cyclin T1 in quiescent cells (perhaps conferring sensitivity to Tat) and, if the proposed model is correct, make cyclin T1 in proliferating cells resistant to degradation induced by PKC inhibition.</p></disp-quote><p>We indeed tested the phosphomimetic substitutions of Thr143 and Thr149 in CycT1. While T149E restored the binding, neither T143E nor T143D rescued interactions between CycT1 and CDK9. As the reviewer acknowledges, phosphomimetic mutants, particularly those of CDKs, do not always mimic the actual phosphorylation. Molecular dynamics simulations and MM-GBSA binding energy calculations indicates that phosphorylation of Thr143 and Thr149 do have the largest effects in binding stability. Therefore, adding one negative charge on Thr143 might not be sufficient to restore the intra-molecular interaction with Q73. Based on this assumption, we constructed various reciprocal mutant CycT1 proteins and are testing them for their ability to restore P-TEFb assembly without phosphorylation. However, these new substitutions are beyond the scope of the current study and could create a non-degradable P-TEFb complex, which will involve significant further experimentation. We also addressed this point in the response to the editor, above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The study would be greatly strengthened by measurements of CDK9 activity after the various manipulations tested, i.e., cyclin T1 mutations, PKC ablation, PP1 inhibition.</p></disp-quote><p>The presented study identifies the mechanism of P-TEFb assembly (CycT1:CDK9 interaction).

In the revised manuscript, we use the term &quot;promoter-proximal pause-release&quot; throughout, which describes the step of pausing after promoter clearance.

The precedent of cyclin E degradation cited on p. 20 is interesting but not quite apt: in that case degradation is promoted by phosphorylation of cyclin E (on a sequence motif known as a phosphodegron), and I am not aware of any requirement for cyclin E phosphorylation in binding to CDK2, so its relevance to the proposed mechanism of cyclin T1 degradation is not clear.</p></disp-quote><p>In the quoted manuscript, the phosphorylated Cyclin E protein is targeted by SCF E3 ligase complex for degradation.

The author describe that the pool of free Cyclin T1 is rapidly degraded when it is not phosphorylated on these two respective sites in the cyclin boxes of cyclin T1. The PP1 phosphates inhibitor okadaic acid leads to P-TEFb stabilization, as less CycT1 is degraded, whereas kinase inhibitors targeting PKC result in P-TEFb disassembly and degradation of CycT1. Using a set of different kinase inhibitors, the authors find that PKC-Î± and PKC-Î² are responsible for CycT1 phosphorylation.</p><p>The findings described in this study bring the transcription regulating cyclins, as CycT1, closer to the cell cycle regulating cyclins, which are long known for the tight regulation between expression upregulation and ubiquitination downregulation. These findings are potentially important, as they could shift our view on the transcriptional cyclins and the need for transcriptional CDK regulators (as 7SK/Hexim1 and Brd4, HIV Tat, AFF4 â¦), if gene expression and degradation is indeed another layer of regulation of these cyclins.</p><p>There is one major conundrum to this study: Multiple biochemical and structural studies on CDK9 and Cyclin T1 have been performed, often by co-expression and co-purification of these two subunits. In none of them (to my knowledge) a phosphorylated T143 or T149 residue was identified. The sentence &quot;Unphosphorylated CycT1 dissociates from P-TEFb and is degraded.&quot; (page 20 and similar in the abstract) seems therefore farfetched. If pT143 and pT149 stabilizes the complex in such a profound degree, why are researchers able to form the non-phosphorylated complex in the first place? CycT1 can be expressed from <italic>E. coli</italic> exhibiting no phosphorylation and binds properly well to CDK9. It would be very beneficial and in support of this study to know the dissociation constants for the interaction partners in a CycT1 phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated state.</p></disp-quote><p>As described in the answer to Reviewers 1 and 2, all P-TEFb structures (including the studies by Baumli 2008, Tahirov 2010, Alber 2013, Alber 2014) were obtained after the purification of the complex from the eukaryotic (insect S9 cells) cells, where CDK9 and CycT1 are likely phosphorylated. Also, enzymatically active P-TEFb complex can be purified from eukaryotic cells, but not from <italic>E. coli</italic> where post-translational modifications (PTM) are not preserved. Although structural studies by Geyer group used CycT1 expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>, these studies did not include CDK9. In fact, there are no studies with P-TEFb expressed from <italic>E. coli</italic>. This finding has been confirmed by our direct communications with Prof. Price, Alber and Hurley.</p><p>In addition, the new table S1 demonstrates that after further Molecular dynamics simulations and MM-GBSA binding energy calculations, the phosphorylation of Thr143 and Thr149 in CycT1 results in a thermodynamically more stable CycT1:CDK9 association. The predominant contribution to the increased binding energy of the complex comes from electrostatic (ÎE<sub>elec</sub>) and polar solvation (ÎE<sub>solvâpolar</sub>) energies, which is consistent with the previous co-IPs between CycT1/mutant CycT1 and CDK9/mutant CDK9 proteins (Figures 3B, 3C and 3D). Furthermore, new Figure 2D demonstrates that with okadaic acid treatment, total phosphorylation levels in purified WT CycT1(280) are much higher than in its purified mutant CycT1(280)TT143149AA protein after phospho-staining.

First of all, the description of Figure 3A is changed greatly and we emphasized that this is merely a model to provide a better understanding of which residues in the CycT1:CDK9 complex are targeted by Thr143 and Thr149. We also added more predictions based on molecular dynamics simulations and MM-GBSA binding energy calculations (Figure 3A and Table 1), which further indicate that the phosphorylation of Thr143 and Thr149 in CycT1 results in a thermodynamically more stable CDK9:CycT1 association. The predominant contribution to the increased binding energy of the complex comes from electrostatic (ÎE<sub>elec</sub>) and polar solvation (ÎE<sub>solvâpolar</sub>) energies. Results of following IP-WBs support the model (Figures 3B, 3C and 3D).

The co-IPs in Figures 1 and 3 indicate that these interactions between CDK9 and mutant CycT1 T143A or CycT1 T149A proteins are weaker than those with the WT CycT1, but the double mutant CycT1 TT143149AA protein reveals a synergistic, rather than additive, impact on CDK9 binding.

The authors have addressed one of my major concerns by providing evidence that PKC can phosphorylate a cyclin T1 fragment in T143/149-dependent fashion in vitro (Figure 5G). I am less persuaded by the evidence implicating PP1 in dephosphorylating cyclin T1, but this is largely owing to the technical difficulty of proving phosphatase specificity in cell-based experiments. Taken together, there is substantial reason to believe, based on the data presented, that presence or absence of PKC-dependent signaling is a determining factor in P-TEFb activity levels in different settings (e.g. resting or exhausted versus activated T cells).</p></disp-quote><p>We added additional phosphatase inhibitors in the revised manuscript. Examining the literature, we find that experimental procedures followed in our work represent the accepted gold standard. The plethora of PP1 and PP2 subunits renders most other approaches difficult if not impossible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>My biggest concern remains, however, that the mechanism the authors propose for this regulation-phosphorylation of two specific residues on cyclin T1 that stabilize an interaction with CDK9-is only incrementally closer to being validated in the revised version. The new data addressing this point were obtained in a complicated setup, in which a severely truncated cyclin T1 fragment (missing residues needed for interaction with CDK9) was expressed in 293T cells and then pulled down and detected in gels by a commercial phosphoprotein-staining reagent, either intact (Figure 2D) or after tryptic digestion (2E). Mutation of T143 and T149 to A abolished the signal, which is promising but still preliminary evidence that these sites might be phosphorylated in intact cyclin T1 under physiologic conditions. This does not address the concern, also expressed by Reviewer 3, that this requirement-and the phosphorylations themselves-have escaped previous detection. The authors dismiss this concern by pointing out that structures of P-TEFb were solved for complexes expressed in insect cells, but this is not persuasive; in those structures, phosphorylation on T186 of the CDK9 activation segment was readily observed (Baumli et al., 2008; Tahirov et al., 2010). Fully active, stable P-TEFb complexes can also be reconstituted from purified CDK9 expressed in insect cells and cyclin T1 purified from bacteria. Finally, a quick check of the PhosphoSite online data base did not turn up either of these sites.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the phosphorylation of T186 was observed in the crystal structure of P-TEFb, but important others in CDK9 and CycT1 were not. In addition, CycT1 from position 1-280 is fully functional in cells when presented to RNA polymerase via RNA (many papers from our and other groups). The full length CycT1 1-726 is only required for DNA presentation. There, the histidine-rich stretch in CycT1 binds to the CTD and directs the modification of RNA polymerase from the distance. In our 2002 manuscript, we discovered that promoters for the most part initiate transcription and enhancers elongate transcription, precisely because of this extended C-terminal half of CycT1. Thus, CycT1 1-280 is a fully functional P-TEFb when presented to RNA polymerase as it begins to synthesize RNA. That is precisely how Tat works! However, CycT1 1-280 has two almost identical large tryptic digests, which necessitated a further truncation to create a unique, identifiable fragment that is phosphorylated by the gold standard for the direct mapping of phorphorylated residues in proteins, that of comparing wild type and mutated peptides for phosphorylated residues. As explained in greater detail below, it would have been impossible to demonstrate the phosphorylation of these adjacent threonines in any other way than with a truncated, validated CycT1 protein. We went to great lengths to explain this logic in the revised manuscript.</p><p>To the second point, no one has been able to reconstitute P-TEFb from bacterially expressed components. We contacted Alber/Hurley and Tahirov groups, especially those responsible for generating P-TEFb in insect cells and they confirmed this finding. Importantly, they also investigated only P-TEFb lacking the C-terminal half of CycT1, which is unstructured and resisted all attempts at crystallization. Other validated (published) phosphorylated residues in CDK9 also did not appear in these structures.</p><p>There is a suggestion throughout this review that we did not follow precedent. The only reason this study was undertaken is because of two publications, which revealed that T143, T149 and two other residues in CycT1 were essential for P-TEFb. In our manuscript, we could eliminate contributions of these 2 other residues, which left T143 and T149. Several independent prediction protocols, all freely available on line (to all investigators) revealed that they are bona fide phosphorylation sites, especially for PKC.</p><p>In separate work by us and others, we found that CycT1 was degraded in resting and terminally differentiated cells, which was prevented by MG132 and bortezomib (bortezomib or Velcade<sup>R</sup> is a proteosomal inhibitor that revolutionized the treatment of multiple myeloma). In these studies, they played key roles in reversing HIV latency, especially when combined with PKC agonists. Thus, our findings are not new to us but follow abundant precedent in the literature!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>So I must reiterate my initial position that, because the authors are proposing a novel and highly detailed mechanism for regulating an essential transcription regulator, the existence, necessity and sufficiency of T143 and T149 phosphorylation simply must be proven and not merely inferred. Typically, a study such as this would include dispositive supporting data obtained via mass spectrometry, phospho-specific antibodies, or both, to gain acceptance at a top-tier journal.</p></disp-quote><p>Please note that mass spectrometry was never mentioned in the initial review. We attempted to make specific antibodies against phosphorylated T143 and T149. However, extensive discussions with experts in making anti-phosphorylated peptide antibodies at UCSF and commercial sources, led to the conclusion that 1. these phosphorylated residues reside in a deep and cavernous pocket (where CDK9 binds) and 2. are spaced close together, which would be difficult if not impossible to access and distinguish by rather bulky antibodies. As to mass spectrometry, we consulted two experts as well. Upon reading the paper, they thought our data were convincing, internally consistent and exhaustive. They pointed out that mass spectrometry is notoriously bad with two adjacent (closely positioned) phosphorylated residues. Agreeing that sampling of free and complexed CycT1 (unphosphorylated and phosphorylated) would present another challenge of abundance and representation. Another problem was with sample preparation and removal of phosphate groups during isolation and purification of P-TEFb. Intrinsic to mass spectrometry, they mentioned acidity, competition for ionization, suppression of signals, unidentifiable peaks and incomplete peptide maps. There are many other considerations, too many to enumerate here (but we are happy to provide additional statements and references). Some relate directly to the published data on CycT1, where only 2 phosphorylated sites were observed in the full-length protein (none in crystal structure of P-TEFb). Using traditional mapping of phosphorylated residues by radiography, Jones and Zhou groups found many more sites in CDK9 and CycT1. Our Figure 2 reveals that there are also additional sites in the truncated CycT1. In conclusion, both experts urged strongly that any mass spectrometric findings would have to be validated by other methods, which they thought we did already. Indeed, they were puzzled that these other accepted and validated measures were not accepted by this reviewer.</p></body></sub-article></article>
