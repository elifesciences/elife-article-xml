These structurally robust organelles experience strenuous cellular processes such as cell division or ciliary beating while performing their function. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the stability of microtubule triplets, as well as centriole architectural integrity remain poorly understood. Here, using ultrastructure expansion microscopy for nanoscale protein mapping, we reveal that POC16 and its human homolog WDR90 are components of the microtubule wall along the central core region of the centriole. We further found that WDR90 is an evolutionary microtubule associated protein. Finally, we demonstrate that WDR90 depletion impairs the localization of inner scaffold components, leading to centriole structural abnormalities in human cells. Altogether, this work highlights that WDR90 is an evolutionary conserved molecular player participating in centriole architecture integrity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells are made up of compartments called organelles that perform specific roles. A cylindrical organelle called the centriole is important for a number of cellular processes, ranging from cell division to movement and signaling. Each centriole contains nine blades made up of protein filaments called microtubules, which link together to form a cylinder. This well-known structure can be found in a variety of different species. Yet, it is unclear how centrioles are able to maintain this stable architecture whilst carrying out their various different cell roles.</p><p>In early 2020, a group of researchers discovered a scaffold protein at the center of centrioles that helps keep the microtubule blades stable. Further investigation suggested that another protein called WDR90 may also help centrioles sustain their cylindrical shape. However, the exact role of this protein was poorly understood.</p><p>To determine the role of WDR90, Steib et al. – including many of the researchers involved in the 2020 study – used a method called Ultrastructure Expansion Microscopy to precisely locate the WDR90 protein in centrioles. This revealed that WDR90 is located on the microtubule wall of centrioles in green algae and human cells grown in the lab. Further experiments showed that the protein binds directly to microtubules and that removing WDR90 from human cells causes centrioles to lose their scaffold proteins and develop structural defects.</p><p>This investigation provides fundamental insights into the structure and stability of centrioles. It shows that single proteins are key components in supporting the structural integrity of organelles and shaping their overall architecture. Furthermore, these findings demonstrate how ultrastructure expansion microscopy can be used to determine the role of individual proteins within a complex structure.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>centriole</kwd><kwd>microtubule</kwd><kwd>chlamydomonas</kwd><kwd>expansion microscopy</kwd><kwd>inner scaffold</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PP00P3_157517</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guichard</surname><given-names>Paul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A_166608</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Steinmetz</surname><given-names>Michel O</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>StG 715289</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guichard</surname><given-names>Paul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PP00P3_187198</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guichard</surname><given-names>Paul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Centriole integrity is ensured by the connection between the inner scaffold and microtubule triplets through POC16/WDR90 proteins.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Centrioles and basal bodies (referred to as centrioles from here onwards for simplicity) are conserved organelles important for the formation of the centrosome as well as for templating cilia and flagella assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bornens, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Breslow and Holland, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Conduit et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ishikawa and Marshall, 2011</xref>).

Each region displays specific structural features such as the cartwheel on the proximal end, which is crucial for centriole assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nakazawa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Strnad et al., 2007</xref>) or the distal appendages at the very distal region, essential for membrane docking during ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tanos et al., 2013</xref>). The central core region of the centriole is defined by the presence of a circular inner scaffold thought to maintain the integrity of microtubule triplets under compressive forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Le Guennec et al., 2020</xref>). Using cryo-tomography, we recently showed that the inner centriole scaffold forms an extended helix covering ~70% of the centriole length and that is rooted at the inner junction between the A and B microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). This connection consists of a stem attaching the neighboring A and B microtubules and three arms extending from the same stem toward the centriolar lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Le Guennec et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>).

Notably, the centriolar proteins POC1B, FAM161A, POC5 and Centrin have been shown to localize to the inner scaffold along the microtubule blades in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Le Guennec et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, these proteins form a complex that can bind to microtubules through the microtubule-binding protein FAM161A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Le Guennec et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zach et al., 2012</xref>). Importantly, a subset of these proteins has been shown to be important, such as POC5 for centriole elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Azimzadeh et al., 2009</xref>) as well as POC1B for centriole and basal body integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pearson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Venoux et al., 2013</xref>). This observation highlights the role of the inner scaffold structure in providing stability to the entire centriolar microtubule wall organization. However, the exact contribution of the inner scaffold to microtubule triplets stability and how the inner scaffold is connected to the microtubule blade is unknown.</p><p>We recently identified the conserved proteins POC16/WDR90 as proteins localizing to the central core region in both <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> and human centrioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hamel et al., 2017</xref>). Impairing POC16 or WDR90 functions has been found to affect ciliogenesis, suggesting that POC16/WDR90 may stabilize the microtubule wall, thereby ensuring proper flagellum or cilium assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hamel et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, POC16 has been proposed to be at the inner junction between the A and B microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yanagisawa et al., 2014</xref>) through its sequence identity with FAP20, an axonemal microtubule doublet inner junction protein of <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> flagella (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dymek et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ma et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Owa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yanagisawa et al., 2014</xref>). As the stem connects the A- and B-microtubules interface, these observations suggest that POC16/WDR90 may connect the inner scaffold to the microtubule triplet through this stem structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), thus ensuring integrity of the centriole architecture.</p><p>In this study, using a combination of cell biology, biochemistry and Ultrastructure Expansion Microscopy (U-ExM) approaches, we establish that the conserved POC16/WDR90 proteins localize on the centriolar microtubule wall in the central core region of both <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> and human cells. We further demonstrate that WDR90 is a microtubule-binding protein and that loss of this protein impairs the localization of inner scaffold components and leads to slight centriole elongation, impairment of the canonical circular shape of centrioles as well as defects in centriolar architecture integrity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>POC16/WDR90 is a conserved microtubule wall component of the central core region</title><p>To test the hypothesis that POC16/WDR90 is a microtubule triplet component, we analyzed its distribution using U-ExM that allows nanoscale mapping of proteins inside the centriole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gambarotto et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Le Guennec et al., 2020</xref>). We observed first in <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> isolated centrioles that the endogenous POC16 longitudinal fluorescence signal is restricted to the central core region as compared to the tubulin signal, which depicts total centriolar length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>). From top viewed centrioles, we measured the distance between both POC16 and tubulin maximal intensity signal from the exterior to the interior of the centriole and found that POC16 localizes precisely on the microtubule wall in the central core region of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M,N</xref>, average distance between POC16 and tubulin Δ = 0 nm +/- 8). As a control, we could recapitulate the internal localization along the microtubule wall of POB15, another central core protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M,N</xref>, average distance between POB15 and tubulin Δ = 12 nm +/- 7) as previously reported using immunogold-labeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hamel et al., 2017</xref>). In human centrioles, the POC16 human homolog WDR90 localizes similarly to POC16 on the centriolar microtubule wall, demonstrating the evolutionary conserved restricted localization of POC16/WDR90 on microtubule triplets in the central core region of centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J–L</xref>). Of note, POC16 and WDR90 display a punctate distribution that we hypothesize to be due to the poor quality of the antibody.</p><p>Next, we compared the relative position of WDR90 from top view centrioles to previously described inner scaffold components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1O–Q</xref>) (see Materials and methods). We found that while WDR90 precisely localizes to the centriolar microtubule wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1P</xref>, average distance between WDR90 and tubulin: Δ = 2 nm +/12), POC1B, FAM161A, POC5 and Centrin signals were shifted toward the centriole lumen in comparison to the tubulin signal, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1P</xref>, Δ = 15 nm +/- 8; 22 nm +/- 5; 27 nm +/- 6 and 28 nm +/- 9, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Le Guennec et al., 2020</xref>). These results demonstrate that WDR90 longitudinal distribution is similar to the inner scaffold components but its localization on the microtubule wall suggests that WDR90 is a component of the centriolar microtubule triplet of the central core region.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>POC16/WDR90 is an evolutionary conserved microtubule-associated protein</title><p>Proteins of the POC16/WDR90 family consist of an N-terminal DUF667-containing domain (domain of unknown function), similar to the ciliary inner junction protein FAP20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yanagisawa et al., 2014</xref>), followed by multiple WD40 repeats that form β-propeller structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Xu and Min, 2011</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>WDR90/POC16-DUF667 directly binds both microtubules and tubulin.</title><p>(see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">3</xref>).

To this end, we raised an antibody against <italic>Paramecium tetraurelia</italic> POC16 and confirmed its localization at centrioles similarly to what we found in <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> and human cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hamel et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Further driven by its predicted similarity to the microtubule associated protein FAP20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Khalifa et al., 2020</xref>) and the underlying hypothesis that POC16/WDR90 proteins might be joining A and B microtubules as well as by their precise localization on the microtubule wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), we first set out to understand the structural identity between the predicted structures of POC16-DUF667 domain to the recently published near atomic structure of FAP20 from flagella microtubule doublets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Khalifa et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ma et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). Strikingly, we observed high similarities between the two structures, suggesting similar biological functions at the inner junction. Moreover, we fitted POC16 model prediction into FAP20 cryo-EM density map and found a good concordance, further hinting for a conserved localization at the level of the microtubule triplet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>).</p><p>Prompted by this result, we then tested whether POC16/WDR90 proteins, similar to FAP20, can bind microtubules both in human cells as well as in vitro. To do so, we overexpressed the N-terminal part of WDR90 and POC16 comprising the DUF667 domain (WDR90-N(1-225) and POC16(1-295), respectively) fused to GFP in U2OS cells and found that this region is sufficient to decorate cytoplasmic microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>). We next tested whether overexpressing such a WDR90-N-terminal fragment could stabilize microtubules. To this end, we analyzed the microtubule network in cells overexpressing mCherry-WDR90-N after depolymerizing microtubules through a cold shock treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B–D</xref>). We found that while low expressing cells did not maintain a microtubule network, high expressing cells did. This suggests that WDR90-N can stabilize microtubules. In contrast, we observed that full-length WDR90 fused to GFP only anecdotally binds microtubules. This observation suggests a possible autoinhibition conformation of the full-length protein and/or to interacting partners preventing microtubule binding in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3E</xref>).</p><p>Next, we determined whether different POC16/WDR90 N-terminal domains directly bind to microtubules in vitro and whether this function has been conserved in evolution. Bacterially expressed, recombinant POC16/WDR90 DUF667 domains from seven different species were purified and their microtubule interaction ability was assessed using a standard microtubule-pelleting assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We found that every POC16/WDR90 DUF667 domain directly binds to microtubules in vitro. This interaction was further confirmed using negative staining electron microscopy, where we could observe recombinant WDR90-N localizing on in vitro polymerized microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p>We next investigated whether POC16/WDR90 DUF667 domain could also interact with free tubulin dimers, considering that closure of the inner junction between the A and B microtubules necessitates two microtubule/tubulin-binding sites as recently reported for FAP20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ma et al., 2019</xref>). We observed that all POC16/WDR90 DUF667 orthologs directly interact with tubulin dimers, generating oligomers that pellet under centrifugation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We then tested whether the DUF667 domain could still interact with tubulin once bound to microtubules. We subsequently incubated either WDR90-N or POC16(1-295) pre-complexed with microtubules with an excess of free tubulin and analyzed their structural organization by electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3F,G</xref>). We observed an additional level of decoration due to the simultaneous binding of the DUF667 domains with tubulin and microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3F,G</xref>). Furthermore, we revealed a 8.5 nm periodical organization of tubulin-WDR90-N oligomers on microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), similar to the recent high-resolution structure of the ciliary microtubule doublet showing that monomeric FAP20 interacts with both A- and B-microtubules every 8 nm at the inner junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Khalifa et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ma et al., 2019</xref>). Due to its similarity, it is tempting to speculate that the DUF667 domain of POC16/WDR90 is also monomeric, however it is also possible that WDR90 forms a homodimer capable of interacting with the microtubules and tubulin.</p><p>Based on these results, we concluded that POC16/WDR90 is an evolutionary conserved microtubule/tubulin-interacting protein with the capacity to connect microtubules, a functional prerequisite for an inner junction protein that simultaneously interacts with the A and B microtubules.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>WDR90 is recruited in G2 during centriole core elongation</title><p>We next assessed whether WDR90 recruitment at centrioles is correlated with the appearance of inner scaffold proteins during centriole biogenesis. In cycling human cells, centrioles duplicate only once per cell cycle during S phase, with the appearance of one procentriole orthogonally to each of the two mother centrioles. Procentrioles then elongate during the following G2 phase of the cell cycle, acquiring the inner scaffold protein POC5 that is critical for the formation of the central and distal parts of the nascent procentriole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Azimzadeh et al., 2009</xref>).

Moreover, we observed an asymmetry in signal reduction at centrioles in WDR90-depleted cells, with only one of two Centrin-positive centrioles still associated with WDR90 in G1 and early S-phase (69% compared to 10% in controls) and one of four Centrin-positive centrioles in S/G2/M cells (77% compared to 0% in controls, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). As the four Centrin-positive dots indicate duplicated centrioles, this result suggests that the loss of WDR90 does not result from a duplication failure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). We postulate therefore that the remaining WDR90 signal possibly corresponds to the mother centriole and that the daughter has been depleted from WDR90 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E</xref>), similarly to what has been observed for the protein POC5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Azimzadeh et al., 2009</xref>).

We found that the double siRNA led to a strong decrease of cell number as compared to WDR90 depletion alone, suggesting either an increase of cell mortality or a defect in cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1J</xref>). As expected, we found that the remaining POC5 belt found in WDR90-depleted centrioles was completely removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). Moreover, centrioles appeared even further elongated under these conditions, indicating that the complete removal of POC5 further enhances the WDR90 phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I,J</xref>). Structurally, we noticed beside the elongated centrioles about 30%, of abnormal centrioles in WDR90/POC5 depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A,C,D</xref>; 70 out of 260 centrioles), ranging from very short centrioles that seem to lack the entire core/distal region as well as centrioles with broken microtubule blades. We also noted a loss of centriole roundness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>, white arrow). Overall, these phenotypes support our prediction that depletion of inner scaffolds component strongly impairs centriole integrity.</p><p>Collectively, we demonstrate that WDR90 is crucial to ensure inner core protein localization within the centriole core, as well as to maintain the microtubule wall integrity and the overall centriole roundness and stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>What maintains centriole barrel stability and roundness is a fundamental open question. Centrioles are microtubule barrel structures held together by the A-C linker at their proximal region and a recently discovered inner scaffold in the central/distal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Le Guennec et al., 2020</xref>). The presence of such an extended scaffold covering 70% of the centriolar length has led to the hypothesis that this structure is important for maintaining centriole integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Le Guennec et al., 2020</xref>). Our work demonstrates that POC16/WDR90 family proteins constitute an evolutionary conserved central core microtubule triplet component that is essential for maintaining the inner centriolar scaffold components in human centrioles. The depletion of WDR90 leads to centriolar defects and impairment of microtubule triplets organization resulting in the loss of the canonical circular shape of centrioles. We also found that this overall destabilization of the centriole can lead to microtubule triplet breakage. Whether this phenotype arises as a consequence of the loss of the inner scaffold or due to the destabilization of the inner junction of the microtubule triplet is still an opened question that should be addressed in the future. Moreover, although unlikely, we cannot exclude that fragile centrioles such as the ones found in WDR90-depleted cells could be affected and further distorted by the technique of expansion microscopy.</p><p>We also demonstrate using expansion microscopy that POC16/WDR90 is a component of the microtubule triplet restricted to the central core region. In addition and based on the sequence and structural similarity to the DUF667 domain of FAP20 that composes the inner junction in flagella, we propose that POC16/WDR90 localizes at the inner junction of the A and B microtubule of the centriolar microtubule triplet. The fact that WDR90 localization is restricted to the central core region led us to hypothesize that another protein, possibly FAP20 as it has been previously reported at centrioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yanagisawa et al., 2014</xref>), could mediate the inner junction between A- and B-microtubule in the proximal region of the centriole. Moreover, in POC16/WDR90 proteins, the DUF667 domain is followed by a WD40 domain sharing a similarity with the flagellar inner B-microtubule protein FAP52/WDR16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Owa et al., 2019</xref>) leading us to propose that the WD40 domains of POC16/WDR90 might also be located inside the B-microtubule of the triplet. However, whether this is the case remains to be addressed in future studies. In addition, WDR90 is potentially not the only protein that forms the inner junction. Indeed, we and others also previously show that FAM161A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Le Guennec et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zach et al., 2012</xref>), similarly to WDR90, is a microtubule-binding protein close to the inner microtubule wall of the centriole, raising the possibility that both might compose the stem and link the microtubule triplets to the inner scaffold. It will be interesting in the future to study whether these two proteins interact.</p><p>Our work further establishes that WDR90 is recruited to centrioles in G2 phase of the cell cycle concomitant with centriole elongation and inner central core assembly. We found that WDR90 depletion does not impair centriole duplication nor microtubule wall assembly, as noted by the presence of the proximal marker HsSAS-6 and the distal cap CP110. In stark contrast, WDR90 depletion leads to a strong reduction of inner scaffold components at centrioles, as well as some centriole destabilization.</p><p>Although several examples of centriole integrity loss have been demonstrated in the past, the molecular mechanisms of centriole disruption are not understood. For instance, Delta- and Epsilon-tubulin mutants have been shown in several model organisms to affect centriole integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dutcher et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dutcher and Trabuco, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garreau de Loubresse et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">O'Toole et al., 2003</xref>) with notably in human cells where Delta- and Epsilon-tubulin null mutant cells were shown to lack microtubule triplets and have thus unstable centrioles that do not persist to the next cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Remarkably, these centrioles can elongate with a proper recruitment of the cartwheel component HsSAS-6 and the distal marker CP110 but fails to recruit POC5, a result that is similar to our findings with WDR90-depleted cells. As Delta- and Epsilon-tubulin null human mutant cells can solely assemble microtubule singlets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2017</xref>), we speculate that WDR90 might not be recruited in these centrioles, as the A- and B-microtubule inner junction would be missing. As a consequence, the inner scaffold proteins may not be recruited, as already shown for POC5, leading to the observed futile cycle of centriole formation and disintegration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). It would therefore be interesting to study the presence of WDR90 in these null mutants as well as the other components of the inner scaffold in the future.</p><p>Our work also showed that WDR90 as well as POC5 depletion affects centriole length in human cells. Altogether, these results emphasize the role of these two proteins in overall centriole length regulation and suggest an unexpected role of the inner scaffold structure in centriole length control. It would be of great interest to understand if and how the absence of the inner scaffold can affect the length of the centriole without affecting distal markers such as CP110, which remains unchanged in our experiments. It is very likely that the concomitant elongation of the centriole with the appearance of inner scaffold components in G2 can act on the final length of this organelle.</p><p>Given the importance of centriole integrity in enabling the proper execution of several diverse cellular processes, our work provides new fundamental insights into the architecture of the centriole, establishing a structural basis for centriole stability and the severe phenotypes that arise when lost.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

Previously, the authors demonstrated that WDR90 localizes to the central inner centriole wall in human/<italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> cells and that its depletion impairs cilia/flagella formation. Here, they demonstrate that WDR90 may directly bind to the centriole wall, where it could link the A- and B-tubules, separating itself from other components of the inner scaffold (POC1B, FAM161A, POC5 and centrin). Using cellular localization, in vitro binding assays, and EM analysis, the authors further show that WDR90 can directly associate with pure MT polymers and free tubulin dimers, suggesting a role of POC16/WDR90 in linking the MT wall to the inner scaffold of the centriole in the central core region. Consistently, functional studies showed that in the absence of WDR90, several inner scaffold components fail to localize to centrioles, and that centrioles depleted of WDR90 become unstable, often losing structural integrity.</p><p>Overall, this is a nicely presented follow-up of the group's previous work that reveals new detail about the organization of proteins at the inner centriole wall, which is important for our understanding of centriole structural integrity. In particular the localization and biochemical studies are solid and of high quality. However, there is also some overlap with previously published work regarding the mapping of inner scaffold components (Le Guennec et al., 2020). Moreover, the relationships between WDR90, POC5 and other inner wall proteins in human cells and differences in RNAi phenotypes could be elucidated in more detail.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Previous work suggests FOP1, glutamylaton, BLD10, and POC1 play roles in stability.

Interestingly, we found that Polyglutamylation decorates the centriolar microtubule wall as previously reported (Mahecic et al., 2020 and Sullenberger et al., 2020) while CEP135 displayed a more complex localization spanning the entire centriole with a clear proximal enrichment. Finally, FOP1 decorated the external central/distal region of the centriole, forming a surrounding shell around the centriole. Overall, we found that glutamylation and CEP135 localization were not affected by the depletion of WDR90. These results suggest that the stability defects observed upon WDR90 depletion are not linked to the protein CEP135 nor to glutamylation defects. In addition, we observed a slight impact on FOP1 distribution that appears more dispersed in WDR90-depleted condition. The new acquired data are now included in the revised manuscript as a new Figure 4—figure supplement 1 as well as in the revised text (subsection “WDR90 depletion leads to a loss of inner scaffold components and to centriole fracture”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Loss of POC5 in human cells results in short centrioles that fail to elongate (Azimzadeh et al., 2009), whereas WDR90-depleted centrioles, in which POC5 is also lost, become over-elongated (this study). It would be very informative if the authors can address this discrepancy.</p></disp-quote><p>Again, we would like to thank the reviewers for pointing out this interesting comment. To address it, we depleted POC5 using the previously described <italic>poc5</italic> siRNA (Azimzadeh et al., 2005) and analyzed the resulting phenotype by expansion microscopy. We first demonstrate that POC5 is efficiently depleted upon siRNA treatment both by standard immunofluorescence microscopy as well as by U-ExM (Figure 6 and Figure 6—figure supplement 1). We next analyzed POC5-depleted mature centrioles by U-ExM and found, similarly to what we report for WDR90 depletion, that these depleted centrioles were longer (Figure 6). This important finding suggests greatly that depletion of the inner scaffold proteins, such as POC5 or WDR90, can lead to a slight centriole elongation. Importantly, we verified that in mitotic cells, similarly to the published work of Azimzadeh et al., procentrioles were shorter than control cells, validating the POC5 depletion condition (Figure 6—figure supplement 1). We also analyzed centriole post-mitosis and found that these procentrioles converted into daughter centrioles are then longer. We do think that the centriole over-elongation happens during mitosis, explaining the discrepancy between our results and the previous one published by the Bornens Lab. This point is now reported in subsection “WDR90/POC5 co-depletion enhances centriole architecture abnormalities” of the revised manuscript.</p><p>For example, where is WDR90 in POC5-depleted centrioles?</p><p>To answer this question, we analyzed the distribution of WDR90 upon POC5 depletion both by standard immunofluorescence microscopy and expansion microscopy (Figure 6 and Figure 6—figure supplement 1). Importantly, we found that WDR90 is not affected by POC5 depletion, suggesting that WDR90 is upstream of POC5 (subsection “WDR90/POC5 co-depletion enhances centriole architecture abnormalities”).</p><p>What does the centriole look like (longer or shorter) when both WDR90 and POC5 are gone? Does WDR90 really function upstream of POC5 (or other inner scaffold components) as the model suggests?</p><p>This is a great question! We co-depleted WDR90 and POC5 and assess the size of centrioles under these conditions using U-ExM. Remarkably, we found that under this condition, the remaining belt of POC5 observed upon WDR90 depletion is now completely gone and we also find a significant proportion of mother and daughter centrioles depleted. Remarkably, we found that the phenotype of the co-depletion led to overly long centrioles (Figure 6 and Figure 6—figure supplement 1). More importantly, the number of broken centrioles are now about 30% upon double depletion while we found only 10% of depleted centrioles with single depletion (WDR90 or POC5) (Figure 5 and Figure 6—figure supplement 2). These results confirm that the removal of inner scaffold components such as WDR90 and POC5 affects centriole integrity.</p><p>The results from these experiments are presented in Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 6—figure supplement 1 and Figure 6—figure supplement 2 and described in the revised manuscript (subsection “WDR90/POC5 co-depletion enhances centriole architecture abnormalities”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Does the distorted shape of centrioles in WDR90-depleted cells, shown in cross sections in Figure 6, truly reflect the shape of WDR90-depleted centrioles prior to expansion or is the distortion a result of the expansion technique, performed on structurally compromised centrioles? Is this also seen by EM analysis?</p><p>The authors should classify the phenotypes and show the frequency for each category of abnormal centrioles by U-ExM and provide EM analyses if available.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewer’s concerns and provide now the classification of the phenotypes, showing the frequency of each category in the Figure 5—figure supplement 1. We have notably quantified the percentage of daughter centrioles that appears in top view and found it to be minority with only 5.3% of the cases observed (Figure 5—figure supplement 1A). Consistently, in WDR90-depleted cells, 4% (17/356 counted centrioles) of depleted centrioles were oriented in top views (Figure 5—figure supplement 1B). Importantly, 95% of these were abnormal, with an affected roundness, indicating that most of the depleted daughter centriole in top view had lost the canonical roundness shape of centrioles (Figure 5—figure supplement 1C).</p><p>Although we do not believe that this results from a distortion owing to the U-ExM technique, we cannot exclude formally that the more fragile/unstable centrioles in WDR90-depleted condition are not affected by the technique. We now stated this possibility in the discussion of the revised manuscript (Discussion section).</p><p>Lastly, concerning the EM analysis, we do not provide such examples owing to the technical difficulties in finding perfectly well-oriented top-view centrioles that are depleted of WDR90 as explained above.</p></body></sub-article></article>
