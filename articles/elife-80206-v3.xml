A lack of resilience can lead to the development of neuropsychiatric and sleep disorders, often within the same individual. Despite extensive research into the brain mechanisms causing maladaptive behavioral-responses to stress, it is not clear why some individuals exhibit resilience. To examine if sleep has a determinative role in maladaptive behavioral-response to social stress, we investigated individual variations in resilience using a social-defeat model for male mice. Our results reveal a direct, causal relationship between sleep amount and resilience—demonstrating that sleep increases after social-defeat stress only occur in resilient mice. Further, we found that within the prefrontal cortex, a regulator of maladaptive responses to stress, pre-existing differences in sleep regulation predict resilience. Overall, these results demonstrate that increased NREM sleep, mediated cortically, is an active response to social-defeat stress that plays a determinative role in promoting resilience. They also show that differences in resilience are strongly correlated with inter-individual variability in sleep regulation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>To many of us, it may seem obvious that sleep is restorative: we feel better after a good night’s rest. However, exactly how sleep benefits the brain and body remains poorly understood. One clue may lie in neuropsychiatric disorders: these conditions – such as depression and anxiety – are often accompanied by disrupted sleep. Additionally, these neuropsychiatric disorders are frequently caused or worsened by stress, which can also interfere with sleep. This close association between stress and sleep has led some to hypothesize that sleep serves to overcome the adverse effects of stress on the brain, but this hypothesis remains largely untested.</p><p>One type of stress that is common to all mammals is social stress, defined as stress caused by social interactions. This means that mice and other rodents can be subjected to social stress in the laboratory to test hypotheses about the effects of stress on the brain. Importantly, in both animals and humans, there are individual differences in resilience, or the ability to overcome the adverse effects of stress.</p><p>Based on this information, Bush et al. set out to establish whether sleep can regulate resilience to social stress in mice. When the mice were gently kept awake during their normal sleep time, resilience decreased and so the mice were less able to overcome the negative effects of stress. Conversely, increasing sleep, by activating an area of the brain responsible for initiating sleep, increased the mice’s resilience to social stress. Thus, Bush et al. showed that changes in sleep do lead to changes in resilience.</p><p>To find out whether resilience can be predicted by changes in sleeping patterns, Bush et al. studied how both resilient mice and those susceptible to stress slept before and after social stress. Resilient mice would often sleep more after social stress; meanwhile, few changes were observed in susceptible mice. Surprisingly, sleep quality also predicted resilience, with resilient mice sleeping better than susceptible mice even before exposure to social stress. To determine whether the differences in sleep that predict resilience can be detected as brain activity, Bush et al. placed electrodes in two regions of the prefrontal cortex – a part of the brain important for decision-making and social behaviors – to measure how mice recovered lost sleep. This experiment revealed that the changes in sleep that predict resilience are prominent in the prefrontal cortex.</p><p>Overall, Bush et al. reveal that sleeping more and sleeping better promote resilience to social stress. Furthermore, the results suggests that lack of sleep may lead to increased risk of stress-related psychiatric conditions. Humans are one of the few species that choose to deprive themselves of sleep: Bush, et al. provide evidence that this choice may have significant consequences on mental health. Furthermore, this work creates a new model that lays the groundwork for future studies investigating how sleep can overcome stress on the brain.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The links between sleep, neuropsychiatric illness, and responses to stress have been extensively documented, but are poorly understood. Sleep disorders are debilitating features of neuropsychiatric conditions (for a review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wulff et al., 2010</xref>), and social stress is known to cause or exacerbate both sleep and neuropsychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Meerlo et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Meerlo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Germain et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huhman, 2006</xref>). Notably, both self-reported sleep disturbances and objective polysomnographic recordings are predictive of the development of stress-induced disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mellman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Koren et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Germain et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bryant et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sheaves et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ben Simon and Walker, 2018</xref>). In some cases, both humans and animals show resilience to the adverse effects of stress. The degree of resilience is highly variable between individuals for reasons that are not entirely clear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Galatzer-Levy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Potegal et al., 1993</xref>). The experiments reported here test two hypotheses: (1) that sleep amount plays a determinative role in the response of an individual to stress and (2) that inter-individual variability in sleep response to stress result in individual differences in resilience.</p><p>To investigate these hypotheses, we used a well-established model of social conflict in mice wherein rodents are socially stressed in the home cage of a larger conspecific. This model is frequently used to model core aspects of human pathologies with high face, construct, and etiological validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huhman et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vialou et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Krishnan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hammamieh et al., 2012</xref>). An important aspect of this social-defeat model is that not all socially stressed animals respond equally well—some mice are susceptible, and others are resilient to the effects of stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Krishnan et al., 2007</xref>). These differences in the behavioral responses to social-defeat stress provide the opportunity to compare brains of susceptible and resilient animals and investigate the brain mechanisms contributing to these behavioral phenotypes. Within this model, multiple functionally interconnected brain regions have a demonstrated role in determining resilience. These regions include the nucleus accumbens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vialou et al., 2010</xref>), amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jasnow and Huhman, 2001</xref>), hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wagner et al., 2013</xref>), and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hultman et al., 2016</xref>). To determine the role of sleep in resilience to social-defeat stress, we have experimentally altered sleep amount; to examine the role of inter-individual variability in sleep, we have conducted detailed examinations of sleep and sleep-response to social-defeat stress in both resilient and susceptible mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We first looked to determine if sleep was necessary for resilience to social-defeat stress. One cohort of mice received daily bouts of social stress at the onset of darkness. In these mice, social interaction (measured by interaction ratio<bold>,</bold> see Materials and Methods for details) was assessed 1 day before and 1 day after social-defeat stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). As expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Krishnan et al., 2007</xref>), half of these mice were resilient (interaction ratio &gt;1.1) to the effects of social-defeat stress (4 of 8 mice were resilient; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>; two susceptible—interaction ratio &lt;1, two undefined—interaction ratio between 1.1 and 0.9). A second cohort of mice was sleep restricted (8 h; n.b. sleep restriction is synonymous with sleep deprivation. Animals unavoidably obtain small amounts of sleep during these sleep-limiting interventions; therefore, the term restriction may be more accurate) at light onset during the ten consecutive-days of social-defeat stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In contrast to the mice without sleep restriction, no sleep-restricted mice were resilient; furthermore, all sleep-restricted mice showed decreased social interaction after social-defeat stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>; five susceptible, two undefined – interaction ratio between 1.1 and 0.9). Differences in social interaction were not due to changes in ambulatory activity, as all treatment-groups showed similar levels of activity during the social-interaction testing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The number of aggressive encounters across the social-defeat stress paradigm are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. In a separate cohort of sleep-deprived mice we assessed fecal corticosterone to estimate stress levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These findings show that hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis stress-pathways are not significantly activated by sleep restriction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>); However, this method assessed corticosterone over a 24 – hour period. It is possible that acute responses measured over a shorter period, and closer to the exact time of stress exposure, may differ. Collectively, these results demonstrate that sleep restriction increases susceptibility to social-defeat stress and provides evidence that sleep is necessary for resilience to social-defeat stress.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Daily sleep-restriction prevents resilience to social-defeat stress.</title><p>One cohort of mice received sleep restriction (8 hr, beginning at light onset) on each day of social-defeat stress; a second cohort (sleep replete) received only social-defeat stress (A; 10 days total, sleep restriction procedure outlined in Methods). As expected in the sleep replete cohort, roughly equal amounts of resilience and susceptibility occurred after social-defeat stress (<bold>B, C</bold>). In contrast, no mouse that underwent sleep restriction was resilient to social-defeat stress (<bold>B, C</bold>).

Because sleep is initiated by GABAergic cells projecting from the preoptic area (POA), we used a designer-receptor exclusively activated by designer-drugs (DREADD) to activate these POA neurons. Four weeks after delivering DREADD to the POA by adeno-associated virus, clozapine-n-oxide (CNO) was used to activate the DREADD and increase sleep. This was validated in a separate cohort of mice at zeitgeber time 10 (ZT, ZT 12=lights off, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), where a single injection of CNO increased non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep for approximately 6 hr. Single, daily injections (administered ZT 1–2) of CNO across the 10-day social-defeat paradigm enhanced total sleep by 79.3±12.5 (mean ± SEM) min per day over control mice, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) including 114.6±14.2 min per day of NREM sleep. Part of this NREM increase occurred at the expense of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep; REM sleep was reduced by 31.6±4.7 min per day. Mice expressing the active DREADD (increased sleep) had significantly increased interaction ratios (increased resilience) after social-defeat stress, when compared to CNO-treated control mice expressing EGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Notably, all mice expressing active-DREADD (increased sleep) were resilient (interaction ratio &gt;1.1), whereas only half of DREADD-control mice were resilient.

Prior to social-defeat stress, mice later identified as susceptible showed increased sleep-recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B, C</xref>, top row), and increased NREM SWA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), after 6-hr of sleep restriction; mice later identified as resilient did not show these changes. This difference was not caused by the amount of sleep lost, as both behavioral phenotypes lost similar amounts of NREM sleep during sleep restriction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, bottom row). In addition, the increased recovery-response in susceptible mice remained when NREM sleep was normalized for each mouse (to the amount of sleep lost over 6-hr and 18 hr of recovery; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, bottom row). After exposure to social stress, the overall patterns in NREM-sleep and NREM SWA were similar to pre social-defeat stress values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and F</xref>, bottom row).

Slow-wave energy was recovered in significantly less time for resilient animals, indicating a more efficient sleep-regulatory response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Slow-wave energy returned to baseline levels immediately after sleep restriction in the PrL LFP and EEG of resilient mice, and within 2-hr in the IL LFP. Susceptible mice, in comparison, were not fully recovered for up to 8 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We also examined the LFP during wake, both before and after sleep restriction. Low-frequency waveforms (2–6 Hz) increase in number and amplitude with sleep-pressure accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ehlen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thomas et al., 2000</xref>). These waveforms are thought to represent local sleep-like events encroaching into wakefulness (i.e. sleepiness). Counting the occurrence of the largest amplitude 2–6 Hz waveforms (I<sub>2-6</sub>) revealed that I<sub>2–6</sub>, and thus waking sleep-pressure, was increased in resilient mice after sleep-restriction. Susceptible mice showed no significant change in I<sub>2–6</sub> within the awake LFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). To further assess local differences in the vmPFC, we calculated phase coherence between each LFP electrode and the global EEG. We found phase coherence below 8 Hz increased in resilient mice during all conditions including: baseline, recovery from sleep restriction and after social-defeat stress; however, this difference was only found in the IL cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Importantly, the 24 hr average of these coherence values, in slow-wave frequencies, was significantly and positively correlated with social interaction ratios for the IL cortex, but not for the PrL cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Overall, this phase-coherence data indicates increased functional connectivity (i.e. a consistent phase-relationship evidenced by high phase-coherence) between the IL cortex and the overall EEG, in the frequency bands associate with sleep, is correlated with resilience. These LFP studies further support our conclusion that local differences in sleep-regulatory processes within the vmPFC exist before stress and predict resilience.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>NREM coherence in the 0.5–4 Hz range predicts resilience to social-defeat stress.</title><p>Local field potential (LFP) in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and epidural electroencephalographic recordings (EEG) were simultaneously obtained from mice before and after 10-days of social-defeat stress (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

We demonstrate through sleep restriction that sleep is required for resilience to social-defeat stress; further, our POA-activation findings demonstrate that specifically increasing sleep amount increases resilience. Thus, sleep plays a determinative role in resilience to social-defeat stress. Furthermore, sleep recordings obtained before and after social-defeat stress reveal that increases in sleep are exclusive to resilient animals. Together, these data lend strong support for the essential role of sleep in conferring resilience.</p><p>Several previous studies have revealed that social stress in both mice and rats causes increased sleep intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Meerlo et al., 1997</xref>) notably, this increased sleep intensity also occurs in the ‘winners’ of social conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kamphuis et al., 2015</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Meerlo et al., 1997</xref> have suggested that the specific nature of preceding wakefulness as well as the duration of prior wakefulness is important in sleep responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Meerlo et al., 1997</xref>). Thus, social-defeat stress may demand increased recovery sleep because it represents a more intense form of wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Meerlo et al., 1997</xref>). Indeed, the effect of waking-context on sleep regulation may extend beyond stress; recent findings indicate that repetitive tasks may represent less-intense wakefulness that, in turn, leads to less intense sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kamphuis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Milinski et al., 2021</xref>). In this context, the altered sleep regulation of susceptible mice in our experiments may render them incapable of responding with increased sleep during or after social-defeat stress, whereas resilient animals adequately recover from this intense wakefulness. Although the ability of social-defeat stress to alter sleep regulation has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Henderson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Radwan et al., 2021b</xref>), our studies demonstrate that differences in sleep regulation exist before exposure to social-defeat stress; however, it is important to consider that the mice were never truly stress naive as some manipulations prior to sleep recording (e.g. surgery) are stressful. The recent finding that sleep fragmentation, a potential indicator of altered sleep regulation, predicts stress susceptibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Radwan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Radwan et al., 2021a</xref>) is consistent with this hypothesis of pre-existing sleep differences; fragmentation before stress exposure was also confirmed in our studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>; longer NREM bout durations in resilient mice). Thus, the sleep changes, and ultimate behavioral outcomes resulting from social-defeat stress, are likely the result of pre-existing differences in sleep regulation. In this context, the intense waking experience of social stress, interacting with differences in sleep regulation between susceptible and resilient mice, may allow resilient animals to recover sleep and leave susceptible animals in a stress-vulnerable, perpetually sleep-deprived state.</p><p>Susceptible mice appear to be sleep deprived in that they show markers of insufficient sleep after 6 hr of sleep restriction. The deprivation was indicated by increased recovery sleep, both before and after social-defeat stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>); as well as a delayed recovery of slow wave energy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Insufficient sleep causes both a reduced ability to cope with stress and negative effects on mood (for a review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goldstein and Walker, 2014</xref>). Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies reveal that sleep deprivation leads to decreased functional connectivity between the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and amygdala; furthermore, this decreased functional connectivity is associated with decreased mood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Killgore, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Motomura et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yoo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Drummond et al., 1999</xref>). This same brain region, the vmPFC, is known to mediate resilience to social-defeat stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vialou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lehmann and Herkenham, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kumar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hultman et al., 2018</xref>). We reasoned that the sleep deprived state of susceptible mice would lead to vmPFC dysfunction; thus, leading to decreased connectivity and an inability to inhibit the limbic circuits responsible for regulating behavioral responses to social stress. As predicted, we found major differences between the vmPFC of susceptible and resilient mice. Our LFP recordings reveal that baseline slow wave activity and recovery from sleep deprivation are preferentially enhanced in the vmPFC of resilient animals—before exposure to stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). Wave incidence after sleep restriction, a marker of waking sleep pressure, is also significantly increased in resilient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–F</xref>). Together, the enhanced buildup of sleep pressure and increased homeostatic response led to faster recovery from sleep restriction in the vmPFC of resilient mice, thus supporting the hypothesis that NREM-related changes in vmPFC are associated with resilience.</p><p>In the present study, we used activation of the POA as a method to increase sleep. The POA has a well-established role in the promotion of sleep and multiple cell groups and neuronal subtypes within this region are involved in initiating sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sherin et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liou et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chung et al., 2017</xref>). Other physiological responses are also regulated by the POA including exploratory and sexual behavior, shivering thermogenesis and body temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Conceição et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tsuneoka and Funato, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kroeger et al., 2018</xref>). A recent chemogenetic study activated galanin-expressing neurons in the POA and reported findings similar to those reported here (increased NREM and decreased REM sleep), and a decrease in body temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kroeger et al., 2018</xref>). We did not observe behavioral effects other than sleep and our method was different in that it activated all neurons in the region; however, we cannot completely rule out the occurrence of non-specific effects. Furthermore, it is not clear from our studies if either clozapine N-oxide (CNO) or G<sub>q</sub> DREADD +CNO (POA activation) influences social-avoidance behavior in the absence of stress. To strengthen our findings, we conducted a detailed histological examination of this region to verify DREADD expression. All mice in the study expressed DREADD in regions of the POA known to initiate sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) and all responded with increased NREM sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Nevertheless, when considered in the context of our other results, especially our finding that sleep restriction decreases resilience (i.e. sleep restriction has the opposite effect of POA activation), our studies provide strong evidence that changes in sleep mediate the changes we observed in resilience.</p><p>Sleep regulation in the cortex is known to occur at a local level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vyazovskiy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Steriade et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miyamoto et al., 2003</xref>); areas that are more active during awake periods are known to have increased sleep intensity during subsequent sleep episodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pigarev et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dang-Vu, 2012</xref>).To find if local sleep-differences contribute to resilience, we examined sleep-related changes in two major subdivisions of the vmPFC—the infralimbic (IL) and prelimbic (PrL) cortex. Phase-coherence in the IL cortex (0.5–4 Hz, with the epidural EEG) was significantly and positively correlated with social-interaction ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This positive correlation increased after sleep restriction and persisted after social stress. No such positive correlation was found in the PrL cortex. Increased phase-coherence suggests an increase in functional connectivity between the IL cortex with the global EEG (in NREM frequency ranges) and suggests that this increased functional connectivity between these brain regions predicts resilience. Phase coherence does not indicate directionality of this functional connectivity; however, it does provide evidence that local differences in sleep are correlated with maladaptive behavioral responses to stress. In future studies, it will be important to determine if causation can be demonstrated for these relationships. Other subregional differences included enhanced SWA (5 A, 0.5–4 Hz range) and slow-wave-energy recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) in the PrL cortex. Collectively, these findings suggest that the sleep-regulatory differences predicting resilience can be further localized to specific subregions of the vmPFC. Both the IL and PrL cortex have a demonstrated importance in resilience to social-defeat stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vialou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lehmann and Herkenham, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Covington et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dulka et al., 2020</xref>) thus, the significance of the observed differences between subregions of the vmPFC (e.g. coherence, power density and slow-wave energy) is not yet clear. Nevertheless, the data demonstrate a clear positive correlation between NREM sleep in the vmPFC and resilience.</p><p>Our findings indicate a major role for NREM sleep in mediating resilience to social-defeat stress based on several lines of evidence. First, our sleep deprivation paradigm decreased both NREM and REM sleep, whereas activation of the POA preferentially increased NREM sleep while REM sleep was reduced. Because REM was decreased in both conditions, with opposite effects on social interaction, REM sleep is unlikely to have large effects on resilience. Furthermore, evidence of altered NREM sleep regulation was most prominent in the vmPFC of resilient mice. In this area, the frequency bands that predominate in NREM sleep were significantly higher and NREM responses to sleep deprivation were significantly enhanced in resilient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Together, these findings strongly implicate NREM sleep in mediating changes in resilience, but do not rule out the involvement of REM sleep.</p><p>The effects of stress on behavior, and sleep-responses to stress, vary with sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Paul et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Paul et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yohn et al., 2019b</xref>) thus, it is not possible to predict how our findings relate to females. Female mice are not territorial; therefore, social-defeat stress in females requires alternative defeat-paradigms. These female-defeat paradigms were only recently developed and reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yohn et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yohn et al., 2019a</xref>), which prevented us from considering sex as a biological variable in the present study. Studies in females will be critical to understanding the role of NREM sleep in resilience and are currently underway in our lab.</p><p>The present studies show that sleep is an active response to social stress that serves to promote resilience, thus demonstrating a clear causal link between insufficient sleep and maladaptive behaviors. Further, our findings in the vmPFC reveal local changes in sleep that may not be visible in the global EEG. This induced sleep response is dependent on inter-individual variability in sleep regulation and, if sufficient sleep is obtained, likely serves to mitigate the well-established negative effects of sleep loss on CNS function—including cognition and emotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Krause et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ritland et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Simonelli et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, the newly demonstrated ability of sleep manipulations to alter behavioral responses to stress offers new possibilities for this mouse model of resilience. This model can be used to investigate the specific mechanisms by which sleep alters stress-induced changes in brain physiology and behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>, male)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">C57BL/6 J</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jackson Labs, Bar Harbor, ME.</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Stock #: 000664</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>, male)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CD-1;

Sleep regulation involves a homeostatic process, as NREM sleep amount and intensity (slow-wave activity, SWA) are proportional to the duration of prior wakefulness. A standard method for investigating this sleep-regulatory process is restricting sleep and then measuring the resulting changes in NREM amount and intensity. We used a 6-hr sleep restriction paradigm before and after 10 days of social-defeat stress to investigate the sleep-regulatory differences between resilient and susceptible mice. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, 6-hr sleep restriction was conducted once to monitor this sleep-regulatory process during the 18-hr period following sleep restriction. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, sleep restriction was used as an intervention to reduce sleep during social-defeat stress and determine how this sleep restriction altered behavioral-responses to social stress. This sleep restriction was performed for the first 8 hr of the light phase (ZT 0–8) daily for each of the 10 days of social-defeat stress. Mice in this study were continuously monitored during this sleep restriction by trained observers.</p><p>One of two methods of sleep restriction were used depending on the number of mice and duration of the study. Sleep restriction in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> was conducted by hand and performed by trained observers. Mice were kept awake during the first 6 hs of the light phase (ZT 0–6) once by gentle handling (introduction of novel objects into the cage, tapping on the cage and when necessary, delicate touching) and allowed an 18 hr recovery opportunity (ZT 6–0). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> sleep deprivation was accomplished using an automated system (Pinnacle Technology, Inc Lawrence, KS) which maintained wakefulness by means of a slowly rotating bar in the cage bottom. The bar direction was set to change randomly every 10–20 s. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, mice were kept awake for the first 6 hs of the light phase (ZT 0–6) once and allowed an 18 hr recovery opportunity (ZT 6–24). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, sleep restriction was used as an intervention to reduce sleep during social-defeat stress and was performed for the first 8 hr of the light phase (ZT 0–8) daily for each of the 10 days of social-defeat stress. Sleep restriction was always carried out in the home cage of the mouse and food and water were available ad libitum.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Corticosterone</title><p>Cages were changed 24 hr prior to each sample collection at ZT 12 (lights off). All feces from the cage were collected exactly 24 hr after this cage change and immediately frozen (–80 °C) until assay. Control samples were taken during the 24 hr period immediately preceding the first day of treatment. As second sample was taken 6 days later, during the 24 hr period that followed exposure to 5 consecutive days of social-defeat stress or 5 consecutive days of both social-defeat stress and sleep deprivation. Just prior to assay, the fecal sample was homogenized and 50 mg was removed for analysis. Sample preparation and analysis was done using the Cayman Corticosterone ELISA kit (Ann Arbor, Michigan), according to the kit -booklet instructions for extraction from feces and analysis. Each condition was run in duplicate, an average of these values was used in analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Surgery: EEG and LFP electrodes</title><p>Electroencephalography (EEG): EEG and Electromyography (EMG) electrodes were implanted in isoflurane (1.5–3%) anesthetized mice. Carprofen was given post operatively for 2 days. A prefabricated head mount (Pinnacle Technology Inc, Lawrence, KS) was used to position three stainless-steel epidural screw electrodes. The first electrode (frontal—located over the frontal cortex) was placed 1.5 mm anterior to bregma and 1.5 mm lateral to the central suture, whereas the second two electrodes (interparietal—located over the visual cortex and common reference) were placed 2.5 mm posterior to bregma and 1.5 mm on either side of the central suture. The resulting two leads (frontal–interparietal and interparietal–interparietal) were referenced contralaterally. A fourth screw served as a ground. Electrical continuity between the screw electrode and head mount was aided by silver epoxy. EMG activity was monitored using stainless-steel Teflon-coated wires that were inserted bilaterally into the nuchal muscle. The head mount (integrated 2×3 pin socket array) was secured to the skull with dental acrylic. Mice were allowed to recover for at least 14 days before sleep recording.</p><p>Local field potential (LFP): LFP, EEG and EMG electrodes were identical to the EEG surgery described above with the following exceptions. A custom-made implant, consisting of two unipolar tungsten electrodes permanently attached to a 2x4 pin socket (Pinnacle Technology Inc, Lawrence, KS), was lowered through a craniotomy with the aid of a stereotaxic apparatus (David Kopff Instruments, Tujunga, CA). The implant was positioned so that the electrodes tips were in the infralimbic (anterior posterior [AP]:+1.9, medial lateral [ML]: –0.4, dorsal ventral [DV]: –3.1; coordinates relative to bregma and midsagittal suture) and prelimbic (AP:+1.9, ML:+0.4, DV: 4.45) cortex. Four epidural, stainless-steel screw-electrodes (Pinnacle Technology Inc, Lawrence, KS) were then positioned on the skull as follows: one recording electrode and LFP reference were placed contralaterally over the frontal cortex, two electrodes over the cerebellum served as an EEG reference and ground. Wire leads attached to each screw were then soldered to output pins on the implant. The implant and leads were covered and secured with dental acrylic.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Excitatory DREADD</title><p>Bilateral injections into the preoptic area (POA) were performed in isoflurane (1.5–3%) anesthetized mice. A 0.5 µl microliter syringe needle (Hamilton, Reno, NV) was positioned in the POA, through a craniotomy made in the skull, with the aid of a stereotaxic apparatus (AP:+0.20, ML:±0.55 DV: –5.65). 200 nl of adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2) containing either control construct (pAAV-hSyn-EGFP; plasmid #50465; Addgene, Watertown, MA) or excitatory DREADD (pAAV-hSyn-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry; plasmid #50474; Addgene, Watertown, MA) was delivered to the POA at 1 nl/s using a motorized syringe pump (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). The syringe needle was left in place for 10 min before removal. Mice were given 14 days of recovery before EEG implant surgery. Carprofen was given post operatively for 2 days.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Clozapine N-Oxide (CNO)</title><p>Clozapine N-oxide dihydrochloride (CNO; 2 mg/kg; Cat# HB6149; HelloBio, Princeton, NJ) was diluted in in lactated ringers and delivered by intraperitoneal (IP) injections on each day of social defeat, where indicated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), between ZT1 and ZT2 (ZT12=lights off, early light phase). Mice expressing both control construct and excitatory DREADD received CNO. For validation studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), single IP injections were delivered at ZT 10.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>EEG/LFP recording/scoring</title><p>One week after surgery, mice were moved to an open-top sleep-recording cage and connected to a lightweight tether attached to a low-resistance commutator mounted over the cage (Pinnacle Technologies, Lawrence KS). This enabled complete freedom of movement throughout the cage. Except for the recording tether, conditions in the recording chamber were identical to those in the home cage. Mice were allowed a minimum of seven additional days to acclimate to the tether and recording chamber. Data acquisition was performed on personal computers running Sirenia Acquisition software (Pinnacle Technologies). EEG signals were low-pass filtered with a 30 Hz cutoff and collected continuously at a sampling rate of 400 Hz. LFP signals, and EEG signals collected simultaneously with LFP, were low-pass filtered with a 1000 Hz cutoff and collected continuously at a sampling rate of 2 kHz. In most cases, sleep recordings were conducted in blocks of 8 mice including both treatments and controls. For classification of waveforms, these EEG signals were low-pass filtered offline at 30 Hz. After collection, all waveforms were classified by a trained observer (using both EEG leads and EMG; in 10 s. epochs) as wake (low-voltage, high-frequency EEG; high-amplitude EMG), NREM sleep (high-voltage, mixed-frequency EEG; low- amplitude EMG) or rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (low-voltage EEG with a predominance of theta activity [6–10 Hz]; very low amplitude EMG). In all studies, individuals performing sleep-stage classification were blind to the experimental conditions and behavioral phenotypes until final analysis. EEG epochs determined to have artifact (interference caused by scratching, movement, eating, or drinking) were excluded from analysis. Artifact comprised less than 5% of all recordings used for analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Wave incidence analysis has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ehlen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ehlen et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, analysis was performed using custom written functions in IGOR Pro 8 (WaveMetrics Inc, Lake Oswego, OR). Raw EEG and LFP signals were band pass-filtered in the frequency range indicated using a Butterworth fourth-order band-pass filter (IGOR Pro routine FilterIIR; WaveMetrics Inc, Lake Oswego, OR). Peaks in the filtered data were detected as negative deflections between two zero crossings. The upper 30% of peak amplitudes that occurred in epochs identified as wake were then counted and expressed as peaks per minute (wave incidence). The wave incidence data were binned for graphing and statistical analysis.</p><p>Power spectral analysis was accomplished by applying a fast Fourier transform (FFT, 0.1 Hz frequency resolution) to EEG or LFP recordings. Where indicated, spectral power within a frequency band was normalized to 24 hr baseline values for each animal or expressed as a percentage of total power (0.5–30 Hz) for each animal.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kate Wassum as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Ana Pocivavsek (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The authors all agree that the manuscript has sufficient data in it for publication, so no additional experiments are required. There was agreement across all reviewers, however, that the authors needed to consider several points and that the manuscript required some significant changes and additions to contextualize and clarify their data. These comments are all listed below:</p><p>1. A major question is where and when these individual differences in stress are encoded in the brain. Unfortunately, determining if these differences exist before exposure to stress is not possible with the methods employed here, unless the case can be made that the surgical procedures required to obtain the sleep measurements are not stressful. This issue must be acknowledged in the report and more care needs to be given to ensuring that the terminologies used are always clear and accurate (i.e., &quot;before stress&quot; should be &quot;before social defeat stress&quot;).</p><p>2. In Figure 2: Increasing sleep by activating the preoptic area is a clever and novel approach that deserves more attention and promotion in this manuscript. Describing this method further, whether in this manuscript or another, can include electrophysiological validations of how the Gq DREADD is affecting preoptic neuronal firing and activity and whether a Gi DREADD has the opposite effect. The present version, however, is not optimally controlled. CNO is used instead of the more selective ligands compound 21 or deschloroclozapine (DCZ). Moreover, it is administered systemically rather than through a cannula directly to the preoptic area. Does CNO itself have any effect on the proportion of resilient vs. susceptible animals after CSDS? Even without considering those variables, an improved version of this experiment and figure would include a CNO-only condition and a DREADD+CNO+ non-defeated, control group. In light of this, the results describing this figure may overreach by claiming simply that &quot;sleep is both necessary and sufficient for resilience to social-defeat stress.&quot; All susceptible animals in other published studies also slept, and more specifically, activating the preoptic area promoted resilience in this study. It may be worth considering whether another method of promoting sleep or activating another brain region would have the same effect.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80206.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

Although CNO was in widespread use, we were also concerned by reports of off-target effects. Because our question centered around the interaction of sleep and social-stress, we chose to keep social-defeat stress and all other conditions constant while changing only sleep/VLPO activation. Thus, all animals in the study received social-defeat stress, virus injections and CNO. We felt that this study design did provide an adequate control for the use of CNO. Notably, in the cohort receiving the control viral construct, we observed an equal number of susceptible and resilient mice after CNO treatment. We agree that it would be ideal to have CNO-only and CNO+non-defeated controls and have added a discussion of the need to determine the effect of these treatments on social avoidance (line 471). In addition, we plan on continuing to refine this approach and to investigate more precise methods of delivery, other compounds, inhibitory DREADD, electrophysiological responses and additional methods of promoting sleep.</p></body></sub-article></article>
