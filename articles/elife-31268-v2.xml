first-line drug for treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D), has been shown to extend lifespan and delay the onset of age-related diseases. However, its primary locus of action remains unclear. Using a pure in vitro reconstitution system, we demonstrate that metformin acts through the v-ATPase-Ragulator lysosomal pathway to coordinate mTORC1 and AMPK, two hubs governing metabolic programs. We further show in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> that both v-ATPase-mediated TORC1 inhibition and v-ATPase-AXIN/LKB1-mediated AMPK activation contribute to the lifespan extension effect of metformin. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of metformin regulated healthspan extension will boost its therapeutic application in the treatment of human aging and age-related diseases.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31268.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>As humans are living for longer, age-related diseases – including cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and cognitive disorders – are becoming more common. Many research groups are therefore trying to find drugs that might prevent these diseases or make them less harmful.</p><p>A drug called metformin has been shown to extend the healthy lifespan of animals such as mice and the roundworm <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. The drug is also currently used to treat type 2 diabetes in humans and may help to prevent some other age-related diseases. However, it is still not clear exactly what effects metformin has on cells.</p><p>Healthy cells need to perform many ‘metabolic’ processes to produce the molecules necessary for survival. Cell compartments called lysosomes play a role in many of these processes because they digest unneeded biological molecules. Through a combination of biochemical and genetic experiments involving <italic>C. elegans</italic> and human cells, Chen, Ou et al. found that metformin coordinates two metabolic pathways that both depend on lysosomes. Metformin reduces the activity of a pathway (called mTOR) that boosts cell growth and the metabolic processes that build complex molecules. At the same time, the drug activates a metabolic pathway (called AMPK) that breaks down complex molecules. Overall, therefore, metformin organizes a switch from a more growth-promoting state to a more growth-restricting state.</p><p>Before metformin can be used more widely to treat human aging and age-related diseases, we need to understand how it works in even more detail. Further studies are required to discover which proteins metformin acts on inside cells, and a clinical trial has also been proposed to measure metformin’s effects on healthy human aging and age-related diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>metformin</kwd><kwd>AMPK</kwd><kwd>mTOR</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31422033</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Ying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2013CB910104</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Ying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31471381</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Ying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Young Thousand Talents Plan of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Ying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Peking-Tsinghua Center for Life Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Ying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Metformin extends <italic>C. elegans</italic> lifespan through lysosome-dependent coordination of TORC1 and AMPK pathways.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>With the discovery that aging could be genetically regulated, numerous strategies have been employed to extend lifespan in model organisms, including pharmacologic and dietary interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Longo et al., 2015</xref>). Identification of a chemical or pharmacological manipulation that could target human aging and lower the risks associated with age-related diseases becomes a central goal of aging research. Administration of metformin, a first-line drug for treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D), has been shown to extend lifespan in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anisimov et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cabreiro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">De Haes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Martin-Montalvo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Onken and Driscoll, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wu et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, metformin has been shown to ameliorate diabetic and cardiovascular diseases in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Scarpello, 2003</xref>). Metformin also lowered the incidence of several other age-related diseases, such as cancer, metabolic syndrome and cognitive disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Foretz et al., 2014</xref>). Due to its broad range of health benefits and little side effects, a clinical trial named TAME (Targeting Aging with Metformin) was proposed to evaluate metformin’s protective effects against human aging and age-related diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barzilai et al., 2016</xref>). However, despite its intriguing benefits to promote healthy aging, the underlying mode of action of metformin is not well understood and a subject of extensive debate.</p><p>Metformin is generally believed to act through activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fryer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hawley et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhou et al., 2001</xref>), a principal energy sensor that when activated, switches on catabolic pathways such as glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation to produce more ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burkewitz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hardie et al., 2012</xref>). It was proposed that metformin might act through inhibition of mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) Complex I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">El-Mir et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Foretz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Owen et al., 2000</xref>), resulting in a change of the AMP/ATP ratio and ultimately activating AMPK. However, this idea has been challenged recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">He and Wondisford, 2015</xref>), especially when physiological/low concentration (~70 uM) of metformin, which cannot induce AMP/ATP change, is still able to activate AMPK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cao et al., 2014</xref>). An alternative model, in which metformin activates AMPK through the lysosome-dependent pathway was proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). In this model, metformin treatment induces lysosomal localization of the scaffold protein AXIN, which brings its associated protein liver kinase B1 (LKB1) to form a complex with v-ATPase-Ragulator on the surface of lysosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). LKB1 then phosphorylates the threonine residue in the activation loop of AMPK, leading to AMPK activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hawley et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shaw et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Woods et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>In addition to AMPK activation, metformin administration also inhibit mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kalender et al., 2010</xref>). mTORC1 constitutes another hub for energy and nutrient sensing, and switches on anabolism when activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schmelzle and Hall, 2000</xref>). The primary pathway for mTORC1 activation requires lysosome-localized Rag GTPases, which form RagA/B–RagC/D heterodimers and recruit mTORC1 to the surface of lysosome through directly binding to the Raptor subunit of mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sancak et al., 2008</xref>). v-ATPase-Ragulator complex on lysosomal surface is required for the spatial regulation and activation of mTORC1 by Rag GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bar-Peled et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dibble and Manning, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jewell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sancak et al., 2010</xref>). Two distinct mechanisms have been proposed for metformin-induced mTORC1 inhibition: suppression of Rag GTPases (AMPK-independent mechanism) or AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of Raptor (regulatory associated protein of mTORC1) (AMPK-dependent mechanism) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Howell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kalender et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Due to its short lifespan and ease of genetic manipulation, <italic>C. elegans</italic> becomes a powerful model organism to test the efficacy of metformin in promoting healthspan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burkewitz et al., 2014</xref>). It has been shown that metformin treatment greatly extends worm lifespan and improves fitness, for example prolonging locomotory ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Onken and Driscoll, 2010</xref>). However, several different mechanisms have been suggested for metformin’s lifespan extension effect in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. For instance, metformin administration may mimic a dietary restriction (DR) metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Onken and Driscoll, 2010</xref>). In addition, alteration of methionine metabolism in <italic>C. elegans</italic> has been shown to play a partial role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cabreiro et al., 2013</xref>). Recently, metformin has been shown to inhibit mTORC1 due to restricted transit of RagA-RagC GTPase through nuclear pore complex (NPC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wu et al., 2016</xref>). It is possible that these observations reflect downstream consequences of a primary action of metformin. Therefore, understanding its direct mechanism of action worth further investigation. Elucidating metformin’s mode of action will significantly boost its application to target human aging and prevent age-related diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Metformin coordinates mTORC1 and AMPK through the lysosomal pathway</title><p>Intrigued by the discoveries that mTORC1 and AMPK share the common activator, v-ATPase-Ragulator complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>), and that metformin may directly act on the lysosomal pathway to promote AMPK activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>), we sought to set up a pure in vitro reconstitution system to explore the mechanism of metformin’s action (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We stably expressed LAMP1-RFP-FLAG in HEK293T cells to label lysosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and performed FLAG pull-down to enrich lysosomes. The purity of lysosome preparation was confirmed by immunoblotting to test for the absence of early endosome, mitochondria, ER or nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Immuno-purified Raptor was then provided to the lysosomes. Upon amino acids stimulation, significant portion of Raptor accumulated on the lysosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,F</xref>), indicating the activation of mTORC1 pathway. We then supplemented Concanavalin A (Con A), a v-ATPase inhibitor, or Metformin (Met) to the reconstitution system. Addition of Con A or metformin dissociated Raptor from the lysosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,G</xref>). It has been proposed that AMPK might directly phosphorylates Raptor and thus inhibits mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gwinn et al., 2008</xref>). To test if metformin’s effect on mTORC1 inhibition requires AMPK or not, we repeated the in vitro experiments in AMPK knockout MEF cells, and still observed the dissociation of Raptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that metformin inhibits mTORC1 through the lysosomal pathway independent of AMPK, possibly mimicking Con A to inhibit v-ATPase. Lastly, we provided purified AXIN and LKB1 to the in vitro system. Immuno-purified LKB1 forms a complex with endogenous STRAD and MO25, two proteins essential for optimal LKB1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Consistent with previous findings, AXIN/LKB1 were recruited to metformin- or Con A-treated lysosomes, and were sufficient to phosphorylate endogenous AMPK in an amino acid-independent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,H</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31268.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Metformin coordinates mTORC1 and AMPK on purified lysosome.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) HEK293T cells stably expressing LAMP1-RFP-FLAG were mechanically broken.

To test if metformin could inhibit mitochondrial function and therefore activate mitochondrial stress response, we treated <italic>C. elegans hsp-6p::gfp</italic> reporter strain with metformin, or rotenone, a well-known mitochondrial ETC complex I inhibitor. Unlike rotenone, metformin treatment showed no reporter activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>). It should be noted that others have reported that metformin inhibits ETC complex I through a mechanism distinct from that of rotenone: metformin treatment increases ROS production, whereas rotenone decreases it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">De Haes et al., 2014</xref>). Because our in vitro reconstitution system excludes mitochondrial contaminants, it highly suggests that metformin inhibits mTORC1 and activates AMPK mainly through the lysosomal pathway. Lastly, we directly measured the metformin’s effect on lysosomal function with the use of a cathepsin assay. Cathepsin is a class of cysteine proteinase localized within lysosomes. A cathepsin assay is a fluorescence-based assay that cleaves cathepsin’s substrate to release fluorescence. Consistent with our idea, metformin administration indeed impaired lysosomal function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C,D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Metformin inhibits TORC1 pathway in <italic>C. elegans</italic></title><p>Because our in vitro biochemical results suggested that metformin might act on the v-ATPase-Ragulator complex of the lysosomal pathway to coordinate mTORC1 inhibition and AMPK activation, we next tested if metformin promotes lifespan extension in <italic>C. elegans</italic> due to similar mechanisms. To confirm that metformin also inhibits TORC1 in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we first examined phosphorylation status of RSKS-1, the human ribosomal protein S6 kinase B1 (S6K) homolog in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. We used an antibody that specifically detects Thr-389, a highly conserved phosphorylation site among species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

We further employed genetic manipulation to show that metformin extends <italic>C. elegans</italic> lifespan and attenuates age-related fitness decline via similar mechanism that requires v-ATPase-Ragulator-AXIN/LKB1 of the lysosomal pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). Metformin may function by targeting and priming v-ATPase-Ragulator complex on lysosome membrane, which serves as a hub to coordinate mTORC1 and AMPK pathways and govern metabolic programs. It is possible that metformin administration might result in a conformational change of v-ATPase-Ragulator complex, which dissociates mTORC1 from lysosome and allows the docking of AXIN/LKB1 for AMPK activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). It will be of particular interest in the future to test if v-ATPase is the direct target of metformin. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of metformin-mediated lifespan extension will boost its application in the treatment of human aging and age-related diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>HEK293T cells used for protein purification, virus packaging and stable cell line generation, and AMPKα1/2 double knockout (DKO) MEF cells used for stable cell line generation were cultured with DMEM high glucose medium (HyClone, SH30243.01), supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibico, 10099–141) and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (HyClone SV30010). 293T HEK cells were obtained from ATCC, not authenticated, and mycoplasma negative.

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Metformin Extends Lifespan by Coordination of mTOR and AMPK through Lysosomal Pathway&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers agreed that this is an interesting study that aims to show that metformin acts on TOR and AMPK at the lysosome, and that this site is critical for the effects of metformin on <italic>C. elegans</italic> lifespan. However, some of the conclusions seem to be based on small changes observed in single experiments, and analysis of more replicates with assessment of statistical significance would make the soundness of the conclusions more convincing. A substantial amount of work needs be conducted to address the concerns raised by the reviewers, and it is unlikely that this can be done within the two–month limit set by <italic>eLife</italic>, so we are rejecting the paper. Nevertheless, if your results hold up, I do encourage you to resubmit your work after you have obtained sufficient lines of validation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors used an in vitro system to show that metformin coordinates mTORC1 inhibition and AMPK activation through the lysosomal pathway. They further demonstrated that both TORC1 inhibition and Axin/LKB1–mediated AMPK activation contribute to the lifespan extension effect of metformin in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. This study provides molecular mechanism of metformin–mediated lifespan extension.</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>1) The authors showed that metformin treatment triggers nuclear localization of HLH–30::GFP in the tail region. How the cells in the tail affect the lifespan? Does loss of function of <italic>hlh–30</italic> suppress the lifespan extension effect of metformin?</p><p>2) Metformin treatment further extends lifespan of <italic>daf–15</italic> heterozygous mutants. This could be due to that metformin acts on a pathway additive to that of TORC1 inhibition. Alternatively, this may be simply due to a partial reduction in mTOR activity in <italic>daf–15</italic> heterozygous mutants.</p><p>3) Quantification results should be provided for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B, C</xref>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Overall, this is an interesting study that aims to show that metformin acts on TOR and AMPK at the lysosome, and that this site is critical for the effects of metformin on <italic>C. elegans</italic> lifespan.

A description of the alleles, whether the mutations are loss– or gain–of function mutations, and the lysosomal function of these genes have to be established.

Of particular interest is whether these genes indeed localize and function within the lysosome. Lysosomal localization assays and functional assays (cathepsin assays) need to be carried out to validate these mutants, considering the rationale of the manuscript overall. Metformin's effects on lysosomal function should also be tested. Of particular concern is <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, in which the authors describe that 80% of the <italic>lmtr–2/3</italic> mutants are censored due to vulval rupture.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor.

They developed an in vitro reconstitution assay to show that metformin coordinates mTORC1 inhibition and AMPK activation through the lysosomal pathway. They further demonstrated that both TORC1 inhibition and Axin/LKB1–mediated AMPK activation contribute to the lifespan extension effect of metformin in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. This study provides insights into the molecular mechanism of metformin–mediated lifespan extension. Overall, the findings are potentially interesting. This manuscript is suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> after appropriate revisions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is unclear whether metformin–activated AMPK also could have effects on HLH–30/TFEB. The authors should directly test whether Metformin treatment of aak–2 mutants leads to HLH–30 nuclear localization (and by extension, gene expression of HLH–30 target genes). This information would help the authors in their discussion of the involvement of AMPK vs mTOR.</p><p>2) The analysis of downstream pathways of TOR is insufficiently characterized and in places contradicting with previous work from Driscoll lab. The authors performed epistasis experiments with known downstream targets of mTOR, e.g., with <italic>pha–4, skn–1</italic> and <italic>hlh–30</italic> mutants and conclude that metformin can still induce lifespan–extending effects in these mutants. However, this clearly looks like a partial lifespan extension; in the authors' hands, metformin generally produces 40% lifespan extension in wild–type/WT animals (Table S8), but in mutants they only see 14% (<italic>hlh–30</italic>) and 20–30% (<italic>pha–4, smg–1</italic>) lifespan extension (Table S6). While these lifespan experiments do not appear to have been performed in direct comparison with a WT control, the more reasonable conclusion is that metformin has a partial effect on lifespan in these backgrounds, and therefore that the genes play a partial role in the lifespan extension. Indeed, Onken and Driscoll reported that <italic>skn–1</italic> is required for metformin–induced longevity. The authors need to revisit their conclusions in light of these comments and previously published data. To this end, they are encouraged to emphasize the lysosome as the site of Metformin action, their most well–supported new finding, and de–focus on dissecting the individual contribution of AMPK and mTOR.

The antibody needs to be validated.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31268.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers agreed that this is an interesting study that aims to show that metformin acts on TOR and AMPK at the lysosome, and that this site is critical for the effects of metformin on C. elegans lifespan.

However, this clearly looks like a partial lifespan extension; in the authors' hands, metformin generally produces 40% lifespan extension in wild–type/WT animals (Table S8), but in mutants they only see 14% (hlh–30) and 20–30% (pha–4, smg–1) lifespan extension (Table S6). While these lifespan experiments do not appear to have been performed in direct comparison with a WT control, the more reasonable conclusion is that metformin has a partial effect on lifespan in these backgrounds, and therefore that the genes play a partial role in the lifespan extension. Indeed, Onken and Driscoll reported that skn–1 is required for metformin–induced longevity. The authors need to revisit their conclusions in light of these comments and previously published data. To this end, they are encouraged to emphasize the lysosome as the site of Metformin action, their most well–supported new finding, and de–focus on dissecting the individual contribution of AMPK and mTOR.

The partial lifespan extension effect of metformin in mutants of TOR downstream genes (e.g. <italic>hlh–30, pha–4</italic> and <italic>skn–1</italic>) supported our conclusions: 1) Metformin only partially extends lifespan of these mutants indicates that these TORC1 downstream genes play a partial role in the lifespan extension.
