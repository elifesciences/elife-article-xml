Evidence suggests that gametes alter oviductal gene expression. To delineate the adaptive interactions between the oviduct and gamete/embryo, we performed a multi-omics characterization of oviductal tissues utilizing bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), and proteomics collected from distal and proximal at various stages after mating in mice. We observed robust region-specific transcriptional signatures. Specifically, the presence of sperm induces genes involved in pro-inflammatory responses in the proximal region at 0.5 days post-coitus (dpc). Genes involved in inflammatory responses were produced specifically by secretory epithelial cells in the oviduct. At 1.5 and 2.5 dpc, genes involved in pyruvate and glycolysis were enriched in the proximal region, potentially providing metabolic support for developing embryos. Abundant proteins in the oviductal fluid were differentially observed between naturally fertilized and superovulated samples. RNA-seq data were used to identify transcription factors predicted to influence protein abundance in the proteomic data via a novel machine learning model based on transformers of integrating transcriptomics and proteomics data. The transformers identified influential transcription factors and correlated predictive protein expressions in alignment with the in vivo-derived data. Lastly, we found some differences between inflammatory responses in sperm-exposed mouse oviducts compared to hydrosalpinx Fallopian tubes from patients. In conclusion, our multi-omics characterization and subsequent in vivo confirmation of proteins/RNAs indicate that the oviduct is adaptive and responsive to the presence of sperm and embryos in a spatiotemporal manner.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Mus</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Mus musculus</italic></kwd><kwd>C57BL/6J</kwd><kwd>oviduct</kwd><kwd>preimplantation embryo</kwd><kwd>sperm</kwd><kwd>superovulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HD097087</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Winuthayanon</surname><given-names>Wipawee</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DBI2308699</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jack Cheng</surname><given-names>Jianlin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CCF2343612</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jack Cheng</surname><given-names>Jianlin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM008336</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carulli</surname><given-names>Daniel J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007165</institution-id><institution>University of Missouri</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Start-up fund</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Winuthayanon</surname><given-names>Wipawee</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007588</institution-id><institution>Washington State University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RA+$10K</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Finnerty</surname><given-names>Ryan M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The oviduct dynamically adapts its molecular makeup over time and space, responding to sperm and embryos by activating inflammatory and metabolic genes in distinct regions to support reproduction.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Optimal physiological conditions in the oviduct (fallopian tube in humans) provide an adaptive microenvironment for several reproductive processes ranging from sperm capacitation and transport to fertilization and embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li and Winuthayanon, 2017</xref>). The oviduct comprises four main regions: infundibulum (responsible for oocyte pick-up), ampulla (site of fertilization), isthmus (sperm capacitation/transport and preimplantation embryonic development), and the uterotubal junction (UTJ; responsible for filtering sperm and embryo transit to the uterus). Several studies demonstrated that distal (infundibulum and ampulla: IA) and proximal (isthmus and UTJ: IU) regions of the oviduct have distinct transcriptional profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Roberson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McGlade et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ford et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harwalkar et al., 2021</xref>). However, it is unclear how the presence of the sperm and embryo(s) modulates the oviductal responses. The presence of gametes and embryos has been shown to alter gene expression in secretory and ciliated cells of the oviduct during the preimplantation period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maillo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Almiñana et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fazeli et al., 2004</xref>). Additionally, it was reported that the endometrium responded differently to in vivo-derived embryos compared to embryos derived from in vitro fertilization or somatic cell nuclear transfer in large animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mansouri-Attia et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bauersachs et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting a maternal response to the presence of different types of embryos. Indeed, variations in the relative abundance of sets of genes involved in compaction and cavitation, desmosomal glycoproteins, metabolism, mRNA processing, stress, trophoblastic function, and growth and development have been observed in in vitro-produced embryos compared to their in vivo counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kropp and Khatib, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smith et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tremoleda et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Niemann and Wrenzycki, 2000</xref>).

In humans, an embryo-derived platelet-activating factor has been implicated in the control of embryo transport to the uterus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Velasquez et al., 2001</xref>). It has been suggested that fertilized embryos produce prostaglandin E2 that facilitates transport to the uterus in mares (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kues et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rodríguez-Alonso et al., 2019</xref>), whereas non-fertilized eggs remain in the oviduct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Betteridge and Mitchell, 1974</xref>). In hamsters, fertilized embryos are transported more expeditiously to the uterus compared to unfertilized eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ortiz et al., 1986</xref>). In rats, transferred advanced-stage embryos (4-cell vs. 1-cell) arrive in the uterus prematurely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ortiz et al., 1989</xref>). In pigs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Almiñana et al., 2012</xref>) and cows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maillo et al., 2015</xref>), pro-inflammatory responses in the oviduct are downregulated by the presence of embryos, suggesting that the embryo may facilitate maternal embryo tolerance during its passage through the oviduct. However, alterations in the oviductal transcriptome are difficult to detect in mono-ovulatory species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maillo et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rodríguez-Alonso et al., 2019</xref>) indicating that the effect of the embryo in the oviduct is localized.</p><p>As for the sperm, observations suggest a filtering process as sperm migrates from the uterus, through the UTJ, into the oviduct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Krzanowska, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pérez-Cerezales et al., 2018</xref>). After entering through the UTJ, sperm interact with ciliated cells in the isthmus to form a reservoir, undergo capacitation and are subsequently released to initiate the acrosomal reaction prior to reaching the ampulla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pérez-Cerezales et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arthur and Ley, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abe, 1996</xref>). However, sperm are allogenic to the female reproductive tract, as sperm have been observed to induce pro- and anti-inflammatory responses in the oviduct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Georgiou et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yousef et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, phagocytic bodies in the luminal fluid at the isthmus region can engulf sperm for degradation in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chakraborty and Nelson, 1975</xref>). In addition to sperm selection, the oviduct seemingly provides beneficial chemical and mechanical mechanisms through rheotaxis, thermotaxis, and chemotaxis that assist sperm in transportation and fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Perez-Cerezales et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Miki and Clapham, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Oliveira et al., 1999</xref>). These observations suggest that the oviduct provides a malleable environment that is plastic and adaptable to select and facilitate the fittest sperm for fertilization. Therefore, our study also intends to provide a better understanding of the oviductal environment before, during, and after the presence of sperm in different regions of the oviduct.</p><p>In recent years, the field of reproductive biology has increasingly leveraged artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning technologies to delve deeper into the intricate mechanisms governing fertilization and embryonic growth. AI predictive models, such as powerful transformer models, have shown remarkable capabilities in analyzing large-scale biological data, encompassing multi-omics data, to unveil patterns and forecast outcomes with elevated precision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang et al., 2024</xref>). One of the critical attributes of transformer models is the attention mechanism, which empowers the model to focus on pertinent essential segments of the input data that are critical for predicted outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vaswani et al., 2017</xref>). This functionality proves advantageous in the domain of reproductive biology, wherein complex interplays among genes, proteins, and other biomolecules dictating fertility outcomes may be revealed by the attention mechanism. The objective of this investigation is to amalgamate a multi-omics strategy with a transformer-based AI predictive model to elucidate the adaptive characteristics of the oviduct during natural fertilization.</p><p>Based on this premise, our study aims to elucidate the adaptive nature of the oviduct using a multi-omics approach during natural fertilization and preimplantation embryo development in a mouse model. We dissected oviducts from naturally fertilized mice at 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, and 3.5 days post-coitus, pseudopregnancy, and superovulation (dpc, dpp, and SO, respectively). Gene expression profiles were analyzed from two different regions of the oviduct (IA and IU) using bulk RNA and single-cell RNA (scRNA) sequencing (seq) analyses, generating a spatiotemporal depiction of gene expression in the oviduct. Observations of RNA expression profiles from bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) findings were reinforced by single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and LC–MS/MS proteomics analysis. Lastly, we integrated bulk RNA-seq and proteomics datasets to develop the initial stages of a machine learning predictive model, which can identify influential transcription factors and correlate predictive protein expressions based on in vivo-derived data. Overall, we observed a robust transition of transcripts in the oviduct after sperm exposure at 0.5 dpc to other timepoints during preimplantation in both IA and IU regions. One of our key observations, was an elevated pro-inflammatory transcriptional and proteomic profile at 0.5 dpc, likely due to the presence of sperm preceding an anti-inflammatory condition 24 hr later, correlating with the spatial presence of the embryo in the IU region at 1.5 dpc. Furthermore, this study paves the way for formulating a pioneering integrative AI model methodology tailored to integrate transcriptomics and proteomics data.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Bulk RNA-seq analysis reveals a dynamic transcriptional profile during pregnancy that exhibits a distinct signature from pseudopregnancy</title><p>To ensure the presence and location of embryos/eggs in the oviduct in our model, we sampled the oviduct at different timepoints and evaluated the location of the embryos/ovulated eggs using hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining.

Additionally, we aim to address whether changes in transcriptional signatures in the oviduct are governed by hormonal fluctuations or the presence of sperm/embryos/eggs. Therefore, oviducts from females at corresponding days post-mating with vasectomized males at (0.5, 1.5, 2.5, and 3.5 dpp) were used for comparisons. Principal component analysis (PCA) plots were generated using the top 2500 differentially expressed genes (DEGs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Broad observations of region-specific transcriptome uniqueness exhibited segregation of all IA and IU biological replicates to opposite ends of the center axis on the PC1, reinforcing previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harwalkar et al., 2021</xref>) that IA and IU regions behave differently with respect to transcriptional activity. Surprisingly, with respect to both the IA and IU regions, overall transcripts at 0.5 dpc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) were segregated to the topmost axis along the PC2 plane, while 1.5–3.5 dpc biological replicates were segregated to the bottommost axis along the PC2 plane.</p><p>Expression signatures of the top 2500 DEGs in the IA region during pseudopregnancy were similar to those during pregnancy, as indicated by a heatmap generated using unsupervised hierarchical clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>). However, there were exceptions at 0.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>, blue box) and 1.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>, black box) dpc/dpp. Unlike the IA region, DEGs in the IU region were more dynamic, as indicated by the presence of unique sets of genes at 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, and 3.5 dpc timepoints between pregnancy versus pseudopregnancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>, blue, black, and red boxes). These findings indicate that oviduct transcripts from pregnant mice also possessed distinct signatures from pseudopregnant samples. Overall, data suggest that the transcriptional profile in the oviduct at all stages during the preimplantation period in the IU region is more dynamic compared to the IA region.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Cellular responses to inflammation are enriched at the proximal (IU) and distal (IA) regions in response to the sperm</title><p>Oviductal transcription signatures were more unique at 0.5 dpc when compared to those at 1.5–3.5 dpc (i.e., 0.5 dpc vs. rest) in both IA and IU regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D</xref>). To determine the biological process of genes that were differentially expressed at 0.5 dpc compared to 1.5–3.5 dpc in both IA and IU regions, an initial analysis (0.5 dpc vs. rest) was chosen to isolate what distinct processes may be occurring during the transition from 0.5 dpc. Unique DEGs upregulated at 0.5 dpc in the IA region were enriched for the following biological processes (BPs): extracellular matrix (ECM) organization, extracellular structure organization, collagen fibril organization, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion homeostasis, among others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Most interestingly, we found upregulated DEGs enriched for BPs at 0.5 dpc in the IU region included cellular response to cytokine stimulus, neutrophil migration, response to interferon-gamma, response to lipopolysaccharide, and neutrophil chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Moreover, there are multiple BPs involved in the glucose catabolic process to pyruvate, in addition to other pyruvate metabolic processes that were uniquely upregulated at 0.5 dpc in the IU region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Next, we evaluated the IA region at 0.5 dpc compared to 1.5 dpc (presence of sperm vs. 24 hr post-sperm exposure in the presence of embryos). We observed significant BPs that were enriched for downregulated DEGs at the IA region at 1.5 dpc compared to 0.5 dpc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C, D</xref>). These processes included response to interferon-gamma, neutrophil chemotaxis, cytokine-mediated signaling pathway, and neutrophil migration. BPs common to the IA region at 0.5 dpc also included ECM organization, extracellular structure organization, and collagen fibril organization.</p><p>DEGs were more dynamic in the IU region during preimplantation embryo development compared to the IA region. At 0.5 dpc, the sperm are present, creating a sperm reservoir in the isthmus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Demott and Suarez, 1992</xref>). When comparing 0.5 dpc to 0.5 dpp in the IU region (presence or absence of sperm, respectively), gene ontology biological processes (GOBPs) analysis revealed significant enrichment of multiple pro-inflammatory BPs, including inflammatory response, neutrophil migration, neutrophil chemotaxis, regulation of phagocytosis, positive regulation of acute inflammatory response, and response to lipopolysaccharide when sperm were present in the IU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E, F</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that, at 0.5 dpc, the isthmus region of the oviduct was heavily regulated for an inflammatory response in the presence of sperm while simultaneously preparing for the metabolic switch of the embryos from pyruvate to glucose metabolism.</p><p>Next KEGG analysis was used to determine molecular players; we found that genes in the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway were mostly upregulated at 0.5 dpc compared to 0.5 dpp at the IU region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Subsequently, an analysis comparing 0.5–1.5 dpc in the IU region (presence of sperm vs. presence of embryos) demonstrated the most striking results. We found that most upregulated genes at 0.5 dpc were now downregulated at 1.5 dpc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Many of these genes are involved in the cellular response to cytokine stimulus, response to interferon-gamma, response to lipopolysaccharide, and neutrophil chemotaxis. These data strongly suggest that the oviduct may suppress the response to inflammation in the isthmus once the sperm is cleared to become conducive for the embryo’s survival at 1.5 dpc.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>scRNA-seq reveals that secretory epithelial cells contribute to the pro- and anti-inflammatory responses in the oviduct</title><p>To determine the key cell types responsible for the oviductal response to sperm/embryos, scRNA-seq analyses were leveraged. As we did not observe significant transcriptional changes from bulk RNA-seq at 3.5 dpc and embryos were not present in the oviduct at 3.5 dpc, we opted not to assess a 3.5 dpc timepoint in our scRNA-seq analysis. In this experiment, SO using exogenous gonadotropins was used due to technical limitations of sample collection for single-cell processing. Non-mated SO estrus samples were used as controls. First, we confirmed that all cell types previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McGlade et al., 2021</xref>) were present in the oviduct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, F</xref>). There was minimum overlap between cells isolated from IA or IU regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). In addition, all cell types were present at all timepoints except for an <italic>Ephx2</italic>+ cluster (only present at SO 0.5 dpc and SO estrus) and a neutrophil cluster (<italic>Ly6g+</italic>, only present at SO 0.5 dpc).</p><p>Next, we investigated whether our findings from bulk RNA-seq data would be recapitulated in the scRNA-seq dataset. Here, we exclusively focused on the IU region as it was the most dynamically regulated region during early pregnancy. Based on GOBP analysis from bulk RNA-seq findings, we further assessed several genes that were upregulated at 0.5 and 1.5 dpc corresponding to GOBP terms ‘inactivation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity’ and ‘MAP kinase phosphatase activity’. Genes associated with these pathways were mostly upregulated at SO 0.5 and SO 1.5 dpc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>, green and teal bars) and downregulated in SO estrus and SO 2.5 dpc in the IU regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D</xref>, red and purple bars). These genes include dual-specificity phosphatase family (<italic>Dusp1</italic>, <italic>Dusp5</italic>, <italic>Dusp6</italic>, <italic>Dusp10</italic>), <italic>Fos</italic>, interleukin 1b (<italic>Il1b</italic>), IL1 receptor 2 (<italic>Il1rb</italic>), and others. As DUSP proteins are crucial for controlling inflammation and antimicrobial immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arthur and Ley, 2013</xref>), we performed qPCR analysis to confirm both our bulk RNA- and scRNA-seq data with respect to MAPK signaling pathways. We found that <italic>Dusp5</italic> was expressed at a significantly higher level at 0.5 dpc compared to 0.5 dpp while <italic>Mapk14</italic> (<italic>p38a</italic>) was significantly upregulated at 1.5 dpc compared to 0.5 dpc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3E, F</xref>). We also further assessed several genes from the GOBP term ‘neutrophil-mediated immunity’ to explain the appearance at SO 0.5 dpc and subsequent disappearance of the neutrophil cluster at SO 1.5 dpc, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, F</xref>). Interestingly, these genes were found to be downregulated in both the IU and IA regions at the 1.5 and 2.5 dpc timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3G, H</xref>, teal and purple bars).</p><p>To identify which cell population is contributing to the observed pro- and anti-inflammatory response in both IA and IU regions at SO 0.5 dpc. We evaluated DEGs in each cell population and performed GOBP analysis. Upregulated DEGs from secretory epithelial cells (both clusters 0 and 1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–I</xref>) from both IA and IU regions at 0.5 dpc were enriched for BPs involved in inflammatory response, neutrophil migration, cellular response to chemokine, chemokine-mediated signaling pathways, and several others chemokine signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). In contrast, when evaluated for upregulated DEGs in ciliated epithelial cells, similarly enriched biological processes were present, albeit in a less significant manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Therefore, it suggests that secretory cells are the key modulators responsible for the regulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory responses during pregnancy establishment.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Oviductal luminal proteomics are dynamic at different preimplantation stages and SO exacerbates the transcriptional profile at each timepoint</title><p>To validate our transcriptomics data at a translational level, LC–MS/MS proteomic analysis was performed on secreted proteins in the oviductal luminal fluid at estrus, 0.5, 1.5, and 2.5 dpc with or without SO.

In addition, this predictive tool can be adapted to other biological disciplines to identify influential ITs and IPs using existing bulk RNA-seq databases.

We integrated a total of 68 biological samples using bulk RNA-seq (24 total biological replicates), scRNA-sequencing (20 total biological replicates), and LC–MS/MS (24 total biological replicates) analyses. In addition, our bulk RNA-seq and proteomic data are immediately available to the scientific community in a web search format (details in Methods). Here, we reinforced significantly enriched pathways shared between different multi-omics techniques. We validated previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harwalkar et al., 2021</xref>) that the transcriptional profile of the oviduct between the IA and IU regions is unique and region-specific based on PCA analyses. Both the IA and IU regions are most distinct at 0.5 dpc compared to other timepoints based on PCA analyses, with unique transcription patterns becoming most disrupted at 0.5 dpc in both pregnancy and pseudopregnancy datasets. Large sets of DEGs display a dramatic shift from either being up- or downregulated between 0.5 and 1.5 dpc in all -omics characterizations. The changes at 0.5 dpc appear to subside at 1.5–3.5 dpc, with fewer unique clusters of genes that were dynamic between timepoints, indicating that either the absence of sperm or the presence of embryos drives the oviduct transition. However, the number of dynamic clusters of genes was greater in the IU region than in the IA region. This finding suggests that the IU region is more dynamic and responsive to the presence of gametes (sperm and oocytes/embryos) compared to the IA region.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Dynamic oviductal response to early pregnancy in mice.</title><p>Bulk RNA, scRNA-sequencing, and LC–MS/MS analyses were performed using the oviductal samples collected from mice at 0.5 days post coitus (dpc) through 2.5 dpc.

Wang and Larina showed that during this timepoint, ciliated epithelial cells in the ampulla region are responsible for creating a circular motion of the cumulus–oocyte complexes (COCs) within the ampulla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang and Larina, 2021</xref>). Here, using scRNA-seq analysis, we found that the ciliated cell population showed suppressed expression of genes involved in cilia assembly at SO 0.5 dpc and in SO Estrus (COCs are present in these two groups) in the IA region. This finding suggests that when the COCs are present in the ampulla, ciliated cells are functionally active. As SO increases the number of mature follicles (therefore, estrogen levels), ovulated eggs, and follicular fluid, it is also likely that these biological alterations could lead to changes in the protein abundance in the oviduct. Interestingly, the <italic>Ephx2</italic>+ cluster was mainly present in the SO 0.5 dpc and SO estrus samples. <italic>Ephx2</italic> encodes epoxide hydrolase 2, which converts epoxides to dihydrodiols. Recent findings suggest that EPHX2 may play a role in primary hypertension in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ma et al., 2020</xref>). However, the reproductive-related functions of EPHX2 have not yet been investigated. Therefore, we believe this presents an opportunity for future research to define the role of <italic>Ephx2</italic> in the oviduct in response to SO during preimplantation embryo development.</p><p>The presence of sperm at 0.5 dpc strongly perturbed the IU region at 0.5 dpc, most likely due to a greater population of sperm in the IU, as a sperm reservoir (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Demott and Suarez, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Suarez, 1998</xref>), compared to the IA region. This perturbation was minimally detected at 0.5 dpp. Multi-omics analysis and observations in bulk RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, and luminal proteomics datasets are in agreement with the previous finding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bromfield et al., 2014</xref>) that seminal fluid and sperm may be the dominant influencers for stimulating inflammatory responsive pathways in the oviduct at 0.5 dpc. We also established here, for the first time, that these observed inflammatory responses may be facilitated by the secretory cell population in the IU region when compared to other cell types. DUSP proteins modulate inflammation and antimicrobial immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arthur and Ley, 2013</xref>), and MAPK signaling pathways are involved in both pro- and anti-inflammatory pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arthur and Ley, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kaminska, 2005</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that the observed inflammatory response was facilitated in part by the activation of MAPK signaling pathways, as indicated by a significant increase in expression of <italic>Dusp5</italic>, which was unique to the IU region after sperm exposure. Overall, the presence of sperm at 0.5 dpc induces a strong pro-inflammatory response in the IU region with upregulation of genes involved in inflammatory cytokines, neutrophil activation, lymphocyte recruitment, and T-cell proliferation. scRNA-seq data suggest that the oviduct is immunodynamic as indicated by the presence of immune cells as indicated by several immune markers such as neutrophils (<italic>Ly6g</italic>+), leukocyte (<italic>Ptrpc</italic>+), T cells (<italic>Cd3d+</italic>, <italic>Cd3g+</italic>), NK cells (<italic>Nkg7+</italic>, <italic>Klrb1c+</italic>), among others. This finding agrees with previous studies in human Fallopian tubes, as well as from our and other laboratories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McGlade et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Givan et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>Sperm migration from the uterus through the UTJ into the oviduct has been an observable phenomenon dating back five decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Krzanowska, 1974</xref>). Additionally, phagocytic bodies engulfing sperm in mice luminal fluid in the isthmus region have also been observed in literature pre-dating the 1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chakraborty and Nelson, 1975</xref>). The prevailing theory is that ‘fit’ sperm display inherently, via intracellular processes and genetic cargos, membrane ‘passport’ proteins that allow them to not only gain access through the UTJ, but also subsequently bind to the epithelium in the isthmus region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Xiong et al., 2019</xref>). The in situ hybridization analysis of the IU region reinforces these observations, suggesting additionally that not only do sperm require specific membrane proteins to function properly in the uterus and oviduct, but also that sperm must evade phagocytosis from an innate immune response. Our findings showed that <italic>Ptrprc</italic>+ cells were present in the stromal and epithelial layers in the presence of sperm at 0.5 dpc in the UTJ. Similarly, a significant increase in <italic>Tlr2+</italic> cells was observed at the epithelial lining of the isthmus and UTJ regions. <italic>Tlr2</italic> is a part of the Toll-like receptor superfamily of proteins that participate in and modulate immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Oliveira-Nascimento et al., 2012</xref>). Previous and ongoing studies suggest an additional role for <italic>Tlr2</italic> in facilitating epithelial cell barrier integrity and remodeling after a significant immune response has occurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abreu, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Al Sadi et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Al Sadi et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rakoff-Nahoum et al., 2004</xref>). As such, we suggest a model where <italic>Tlr2</italic> expression increased at 0.5 dpc in response to the presence of sperm that may modulate epithelial cell integrity, thereafter, inducing remodeling in damaged cells at 1.5 and 2.5 dpc. Future studies need to be conducted to further reinforce this hypothesis.</p><p>Further indications of a pro-inflammatory condition induced by sperm at 0.5 dpc followed by epithelial cell remodeling at 1.5 dpc were observed in our luminal proteomics data. We observed an increase in NFκB fluorescent signal at 0.5 dpc, indicating conditions favorable for pro-inflammation. Previous work both in vivo and in vitro in the uterus and oviduct, respectively, indicate sperm have the capacity to induce immune-related responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yousef et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Marey et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schjenken et al., 2021</xref>). In the uterus, observations suggest a hostile, phagocytic environment to remove excessive and dead sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Marey et al., 2020</xref>). Our findings suggest an equally hostile response to allogenic sperm in the oviduct at 0.5 dpc. However, this finding is in conflict with prior in vitro studies in the bovine oviductal epithelial cell (BOEC) culture model, in which sperm bind and induce anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as <italic>TGFB1</italic> (transforming growth factor β1) and <italic>IL10</italic>, while decreasing pro-inflammatory transcripts such as <italic>TNFɑ</italic> (tumor necrosis factor ɑ) and <italic>IL1B</italic> in the BOECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yousef et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Marey et al., 2020</xref>). It is possible that this discrepancy could be due to differences between (1) in vivo versus in vitro models and (2) murine versus bovine model organisms. Surprisingly, our luminal proteomics data suggest an exacerbated pro-inflammatory state in the SO condition, inducing greater dysregulation of pro-inflammatory pathways and epithelial cell remodeling.</p><p>At 1.5–3.5 dpc, oviductal transcriptional profiles were similar to each other compared to that of 0.5 dpc. During this preimplantation developmental period (1.5–3.5 dpc), embryos transit from the IA to the IU region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang and Larina, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Flores et al., 2020</xref>). It indicates that there could be a critical transition of transcripts from 0.5 dpc to other timepoints when the embryos are present at 1.5–3.5 dpc. Therefore, our observations suggest that the oviduct provides an adaptive response in a unique manner during fertilization/preimplantation development, facilitating dynamic selection processes in the presence of gametes and embryos. At 1.5 dpc, 2-cell embryos were in the isthmus region. All embryos at later developmental stages 1.5–2.5 dpc were stalled in the lower isthmus and subsequently the UTJ region between 2.5 and 3.0 dpc. At 3.5 dpc, all embryos have transited from the oviduct to the uterus. Nutrients such as pyruvate, lactate, and amino acids are present in the oviductal fluid in several mammalian species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nieder and Corder, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tay et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nichol et al., 1992</xref>). After fertilization, zygotes acquire pyruvate and lactate for their energy source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Folmes and Terzic, 2014</xref>). Then, the metabolism profile shifts from oxidative to glycolytic metabolism at later stages of preimplantation development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gardner et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Absalón-Medina et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we found that upregulated DEGs at 0.5 dpc were enriched for several energy metabolism BPs, including pyruvate metabolic, glucose catabolic process to pyruvate, canonical glycolysis, and glycolytic process through glucose-6-phosphose. These pathways are subsequently downregulated between 1.5 and 3.5 dpc. We showed that genes involved in these pathways were unique to the IU region with respect to differential expression analysis. Therefore, it is possible that the IU region is priming the environment to adjust to produce specific energy sources required for early and late embryo metabolism as the embryo switches from utilizing pyruvate to utilizing glucose during successive developmental periods in the oviduct.</p><p>Lastly, we found that sperm-induced inflammatory conditions in the oviduct were potentially different than those of chronic inflammatory conditions in human Fallopian tubes. The inflammatory responses observed in mice and humans exhibited significant distinction based on immune cell involvement, mechanisms, and context. In mice, acute inflammation after sperm exposure could be primarily characterized by the activation of neutrophils, which serve as the first responders to injury or foreign bodies. In contrast, human Fallopian tubes with hydrosalpinx conditions displayed chronic inflammatory conditions predominantly involving macrophages and NK cells, suggesting a more complex and sustained immune response. It is also possible that inflammation in the oviduct differs between mice and humans. Understanding these species-specific variations is crucial for developing effective therapeutic strategies, as findings from murine models may not accurately translate to human inflammatory conditions due to the distinct immune dynamics at play.</p><p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated through a comprehensive multi-omics study of the oviduct that the transcriptomic and proteomic landscape of the oviduct at four different preimplantation periods was dynamic during natural fertilization, pseudopregnancy, and SO using three independent cell/tissue isolation and analytical techniques. Most novel findings from this study suggest that: (1) sperm were likely the key mediators in modulating inflammatory responses in the oviduct, potentially priming the oviduct to become tolerable to the presence of embryos, (2) inflammatory cytokine-mediated signals observed were more robustly amplified by the secretory epithelial cells of the oviduct, (3) the oviduct is an immuno-dynamic organ, alternating between a pro-inflammatory condition at 0.5 dpc to seemingly prioritizing epithelial barrier integrity/rejuvenation and cellular homeostasis between 1.5 and 2.5 dpc, and (4) the oviduct could provide necessary nutrient enrichment in the luminal fluid at different stages of embryonic development. In addition, an initial stage AI learning predictive model has been used to identify influential transcription factors and correlate predictive protein expressions. This initial AI model has recapitulated a similar progressive prediction of TFs correlating to IPs suggesting similar biological/cellular processes as our empirical in vivo multi-omics analysis. Overall, our findings reveal an adaptive oviduct with unique transcriptomic profiles in different oviductal regions, along with dynamic proteomics that may be specialized to influence sperm migration, fertilization, embryo transport, and development. These findings and techniques could facilitate developments to ensure a proper microenvironment for embryo development in vitro, assisting in establishing standard protocols at the laboratory, agricultural, and clinical levels.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All animals were maintained at Washington State University and the University of Missouri and were handled according to Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines using approved protocols 6147, 6151, 38927, and 38961.

Effects of mitochondrial gene expression and total counts were regressed out, and the data were scaled to unit variance and a mean of zero. Dimensionality reduction was first achieved through PCA with Scanpy’s default parameters. To achieve further dimensionality reduction, a neighborhood graph of cells was computed, utilizing the top 40 principal components (PCs) and a neighborhood size of 10, then embedded utilizing uniform manifold approximation and projection, using the default parameters in Scanpy. Clustering of cells was achieved through Leiden clustering at a resolution of 0.1. Established marker genes were used to identify clusters as specific cell types: pan-epithelial (<italic>Epcam</italic>+), secretory (<italic>Pax8</italic>+), ciliated (<italic>Foxj1</italic>+), leukocytes (<italic>Ptprc</italic>+), antigen-presenting cells (<italic>Cd74+</italic>), monocytes and macrophages (<italic>Ms4a7+Cd14+</italic>), T-cells (<italic>Cd3d+</italic>, <italic>Cd3g</italic>), natural killer and NKT cells (<italic>Nkg7+</italic>, <italic>Klrb1c+</italic>), B-cells (<italic>Cd79a+</italic>, <italic>Cd79b+</italic>), granulocytes (<italic>S100a8+</italic>, <italic>S100a9+</italic>), neutrophils (<italic>Ly6g+</italic>), fibroblasts and stromal (<italic>Pdgfra+</italic>, <italic>Twist2+</italic>, <italic>Dcn+</italic>, <italic>Col1a1</italic>+), and endothelial (<italic>Pecam1</italic>+). Subsets containing only specific cell types (e.g., secretory cells), treatments (e.g., control, 0.5, 1.5, and 2.5 dpc), or regions (e.g., IA and IU) were created for specific downstream analyses and analyzed through the same process as above with identical parameters.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Oviductal luminal fluid collection for luminal proteomic characterization</title><p>Oviducts were collected as pairs at estrus, 0.5, 1.5, and 2.5 dpc/SO of natural fertilization and superovulated fertilization, respectively. The estrus stage was determined by performing a vaginal lavage, followed by H&amp;E staining. Datasets from the natural cycle and SO allowed us to directly compare the impact of exogenous hormone treatments on protein abundance and profile distinct from the physiological levels of hormones. In this context, our SO approach facilitates multi-dimensional analysis comparisons among naturally cycling bulk RNA-seq, SO scRNA-seq, and natural luminal proteomic biological replicates, enhancing confidence between different methods. This experimental design also reflects adaptive responses in the oviduct during natural fertilization and preimplantation development, influenced by PMSG and hCG treatments at both RNA and protein levels. Furthermore, SO is commonly used in female reproduction to synchronize estrus cycles in animals, thus reducing variables at each collection timepoint.</p><p>For estrus SO, oviducts were collected the day after hCG injections between 10:00 and 13:00 hr. The presence of cumulus mass cells containing oocytes was also confirmed. For 0.5 dpc/SO tissue, female mice were placed for mating at 9 p.m. For 1.5 and 2.5 dpc/SO, female mice were placed for mating between 5 and 6 p.m. Oviducts were dissected and washed in a petri dish containing a 25-µl drop of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) + HALT (1×) (Thermo Scientific, 78440). Once transported to a dissection scope, oviducts were then moved to a fresh adjacent 25 µl drop of PBS + HALT (1×). Inserting a dulled 30 G needle and syringe into the UTJ, each oviduct was subsequently flushed with 100 µl PBS + HALT (1×), for a total sample volume of 225 µl. Next, we observed, staged, and removed oocytes/embryos present in the sample drop via mouth pipetting ensuring to take the least amount of sample fluid possible. The presence of a minimum of 6 embryos per female was confirmed as a benchmark to represent the average litter size. Once oocytes/embryos were removed, we placed the sample drop in a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube and centrifuged at 2200 × <italic>g</italic> for 15 min to remove any additional cell debris or blood cells that may be present after flushing. The supernatant was removed, and we performed additional centrifugation at 5000 × <italic>g</italic> for 10 min. Once centrifugation was complete, the supernatant was placed/pooled and flash frozen with liquid N<sub>2</sub>. Pooled samples (<italic>n</italic> = 3 mice/timepoints) were stored at −80°C. Every sample submitted for LC–MS/MS contained five paired oviduct flushes at each respective timepoint/condition. The average collection time from cervical dislocation to flushing was 10:47 (min:s) before subsequent centrifugations. Once all samples were collected, they were shipped on dry ice overnight to Tymora Analytical Operations (West Lafayette, IN) to perform LC–MS/MS analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>ELISA analysis</title><p>Enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) was utilized to establish in vivo translation of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL1β.

Before sectioning the oviduct into two regions (IA and IU), oviducts were flushed with L15 + 1% FBS media under a 37°C dissecting microscope (Leica MZ10f, Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL). The presence of a minimum of 6 embryos per female was confirmed as a benchmark to represent the average litter size. Additionally, embryos were confirmed to be in the correct developmental stage and location in oviductal tissue samples. Oviducts were sectioned into IA and IU regions.

The model’s architecture is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Input data comprise bulk RNA-seq expressions obtained from naturally fertilized oviduct mice at one of various stages such as estrus, 0.5 dpc, 1.5 dpc, and 2.5 dpc, and the output is the abundance of proteins. Preprocessing steps were applied to raw reads from bulk RNA-seq and raw protein abundance values, which involved removing genes and proteins lacking recorded expression and abundance values across all timepoints, respectively. Normalization techniques were employed on the data, including counts per million (CPM) normalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Johnson and Krishnan, 2022</xref>) for bulk RNA counts to calculate expression values. Furthermore, these values underwent percentile normalization to be confined in the range [0–1], a critical step for machine learning models to manage exploding/vanishing gradients during training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 2023</xref>). Protein abundance values were normalized using log-min-max within each timepoint sample. A specific threshold of 0.6/0.8 was defined to label proteins as high abundance or low abundance. The bulk RNA-seq expression matrix, encompassing samples from IA and IU regions, along with an additional feature indicating if a gene is a transcription factor, was incorporated and randomly sampled for data augmentation. The transformer model is equipped with a single-layer transformer encoder featuring a single-head self-attention mechanism to predict the abundancy of proteins (abundant or not) from the input RNA-seq data. The attention mechanism directs its focus toward crucial segments of the input, capturing the key genes (e.g., transcription factors) that influence protein abundance. The augmented RNA-seq data from estrus, 0.5 dpc, and 1.5 dpc, and the corresponding extracted protein abundance labels, were used to train and validate the transformer model. Subsequently, the model’s performance in predicting the abundance of proteins from RNA-seq data was blindly tested using samples from 2.5 dpc not used in the training and validation. Moreover, the attention matrix derived from the trained transformer model was checked against the results of the differential gene expression analysis and the differential protein abundance analysis to identify significant proteins and the key transcription factors that may influence them across different timepoints. The evaluation results of the model are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6b</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Enrichr pathway analysis: Reactome (2022) and Gene Ontology (GO Biological Processes 2023) bulk RNA and luminal proteomics analysis</title><p>DEG lists were generated for bulk RNA and luminal proteomic data analysis utilizing Biojupies differential expression software and Perseus software.

This mathematical assumption is based on the existence of a continuous random variable. We assume that any single empirically measured protein value (random variable) will not yield the same empirical measurement if subsequent repeated measurements are taken on the same sample. Therefore, we assume that any repeated empirical measurement of any one protein will adhere to a distribution rather than being an absolute measurement. We applied this assumption to our pooled oviductal luminal protein biological replicates to extend our analysis with respect to utilizing statistical tests to identify significantly altered protein abundances during preimplantation development. However, we limited our assumption range to 1 SD above and below all empirically measured protein values. Applying these parameters generates two additional artificial but probable values centered around the true empirical measurement. For example, statistical <italic>t</italic>-tests carried out with this integration will assign empirical measurements as the means for statistical comparisons.

Your comprehensive summary accurately captures the essence of our multi-omics study on oviductal biology, highlighting its importance in understanding reproductive physiology. We are particularly grateful for your recognition of our study's strengths. In the revised manuscript, we have added another searchable scRNA-seq data on our public website; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://genesearch.org/winuthayanon/Oviduct_pregnancy/">https://genesearch.org/winuthayanon/Oviduct_pregnancy/</ext-link>. We have also addressed the weaknesses in the response below in our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) The rationale for using the superovulation model is not clear. The oviductal response to sperm and embryos can be studied by comparing mating with normal and vasectomized mice and comparing pregnancy vs pseudopregnancy (induced by mating with vasectomized males). Superovulation causes supraphysiological hormone levels and other confounding conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this assessment that superovulation changes the hormonal levels and could have a confounding impact on the oviduct function. As such, for all experiments involving pseudopregnant datasets, pseudopregnancy was induced by mating females with vasectomized males without superovulation. Our oviductal luminal protein content analysis was collected from oviductal fluid from pregnant females with and without superovulation. This allowed us to directly compare the impact of superovulation on protein abundance and profile. In the revised manuscript, we have provided clarifying statements on using superovulation in our Method section, which reads</p><p>“Datasets from the natural cycle and SO allowed us to directly compare the impact of exogenous hormone treatments on protein abundance and profile distinct from the physiological levels of hormones”.</p><p>One exception for using superovulation in the absence of a “natural mating” group for comparison is the scRNA-seq dataset. As single-cell libraries should be performed in a single run to avoid batch effects, we need to ensure that a sufficient number of females were pregnant for single-cell isolation (we used ~4 mice/time point). Therefore, superovulation was used to synchronize and ensure that the females were receptive to mating. At the time of our sample collection, single nuclei isolation methods (freeze tissue now, isolate nuclei later) had not been reliable or standardized. We tried to synchronize females using the male bedding without superovulation. However, we would still need to set up at least 12-15 females per pregnancy timepoint to mate with male mice, totaling ~48-60 mice each night. Due to budget constraints and vivarium space limitations, we were not able to do so. We have included a similar statement to clarify the justifications in the revised Methods, which reads,</p><p>“Mating and tissue collection protocols were similar to bulk RNA isolation described above, with the exception that female mice were superovulated using the protocol described previously (73) to ensure sufficient numbers of female mice at each timepoint could be harvested for single cell isolation and library preparation within the same day (n = 3-4 mice/group)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) This study involves a very complex dataset with three different models at four time points. If possible, it would be very informative to generate a graphic abstract/summary of their major findings in oviductal responses in different models and time points</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have now included the graphical abstract to accompany our final version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The resolution of Figures 3A-3C in the submitted file was not high enough to assess the authors' conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now used a higher magnification of images in Figures 3A-C in the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors need to double-check influential transcription factors identified by machine learning. Apparently, some of them (such as Anxa2, Ift88, Ccdc40) are not transcription factors at all.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the recognition of this oversight. In the revised manuscript, we have clarified and stated the distinction between ‘influential transcripts’ and ‘influenced proteins’, which now reads,</p><p>“The top 25 “influential” transcripts (ITs) with the highest attention scores from all the transcription factors present in bulk RNA-seq data were extracted for every potentially influenced protein (IP) in the empirical proteomics datasets”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p>(1) What are the stained debris/nuclei surrounding oocytes/fertilized eggs in Figure 1A? Please indicate in figure legends.</p></disp-quote><p>We have edited Figure 1A with black arrows that highlight the stained cumulus cells surrounding the ovulated eggs/fertilized eggs, together with a revised Figure legend, which now reads, “Arrows indicate cumulus cells surrounding the eggs/fertilized eggs called cumulus-oocyte complexes”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) &quot;Then, oviducts were sectioned into IA and IU regions&quot; The Ampulla region is quite a long tube. Could authors provide details about the cutting border between IA and IU regions?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included a literature defining the number of turns in the coiled mouse oviduct and how we cut between the IA and IU regions in the Method section, which reads,</p><p>“We defined the IA region by including the infundibulum and cutting at turn three of the oviductal coil (the end of ampulla) (5). Turn four to eleven was considered the IU region, which was stripped of uterine tissue enveloping the colliculus tubaris of the UTJ region (5)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) &quot;In this experiment, superovulation (SO) using exogenous gonadotropins was used due to technical limitations of sample collection for single-cell processing.&quot; It was not clear. What was the technical limitation of sample collections?</p></disp-quote><p>As indicated in response to the public review above, we have now clarified that we used superovulation for scRNA-seq analysis to ensure that a sufficient number of females were pregnant for singlecell isolation (we used ~4 mice/time point). Therefore, superovulation was used to synchronize, making sure that females were receptive to mating, thereby providing enough cell numbers for the experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Ephx2+ cluster (only present at SO 0.5 dpc and SO estrus) was very interesting. Could the author provide more information about this gene and the potential cell type this cluster represents?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s interest in this cell-type cluster. We have now included the discussion regarding this gene, which reads, “Interestingly, the <italic>Ephx2</italic>+ cluster was mainly present in the SO 0.5 dpc and SO estrus samples. <italic>Ephx2</italic> encodes epoxide hydrolase 2, which converts epoxides to dihydrodiols. Recent findings suggest that EPHX2 may play a role in primary hypertension in humans (52). However, the reproductive-related functions of EPHX2 have not yet been investigated. Therefore, we believe this presents an opportunity for future research to define the role of <italic>Ephx2</italic> in the oviduct in response to SO during preimplantation embryo development.” However, as it is beyond the scope of the research provided in this manuscript, we did not further investigate the roles of <italic>Ephx2</italic> in our current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) &quot;we elucidated whether exogenous hormone treatment impacts protein secretion in the oviduct. There were 298, 354, and 163 differentially abundant proteins when compared between SO estrus vs. SO 269 0.5 dpc&quot;. Which hormone?? FSH/LH? Or high estrogens due to more mature follicles; or more embryos instead of hormones? Again, the rationale for using the superovulation model need to be better explained with the consideration of other possibilities.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We have clarified that “exogenous hormone treatment” was the superovulation (SO), which is now corrected in the statement, which reads, “we elucidated whether SO treatment impacts protein secretion in the oviduct”.</p><p>The justification for the superovulation has now been included in the revised manuscript as indicated in the responses to reviewers above. A detailed description of gonadotropin treatment was included in the Material and Methods section. As the reviewer suggested, we have revised in the Discussion, including the caveat and possibility of the other factors that could lead to biological changes we observed subsequent to SO, which reads,</p><p>“As SO increases the number of mature follicles (therefore, estrogen levels), ovulated eggs, and follicular fluid, it is also likely that these biological alterations could lead to changes in the protein abundance in the oviduct”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) &quot;we used RNAScope in situ hybridization staining of Tlr2, Ly6g (leukocytes), and Ptprc (common immune cell marker).&quot; Please indicate what cell types Tlr2 marker was for.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now corrected the statement to include the cell types with <italic>Tlr2</italic>+ staining, which reads, “we used RNAScope in situ hybridization staining of <italic>Tlr2</italic> (epithelium, stroma, and myosalpinx)<italic>,</italic> ”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) In which cell types are P38 and p-P38 expressed?</p></disp-quote><p>Based on our scRNA-seq searchable dataset, which has been included in the revised manuscript (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://genesearch.org/winuthayanon/Oviduct_pregnancy/">https://genesearch.org/winuthayanon/Oviduct_pregnancy/</ext-link>), we found that <italic>Mapk14</italic> (encoding P38) was highly expressed in the immune cells in mice (red arrows in the UMAPs below).</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-100705-sa3-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>In humans, scRNA-seq data published by Ulrich <italic>et al.</italic> (PMID: 35320732) showed that <italic>MAPK14</italic> was present in most cell types in the Fallopian tubes at low levels (see violin plot below).</p><fig id="sa3fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-100705-sa3-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) &quot;Our findings showed an influx of Ptrprc+ cells to the stromal layer, and subsequently penetration into the epithelial layer in the presence of sperm at 0.5 dpc in the UTJ.&quot; The authors didn't have results for tracking the influx Ptrprc+ cell to the stromal layer.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out.

We have addressed all comments made by the reviewer concerning superovulation, figure recommendations, and additional analysis in our revised manuscript. We have included a new analysis of scRNA-seq datasets from human Fallopian tube tissues collected from hydrosalpinx patients and healthy subjects by Ulrich <italic>et al.</italic> (PMID: 35320732). The evaluation of this human data helped distinguish between different inflammatory pathways stimulated by sperm vs. general inflammation, as well as species differences (more details in responses below). In future studies, we will follow up on a detailed description of immune cell types present at 0.5 dpc using FACS analysis. This is mainly due to a lack of expertise and technical limitations in our lab on immune cell investigation. Nevertheless, we have already recruited two immunologists to facilitate our future immune cell studies. We have also provided a clear justification for superovulation, especially in the scRNA-seq analysis in the revised manuscript (please see response to Reviewer 1 above).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p>(1) In Figure 3A and 3B, the authors should provide higher contrast and high-resolution images for the expression of the selected immune cell markers at 0.5 dpc and 0.5 dpp. For better clarity and flow, 0.5 dpc &amp; 0.5 dpp, as well as 1.5 dpc &amp; 1.5 dpp, should be merged into a single panel.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. As shown in the response to Reviewer 1 above, we have now used a higher-magnification image for Fig. 3. We have also changed the panel in the quantification graphs to better reflect the immunofluorescent images and improve clarity and flow.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors demonstrated that sperm induces an inflammatory response in the oviduct by presenting IF for selected immune cells. However, FACS analysis should be included to dissect the various immune cell populations further.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the recommendation and agree that FACS analysis should provide a more detailed description of the immune cell types present at 0.5 dpc. However, our current work primarily offers initial investigations, confirming that three bioinformatic models (bulk RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, and proteomic analyses) can be validated by IF staining. Our future research using analysis should provide additional characterization of immune cell types at 0.5 dpc in the oviduct.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In Figure 2, the authors performed proteomic analysis at different stages of implantation. They observed similar alterations in the pro-inflammatory Reactome, as seen with RNA-seq and sc-RNA-seq analyses. It would be interesting to examine the types of proteins induced by embryo presence and how their expression changes at 1.5 and 2.5 dpc. Similarly, are sperm-interacting proteins induced in response to sperm presence at 0.5 dpc? Are these proteins uniquely present in the isthmus compared to the ampulla?</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely appreciate the reviewer’s insightful comments regarding the findings in Figure 2 and the potential avenues for further exploration of the proteomic analysis during different stages of embryo preimplantation. We found that during 1.5 dpc, enriched Reactome included Innate Immune System and RHO GTPase (Fig. S4A). In comparison, Reactome at 2.5 dpc were enriched for Keratinization, Metabolism of Protein, and Post-translational Protein Modification (Fig. S4B). Therefore, the pro-inflammatory Reactome profile appeared to have completely subsided at 2.5 dpc. This statement has now been included in the results section, which reads, “Lastly, differential protein abundance at 1.5 dpc and 2.5 dpc indicated the enrichment for Ras Homolog (RHO) GTPase signaling pathway and changes in epithelial remodeling (keratinization) (Fig. S4A and B), respectively. Therefore, the pro-inflammatory Reactome profile appeared to have completely subsided at 2.5 dpc”.</p><p>And yes, we detected sperm-interacting proteins (such as OVGP1, ANXA1, HSPA5, and PDIA6, etc.) from our 0.5 dpc proteomic datasets (see examples from images below taken from our dataset: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://genes.winuthayanon.com/winuthayanon/oviduct_proteins/">https://genes.winuthayanon.com/winuthayanon/oviduct_proteins/</ext-link>). We noticed that all of these sperminteracting protein levels were lower at 0.5 dpc compared to other timepoints. We speculated that these proteins bind to the sperm and were washed out together with the sperm during the pre-processing centrifugation prior to mass spectrometry analysis. However, we could not distinguish the original location (ampulla vs. isthmus) of proteins as the luminal fluid was flushed from the entire oviduct.</p><fig id="sa3fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-100705-sa3-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Given that salpingitis is associated with inflammation of the fallopian tubes, the authors should consider comparing the gene signatures from this study with publicly available salpingitis datasets.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this insightful suggestion. We have reanalyzed the human data from scRNA-seq of Fallopian tube tissues collected from hydrosalpinx (inflamed and dilated tube) and healthy patients by Ulrich <italic>et al.</italic> (PMID: 35320732). From this published human dataset, we have evaluated GO biological pathways enriched in the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in hydrosalpinx compared to healthy Fallopian tubes. We have added these new data in the revised Results, Fig. 5 and Supplementary Dataset S5. The new data now read,</p><p>“Evaluation of human hydrosalpinx Fallopian tubes compared to sperm-induced inflammation genes</p><p>To determine whether sperm-induced inflammatory responses in the mouse oviduct are similar to or different from human inflammation conditions, we reanalyzed publicly available scRNA-seq data from hydrosalpinx samples by Ulrich et al (50)<italic>.</italic> We found that some of the sperm-induced inflammatory genes identified from our mouse study were present and upregulated in hydrosalpinx samples compared to healthy subjects (Fig. 5A). However, the differentially expressed levels, for example the <italic>CCL2</italic> gene, appeared to be marginal between healthy vs. hydrosalpinx samples (Fig. 5_B-C_ and Supplemental Datasets S5). Nevertheless, the top five most enriched GOBPs related to inflammatory responses were Regulation of Complement Activation, Positive Regulation of Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor Signaling Pathway, MHC Class II Protein Complex Assembly, Positive Regulation of NK Cell Chemotaxis, and Negative Regulation of Metallopeptidase Activity (Fig. 5D). These GOBPs differed from those identified in sperm-exposed mouse oviducts at 0.5 dpc, which were enriched for neutrophil-related pathways, unlike macrophages or NK cells in hydrosalpinx samples”.</p><p>We have also added a revised Discussion, which now reads,</p><p>“Lastly, we found that sperm-induced inflammatory conditions in the oviduct were potentially different than those of chronic inflammatory conditions in human Fallopian tubes. The inflammatory responses observed in mice and humans exhibited significant distinction based on immune cell involvement, mechanisms, and context. In mice, acute inflammation after sperm exposure could be primarily characterized by the activation of neutrophils, which serve as the first responders to injury or foreign bodies. In contrast, human Fallopian tubes with hydrosalpinx conditions displayed chronic inflammatory conditions predominantly involving macrophages and NK cells, suggesting a more complex and sustained immune response. It is also possible that inflammation in the oviduct differs between mice and humans. Understanding these species-specific variations is crucial for developing effective therapeutic strategies, as findings from murine models may not accurately translate to human inflammatory conditions due to the distinct immune dynamics at play”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) In Line 259, the authors should clarify why SO females were chosen for luminal fluid collection at different points.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We wanted to clarify that the proteomic analysis from the luminal fluid was performed in both naturally mated with and without SO. We have revised the statement in the Results section, which now reads,</p><p>“To validate our transcriptomics data at a translational level, LC-MS/MS proteomic analysis was performed on secreted proteins in the oviductal luminal fluid at estrus, 0.5, 1.5, and 2.5 dpc with or without SO. As we also aim to address whether changes in proteomic profiles in the oviduct are governed by hormonal fluctuations, the SO was performed using exogenous gonadotropins. Therefore, the comparison was assessed in the following groups: estrus, 0.5 dpc, 1.5 dpc, 2.5 dpc, SO estrus, SO 0.5 dpc, SO 1.5 dpc, and SO 2.5 dpc”.</p><p>In addition, we have now provided additional clarification in the Method section, which reads,</p><p>“In this context, our SO approach facilitates multi-dimensional analysis comparisons among naturally cycling bulk RNA-seq, SO scRNA-seq, and natural luminal proteomic biological replicates, enhancing confidence between different methods. This experimental design also reflects adaptive responses in the oviduct during natural fertilization and preimplantation development, influenced by PMSG and hCG treatments at both RNA and protein levels. Furthermore, SO is commonly used in female reproduction to synchronize estrus cycles in animals, thus reducing variables at each collection timepoint.”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The authors should include scale bars in all fluorescent images.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this oversight.
