erythematosus (SLE). AGS is thought to arise from the accumulation of incompletely metabolized endogenous nucleic acid species owing to mutations in nucleic acid-degrading enzymes TREX1 (AGS1), RNase H2 (AGS2, 3 and 4), and SAMHD1 (AGS5). However, the identity and source of such immunogenic nucleic acid species remain undefined. Using genome-wide approaches, we show that fibroblasts from AGS patients with AGS1-5 mutations are burdened by excessive loads of RNA:DNA hybrids. Using MethylC-seq, we show that AGS fibroblasts display pronounced and global loss of DNA methylation and demonstrate that AGS-specific RNA:DNA hybrids often occur within DNA hypomethylated regions. Altogether, our data suggest that RNA:DNA hybrids may represent a common immunogenic form of nucleic acids in AGS and provide the first evidence of epigenetic perturbations in AGS, furthering the links between AGS and SLE.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08007.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08007.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08007.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The immune system protects the body from attack by bacteria, viruses, and other microbes. A key feature of this system is the ability to discriminate between the body's own cells and potential foreign invaders. Occasionally, this process can go wrong and the immune system starts attacking its own tissues, which can lead to arthritis, diabetes, lupus, and other ‘autoimmune’ diseases.</p><p>Aicardi–Goutières syndrome (AGS) is an autoimmune disease that leads to severe mental and physical symptoms. Recent research has revealed that the disease is caused by mutations in genes that make enzymes called nucleases. In healthy people, these enzymes destroy DNA molecules and other nucleic acids. In AGS patients, the failure of the nucleases to act is thought to lead to the accumulation of unwanted DNA and RNA molecules. These molecules, in turn, are thought to be mistakenly identified by the immune system as ‘foreign’ and to cause an autoimmune response. However, it is not clear how this works.</p><p>Here, Lim et al. studied skin cells called fibroblasts from patients with Aicardi–Goutières syndrome. The experiments found that the patients' cells had excessive numbers of RNA molecules binding to sections of matching DNA. These unusual DNA–RNA ‘hybrids’ accumulated in regions of the genome that do not contain many genes, perhaps as a result of breaks in the DNA. It is possible that they may mimic nucleic acids from viruses and could trigger an autoimmune response.</p><p>In healthy individuals, small ‘methyl’ groups are often attached to DNA in a process known as DNA methylation. This serves to maintain the stability of the genome and controls the activity of genes. Unexpectedly, Lim et al. found that the DNA in AGS patients had far fewer methyl groups, especially in areas where the DNA–RNA hybrids had accumulated. This may lead to genome destabilization, alterations in gene activity, and may mean that the DNA in these regions may be mistaken for foreign DNA by the immune system.</p><p>Altogether, Lim et al.'s findings suggest that Aicardi–Goutières syndrome may be caused by immune responses triggered by the accumulation of RNA–DNA hybrids and lower levels of DNA methylation. These findings may aid the development of new therapies to treat Aicardi–Goutières syndrome, lupus, and other similar diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08007.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08007.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Aicardi–Goutières syndrome</kwd><kwd>DNA methylation</kwd><kwd>RNA:DNA hybrids</kwd><kwd>RNase H2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006792</institution-id><institution>Hartwell Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chédin</surname><given-names>Frédéric</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH R01 GM094299</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chédin</surname><given-names>Frédéric</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5T32GM007377</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lim</surname><given-names>Yoong Wearn</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Global epigenetic perturbations and accumulation of RNA:DNA hybrids are two novel hallmarks of the lupus-like inflammatory disorder Aicardi-Goutières syndrome.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Aicardi–Goutières syndrome (AGS) is a severe inflammatory encephalopathy characterized by neurological dysfunction, psychomotor retardation, seizures, unexplained fevers, joint stiffness, basal ganglia calcification, and chilblain skin lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rice et al., 2007b</xref>). Despite its rarity, AGS has captured the attention of the scientific community due to its clinical, molecular, and genetic overlap with another, common, systemic autoimmune disorder, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rice et al., 2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ravenscroft et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gunther et al., 2015</xref>). Both diseases are characterized, and to a large extent driven, by excessive expression of interferon alpha, a potent anti-viral cytokine associated with heightened innate immune response and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crow, 2011</xref>). AGS is a monogenic disorder caused by mutations in any one of the six AGS genes. The AGS genes encode for the 3′ to 5′ single-stranded DNA exonuclease TREX1 (AGS1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crow et al., 2006a</xref>), the RNA:DNA hybrid-specific ribonuclease H2 subunits (RNase H2A, B and C, corresponding to AGS4, 2 and 3, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crow et al., 2006b</xref>), the 3′ to 5′ exonuclease and dNTP hydrolase SAMHD1 (AGS5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rice et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goldstone et al., 2011</xref>), and the RNA adenosine deaminase ADAR1 (AGS6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rice et al., 2012</xref>). Recently, gain-of-function mutations in the cytosolic double-stranded RNA receptor gene IFIH1 have also been shown to be associated with AGS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rice et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, mutations in <italic>TREX1</italic> and the <italic>RNASEH2</italic> genes have also been implicated in SLE, further illustrating the genetic link between AGS and SLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee-Kirsch et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gunther et al., 2015</xref>). Given the role of AGS enzymes in DNA and RNA metabolism, the innate immune response in AGS is thought to be triggered by the accumulation of incompletely metabolized endogenous nucleic acid elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Crow and Rehwinkel, 2009</xref>). However, the identity and source of such immunogenic nucleic acid elements remain undefined.</p><p>While genetically well defined, the potential contribution of epigenetic deregulation to AGS has not been addressed. Characterizing putative epigenetic deregulation in AGS is all the more justified given that DNA hypomethylation, either spontaneous or caused by drug exposure, triggers increased B cell autoreactivity and the development of drug-induced and idiopathic human lupus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Richardson, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Quddus et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yung et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jeffries et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Absher et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, loss of DNA methylation, albeit modest and restricted to specific autoimmunity-related genes, was reported in SLE patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Richardson et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ballestar et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Javierre et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jeffries et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Absher et al., 2013</xref>), raising the question of whether the same epigenetic deregulation is shared in AGS.</p><p>To uncover the mechanism driving inflammatory responses in AGS, we sought to identify transcriptional, genetic, and epigenetic perturbations shared among AGS subtypes. For this, we extensively profiled a series of primary fibroblast cells from AGS patients with mutations in AGS1, AGS2, and AGS4 and AGS5 using high-throughput sequencing technologies. Transcriptional profiling via RNA-seq showed that AGS fibroblasts are characterized by an activated antiviral, immune response with a characteristic interferon signature. Genome-wide profiling of RNA:DNA hybrid formation revealed that AGS cells accumulate excessive loads of RNA:DNA hybrids. Whole-genome DNA methylation profiling further indicated that AGS genomes experience global loss of DNA methylation. Our data therefore provide the first evidence that <italic>TREX1</italic>, <italic>RNASEH2</italic>, and <italic>SAMHD1</italic> mutations share common molecular abnormalities including genome-wide DNA hypomethylation and accumulation of RNA:DNA hybrid species.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Primary AGS fibroblasts show heightened immunomodulatory transcriptional responses</title><p>We first performed RNA-seq to ascertain transcriptional signatures of AGS using primary fibroblasts from four patients with mutations in AGS1, AGS2, AGS4, or AGS5, and an age-matched healthy control (see Supplementary file for detailed genotype information). We identified a total of 98 and 209 genes that were significantly up- and down-regulated, respectively, in at least one AGS sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). AGS down-regulated genes significantly associated with ontologies linked to cell adhesion and the extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). These ontologies may be relevant to the skin lesions often observed in AGS and SLE patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rice et al., 2007b</xref>). Genes involved in inflammation, immune responses, chemokine signaling pathways, and sensing of viral nucleic acids were up-regulated in AGS patient cells. Genes for the major pro-inflammatory cytokine IL1β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhao et al., 2013b</xref>) and the CXCL5 and CXCL6 chemokines were up-regulated in several AGS patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Additional immune signaling genes (<italic>IL-33</italic>, <italic>CXCL3</italic>, <italic>CXCL1</italic>, <italic>IL-8</italic>, <italic>CCL11</italic>) were significantly up-regulated in at least one AGS sample (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>) and gene ontology analysis of AGS deregulated genes identified cytokine and chemokine signaling pathways as one of weakly enriched terms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These observations are indicative of a heightened immunomodulatory and chemotactic response previously identified in multiple autoimmune conditions, including SLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tuller et al., 2013</xref>). Genes involved in anti-viral responses (<italic>RSAD2</italic>, <italic>OASL</italic>, <italic>IGF2BP1</italic>, <italic>BST2</italic>), in particular interferon-inducible genes, were also up-regulated in multiple AGS samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Additional interferon-inducible genes (<italic>IFI6</italic>, <italic>IF44L</italic>, <italic>ISG15</italic>) described previously as representing an interferon signature in SLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baechler et al., 2003</xref>) and AGS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rice et al., 2013</xref>) showed up-regulation in at least one AGS sample (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). AGS fibroblasts thus exhibit an activated immune, inflammatory, and anti-viral state, underscoring the systemic nature of the disease and indicating that fibroblasts are an appropriate cell type to study AGS.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08007.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>AGS fibroblasts exhibit activated immune antiviral response.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) RNA-seq heatmap showing log2 expression level of genes up-regulated in at least two Aicardi–Goutières syndrome (AGS) samples.

RNase H2 generally degrades RNA:DNA hybrids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cerritelli and Crouch, 2009</xref>) and is specifically responsible for removing single ribonucleotides that are misincorporated during DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Reijns et al., 2012</xref>). We therefore determined whether ribonucleotide accumulation is a common feature of AGS. For this, we treated genomic DNA from AGS and control primary fibroblasts with purified human RNase H2 and measured the presence of resulting nicks by DNA polymerase I-dependent nick translation in the presence of [α-<sup>32</sup>P] dCTP. Genomic DNA from wild-type and RNase H2A-deficient (<italic>rnh201Δ</italic>) yeast cells that readily incorporate ribonucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nick McElhinny et al., 2010</xref>) was used as a control. Relative to wild-type, <italic>rnh201Δ</italic> yeast cells showed a fourfold to fivefold increase in ribonucleotide accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>), consistent with prior results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nick McElhinny et al., 2010</xref>). Cells from two patients mutated in <italic>RNASEH2B (AGS2)</italic> showed a twofold to threefold increase in labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,C</xref>). Cells from two patients mutated in the catalytic RNase H2A subunit <italic>(AGS4)</italic> showed a pronounced 10–25-fold increase in ribonucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,C</xref>). Thus, as observed in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nick McElhinny et al., 2010</xref>) and mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Reijns et al., 2012</xref>) models, a reduction of human RNase H2 activity leads to elevated levels of ribonucleotides in genomic DNA. By contrast, no significant increase in ribonucleotide loads could be detected in patients mutated in <italic>TREX1 (AGS1)</italic> or <italic>SAMHD1 (AGS5)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). Thus, while aberrant accumulation of ribonucleotides may contribute to the severity of the disease in RNase H2-defective AGS patients, it is unlikely to represent a common form of disease-causing nucleic acids in AGS.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08007.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Incorporation of ribonucleotides in genomic DNA is only observed in RNase H2-deficient AGS fibroblasts.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Genomic DNA was treated with RNase H2 to reveal the presence of ribonucleotides as single-strand nicks.

R-loops are long RNA:DNA hybrid structures that form co-transcriptionally upon re-annealing of the RNA transcript to the template DNA strand, forcing the non-template strand into a single-stranded state. R-loops are enriched at the 5′- and 3′-ends of human genes where they play roles in epigenetic control and transcription regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ginno et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">2013</xref>). DRIP-seq revealed that AGS and control fibroblasts share a total of 15,897 DRIP peaks representing approximately 141 megabases of genomic space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Consistent with prior studies, 32% of these peaks mapped to promoters or gene ends, which represents a strong enrichment over expected genomic distribution and further indicates that gene ends correspond to R-loop formation hotspots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ginno et al., 2013</xref>). Our high-coverage DRIP-seq data also revealed that 56% of the R-loop signal mapped onto gene bodies, suggesting that RNA–DNA entanglements during transcription are prevalent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). By contrast, only 15.6% of common R-loop peaks mapped to intergenic regions, consistent with a predominant genic origin for R-loop formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Overall, common DRIP peaks showed strong overlap with GC skew (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), a key sequence determinant that favors co-transcriptional R-loop formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ginno et al., 2013</xref>). The observation that AGS samples display R-loop formation over expected R-loop forming, GC-skewed, regions indicates that canonical R-loop formation is not significantly altered in AGS patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08007.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>AGS fibroblasts accumulate RNA:DNA hybrids.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) All genomic loci overlapping with a DRIP peak in at least one sample are stacked vertically; the position of each peak in a stack is constant horizontally across samples.

These novel peaks of RNA:DNA hybrids were in many cases unique to each patient sub-type. While a small number of DRIP peaks were also unique to the control sample, AGS-specific DRIP peaks in each AGS subtype were both threefold to fourfold greater in numbers, and when combined, occupied a three to four times larger genomic space than control-specific peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). On average, AGS-specific DRIP peaks occupied an additional 23.8 megabases of DNA sequence.

To determine if DNA methylation patterns were altered in AGS, we performed MethylC-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lister et al., 2009</xref>) to profile DNA methylation at low coverage (3.21–7.82 X coverage) across the same set of primary fibroblasts studied above (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). All AGS cells displayed significant, global, DNA hypomethylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). AGS2 and 4 cells showed profound DNA hypomethylation, with a ∼20% reduction in genomic methylation levels overall. AGS1 and 5 showed a more moderate, but still highly significant, 5–10% reduction in DNA methylation.

While additional samples encompassing other AGS mutations subtypes will need to be studied to confirm this trend, this observation nonetheless reinforces the similarities between AGS and SLE, although the DNA hypomethylation reported here is stronger than that previously reported in SLE. In AGS, DNA hypomethylation was found to affect every genomic compartment, including genic and intergenic regions, unique and repeated sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In AGS2 and AGS4, where the effect was most marked, the DNA hypomethylation led to the formation of AGS-specific PMDs in addition to those normally observed in fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lister et al., 2009</xref>). Similar to previously characterized PMDs in somatic tissues and cancer samples, common fibroblasts PMDs described here overlapped with inactive, late-replicating, heterochromatic regions associated with H3K9me3 and Lamin-B1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hawkins et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berman et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, AGS-specific PMDs, but not common PMDs, were also enriched over regions marked by H3K27me3, a mark of facultative heterochromatin associated with developmental silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This suggests that silent, condensed genomic regions, may in fact be intrinsically prone to becoming PMDs, and that this tendency is made worse by AGS2 and AGS4 mutations. Our data further indicate that RNase H2 defects directly drive these epigenetic perturbations given that we could recapitulate DNA hypomethylation at a subset of LINE-1 sequences and trigger the reactivation of a silent GFP reporter by knocking out <italic>RNASEH2A</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). While the precise mechanism responsible for DNA hypomethylation in AGS remains to be elucidated, it is worth noting that defects in TREX1, RNase H2, and SAMHD1 all trigger the DNA damage response and are associated with increased genomic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Reijns et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clifford et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kretschmer et al., 2015</xref>). RNase H2 in fact associates with the DNA replication fork through the PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) clamp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bubeck et al., 2011</xref>) and TREX1 was found to translocate to the nucleus upon replication stress where it might be involved in processing aberrant DNA replication intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yang et al., 2007</xref>). It is therefore possible that the replication stress caused by AGS mutations indirectly results in defects in replication-coupled, DNMT1-mediated DNA methylation maintenance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Law and Jacobsen, 2010</xref>). In support of this notion, a recent report shows that the PCNA clamp unloads from the lagging strand of stalled DNA replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yu et al., 2014</xref>). Given that the DNMT1 maintenance DNA methyltransferase binds to PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Leonhardt et al., 1992</xref>) and requires PCNA binding for efficient activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schermelleh et al., 2007</xref>), it is plausible that replication stress may lead to inefficient DNA methylation maintenance, particularly in silent, compact regions of the genome such as heterochromatic regions. An analogous mechanism was proposed to account for how defective DNA replication may trigger epigenetic instability by uncoupling DNA synthesis from histone recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sarkies et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine, a drug best known as a DNA-demethylating agent, in fact causes genome-wide DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Karpf et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Palii et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Orta et al., 2013</xref>). Finally, pronounced DNA hypomethylation is also known to cause genomic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jackson-Grusby et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liao et al., 2015</xref>) suggesting a possible positive feedback loop that may link and amplify defects in either pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). It will be interesting to further investigate the connections between DNA replication stress, DNA hypomethylation, and epigenetic instability in the context of AGS or of other diseases associated with epigenetic aberrations such as cancers.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08007.013</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Overall model by which AGS1-5 mutations may lead to DNA hypomethylation, RNA:DNA hybrid accumulation, and IFN-stimulated immune response.</title><p>See ‘Discussion’ for details.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08007.013">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08007.013</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-08007-fig7-v2"/></fig></p><p>Understanding if and how DNA hypomethylation contributes to autoimmunity in AGS and SLE is more than ever a priority. One possibility is that DNA hypomethylation results in altered gene expression profiles. However, our RNA-seq characterization only identified a modest number of up- and down-regulated genes that were enriched for ontologies reflecting the biology of the disease itself, such as immunomodulatory genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). There is therefore no evidence for a global alteration of transcriptional profiles as a result of the DNA hypomethylation in AGS. This is consistent with the general absence of direct connections between DNA hypomethylation and gene reactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bestor et al., 2015</xref>), including in extremely hypomethylated mouse ES cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tsumura et al., 2006</xref>). It remains possible, however, that DNA hypomethylation may enable the transcription of normally silent and methylated retrotransposable elements. DNA methylation is indeed the primary silencing force ensuring retrotransposon control in somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Walsh et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yoder and Bestor, 1998</xref>). If correct, this could lead to the reactivation of endogenous retroviral-like particles, which if detected by innate immune sensors, could in turn induce the anti-viral IFNα cytokine, a hallmark of AGS and SLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Volkman and Stetson, 2014</xref>). Here, we showed that the DNA hypomethylation observed in AGS samples affected LTR, LINE, and to a lower extent, SINE repeated DNA elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). However, methylation pyrosequencing focused on human-specific LINE-1s showed that the extent of DNA hypomethylation at these elements, while significant, was minimal and that they in fact remained mostly methylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Likewise mining of our RNA-seq data sets or targeted real-time reverse-transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) assays aimed at the LINE-1 mRNA transcript failed to provide convincing evidence for LINE-1 transcriptional reactivation (data not shown). Finally, Western blots aimed at detecting the LINE-1 Orf1p protein were negative for AGS fibroblasts even though the protein was easily detected in Ntera2 control cells (data not shown). Altogether, while we can't rule out that LINE-1, or other retroelements, undergo reactivation in AGS cells, particularly in other cell types or at earlier time points during development, the evidence suggests that the DNA hypomethylation observed in AGS primary fibroblasts is not accompanied by LINE-1 reactivation.</p><p>The second major observation from this study is that all AGS subtypes tested here exhibit large accumulation of RNA:DNA hybrid species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). RNA:DNA hybrids therefore represent candidate immunogenic nucleic acids in AGS. In contrast, ribonucleotide incorporation in genomic DNA was only observed in RNase H2-mutated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Our DRIP-seq profiling reveals that AGS2- and AGS4-specific RNA:DNA hybrids map to the intergenic space, away from traditional R-loop hotspots including genes, promoters, and terminators. AGS1- and AGS5-specific RNA:DNA hybrids were by contrast enriched over gene body regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). All AGS-unique RNA:DNA hybrid peaks showed a lower overlap with GC skew, an important sequence determinant of R-loop formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), suggesting that these hybrids may occur by a mechanism distinct from the well-accepted ‘thread back’ R-loop mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aguilera and Garcia-Muse, 2012</xref>). AGS-specific DRIP peaks were enriched in LINE-1 and LTR-containing sequences. This enrichment is intriguing in light of the proposed roles of SAMHD1, RNase H2, and TREX1 in the control of retroelement transposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stetson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhao et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Volkman and Stetson, 2014</xref>), although, as discussed above, we did not find convincing evidence for transposon reactivation here. Alternatively, it is possible that enrichment of AGS-specific RNA:DNA hybrids over LINE-1-rich regions simply reflects the fact that they map preferentially to intergenic and intronic regions. One possible clue as to the origin of AGS-specific DRIP peaks stems from the fact that a large fraction of such peaks in AGS2 and AGS4 samples overlap with AGS-specific PMDs in these two subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Direct measurements in fact show that AGS-specific DRIP peaks are significantly hypomethylated in AGS1, AGS2, and AGS4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Thus, the two main features observed in AGS samples, excessive RNA:DNA hybrid formation and DNA hypomethylation, often overlap, strongly supporting a link between both changes <italic>in cis</italic>. One possible explanation for this overlap is that regions experiencing DNA hypomethylation as a result of AGS mutations may undergo spurious transcription that lead to co-transcriptional R-loop formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Another non-exclusive possibility is based on the proposition that PMD regions may result from DNA damage and inefficient maintenance DNA methylation (see above). It was recently described that RNA transcripts may serve as a template for the repair of double-strand DNA breaks upon hybridization to DNA via Rad52, a key member of the homologous recombination pathway. Interestingly, RNase H2 activity was shown to block the formation of these RNA:DNA hybrids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Keskin et al., 2014</xref>). It is therefore possible that some of the DNA breaks caused by AGS mutations and replication stress are repaired according to a pathway prone to RNA:DNA hybrid formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). While speculative, this model may also account for the lack of overlap with GC skew since those hybrids are thought to be mediated by Rad52 and not to arise co-transcriptionally. Experiments aimed at testing this proposal will be important.</p><p>One key unanswered question concerns the manner in which RNA:DNA hybrids trigger an immune response. The cGAS-STING pathway activates the interferon response upon sensing of not only cytosolic DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sun et al., 2013</xref>), but also RNA:DNA hybrids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mankan et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, several studies reported that multiple dsDNA break repair proteins can sense damaged DNA and induce a STING-mediated type I IFN response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kondo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hartlova et al., 2015</xref>), thereby highlighting previously underappreciated links between the DNA damage response and innate immune signaling. Besides STING, it is worth noting that the endosomal receptor TLR9 has also been identified as an RNA:DNA hybrid sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rigby et al., 2014</xref>) in addition to its canonical role in sensing unmethylated CpG-rich DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hemmi et al., 2000</xref>). It is therefore possible that AGS mutations-induced DNA hypomethylation also contributes to the increased interferon response in AGS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Interestingly, treatment of colon adenocarcinoma with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine, which causes DNA damage and DNA demethylation, triggers a prominent interferon response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Karpf et al., 1999</xref>). Future work will be necessary to dissect the pathways by which unmethylated DNA and RNA:DNA hybrids may be sensed to trigger the innate immune response characteristic of AGS, and by extension, SLE patients.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Detection of incorporated ribonucleotides by nick translation assays</title><p>Detection of incorporated ribonucleotides was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hiller et al., 2012</xref>).

Overall, the manuscript is well written, with most conclusions well supported by evidence presented.

In this study, the authors profiled transcriptome, DNA methylome and RNA-DNA hybrids in fibroblasts from patients with AGS, and identified global DNA hypo-methylation and increased RNA:DNA hybrids as the most likely drivers of the inflammatory response in AGS patients. Importantly they highlight a potential epigenetic contribution to this syndrome (hypomethylation) specifically the reactivation of retrotransposon elements in the human genome, due to genome hypomethylation in the cells. The results are pretty compelling and the conclusions are well supported by the data provided.</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. It appears that for some genes, the normalized RNA-seq data for some of the samples (AGS4-P2, AGS5-P2, AGS2-P1) varies a lot between replicates in the same patient. Could you provide information showing the correlation between replicates?</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) This figure is confusing. It would help to explain how the right hand vertical axis corresponds to the left hand vertical axis. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> is much more easily interpretable and a cleaner presentation of the data.</p><p>3) The authors show that in AGS2 and AGS4 patients, regions containing RNA:DNA hybrids largely correspond with hypomethylated regions, but this is not true in AGS1 and AGS5 patients. Additionally, the authors mention that AGS1 and AGS5 patients have decrease hypomethylation. Patients AGS2 and AGS4 have RNASEH2a/2b mutations, and the authors show how RNASEH2a mutations trigger DNA hypomethylation. Is it possible to show the same for the RNASEH2b mutation corresponding with the AGS2 patient?</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E/F</xref>) By focusing on only two LINE elements it seems too small of a set to “suggest a direct role of RNASEH2a in triggering DNA hypomethylation.” Perhaps you can suggest that it plays a role at these LINE elements. It is likely that if you focused on other areas you could see hypermethylation. Additionally in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E/F</xref> on cpg13, there are four reads supporting 50 % methylation level in the scramble, and two reads supporting a 0% methylation level in the KO. There are too few reads covering this cpg to make any claims regarding changes in methylation at cpg13.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The study focuses on a potential mechanism connecting genetic mutations in TREX1, RNase H2 and SAMHD1 to inflammation-related problems in Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) in children. AGS involves the accumulation of incompletely metabolized nucleic acids resulting from the mutations. In this study, a variety of epigenome and transcriptome profiling, and a cutting-edge genetic engineering method are used to identify the source of immunogenic nucleic acids. The main conclusion is global epigenetic alterations and accumulation of RNA-DNA hybrids are involved in AGS, both shown here for the first time, and these alterations may drive immune responses that cause the inflammation.</p><p>Overall this is a novel study that provides a new evidence of two types of molecular changes that are variably associated with AGS, as shown in fibroblasts from AGS patients and controls.</p><p>The main issue I see with this manuscript is the overstatement of causality where only modest associations are shown. For example, I would agree with “This study identifies global epigenetic perturbations and accumulation of RNA:DNA hybrids as two novel hallmarks” but do not see adequate support for the remainder of the conclusion “that may drive the powerful immune response responsible for...” I also suggest adding additional caveat/caution about the first phrase as this study analyzed a very limited number of AGS samples, and they are heterogeneous in terms of the underlying mutation. Another example of overstatement is “our results indicate that AGS mutations in TREX1, RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B, and SAMHD1 lead to the accumulation of RNA:DNA hybrids over retrotransposon-rich intergenic regions.” The data do not support “lead to”, but perhaps better described as “associated with”.</p><p>The WGBS data is quite interesting and the Circos display allows a reasonable visual comparison and highlights global differences. I have minor concerns about the data. The coverage is quite low, 3x to 7x, which defeats the main benefit of this method, base resolution. While the overall conclusion is probably correct, it would be better for the reader to know this is very low pass sequencing upfront, rather than putting it in a supplemental table only. It is also not clear how the C to T conversion was calculated. I could not find an explanation in the table or methods.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Lim et al. makes some very interesting observations regarding the molecular basis of Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome, an autoimmune disorder of uncertain molecular origin despite well described loss of function mutations in several nucleic acid processing enzymes. The authors find that loss of function of AGS genes is associated, to varying degrees, with widespread hypomethylation of DNA as well as the selective accumulation of RNA:DNA hybrids in intergenic regions and over repetitive elements, and modest changes in gene expression. How these three observations are molecularly linked is less clear. The manuscript is well written and the experiments appropriately controlled. For the most part (exceptions noted below, the conclusions drawn are supported by the data provided.</p><p>1) The authors appear to favor the idea that RNA:DNA hybrid accumulation is the culprit behind activation of the immune response in AGS cells, though the data at hand are such that a direct causal link cannot be established. How this might be achieved is unclear, but the Discussion proposes a number of ‘sensing’ mechanisms, some of which would require a mechanism in cis (e.g. detection of hybrids as they are formed) whereas others (TLR, GAS-STING etc. ) require cytoplasmic accumulation of duplexes. Is there any evidence in the AGS fibroblasts or in the RNASeH2 K/O fibroblasts of non-genomic accumulation of DNA:RNA duplexes in AGS cells?</p><p>2) The RNAseq data only weakly support the idea of immune activation as a phenptype that is enriched in AGS fibroblasts. There were nearly as many downregulated genes...any patterns there? The data should be fully discussed.</p><p>3) The DNA damage known to accompany defects in the AGS genes is proposed as intermediates that could mediate and/or cause the RNA:DNA hybrids or DNA hypomethylation. Do RNA:DNA hybrids accumulate at the sites of ectopic DNA damage ? This is something that could be addressed in the RNAseH2 k/o cells which exhibit by co-localization studies with gamma H2Ax.</p><p>4) It is suggested that the relationship of RNA:DNA hybrid accumulation to retroelements might be circumstantial, due to the enrichment of these structures in intragenic regions... however, the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E, F</xref>, if representative, seem to suggest the opposite; that the accumulation of RNA:DNA hybrids is confined to retroelements, and further, to specific classes (LINE,LTR) implying some specificity to the effect. Are the unique drip seq signals by and large confined to retroelements as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E, F</xref>? Is it possible that you are detecting some intermediate in piRNA-mediated transposon silencing?</p><p>5) The Drip-seq data are presented in a very general way (as total # of peaks, distance covered etc.) making it difficult to fully appreciate how the patterns change, and the spatial relationship to other genomic features. Both and increase in burden and size is implied. Statements like “...Drip-seq peaks were 3-4 fold larger in size” are unclear. Do you mean that existing Drip-seq peaks in control cells spread / expand laterally in AGS cells, or is the trend for new peaks to form in patient cells? <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> – the ‘raw’ data on common and unique sites would be more informative rather than “fold change” e.g. what fraction of common and unique peaks overlap each genomic feature? This would provide not only a comparison between unique and common sites, but also an indication of the relative distribution of Dripseq peaks across genomic features in each setting.</p><p>6) Likewise, it is hard to appreciate the spatial relationship between DNA methylation changes and accumulation of RNA:DNA hybrids, given that the former are very broad and might encompass multiple retroelements some of which change and others that don't. If one looks specifically at those AGS specific DRIP-seq peaks, what fraction are overlapping retroelements, and what is the average DNA methylation level of these in control and AGS cells?</p><p>7) The lack of overlap between AGS unique DRIP seq peaks and regions of GC skew/ annotated TSSs is taken as an indication that the aberrant RNA:DNA hybrids detected do not arise co-transcriptionally. Barring a direct test of the role of transcription on RNA: DNA hybrids in AGS cells, I'm not sure one can rule out a transcription-dependent mechanism at this juncture.</p><p>8) The authors interpret the data from the RNASEH2A k/o fibroblasts as evidence that “...RNAse H2 defects directly drive these epigenetic perturbations”. Thus far they have only observed a modest impact on DNA methylation at certain retroelements. Whether there is a measurable global (bulk) effect on DNA methylation as in AGS cells is not clear, nor has the impact on RNA:DNA hybrid formation been studied. This could be a powerful system as it might allow the investigator to determine the hierarchical nature of the genomic phenomena observed.</p><p>9) Why/what are the missing bubbles in the bisulfite sequencing data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>? Depending on the nature of these CpGs (unmethylated/methylated) would change the magnitude of the methylation change significantly.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08007.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Thoroughly revise the conclusions, where unwarranted causal relationship was drawn, as noted by both reviewers #2 and #3 (below)</italic>. <italic>For example, “This study identifies global epigenetic perturbations and accumulation of RNA:DNA hybrids as two novel hallmarks that may drive the powerful immune response responsible for...”</italic></p><p>We systematically went through the manuscript and eliminated or qualified any unwarranted causal relationship. For example, the sentence above (which appeared in the impact statement) was modified to “Global epigenetic perturbations and accumulation of RNA:DNA hybrids were identified as two novel hallmarks of the lupus-like inflammatory disorder Aicardi-Goutières syndrome”. As suggested by Reviewer #2, we inserted a clause at the top of the Discussion stating that “additional samples encompassing other AGS mutations subtypes will need to be studied to confirm this trend”. Likewise, instances of “lead to” were changed to “associated with”. As suggested by Reviewer #3, we inserted a clause indicating at the end of the Results section that the effect of RNASEH2A deficiency in triggering DNA hypomethylation was observed “at least for the loci studied here”.</p><p><italic>2) Provide clearer description of the datasets. For example, provide information upfront regarding the WGBS sequence depth and resolution</italic>.</p><p>We now indicate coverage depth in the Results section and added an explanation of the method used to calculate bisulfite conversion efficiency in Materials and methods.</p><p><italic>3) The RNAseq data only weakly support the idea of immune activation as a phenptype that is enriched in AGS fibroblasts.

This was added to the Results section and to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>. The data indicates that AGS down-regulated genes significantly associate with ontologies linked to cell adhesion and the extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). These ontologies are interesting given the fact that skin lesions are a clinical hallmark of AGS and SLE patients.</p><p><italic>4) The data in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3E, F</italic></xref> <italic>seem to suggest that the accumulation of RNA:DNA hybrids is confined to retroelements, and further, to specific classes (LINE,LTR) implying some specificity to the effect. Please discuss this trend and biological implications</italic>.</p><p>We apologize if the genome browser screenshots gave the impression that accumulation of RNA:DNA hybrids was confined to retroelements. This is certainly not our view. To address this, we added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> as an example of AGS-unique DRIP peaks overlapping with an intergenic non-retroelement region. We also significantly expanded the corresponding paragraph in the Results section to further discuss the distribution of AGS-specific DRIP peaks over repeat elements. We now specifically state that “whether the reported enrichment of AGS-specific DRIP peaks over LINE and LTR repeats carries biological significance or is simply a reflection of the increased repeat content of intergenic and intronic space remains to be determined”. As was mentioned in detail in the Discussion, we did not find convincing evidence of retroelement reactivation in AGS fibroblasts and stated that “it is possible that enrichment of AGS-specific RNA:DNA hybrids over LINE-1-rich regions simply reflects the fact that they map preferentially to intergenic regions”. Nevertheless, as was stated in the Discussion, we agree that the observation of RNA:DNA hybrids over retroelements is intriguing “in light of the proposed roles of SAMHD1, RNase H2, and TREX1 in the control of retroelement transposition”. In the spirit of open-mindedness, our proposed model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) therefore included “defective retroelement control” as a potential source of RNA:DNA hybrid accumulation.</p><p><italic>5) The Drip-seq data need to be better presented so that a reader can fully appreciate how the patterns change, and the spatial relationship to other genomic features (see Reviewer #3 comment below)</italic>.</p><p>We agree with this and have significantly expanded the corresponding Results section. We now provide a much more detailed description of the distribution of R-loops commonly formed in both control and patient samples over genomic features including promoters, gene bodies, terminal regions and intergenic space. These additions can be found in the subsection “RNA:DNA hybrids accumulate in AGS patients” of the manuscript and in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1C</xref>. As requested by Reviewer #3, we also added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1D</xref> to show the fraction of common and unique DRIP peaks overlapping with each genomic feature. We believe that this more thorough representation of the data strengthened the manuscript and thank the reviewers for the suggestion.</p><p><italic>6) The DNA methylation data and RNA-DNA hybrid datasets also need to be presented more clearly, so that the spatial relationship between DNA methylation changes and accumulation of RNA:DNA hybrid can be better appreciated</italic>.</p><p>We agree that properly describing the spatial relationship between DNA methylation and the accumulation of RNA:DNA hybrids is essential. In the original version, the relationship between RNA:DNA hybrid and partially methylated domains (PMDs) was reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, which showed that a significant portion of AGS2 and AGS4-unique RNA:DNA hybrid peaks fell onto AGS2 and AGS4-unique PMDs. To expand this data and facilitate its comprehension, we added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, a genome browser screenshot that clearly shows the association between peaks of RNA:DNA hybrids in AGS2 and AGS4 subtypes with the presence of a partially methylated region in these two samples. We also added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> to more quantitatively address the relationship between the presence of a peak of RNA:DNA hybrid and the DNA methylation levels of that peak in control versus patient samples. As now shown, the formation of an extra peak of RNA:DNA hybrid in AGS1, AGS2, and AGS4 (but not AGS5) is associated with a significant decrease in the DNA methylation status of that region in patient versus control. This new data solidifies the overlap between changes in RNA:DNA hybrid formation and DNA hypomethylation <italic>in cis</italic>, a point that has also been added in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>7) Experiments from the RNASEH2A k/o fibroblasts have revealed only a modest impact of RNASEH2A KO on DNA methylation at certain retroelements. Deeper analysis of this cell system would allow the investigator to determine the hierarchical nature of the genomic phenomena observed, and strength the causality statement</italic>.</p><p>While we fully agree that further experiments using the RNASEH2A KO system will be informative, we believe that our findings are sufficiently supported by the fact that knockout of the RNASEH2A gene was sufficient to cause partial loss of DNA methylation at dispersed LINE-1 loci and the reactivation of a previously silent reporter gene. We intend to use the knockout system to further investigate the mechanisms linking RNase H2 function, DNA replication stress, RNA:DNA hybrid formation and DNA hypomethylation, but these studies will be reported in a different manuscript.</p><p><italic>8) Proper statistics needs to be used and documented when the enrichment/depletion characteristics and overlapping features are discussed</italic>.</p><p>We have now included statistical tests in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1D</xref>.

For example, I would agree with “This study identifies global epigenetic perturbations and accumulation of RNA:DNA hybrids as two novel hallmarks” but do not see adequate support for the remainder of the conclusion “that may drive the powerful immune response responsible for...” I also suggest adding additional caveat/caution about the first phrase as this study analyzed a very limited number of AGS samples, and they are heterogeneous in terms of the underlying mutation. Another example of overstatement is “our results indicate that AGS mutations in TREX1, RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B, and SAMHD1 lead to the accumulation of RNA:DNA hybrids over retrotransposon-rich intergenic regions.” The data do not support “lead to”, but perhaps better described as “associated with”</italic>.</p><p><italic>The WGBS data is quite interesting and the Circos display allows a reasonable visual comparison and highlights global differences. I have minor concerns about the data. The coverage is quite low, 3x to 7x, which defeats the main benefit of this method, base resolution. While the overall conclusion is probably correct, it would be better for the reader to know this is very low pass sequencing upfront, rather than putting it in a supplemental table only. It is also not clear how the C to T conversion was calculated. I could not find an explanation in the table or methods</italic>.</p><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comments and suggestions. Please see our replies to Essential Revisions #1 and #2.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p><italic>1) The authors appear to favor the idea that RNA:DNA hybrid accumulation is the culprit behind activation of the immune response in AGS cells, though the data at hand are such that a direct causal link cannot be established. How this might be achieved is unclear, but the Discussion proposes a number of ‘sensing’ mechanisms, some of which would require a mechanism in cis (e.g. detection of hybrids as they are formed) whereas others (TLR, GAS-STING etc. ) require cytoplasmic accumulation of duplexes</italic>. <italic>Is there any evidence in the AGS fibroblasts or in the RNASeH2 K/O fibroblasts of non-genomic accumulation of DNA:RNA duplexes in AGS cells?</italic></p><p>We agree that it may be an over interpretation to attribute the immune response solely to RNA:DNA hybrid accumulation in AGS cells. We have therefore eliminated or qualified any unwarranted causal relationship (please see our reply to Essential Revision #1). We also agree that while numerous studies show sensing of nucleic acids either in the cytoplasm or as a consequence of DNA damage, the mechanisms underlying such sensing and their distribution within cellular sub-compartments remain unclear. We have thus far not specifically looked at non-genomic RNA:DNA hybrid accumulation but plan onto doing this in the near future.</p><p><italic>2) The RNAseq data only weakly support the idea of immune activation as a phenptype that is enriched in AGS fibroblasts. There were nearly as many downregulated genes...any patterns there? The data should be fully discussed</italic>.</p><p>We added gene ontology analysis for both up- and down-regulated genes in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>. A short description of these ontologies for down-regulated genes was added to the Results section. See response to Essential Revision #3 for further information.</p><p><italic>3) The DNA damage known to accompany defects in the AGS genes is proposed as intermediates that could mediate and/or cause the RNA:DNA hybrids or DNA hypomethylation. Do RNA:DNA hybrids accumulate at the sites of ectopic DNA damage ? This is something that could be addressed in the RNAseH2 k/o cells which exhibit by co-localization studies with gamma H2Ax</italic>.</p><p>This is undoubtedly an interesting area of future investigation. At this time, however, we do not have data directly relevant to this point and believe it is beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><p><italic>4) It is suggested that the relationship of RNA:DNA hybrid accumulation to retroelements might be circumstantial, due to the enrichment of these structures in intragenic regions... however, the data in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3E, F</italic></xref><italic>, if representative, seem to suggest the opposite; that the accumulation of RNA:DNA hybrids is confined to retroelements, and further, to specific classes (LINE,LTR) implying some specificity to the effect. Are the unique drip seq signals by and large confined to retroelements as shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3E, F</italic></xref><italic>? Is it possible that you are detecting some intermediate in piRNA-mediated transposon silencing?</italic></p><p>Please see response to Essential Revision #4.</p><p><italic>5) The Drip-seq data are presented in a very general way (as total # of peaks, distance covered etc.) making it difficult to fully appreciate how the patterns change, and the spatial relationship to other genomic features. Both and increase in burden and size is implied. Statements like “...Drip-seq peaks were 3-4 fold larger in size” are unclear. Do you mean that existing Drip-seq peaks in control cells spread / expand laterally in AGS cells, or is the trend for new peaks to form in patient cells?</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3D</italic></xref> <italic>– the ‘raw’ data on common and unique sites would be more informative rather than “fold change” e.g. what fraction of common and unique peaks overlap each genomic feature? This would provide not only a comparison between unique and common sites, but also an indication of the relative distribution of Dripseq peaks across genomic features in each setting</italic>.</p><p>We agree with this point – please see answer to Essential Revision #5.</p><p><italic>6) Likewise, it is hard to appreciate the spatial relationship between DNA methylation changes and accumulation of RNA:DNA hybrids, given that the former are very broad and might encompass multiple retroelements some of which change and others that don't. If one looks specifically at those AGS specific DRIP-seq peaks, what fraction are overlapping retroelements, and what is the average DNA methylation level of these in control and AGS cells?</italic></p><p>Please see answer to Essential Revision #6. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> now describes the methylation state of AGS-unique DRIP peaks clearly showing DNA hypomethylation in AGS1, AGS2, AGS4, but not AGS5 samples.</p><p>In answer to your specific request regarding the methylation state of AGS-unique DRIP peaks that overlap retroelements, we are providing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref>.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08007.020</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08007.020">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08007.020</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-08007-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p><italic>7) The lack of overlap between AGS unique DRIP seq peaks and regions of GC skew/ annotated TSSs is taken as an indication that the aberrant RNA:DNA hybrids detected do not arise co-transcriptionally. Barring a direct test of the role of transcription on RNA: DNA hybrids in AGS cells, I'm not sure one can rule out a transcription-dependent mechanism at this juncture</italic>.</p><p>We agree and have edited the language throughout the manuscript so as not to rule out possible co-transcriptional formation of AGS-unique peaks of RNA:DNA hybrids.</p><p><italic>8) The authors interpret the data from the RNASEH2A k/o fibroblasts as evidence that “...RNAse H2 defects directly drive these epigenetic perturbations”. Thus far they have only observed a modest impact on DNA methylation at certain retroelements. Whether there is a measurable global (bulk) effect on DNA methylation as in AGS cells is not clear, nor has the impact on RNA:DNA hybrid formation been studied. This could be a powerful system as it might allow the investigator to determine the hierarchical nature of the genomic phenomena observed</italic>.</p><p>Please see our reply to Essential Revision #7.</p><p><italic>9) Why/what are the missing bubbles in the bisulfite sequencing data in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6E</italic></xref><italic>? Depending on the nature of these CpGs (unmethylated/methylated) would change the magnitude of the methylation change significantly</italic>.</p><p>The missing bubbles correspond to CpG sites that are absent from the sequenced molecule. This is likely due to heterogeneity in LINE-1 sequences. We added a sentence clarifying this in the figure legend.</p></body></sub-article></article>
