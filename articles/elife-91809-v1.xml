However, the existing arsenal for examining antigen-specific T cell interactions is restricted to a select few antigen-T cell receptor pairs, with limited in situ utility. This lack of versatility is largely due to the disruptive effects of reagents on the immune synapse, which hinder real-time monitoring of antigen-specific interactions. To address this limitation, we have developed a novel and versatile immune monitoring strategy by adding a short cysteine-rich tag to antigenic peptides that emits fluorescence upon binding to thiol-reactive biarsenical hairpin compounds. Our findings demonstrate the specificity and durability of the novel antigen-targeting probes during dynamic immune monitoring in vitro and in vivo. This strategy opens new avenues for biological validation of T-cell receptors with newly identified epitopes by revealing the behavior of previously unrecognized antigen-receptor pairs, expanding our understanding of T cell responses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>t cell</kwd><kwd>dendritic cell</kwd><kwd>immune response</kwd><kwd>antigen</kwd><kwd>immune synapse</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP2AI154451</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Akkaya</surname><given-names>Billur</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZIAAI000224</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shevach</surname><given-names>Ethan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Novel antigen-targeting probes, featuring a cysteine-rich tag emitting fluorescence, offer unprecedented insight into antigen-specific immune responses.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The interactions between T cells and APCs form the cornerstone of adaptive immunity. Within the intricate milieu of lymphoid tissue, T cell priming stands out as a discrete and precise process, occurring amidst the multitude of dynamic cellular interactions. Multimerized peptide-major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) labeling has been the gold standard tool for capturing antigen-specific T cells from a polyclonal repertoire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jenkins et al., 2010</xref>). However, such multimers, most commonly tetramers, have limitations in monitoring dynamic interactions of antigen-specific T cells in real-time due to their blocking effect on the immune synapse. Likewise, currently available T cell receptor-like (TCRL), also known as peptide-in-groove (PIG), antibodies that detect pMHC complexes are known to disrupt the immune synapse, making them unsuitable for real-time monitoring of antigen-specific T cell interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dahan and Reiter, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Høydahl et al., 2019</xref>). Although alternative approaches for labeling antigenic peptides with conventional tags such as fluorescent proteins, fluorophores, and biotin-streptavidin have been used, these tags have limitations such as size constraints, membrane impermeability, and photophysically unstable nature, which restrict their use in applications for dynamic monitoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Giepmans et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hoffmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Toseland, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu and Cui, 2020</xref>).</p><p>To overcome these drawbacks, we have developed a highly specific and minimally disruptive labeling strategy for studying antigen-specific T cell-APC interactions. Our approach involves introducing a six-amino acid tetracysteine tag (CCPGCC) on antigenic peptides and inducing fluorescence using membrane permeable thiol-reactive Arsenical Hairpin (AsH) probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hoffmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2002</xref>). We have engineered the OVA<sub>(323-339)</sub> peptide by placing the tetracysteine tag at either the amino or the carboxy terminus, away from the TCR and MHC binding sites, to avoid disrupting T cell- APC synapse in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Robertson et al., 2000</xref>). Owing to these modifications, our labeling strategy preserves the T cell priming ability and allows for the detection of the fluorescent signal on the surface of APCs in an MHCII-dependent manner. Using flow cytometry and live microscopy, we found that the labeled peptide is readily taken up by the cognate CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells with precise specificity in vivo, as previously shown for pMHC complexes taken up from the immune synapse via processes such as trogocytosis and transendocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aucher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Daubeuf et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wetzel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hudrisier et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huang et al., 1999</xref>). Furthermore, we have created new variants of the tetracysteine-tagged OVA<sub>(323-339)</sub> peptide with altered TCR-binding sites and have shown that the AsH probe labeling can track the TCR-mediated uptake of nuanced pMHC complexes. This indicates that our labeling strategy is highly robust and forges a novel path for investigating immune responses against altered antigens such as those derived from self, microbiota, and tumor microenvironment. Overall, AsH probe-mediated immune monitoring offers significant advantages over existing methods, making it a versatile tool for in vitro and in vivo applications including live imaging of the T cell synapse within intact tissue architecture. This novel approach will further our understanding of T cell-mediated immune responses by also complementing tetramers for sorting antigen-specific T cells with precision and extending it to newly discovered epitopes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Signal intensity is determined by the sequence and placement of tetracysteine tag</title><p>We first generated OVA<sub>323-339</sub> variants by placing a tetracysteine tag ‘CCPGCC’ at amino or carboxy termini, either consecutively or via a flexible <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ϵ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>-amino-caproic acid (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ϵ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>-ACA) linker to prevent endosomal-lysosomal enzymatic digestion to the tag.

We used these variants to load mature C57BL/6 CD11c<sup>+</sup> splenic DCs from C57BL/6 mice and induced fluorescence by treating cells with Fluorescein-AsH (FlAsH) probe. Flow cytometry analysis showed that CACA- peptide combination but not the other tested variants induced a distinguished fluorescent signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Cysteine is naturally oxidation prone and this may reduce FlAsH binding to tetracysteine tag. We addressed this problem by pre-treating OVA<sub>CACA</sub> with tris-2-carboxyethylphosphine (TCEP), an irreversible reducing agent that blocks cystine disulfide bridge formation and elicited a consistent FlAsH signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Moreover, we used another AsH probe excitable by 561 nm laser, called ReAsH, to occupy non-specific cysteine residues that would otherwise attract FlAsH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Stroffekova et al., 2001</xref>). Pre-incubation of DCs with ReAsH improved signal-to-noise ratio significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). We have created additional OVA variants to enhance signal intensity. These variants include one with two tetracysteine residues and another with a longer tetracysteine tag that withstands the British anti-Lewisite (BAL) wash, a crucial step to reduce background labeling by removing excess AsH probe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Machleidt et al., 2007</xref>). However, new variants provided FlAsH intensity comparable to the original CACA variant, indicating no additional benefit for longer tags (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Fluorescein-AsH (FlAsH) labeling elicits fluorescence depending on the location of the tetracysteine tag.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Arsenical Hairpin (AsH)- probe labeling strategy for the tetracysteine-tagged peptides and the four OVA<sub>323-339</sub> variants generated for the study.

Within the first hours of coculture, OTII T cells established stable contact with OVA<sub>CACA</sub>-pulsed DCs, and FlAsH-labeled peptide gradually concentrated at the contact site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). At 24 hr after treatment, OTII T cells in the peptide-treated groups exhibited increased volume and a shift towards a less spherical shape, indicative of T cell blasting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>).

Splenic DCs from β-Actin DsRed mice were treated with ReAsH to prime them for FlAsH labeling. Because DsRed and ReAsH do not get transferred to T cells during immune synapse, their overlapping fluorescence emission do not pose any problem for tracking the DCs. Next, DCs were pulsed with a peptide mix comprised of equimolar amounts of OVA-Biotin and OVA<sub>CACA</sub>, where OVA-Biotin served as a positive control for flow cytometry. This was followed by optimized FlAsH treatments as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and adoptive transfer into C57BL/6 recipients via footpad injection. Naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were isolated from OTII and WT C57BL/6 spleens, labeled with distinct cell-tracker dyes, mixed 1:1, and transferred into recipients via retroorbital i.v. injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). As previously demonstrated, adoptively transferred DCs were detectable in the popliteal lymph node 18–24 hr post-transfer and they largely disappeared by 48 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bajénoff et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bousso, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ingulli et al., 1997</xref>). FlAsH signal remained stable on DCs for the entire duration DCs were present in the lymph node (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Strikingly, FlAsH was picked up by the cognate OTII T cells, suggestive of an antigen-specific peptide major histocompatibility complex II (pMHCII) trogocytosis in-vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c and d</xref>). Antigen-specific transfer was also confirmed by OVA-Biotin staining on OTII T cells by fluorochrome-conjugated streptavidin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c and d</xref>).

To address this gap, we sought to determine the robustness of tetracysteine tagging in visualizing nuanced pMHCII variants. We created three variants by introducing alanine mutations at the TCR binding residues 331, 333, and 335 of OVA<sub>CACA</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). The mutations at 331 and 333, depicted as variants 1 and 2, respectively, were previously reported to abolish the binding of OTII TCR to OVA<sub>323-339</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Robertson et al., 2000</xref>). Although the residue 335 is flanked between the core OTII TCR binding residues 333 and 336, mutant 335 was shown to elicit the normal proliferative response in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Robertson et al., 2000</xref>). We addressed how pMHCII uptake by T cells is influenced by the mutation of TCR binding residues of OVA<sub>CACA</sub>.

TCR-mediated uptake of the FlAsH-labeled pMHCII complexes followed the same pattern and only variant 3 complexes produced a comparable signal to that of OVA<sub>CACA</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>).

Here, we address this issue by presenting a novel strategy for visualizing T cell-APC interactions via tetracysteine tagging of antigenic peptides. While tetracysteine tagging has been previously applied in cell biology and virology, these applications have been mostly limited to cell lines and in vitro studies in immunology-unrelated experimental settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Griffin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mohl and Roy, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ng et al., 2019</xref>). On the other hand, our technique labels antigenic peptides and tracks pMHCII complexes in primary APCs during their interactions with T cells both in vitro and in vivo. Our approach is superior as compared to other strategies for monitoring T cell-DC interactions, in the way it robustly targets specific pMHCII complexes in real-time in vivo. There is no need for special organisms or genetic modifications, and the technique can easily be expanded to new antigens and T cell-APC pairs from both mice and humans. This strategy can, for instance, be integrated into validation efforts for antigen discovery and utilized in the investigation of the synapses of newly deorphanized human T cells, a largely unexplored area where tools are scarce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dobson et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lewis and Peters, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pogorelyy et al., 2022</xref>). Given that is a two-part system (tag and FlAsH), it also carries the added capability of being inducible at different time points to allow for increased flexibility in interrogating pMHCII-TCR interactions over time. On the other hand, this introduces a high background due to the non-specific binding of FlAsH to endogenous cysteines. Thus, we implemented a ReAsH pretreatment strategy, successfully improving the signal-to-noise profile for FlAsH. It’s worth mentioning our unpublished attempts to load dendritic cells (DCs) with preconjugated peptide and FlAsH to mitigate the background. Unfortunately, this endeavor led to almost a complete loss of the FlAsH signal and has not been pursued further. Therefore, exploring new peptide probes chemically conjugated to small organic dyes emerges as a potential avenue for future investigation.</p><p>Most important of all, our experiments demonstrate that tetracysteine-tagged peptides can be transferred from DCs to T cells via synaptic processes, such as antigen-specific pMHCII trogocytosis/transendocytosis, marking acceptor T cells for several days. Although the turnover of pMHCII in acceptor T cells and its temporal relationship to the TCR downstream events require further elucidation, our visualization of tetracysteine-tagged pMHCII can complement tetramers in detecting antigen-specific T cells in vivo. Additionally, we show that tetracysteine tagging of pMHCII does not broadly alter or disturb T cell-DC synapse by functional read-outs. Although the ratio of peptide-FlAsH conjugates to free peptide in DCs would be needed to support this claim, our approach offers an advantage over tetramers in that it is suitable for real-time monitoring of the immune synapse. Finally, it is worth noting that tetracysteine tags can be visualized as electron-dense particles by Transmission Electron Microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ellisman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cortese et al., 2009</xref>), providing potential for the detailed investigation of T-DC synapse and subcellular localization of pMHCII complexes. Although TEM application was out of scope for this study, it offers a promising avenue for future research. In conclusion, the tetracysteine labeling approach described here provides a powerful and unique tool to advance our understanding of T cell-APC interactions, offering new opportunities to investigate the immune response and develop improved immunotherapies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals and reagents</title><p>C57BL/6, DsRed.T3, <italic>H2-K1</italic>/<italic>H2-D1</italic> knockout (MHCI KO), Eα<sub>52-68</sub>, LCMV GP<sub>61–80</sub>-specific (SMARTA), and OVA<sub>323–339</sub>-specific (OT-II) TCR transgenic mice were acquired from The Jackson Laboratory.

Pulsed DCs were adoptively transferred through the right footpad in 50 uL sterile PBS. T cells labeled with e450 or e670 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were injected intravenously in 100 uL sterile PBS through the retro-orbital sinus.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-7"><title>Confocal microscopy</title><p>35 mm dishes with a 14 mm glass coverslip bottom (MatTek) were pre-treated with 10 ug/ml fibronectin (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for 1 hr at room temperature and washed twice. Splenic DCs were added onto the glass coverslip in complete RPMI and pulsed with 5–10 μM peptide at 37 °C for 1 hr. Excess peptide was washed off with complete RPMI before the addition of CD4 T cells. Co-cultures were imaged for 3–18 hr using a Leica SP-8 inverted microscope (Leica Microsystems) equipped with a full range of visible lasers, two hybrid detectors, three photomultiplier detectors, and a motorized stage. 63x objective (Leica Microsystems) was used and microscope configuration was set up for 3D analysis (x, y, z) of the cellular layer. The following lasers were used: diode laser for 405  nm excitation; argon laser for 488 and 514  nm excitation; diode-pumped solid-state laser for 561  nm; and HeNe laser for 594 and 633  nm excitation. All lasers were tuned to minimal power (between 0.3% and 2%) to prevent photobleaching. z stacking of images of 10–12  µm were collected. Mosaic images of large cell culture areas (1  mm<sup>2</sup>) were generated by acquiring multiple z stacks using the Tile scan mode and were assembled into tiled images using LAS X v4.0 (Leica Microsystems).</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-8"><title>Intravital two-photon laser-scanning microscopy of mouse popliteal lymph nodes</title><p>Mice were anesthetized in 1.5% isoflurane USP (Baxter) through a rodent nose cone followed by surgery to expose the right popliteal lymph node. Warm PBS was added to maintain lymph node moisture. Mouse body temperature was maintained with an infrared blanket (Braintree Scientific) throughout the imaging process after which they were euthanized through cervical dislocation under anesthesia. Mice were imaged on a glass stage with a two-photon laser-scanning microscopy setup with a Leica SP8 inverted confocal microscope with dual multi-photon lasers, Mai Tai and InSight DS (Spectra-Physics), L 25.0 water-immersion objective, 0.95 NA (Leica Microsystems), and a 37  °C incubation chamber (NIH, Division of Scientific Equipment and Instrumentation Services). The Mai Tai laser was tuned to 890  nm to excite e450 and FlAsH; the InSight DS laser was tuned to 1150  nm to excite DsRed/ PKH-26 /ReAsH and e670. For time-lapse imaging, a z stack consisting of 10–12 single planes (5  μm each over a total tissue depth of 50–60  μm) was acquired at 15 s intervals for a total period of 1–4 hr.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-9"><title>Two-photon laser-scanning microscopy of live lymph node sections</title><p>Live lymph node sections were imaged ex vivo by two-photon microscopy. To maintain tissue architecture, popliteal lymph nodes were immediately transferred to PBS with 1% BSA and kept on ice immediately following harvest. Residual fat and connective tissue were removed using a Leica MZ6 StereoZoom microscope (Leica Microsystems). Lymph nodes were suspended at 38  °C agarose in DMEM and kept over ice. Following complete agarose solidification, complete RPMI was added and blocks were cut containing one lymph node each. Lymph node blocks were cut into 200  µm sections with a Leica VT1000 S vibrating blade microtome (Leica Microsystems) at speed 5 in ice-cold PBS and frozen at –80  °C. Prior to imaging, a complete RPMI medium was added to tissue sections and incubated at 37  °C for 2  hr. Sections were held down with tissue anchors (Warner Instruments) in 35 mm dishes with a 14 mm glass coverslip bottom (MatTek) and were imaged with a Leica SP8 inverted five-channel confocal microscope equipped with an environmental chamber (NIH, Division of Scientific Equipment and Instrumentation Services) and a motorized stage. The microscope configuration was set up for four-dimensional analysis (x, y, z, t) of cell segregation and migration within tissue sections. A diode laser for 405  nm, an argon laser for 488 and 514  nm, a diode-pumped solid-state laser for 561  nm, and a HeNe laser for 594 and 633  nm excitation wavelengths were tuned to minimal power (between 0.3% and 2%). z-stack of images of 10–25  µm were collected. Mosaic images of whole lymph nodes were generated by acquiring multiple z stacks using a motorized stage to cover the whole lymph node area and assembled into a tiled image with the LAS X software. For time-lapse analysis of cell migration, tiled z-stacks were collected over time (1–4  hr).</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-10"><title>Image analysis</title><p>Analysis of confocal and intravital two-photon images was performed using Imaris v9.2.1 and v10.0.0 (Bitplane) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Akkaya et al., 2021</xref>). In brief, e450 and e670 signals were utilized for reconstructing the 3D structure of T cells and iTreg cells as surface objects. To reconstruct the 3D structure of DCs, overlapping DsRed, PKH-26, and ReAsH signals were employed. Imaris v10.0.0’s built-in algorithms were used to calculate 3D volumes, track velocities, surface-to-surface colocalization parameters, and FlAsH (green) intensities of cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-11"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was conducted on Prism v9.5.1 (GraphPad).

However, this doesn't limit the utility of the method for applications where the peptide of interest is known. It's not clear to me how it could be used to de-orphan known TCR and this should be explained if they want to claim this as an application. Previous methods based on biotin-streptavidin and phycoerythrin had single pMHC sensitivity, but there were limitations to the PE-based probe so the use of organic dyes could offer advantages.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the valuable comments and suggestions. Indeed, we have shown and optimized this labeling technique for a commonly used peptide at rather high doses to provide a proof of principle for the possible use of tetracysteine tagged peptides for in vitro and in vivo studies. However, we completely agree that the studies that require different peptides and/or lower pMHC concentrations may require preliminary experiments if the use of biarsenical probes is attempted. We think it can help investigate the functional and biological properties of the peptides for TCRs deorphaned by techniques. Tetracysteine tagging of such peptides would provide a readily available antigen-specific reagent for the downstream assays and validation. Other possible uses for modified immunogenic peptides could be visualizing the dynamics of neoantigen vaccines or peptide delivery methods in vivo. For these additional uses, we recommend further optimization based on the needs of the prospective assay.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors here develop a novel Ovalbumin model peptide that can be labeled with a site-specific FlAsH dye to track agonist peptides both in vitro and in vivo. The utility of this tool could allow better tracking of activated polyclonal T cells particularly in novel systems. The authors have provided solid evidence that peptides are functional, capable of activating OTII T cells, and that these peptides can undergo trogocytosis by cognate T cells only.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>-An array of in vitro and in vivo studies are used to assess peptide functionality.</p><p>-Nice use of cutting-edge intravital imaging.</p><p>-Internal controls such as non-cogate T cells to improve the robustness of the results (such as Fig 5A-D).</p><p>-One of the strengths is the direct labeling of the peptide and the potential utility in other systems.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>1. What is the background signal from FlAsH? The baselines for Figure 1 flow plots are all quite different. Hard to follow. What does the background signal look like without FLASH (how much fluorescence shift is unlabeled cells to No antigen+FLASH?). How much of the FlAsH in cells is actually conjugated to the peptide? In Figure 2E, it doesn't look like it's very specific to pMHC complexes. Maybe you could double-stain with Ab for MHCII. Figure 4e suggests there is no background without MHCII but I'm not fully convinced. Potentially some MassSpec for FLASH-containing peptides.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out a possible area of confusion. In fact, we have done extensive characterization of the background and found that it has varied with the batch of FlAsH, TCEP, cytometer and also due to the oxidation prone nature of the reagents. Because Figure 1 subfigures have been derived from different experiments, a combination of the factors above have likely contributed to the inconsistent background. To display the background more objectively, we have now added the No antigen+Flash background to the revised Fig 1.</p><p>It is also worthwhile noting that nonspecific Flash incorporation can be toxic at increasing doses, and live cells that display high backgrounds may undergo early apoptotic changes in vitro. However, when these cells are adoptively transferred and tracked in vivo, the compromised cells with high background possibly undergo apoptosis and get cleared by macrophages in the lymph node. The lack of clearance in vitro further contributes to different backgrounds between in vitro and in vivo, which we think is also a possible cause for the inconsistent backgrounds throughout the manuscript. Altogether, comparison of absolute signal intensities from different experiments would be misleading and the relative differences within each experiment should be relied upon. We have added further discussion about this issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. On the flip side, how much of the variant peptides are getting conjugated in cells? I'd like to see some quantification (HPLC or MassSpec). If it's ~10% of peptides that get labeled, this could explain the low shifts in fluorescence and the similar T cell activation to native peptides if FlasH has any deleterious effects on TCR recognition. But if it's a high rate of labeling, then it adds confidence to this system.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that mass spectrometry or, more specifically tandem MS/MS, would be an excellent addition to support our claim about peptide labeling by FlAsH being reliable and non-disruptive. Therefore, we have recently undertaken a tandem MS/MS quantitation project with our collaborators. However, this would require significant time to determine the internal standard based calibration curves and to run both analytical and biological replicates. Hence, we have decided pursuing this as a follow up study and added further discussion on quantification of the FlAsH-peptide conjugates by tandem MS/MS.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Conceptually, what is the value of labeling peptides after loading with DCs? Why not preconjugate peptides with dye, before loading, so you have a cleaner, potentially higher fluorescence signal? If there is a potential utility, I do not see it being well exploited in this paper. There are some hints in the discussion of additional use cases, but it was not clear exactly how they would work. One mention was that the dye could be added in real-time in vivo to label complexes, but I believe this was not done here. Is that feasible to show?</p></disp-quote><p>We have already addressed preconjugation as a possible avenue for labeling peptides. In our hands, preconjugation resulted in low FlAsH intensity overall in both the control and tetracysteine labeled peptides (Author response image 1). While we don’t have a satisfactory answer as to why the signal was blunted due to preconjugation, it could be that the tetracysteine tagged peptides attract biarsenical compounds better intracellularly. It may be due to the redox potential of the intracellular environment that limits disulfide bond formation.

Figure 5D-F the imaging data isn't fully convincing. For example, in 5F and 2G, the speeds for T cells with no Ag should be much higher (10-15micron/min or 0.16-0.25micron/sec). The fact that yours are much lower speeds suggests technical or biological issues, that might need to be acknowledged or use other readouts like the flow cytometry.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for drawing attention to this technical point. We would like to point out that the imaging data in fig 5 d-f was obtained from agarose embedded live lymph node sections. Briefly, the lymph nodes were removed, suspended in 2% low melting temp agarose in DMEM and cut into 200 µm sections with a vibrating microtome. Prior to imaging, tissue sections were incubated in complete RPMI medium at 37 °C for 2 h to resume cell mobility. Thus, we think the cells resuming their typical speeds ex vivo may account for slightly reduced T cell speeds overall, for both control and antigen-specific T cells (PMID: 32427565, PMID: 25083865). We have added text to prevent the ambiguity about the technique for dynamic imaging. The speeds in Figure 2g come from live imaging of DC-T cell cocultures, in which the basal cell movement could be hampered by the cell density. Additionally, glass bottom dishes have been coated with Fibronectin to facilitate DC adhesion, which may be responsible for the lower average speeds of the T cells in vitro.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Does the reaction of ReAsH with reactive sites on the surface of DC alter them functionally? Functions have been attributed to redox chemistry at the cell surface- could this alter this chemistry?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the insight. It is possible that the nonspecific binding of biarsenical compounds to cysteine residues, which we refer to as background throughout the manuscript, contribute to some alterations. One possible way biarsenicals affect the redox events in DCs can be via reducing glutathione levels (PMID: 32802886). Glutathione depletion is known to impair DC maturation and antigen presentation (PMID: 20733204). To avoid toxicity, we have carried out a stringent titration to optimize ReAsH and FlAsH concentrations for labeling and conducted experiments using doses that did not cause overt toxicity or altered DC function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Have the authors compared this to a straightforward approach where the peptide is just labelled with a similar dye and incubated with the cell to load pMHC using the MHC knockout to assess specificity? Why is this that involves exposing the DC to a high concentration of TCEP, better than just labelling the peptide? The Davis lab also arrived at a two-step method with biotinylated peptide and streptavidin-PE, but I still wonder if this was really necessary as the sensitivity will always come down to the ability to wash out the reagents that are not associated with the MHC.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that small undisruptive fluorochrome labeled peptide alternatives would greatly improve the workflow and signal to noise ratio. In fact, we have been actively searching for such alternatives since we have started working on the tetracysteine containing peptides. So far, we have tried commercially available FITC and TAMRA conjugated OVA323-339 for loading the DCs, however failed to elicit any discernible signal. We also have an ongoing study where we have been producing and testing various in-house modified OVA323-339 that contain fluorogenic properties. Unfortunately, at this moment, the ones that provided us with a crisp, bright signal for loading revealed that they have also incorporated to DC membrane in a nonspecific fashion and have been taken up by non-cognate T cells from double antigen-loaded DCs. We are actively pursuing this area of investigation and developing better optimized peptides with low/non-significant membrane incorporation.</p><p>Lastly, we would like to point out that tetracysteine tags are visible by transmission electron microscopy without FlAsH treatment. Thus, this application could add a new dimension for addressing questions about the antigen/pMHCII loading compartments in future studies. We have now added more in-depth discussion about the setbacks and advantages of using tetracysteine labeled peptides in immune system studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The peptide dosing at 5 µM is high compared to the likely sensitivity of the T cells. It would be helpful to titrate the system down to the EC50 for the peptide, which may be nM, and determine if the specific fluorescence signal can still be detected in the optimal conditions. This will not likely be useful in vivo, but it will be helpful to see if the labelling procedure would impact T cell responses when antigen is limited, which will be more of a test. At 5 µM it's likely the system is at a plateau and even a 10-fold reduction in potency might not impact the T cell response, but it would shift the EC50.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment and suggestion. We agree that it is possible to miss minimally disruptive effects at 5 µM and titrating the native peptide vs. modified peptide down to the nM doses would provide us a clearer view. This can certainly be addressed in future studies and also with other peptides with different affinity profiles. A reason why we have chosen a relatively high dose for this study was that lowering the peptide dose had costed us the specific FlAsH signal, thus we have proceeded with the lowest possible peptide concentration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Fig 3b the level of background in the dsRed channel is very high after DC transfer. What cells is this associated with and does this appear be to debris? Also, I wonder where the ReAsH signal is in the experiments in general. I believe this is a red dye and it would likely be quite bright given the reduction of the FlAsH signal. Will this signal overlap with signals like dsRed and PHK-26 if the DC is also treated with this to reduce the FlAsH background?</p></disp-quote><p>We have already shown that ReAsH signal with DsRed can be used for cell-tracking purposes as they don’t get transferred to other cells during antigen specific interactions (Author response image 2). In fact, combining their exceptionally bright fluorescence provided us a robust signal to track the adoptively transferred DCs in the recipient mice. On the other hand, the lipophilic membrane dye PKH-26 gets transferred by trogocytosis while the remaining signal contributes to the red fluorescence for tracking DCs. Therefore, the signal that we show to be transferred from DCs to T cells only come from the lipophilic dye. To address this, we have added a sentence to elaborate on this in the results section. Regarding the reviewer’s comment on DsRed background in Figure 3b., we agree that the cells outside the gate in recipient mice seems slightly higher that of the control mice. It may suggest that the macrophages clearing up debris from apoptotic/dying DCs might contribute to the background elicited from the recipient lymph node. Nevertheless, it does not contribute to any DsRed/ReAsH signal in the antigen-specific T cells.</p><fig id="sa3fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>ReAsH and DsRed are not picked up by T cells during immune synapse.</title><p>DsRed+ DCs were labeled with ReAsH, pulsed with 5 μM OVACACA, labeled with FlAsH and adoptively transferred into CD45.1 congenic mice mice (1-2 × 106 cells) via footpad.

If they look at Ea-specific T cells for DC with without the Ova peptide do they see no transfer of PKH-26 to the OTII T cells? Also, the FMI of the FlAsH signal transferred to the T cells seems very high compared to other experiments. Can the author estimate the number of peptides transferred (this should be possible) and would each T cell need to be collecting antigens from multiple DC? Could the debris from dead DC also contribute to this if picked up by other DC or even directly by the T cells? Maybe this could be tested by transferring DC that are killed (perhaps by sonication) prior to inoculation?</p></disp-quote><p>To address the reviewer’s question on the PKH-26 acquisition by T cells, Ea-T cells pick up PKH-26 from Ea+OVA double pulsed DCs, but not from the unpulsed or single OVA pulsed DCs. OTII T cells acquire PKH-26 from OVA-pulsed DCs, whereas Ea T cells don’t (as expected) and serve as an internal negative control for that condition. Regarding the reviewer’s comment on the high FlAsH signal intensity of T cells in Figure 5b, a plausible explanation can be that the T cells accumulate pMHCII through serial engagements with APCs. In fact, a comparison of the T cell FlAsH intensities 18 h and 36-48 h post-transfer demonstrate an increase (Author response image 3) and thus hints at a cumulative signal. As DCs are known to be short-lived after adoptive transfer, the debris of dying DCs along with its peptide content may indeed be passed onto macrophages, neighboring DCs and eventually back to T cells again (or for the first time, depending on the T:DC ratio that may not allow all T cells to contact with the transferred DCs within the limited time frame). We agree that the number and the quality of such contacts can be gauged using fluorescent peptides. However, we think peptides chemically conjugated to fluorochromes with optimized signal to noise profiles and with less oxidation prone nature would be more suitable for quantification purposes.</p><fig id="sa3fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>FlAsH signal acquisition by antigen specific T cells becomes more prominent at 36-48 h post-transfer.</title><p>DsRed+ splenic DCs were double-pulsed with 5 μM OVACACA and 5 μM OVA-biotin and adoptively transferred into CD45.1 recipients (2 × 106 cells) via footpad.

We have used proliferation and CD44 expressions as proxies of activation (Fig 2, 6).
