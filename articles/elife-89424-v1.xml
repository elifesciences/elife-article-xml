Numb is an adaptor protein best known for its critical roles in development, including asymmetric cell division, cell-type specification, and termination of intracellular signaling. <italic>Numb</italic> expression is reduced in old humans and mice. We previously showed that, in mouse skeletal muscle fibers, Numb is localized to sarcomeres where it is concentrated near triads; conditional inactivation of <italic>Numb</italic> and a closely related protein <italic>Numb</italic>-like (<italic>Numbl</italic>) in mouse myofibers caused weakness, disorganization of sarcomeres, and smaller mitochondria with impaired function. Here, we found that a single knockout of <italic>Numb</italic> in myofibers causes reduction in tetanic force comparable to a double <italic>Numb</italic>, <italic>Numbl</italic> knockout. We found by proteomics analysis of protein complexes isolated from C2C12 myotubes by immunoprecipitation using antibodies against Numb that Septin 7 is a potential Numb-binding partner. Septin 7 is a member of the family of GTP-binding proteins that organize into filaments, sheets, and rings, and is considered part of the cytoskeleton. Immunofluorescence evaluation revealed a partial overlap of staining for Numb and Septin 7 in myofibers. Conditional, inducible knockouts of <italic>Numb</italic> led to disorganization of Septin 7 staining in myofibers. These findings indicate that Septin 7 is a Numb-binding partner and suggest that interactions between Numb and Septin 7 are critical for structural organization of the sarcomere and muscle contractile function.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>skeletal muscle</kwd><kwd>excitation–contraction coupling</kwd><kwd>cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>sarcomere structure</kwd><kwd>Numb</kwd><kwd>Septin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000738</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I50RX002020</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cardozo</surname><given-names>Christopher P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000738</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I01RX00776</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cardozo</surname><given-names>Christopher P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R-1AG060341</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cardozo</surname><given-names>Christopher P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100018818</institution-id><institution>National Research, Development and Innovation Office</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2020-4.1.1-TKP2020</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Csernoch</surname><given-names>Laszlo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministry of Innovation and Technology of Hungary</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K_137600</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Csernoch</surname><given-names>Laszlo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012636</institution-id><institution>New York State Stem Cell Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#C039159</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brown</surname><given-names>Lewis M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006380</institution-id><institution>Rehabilitation Research and Development Service</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>B7756R</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cardozo</surname><given-names>Christopher P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic reduction of Numb or Numb/Nubl is linked to deterioration of the Septin cytoskeleton and suggests cytoskeletal abnormalities are the consequences of and contribute to age-related changes in skeletal muscle.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A common consequence of aging is sarcopenia, which is characterized by declining skeletal muscle mass, muscle contractile force, muscle power, and overall physical function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Brotto and Abreu, 2012</xref>). The causes of reduced contractile function and power of skeletal muscle in individuals who have sarcopenia remain incompletely understood. One candidate mechanism is the reduced expression of the adaptor protein Numb in muscle of older organisms. <italic>Numb</italic> mRNA expression is reduced in muscle biopsy samples during normal aging in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Carey et al., 2007</xref>) and Numb protein levels are diminished in skeletal muscle of 24-month-old mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">De Gasperi et al., 2022</xref>). Numb is an adaptor protein that is highly conserved from <italic>Drosophila</italic> to humans. Numb contributes to asymmetric cell division, specification of cell fate, trafficking of cell surface proteins such as integrins, and turnover of signaling molecules such as Notch, Hedgehog, and p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Yan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Pece et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Reichardt and Knoblich, 2013</xref>). A role in mitochondrial fission and fusion has also been suggested in certain contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). In mammals, the <italic>Numb</italic> gene contains 10 exons and is expressed as one of four splice variants. The three shorter variants lack exons 3, 9, or both. Removal of exon 3 shortens the phosphotyrosine binding domain while removal of exon 9 truncates a proline-rich domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Variants of <italic>Numb</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The PCR strategy used to detect <italic>Numb</italic> splice variants is shown.

PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Gastrocnemius muscles were removed at 7 d after left sciatic nerve transection. Differentiated C2C12 cells were harvested at 5 d after transferring cells to differentiation media.

Its expression in satellite cells is critical for their proliferation and for tissue repair after muscle injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">George et al., 2013</xref>). In skeletal muscle fibers, a conditional knockout (cKO) from myofibers of <italic>Numb</italic> and the closely related protein <italic>Numb</italic>-like (<italic>Numbl</italic>) reduced muscle contractility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">De Gasperi et al., 2022</xref>). Examination of muscle from mice with a double knockout of <italic>Numb</italic> and <italic>Numbl</italic> by transmission electron microscope revealed perturbed muscle ultrastructure and altered mitochondrial morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">De Gasperi et al., 2022</xref>). Ultrastructural changes included increased spacing of Z-lines, staircasing of Z-lines, altered mitochondrial morphology, and loss of the regular spacing of sarcoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">De Gasperi et al., 2022</xref>). In vitro experiments using mouse primary myotube cultures found that knockdown (KD) of <italic>Numb</italic> reduced myoblast fusion and mitochondrial function, and delayed caffeine-induced calcium release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">De Gasperi et al., 2022</xref>). A subsequent study found that knockout (KO) of <italic>Numb</italic> in the heart led to cardiac dilation and altered cardiac and skeletal muscle sarcomere structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). Since Numbl protein levels are very low or undetectable in adult skeletal muscle, we have posited that the effects of KO of <italic>Numb</italic> and <italic>Numbl</italic> on skeletal muscle ultrastructure and function are likely attributable to loss of <italic>Numb</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">De Gasperi et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Molecular mechanisms by which <italic>Numb</italic> and <italic>Numbl</italic> organize the sarcomere and assure optimal calcium release during excitation–contraction coupling remain poorly understood.

Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments have shown that Numb binds sarcomeric α-actin and actinin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Wang et al., 2022</xref>) and Numb has been proposed to participate in sarcomere assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). The possibility that Numb binds other proteins present in myofibers has not been tested.</p><p>The goal of the current study was to better understand the molecular mechanisms by which the cKO of <italic>Numb</italic> in skeletal muscle myofibers perturbed muscle weakness. We began by comparing effects of a single knockout (sKO) of <italic>Numb</italic> or a double knockout (dKO) of <italic>Numb</italic> and <italic>Numbl</italic> on ex vivo physiological properties of the <italic>extensor digitorum longus</italic> (EDL) muscle. We then examined Numb protein binding partners in C2C12 myotubes using a combination of immunoprecipitation (IP) and liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) approaches. Our results identify Septins as Numb-binding partners and provide evidence that loss of Numb perturbs the organization of Septin 7 within myofibers.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Effect of <italic>Numb</italic> and <italic>Numb/Numbl</italic> cKO on force generation</title><p>To begin, we compared properties of EDL muscle during ex vivo testing between mice with a single cKO of <italic>Numb</italic> or a double cKO of <italic>Numb</italic> and <italic>Numbl</italic>. As expected, Numb protein levels in muscle lysates were significantly lower in tamoxifen-treated HSA-MCM/<italic>Numb</italic><sup>(f/f)</sup> mice and HSA-MCM/<italic>Numb</italic><sup>(f/f)</sup>/<italic>Numbl</italic><sup>(f/f)</sup> mice at 14 d after starting tamoxifen compared to vehicle-treated mice of the same genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

A single cKO of Numb (HSA-MCM/<italic>Numb</italic><sup>(f/f)</sup> mice) markedly reduced tetanic force and twitch force generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>).

We determined the binding partners for Numb in cells of the myogenic lineage by proteomics analysis of protein complexes isolated by immunoprecipitation using anti-Numb antibodies. For these experiments, we used C2C12 myotubes, which are multinucleated cell syncytia that express actin, myosin, and acetyl choline receptors and can be induced to contract by electrical stimulation. Using the methods described above, we were able to precipitate almost quantitatively Numb proteins when detergent was included in the cell lysis buffer. Yields were low when the detergent was removed, which we infer indicates that in C2C12 myotubes Numb is localized to membranes or is bound to membrane-bound proteins. Due to the incompatibility of LC/MS/MS analysis with most detergents commonly used in protein chemistry, choices of detergent that could be used were limited. After much optimization, we used a buffer containing a reduced amount of Triton-X100 (0.1%) for immunoprecipitation and washed the IP with TBS to remove as much Triton-X100 as possible. We also found that heating the samples at 37°C for 1 hr in 0.3% SDS was a mild yet effective elution method.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, using this method, we were able to immunoprecipitate Numb from 5-day differentiated C2C12 myotubes.

Findings that a single, conditional and inducible KO of <italic>Numb</italic> in skeletal muscle fibers resulted in marked reductions of peak twitch and peak tetanic force that were similar, if not identical, to those observed in a <italic>Numb</italic>/<italic>Numbl</italic> cKO confirm our conclusion that it was loss of <italic>Numb</italic>, rather than <italic>Numbl</italic>, that explained reduced muscle force production during in situ physiological testing in mice with a double <italic>Numb/Numbl</italic> KO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">De Gasperi et al., 2022</xref>). The loss in force-generating capacity of EDL was observed by ex vivo physiological testing as soon as 14 d after the first injection of tamoxifen, indicating that deterioration of muscle in response to depletion of Numb occurs rapidly. These findings do not, formally, test if <italic>Numbl</italic> contributes to homeostasis of adult skeletal muscle fibers, although the very low-level expression of <italic>Numbl</italic> in adult skeletal muscle suggests that a role for this gene is unlikely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">De Gasperi et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Our approach to understanding how <italic>Numb</italic> contributed to the molecular physiology of skeletal muscle contractility relied on LC/MS/MS analysis of tryptic peptides of proteins immunoprecipitated from C2C12 myotubes using an anti-Numb antibody. By applying stringent criteria for identifying putative Numb-binding partners, a total of 11 high-probability Numb-binding proteins representing at least 6 different proteins or protein complexes was identified. None of these proteins were listed among the 209 known Numb-interacting proteins listed on the NCBI webpage for human Numb (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8650#interactions">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8650#interactions</ext-link>). We believe these to be new, high-probability interactions, some of which may have muscle-specific roles.</p><p>The results support the conclusion that Septin 7 is an authentic binding partner of Numb within skeletal muscle fibers based on evidence that Numb pulls down Septin 7 from lysates of C2C12 myotubes, Numb and Septin 7 colocalize within skeletal muscle fibers, and cKO of <italic>Numb</italic> and <italic>Numbl</italic> perturbs the distribution of Septin 7 immunostaining. The identification of three other septins as Numb-binding partners is consistent with the findings that septins form hetero-oligomers that self-organize into fibrils that can polymerize into sheets, filaments, or rings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gönczi et al., 2021</xref>). The co-localization of Numb with Septin 7 is constrained to specific regions of the myofiber suggesting overlapping but distinct functions of each protein in organization of the sarcomere. For example, Septin 7 was detected without Numb immunostaining in several locations, including around the nuclear envelope, and in longitudinal streaks that traverse several sarcomeres. Why these proteins interact at some locations but not others is unclear. Possibilities are that splice variants of Septin 7 vary in their distribution based on proteins they interact with and that only some splice variants bind Numb. It may also be that the interaction of Numb and Septin 7 is through a third yet to be identified protein that is localized near the triad, our proposed localization for Numb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">De Gasperi et al., 2022</xref>). Further study is needed to determine the explanation for the distribution of these two critical proteins.</p><p>Our findings suggest that Numb may also interact with other septins such as Septins 2, 9, and 10, which were also identified with a high level of confidence as Numb-interacting proteins by our LC/MS/MS analysis. Our data do not allow us to determine if Numb binds directly to these septins. Septins contain highly conserved regions, and, consequently, if one such region of Septin 7 interacts with Numb, then many septins would be expected to directly bind Numb through the same domain. However, because septins self-oligomerize, it is possible that when Numb binds to one septin, antibodies against Numb could also pull down other septins present in the septin oligomer to which Numb is bound regardless of whether or not they are also bound by Numb.</p><p>The roles in muscle physiology of Homer3, RUVBL1, Wnk1, and TRAF7 remain uncertain. Homer1, a protein closely related to Homer3, has been implicated in interactions between the Cav1.2 subunit of L-type calcium channels and ryanodine receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huang et al., 2007</xref>) and is expressed in skeletal muscle. Its expression levels also correlate with serum alkaline phosphatase levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sinnott-Armstrong et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). TRAF7 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase regulated by MyoD that ubiquitinates NF-kB targeting it for proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Tsikitis et al., 2010</xref>) to facilitate myogenic differentiation. Zc3hc1 is another E3 ubiquitin ligase highly expressed in skeletal muscle known for its ability to target Cyclin B for proteolysis by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.</p><p>Our interest in the role(s) of Numb in skeletal myofibers was stimulated in part by the findings that its expression at the level of mRNA was reduced in older individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Carey et al., 2007</xref>), a finding we confirmed at the protein level in muscles from C57B6 mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">De Gasperi et al., 2022</xref>). The disorganization of Septin 7 immunostaining observed by day 14 after inducing <italic>Numb</italic> KD suggests that aging-related reduction of Numb expression may perturb organization of Septin 7 in a similar way though this prediction must be tested experimentally.</p><p>In conclusion, Numb binds Septin 7, a ubiquitously expressed protein involved in forming septin-based filaments, sheets, and cages that serve as the ‘fourth component of the cytoskeleton’. The localization of these two proteins near the triad, together with binding of Homer 3 to Numb, strongly suggests that Numb and Septin 7 participate in organizing the triad through specific molecular interactions whose nature remains unclear. The interaction of Numb with septins has direct implications for understanding the molecular physiology of skeletal muscle and broader implications for understanding the roles of Numb and septins in biology.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All animal studies were reviewed and approved by the James J.

Hindlimb muscles were excised after careful blunt dissection. Measurement of whole-muscle contractile and mechanical properties was performed using an Aurora Scientific ex vivo physiology system for mice (Aurora, ON, Canada). A 4–0 silk suture was tied to the proximal and distal tendons of intact right EDL, immediately distal to the aponeuroses, the muscles were dissected and immediately placed in a bath containing a Krebs mammalian Ringer solution at pH 7.4, supplemented with tubocurarine chloride (0.03 mM) and glucose (11 mM) for 10 min. The bath was maintained at 25°C and bubbled constantly with a mixture of O<sub>2</sub> (95%) and CO<sub>2</sub> (5%). The distal tendon of the muscle was then tied to a dual-mode servomotor/force transducer (Aurora Scientific) and the proximal tendon tied to a fixed hook. Using wave pulses delivered from platinum electrodes connected to a high-power bi-phasic current stimulator (Aurora Scientific), each EDL was stimulated to contract. The 610A Dynamic Muscle Control v5.5 software (Aurora Scientific) was used to control pulse properties and servomotor activity, and record data from the force transducer. Optimal length (Lo) was established for each EDL to develop an isometric twitch force. EDL muscles were stimulated with a single electrical pulse to produce a twitch response. Stimulation produced a maximal twitch response by adjusting small increments (or decrements) to longer (or shorter) lengths. Muscle was left resting at least 45 s between twitch responses. Lo was achieved when twitch force was maximal. A frequency–force relationship was established once Lo was achieved. Here, EDL muscles were stimulated at increasing frequencies (i.e., 10, 25, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 150 Hz). Stimulation was delivered for 300 ms, and muscles were left to rest for 1 min between successive stimuli. Maximum absolute isometric tetanic force (Po) was determined from the plateau of the frequency–force relationship. Muscle fatigue resistance during repetitive stimulation at 60 Hz every second for a total of 100 stimuli (fatigue index [FI]) was also evaluated.

In particular, the effects of reduced Numb expression in aging muscle is proposed as a mechanism for reduced contractile function associated with sarcopenia. Using ex-vivo analysis of conditional Numb and Numblike knockout muscle the authors demonstrate that loss of Numb but not the related Numblike gene expression perturbs muscle force generation. In order to explore the molecular mechanisms involved, Numb interacting proteins were identified in C2C12 cell cultured myotubes by immunoprecipitation and LC-MS/MS. The authors identify Septin 7 as well as Septin 2, 9 and 10 as a Numb binding proteins and demonstrate that loss of Numb/Numblike in myofibers causes changes in Septin 7 subcellular localization. Of note, whether additional septins form a complex or are also disrupted by Numb/Numblike loss remains an interesting area for further investigation. Additional investigation of the specificity and mapping of the Numb-Septin 7 (or another Septin) interaction would be of interest and provide an approach for future studies to demonstrate the biological relevance and specificity of the Numb-Septin 7 interaction in skeletal muscle</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89424.4.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>The main purpose of this investigation was to (1) compare the effects of a single knockout (sKO) of Numb or a double knockout (dKO) of Numb and NumbL on ex-vivo physiological properties of the extensor digitorium longus (EDL) muscle in C57BL/6NCrl mice; and (2) analyze protein complexes isolated from C2C12 myotubes via immunoprecipitation and LC/MS/MS for potential Numb binding partners. The main findings are (1) the muscles from sKO and dKO were significantly weaker with little difference between the sKO and dKO lines, indicating the reduced force is mainly due to the inactivation of the Numb gene;

While the specificity of the observed muscle phenotypes seems clear, the subsequent molecular analysis of Numb protein interactors does not seem to consider the potential involvement of Numb-like. The authors should demonstrate the relative expression levels of Numb and Numb-like in the models used, and establish the specificity of the antibodies used in IP, western and staining experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Perhaps the most convincing evidence that the anti-Numb antibody did not pull down Numb-like is that this protein was not detected among immunoprecipitated protein complexes pulled down by the anti-Numb antibody used. The antibody used in the immunoprecipitation was validated by the supplier and was previously reported to immunoprecipitate Numb [1, 2]. We previously demonstrated that a morpholino against Numb mRNA almost completely eliminated the band detected by this antibody and that this band was at the expected molecular weight [ref]. In our hands, mRNA levels for Numb-like in skeletal muscle are 5-10-fold lower than those for Numb [3]. We have been unable to detect Numb-like protein in healthy adult skeletal muscle by immunoblotting or immunofluorescence staining. Taking all of these findings together, it seems unlikely that the antibodies used for immunoprecipitating Numb-protein complexes pulls down Numb-like.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors use PCR to investigate Numb isoform expression and conclude that p65 is likely the dominant protein isoform expressed. While this agrees with the single band observed in Supp Figure 4A, a positive control for exon 9 excluded and included isoforms in the PCR reactions would strengthen this conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: The amplicons shown in Supplemental 4 were sequenced. The clones corresponded to the isoforms with the exon 3 present or removed. No amplicons containing exon 9 were detected. The following sentence was added to the Analysis of Splice Variants section of Methods to address this point: “PCR products were cloned using the TOPO TA cloning system (ThermoFisher) and multiple resulting clones were sequenced to confirm that the expected products were generated.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. PCR analysis of total Numb and Numb-like expression levels are not shown. This is important given the specificity of the Numb antibodies used for AP-MS experiments are not described and some Numb antibodies are well known to also recognize Numb-like. Two different Numb antibodies were used for Western and immunoprecipitation but the specificity for Numb and Numb-like is not described. In particular, does the antibody used in the AP-MS experiment recognize both Numb and Numb-like? Supplementary Table 1 does not list Numb or Numb-like, but presumably peptides were identified?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: As noted above, the specificity of anti-Numb antibodies was confirmed in previous studies [3]. Importantly, Numb-like mRNA levels are 5-10-fold lower than Numb mRNA, and NumbL protein is undetectable in healthy adult skeletal muscle by Western. The physiology data reported in this manuscript supports the conclusion that a single KO of Numb is sufficient to recapitulate the physiological phenotype of Numb/Numb-like KO . We therefore reason that the majority, if not all, of the physiological contribution of these proteins to muscle contractility due to Numb (Fig. 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The validation experiment used the same Numb antibody for immunoprecipitation, immunoblotted with Septin 7. A reciprocal IP of Septin 7 and blotted with Numb should be performed. In addition, a Numb-like IP or immunoblot would also be useful to demonstrate the specificity of the interaction. Efforts to map the interaction between Numb and Septin 7 would be useful to demonstrate specificity of the interaction and strategies to establish the biological relevance of the interaction.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We agree with the reviewer and attempted several IPs with anti-Septin7 antibodies. These were unsuccessful. In a new collaboration, Dr. Italo Cavini (University of Sao Paulo) has used machine-learning-based approaches to model binding between Numb and several septins, including Septin 7. The analysis suggests that binding of Numb with septins involves a domain of Numb that has not yet been ascribed a function in protein-protein interactions. These computational predictions require experimental validation but provide rational starting point for experiments to define the domains responsible for these interactions. Such experiments were included in our recent NIH R01 renewal application. We hope to be able to report on results of confirmatory experiments of these computational models in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Other septins were identified in the AP-MS experiment and might have been anticipated to also be disrupted by Numb/Numb-like deletion. Are these septins known to interact in a complex?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: This is an excellent question. Septins have conserved motifs providing a clear reason to imagine that many different mammalian septins could directly interact with Numb. Septins form heterooligomers consisting of complexes formed by 3, 6 or 8 septins [4]. It is likely that when Numb binds to one septin, antibodies against Numb pull down other septins present in the septin oligomer to which Numb is bound. The following paragraph was added to the discussion: “Our findings suggest that Numb may also interact with other septins such as septins 2, 9 and 10, which were also identified with a high level of confidence as Numb interacting proteins by our LC/MS/MS analysis. Our data to not allow us to determine if Numb binds directly to these septins. Septins contain highly conserved regions, and, consequently, if one such region of septin 7 interacts with Numb, then many septins would be expected to directly bind Numb through the same domain. However, because septins self-oligomerize, is possible that when Numb binds to one septin, antibodies against Numb could also pull down other septins present in the septin oligomer to which Numb is bound regardless of whether or not they are also bound by Numb. “</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The text for Figure 5 describes analysis of Septin localization in inducible Numb/Numb-like cKO muscle, but the figure indicates only Numb is knocked out.
