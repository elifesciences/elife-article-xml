Given their important role in both short-term and long-term coordination of cerebellum-dependent behaviors, it is paramount to understand the factors that determine the output of olivary neurons. Here, we use mouse models to investigate how the inhibitory and excitatory inputs to the olivary neurons interact with each other, generating spiking patterns of olivary neurons that align with their intrinsic oscillations. Using dual color optogenetic stimulation and whole-cell recordings, we demonstrate how intervals between the inhibitory input from the cerebellar nuclei and excitatory input from the mesodiencephalic junction affect phase and gain of the olivary output at both the sub- and suprathreshold level. When the excitatory input is activated shortly (~50 ms) after the inhibitory input, the phase of the intrinsic oscillations becomes remarkably unstable and the excitatory input can hardly generate any olivary spike. Instead, when the excitatory input is activated one cycle (~150 ms) after the inhibitory input, the excitatory input can optimally drive olivary spiking, riding on top of the first cycle of the subthreshold oscillations that have been powerfully reset by the preceding inhibitory input. Simulations of a large-scale network model of the inferior olive highlight to what extent the synaptic interactions penetrate in the neuropil, generating quasi-oscillatory spiking patterns in large parts of the olivary subnuclei, the size of which also depends on the relative timing of the inhibitory and excitatory inputs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>inferior olive</kwd><kwd>gap junctions</kwd><kwd>synaptic activity</kwd><kwd>oscillations</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Netherland Organization for scientific research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NWO- ALW 824.02.001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>De Zeeuw</surname><given-names>Chris I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Dutch Organization for Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZonMW 91120067</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>De Zeeuw</surname><given-names>Chris I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Medical Neuro-Delta</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MD 01092019-31082023</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>De Zeeuw</surname><given-names>Chris I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>INTENSE LSH-NWO</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TTW/00798883</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>De Zeeuw</surname><given-names>Chris I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>ERC-adv</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GA-294775</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>De Zeeuw</surname><given-names>Chris I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>ERC-POC</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>nrs. 737619 and 768914</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>De Zeeuw</surname><given-names>Chris I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Dutch NWO Gravitation Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DBI2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>De Zeeuw</surname><given-names>Chris I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Experimental work and computational models reveal how the timing between the inhibitory and excitatory inputs modulates the function of the inferior olive nucleus, a key structure for motor learning and cognition.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The inferior olive (IO) forms an integral part of the cerebellar system in that it provides all the climbing fibers innervating Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ito, 1984</xref>). Activation of the climbing fiber terminals elicits both short-term and long-term effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">De Zeeuw et al., 2011</xref>). In the short-term, it evokes powerful, all-or-none, depolarizations in Purkinje cells also known as complex spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Thach, 1967</xref>); increases in complex spike activity within cerebellar microzones can facilitate reflex-like movements, such as fast reactive limb movements following a perturbation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">De Gruijl et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hoogland et al., 2015</xref>), but when occurring in more widespread ensembles they also mediate more demanding forms of motor behavior, such as skilled sequences of contractions of tongue muscles upon presentation of specific sensory cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Welsh et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bina et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Romano et al., 2022</xref>). In the more long term, modulation of climbing fiber activity facilitates the induction of various forms of pre- and postsynaptic plasticity at most, if not all, parallel fiber synapses onto interneurons and Purkinje cells in the molecular layer of the cerebellar cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gao et al., 2012</xref>). Due to the fact that these different subcellular effects occur in a synergistic fashion in that they ultimately converge into either a downbound or upbound impact on simple spike activity in the Purkinje cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">De Zeeuw, 2021</xref>), climbing fibers are also prominently implicated in cerebellar learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ito and Kano, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Raymond and Lisberger, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Safo and Regehr, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">ten Brinke et al., 2015</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">ten Brinke et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gutierrez-Castellanos et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boele et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bina et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Romano et al., 2018</xref>). For both the short-term and long-term effects in the cerebellar cortex the precise timing of the climbing fiber activation is crucial. For example, when the synchronization of complex spikes within microzones is enhanced, the latency of subsequent reflex movements will be shortened (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kistler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Van Der Giessen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">De Gruijl et al., 2014a</xref>). Or likewise, depending on the timing of the activity of the climbing fiber input with respect to that of the parallel fiber input, depression or potentiation plasticity mechanisms in Purkinje cells will prevail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">De Zeeuw, 2021</xref>).</p><p>Given the paramount impact of precise timing of climbing fiber activation, it is important to identify the factors that contribute to this process. Classical work by Llinas and Yarom has revealed that olivary neurons are endowed with dendro-dendritic gap junctions as well as ionic conductances that allow them to oscillate in synchrony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Llinas et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sotelo et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Llinás and Yarom, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Llinás and Yarom, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lampl and Yarom, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lampl and Yarom, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Leznik and Llinás, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Choi et al., 2010</xref>). More specifically, olivary neurons can show different types of subthreshold activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Khosrovani et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Turecek et al., 2014</xref>), which can partly be explained at the cellular level by differential expression of Cav 3.1 channels (T-type Ca<sup>+2</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Urbano et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bazzigaluppi and de Jeu, 2016</xref>). Whole-cell recordings in vivo, systems’ extracellular recordings, as well as modeling studies indicate that olivary subthreshold oscillations (STOs) are likely to occur at preferred frequencies below 10 Hz for a limited number of cycles and that the complex spikes ride on this rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sasaki et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bal and McCormick, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blenkinsop and Lang, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chorev et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Choi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lefler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Turecek et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Turecek et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Khosrovani et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Negrello et al., 2019</xref>). Question remains though, how and to what extent the afferents to the olivary neurons modify the intrinsic pattern of STOs and thereby that of their spiking activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Placantonakis et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Best and Regehr, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bazzigaluppi et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bazzigaluppi et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Garden et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Garden et al., 2018</xref>). The vast majority of the axon terminals of the afferents target the dendritic spines located in the olivary glomeruli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sotelo et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Zeeuw et al., 1989</xref>). Many of these spines are electronically coupled by gap junctions and most, if not all, of them receive both an inhibitory and excitatory input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Zeeuw et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">De Zeeuw et al., 1990</xref>). Based upon a theoretical model of excitable spines in such configuration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Segev and Parnas, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Segev and Rall, 1988</xref>), it has been advocated that spike generation of olivary neurons may be highly sensitive to the temporal interval between activation of the inhibitory and excitatory inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">De Zeeuw, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">De Zeeuw et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>Using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of olivary neurons in combination with dual color optogenetics, we set out to test this hypothesis in mice by investigating the temporal response properties of neurons in the principal olive (PO) and rostral medial accessory olive (MAO), both of which receive their monosynaptic, inhibitory and excitatory inputs from the cerebellar nuclei (CN) and mesodiencephalic junction (MDJ), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Zeeuw et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">De Zeeuw et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ruigrok and Voogd, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Apps and Hawkes, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lefler et al., 2014</xref>). Our data indicate that optimal and stable control of olivary spiking behavior indeed strongly depends on the temporal interval between cerebellar inhibition and mesodiencephalic excitation, allowing bidirectional control of firing probability. The sensitivity to this interval is so high that stimulation of the excitatory input at the appropriate moment following inhibition triggers more olivary spikes than stimulation of the excitatory input alone. The in vitro experiments confirmed by simulations running on a realistic model of the mouse IO indicate that this high sensitivity results at least in part from the fact that inhibition induces a strong phase reset of the STOs on top of which the excitatory input can drive the spiking output. Moreover, the simulations of coupled olivary neurons also suggest that the size of the olivary network that is engaged in generating a particular firing pattern also depends on the timing and overlap between both inputs. In short, the relative timing of the inhibitory and excitatory inputs with respect to each other determines the timing of the spiking output of the olivary neurons, gating the impact of their climbing fibers in the cerebellar cortex.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cell physiological properties</title><p>Prior to investigating how IO neurons integrate synaptic inputs, we characterized their physiological properties in sagittal sections of the brainstem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–G</xref>).

Such oscillations, which lasted up to 2.88 s (average duration of 1.8±0.65 s; n=5, N=4), could only be induced if the hyperpolarizing component of the synaptic potential (Vhyp) had a magnitude of at least 1.14 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). On average, the amplitude of the first cycle following stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, lower panel) scaled well with the amplitude of Vhyp (r<sup>2</sup>=0.95; n=5, N=4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, first panel) and was modulated by membrane voltage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). Subsequent cycles showed lower correlation levels (for second and third cycles, r<sup>2</sup>=0.53 and 0.49, respectively; n=5, N=4). Likewise, the latencies to the peak of the rebound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, upper panel) as well as the slope of the rebound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) could to some extent be correlated to Vhyp, even though different categories became apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, second and third panels). Possibly, these categories reflect the differential speeds in desensitizing responses that are mediated by GABAA receptors of different subunit composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Devor et al., 2001</xref>). Together, our findings in IO cells without STOs suggest that CN afferent stimulation induces hyperpolarizing and rebound responses, and that the magnitude of these responses determines the amplitude, latency, and duration of the induced transient oscillations.</p><p>Next, we investigated the impact of CN input on the phase changes (Δφ) of IO neurons with spontaneous STOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). When stimulating CN afferents at various incident phases (φ) of the STO cycle, we extracted two parameters, the slope and Δφ-intercept, from the phase response curve (PRC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). The slope provides a measure of how sensitive phase changes are to the incident phase at which the afferent input arrives, while the Δφ-intercept provides insight into whether stimulus-induced phase changes consist exclusively of phase delays (negative intercepts) or delays and advances (positive intercepts). In the subthreshold regime, CN afferent stimulation acted as a strongly resetting stimulus for oscillating IO neurons and consistently introduced a phase delay for each phase of the cycle (slope = –0.52 ± 0.01, ΔФ-intercept = 0.07 ± 0.01, r<sup>2</sup>=0.86; n=5, N=3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). To estimate the impact on the regularity of phase resetting across trials, we calculated the intertrial phase jitter across three oscillation cycles before and after inhibitory stimulation and compared the standard deviations of the pre- and post-stimulus phase lags (from now on referred to as SDpre-stim and SDpost-stim, respectively). Across trials, intertrial phase jitter was significantly reduced after stimulation (SDpre-stim=59.51 ms, SDpost-stim=20.35 ms, n=15, N=14; p&lt;0.0001, F test), indicating that the stimulus induced nearly identical post-stimulus phase responses across trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and H</xref>). To determine to what extent subthreshold inhibitory stimulation affected STO amplitude, we next quantified the increase in STO amplitude of four post-stimulus cycles relative to a pre-stimulus baseline (set as the average of the amplitude of pre-stimulus cycles). Inhibitory synaptic responses could significantly boost STO amplitude (ΔSTO amplitude of first cycle 4.8±3.7 mV, p&lt;0.0001; second cycle 1.0±1.7 mV, p&lt;0.0001; third cycle 0.57±1.7 mV, p&lt;0.0001; fourth cycle 0.4±1.3 mV, n=24, N=19; p=0.0002, Friedman test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>MDJ input and subthreshold activity of IO neurons</title><p>Olivary synaptic responses to excitatory input from the MDJ are comprised of a depolarization (Vdep) mediated by AMPA and NMDA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mathy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Turecek et al., 2014</xref>), followed by a hyperpolarization (Vhyp), mediated by both HCN and SK channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Garden et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Garden et al., 2018</xref>). If sufficiently large, this hyperpolarization also drives a rebound depolarization (Vreb) mediated by HCN and T-type calcium channels, which can reach threshold to initiate a spike. MDJ afferents in the IO were stimulated either electrically or with the use of optogenetics in slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In case of electrical stimulation (100 µs pulses, 0.1–1.2 mA), a bipolar stimulation electrode was placed in the medial tegmental tract, which contains the fibers that descend from the MDJ to the IO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ruigrok and Voogd, 1995</xref>). For optogenetics, AAV-Syn-Chronos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Klapoetke et al., 2014</xref>) was injected in the MDJ and stimulation (1 ms light pulses, 0.6–1.7 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>) was done at least 4 weeks post-transduction when the medial and principal olivary subnuclei showed a clear innervation of labeled afferents from the MDJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). With both approaches stimulation of MDJ afferents could readily elicit triphasic synaptic potentials in non-oscillating IO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and C</xref>); in virtually all cases these potentials comprised a Vdep, Vhyp, and Vreb component, as highlighted above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). The synaptic potentials evoked by electrical stimulation had shorter latency onsets than those evoked by light stimulation (p&lt;0.0001, Mann-Whitney U test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), but otherwise both types of stimulation evoked similar responses. In general, stimulation of MDJ afferents could only trigger STOs in intrinsically silent IO neurons when Vhyp was larger than ~3 mV. The duration of these transient oscillations (1.3±0.64 s, ranging from 0.44 s to 2.36 s) was on average significantly shorter (p=0.005, unpaired t-test; n=6, N=5) than those occurring upon stimulation of the CN afferents. Moreover, with both electrical and optogenetic stimulation, the amplitude of Vdep scaled linearly with stimulus strength, whereas Vhyp and Vreb scaled with stimulation strength in a slightly less linear manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>). Likewise, the half-widths of the three components were comparable following either type of stimulation (for Vdep p=0.84; for Vhyp p=0.62; and for Vreb p=0.085, unpaired t-test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Like the olivary responses to CN input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), the amplitude and slope of the first cycle following MDJ stimulation scaled with the size of the preceding hyperpolarization (first cycle: r<sup>2</sup>=0.92 and 0.93, respectively; n=8, N=7) and was modulated by membrane voltage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C and D</xref>). The latency to peak (rebound peak) was inversely related to the hyperpolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). However, the amplitudes of the second and third cycles of the elicited oscillations correlated weakly with the amplitude of Vhyp (r<sup>2</sup>=0.26 and 0.04, respectively), reflecting a higher level of variability in the responses to MDJ stimulation relative to CN stimulation. Accordingly, the transient STOs that occurred in the silent or ‘non-oscillating’ IO cells upon MDJ stimulation also showed a relatively high level of variability of their phase values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Indeed, it should be noted that CN stimulation had a stronger and more consistent impact on resetting the phase of the oscillations in such cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Responses of oscillating and non-oscillating neurons in the inferior olive to stimulation of excitatory afferents from the mesodiencephalic junction (MDJ).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) To stimulate neurons in the principal olive (PO) and medial accessory olive (MAO), we used either direct electrical stimulation of the central and medial tegmental tract, respectively (top panel), or optogenetic stimulation following injection of Chronos-eYFP into the MDJ (bottom panel).

Moreover, MDJ stimulation induced a relatively weak, yet significant, increase of the amplitude of the post-stimulus oscillation cycles in these cells (ΔSTO amplitude of first cycle 1.52±3.0 mV, p&lt;0.0001; second cycle 0.60±2.0 mV, p&lt;0.0001; third cycle 0.37±1.7 mV, p=0.01; fourth cycle 0.5±3.69 mV, p=0.0119; Friedman test, n=26, N=19), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>).

Instead, when AMPA receptors were blocked with CNQX all three components were prominently reduced (Vdep: 22.9 ± 12.18%, p&lt;0.0001; Vhyp: 21.2 ± 19.7%, p&lt;0.0001; Vreb: 10.8 ± 12.6%, p&lt;0.0001; n=8, N=8, paired t-test).

These data establish that stimulation of excitatory MDJ afferents results in synaptic potentials that are predominantly mediated by glutamate receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Zeeuw et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Garden et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Network model recapitulates STOs’ responses to CN and MDJ inputs in isolation</title><p>In this work we have extended the IO model from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Negrello et al., 2019</xref>, by scaling the number of cells to capture the murine MAO, comprising over a thousand cells with inhibitory and excitatory arborizations from the CN and MDJ, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Vrieler et al., 2019</xref>).

We therefore set out to stimulate CN and MDJ afferents at different intervals with respect to each other and investigated the impact of the stimulus patterns on individual olivary cells. We used two different combinations, both of which allowed us to stimulate the CN and MDJ afferents independently in the same preparation; either we used two different viral vectors with different opsins (AAV-ChrimsonR-tdTomato and AAV-Chronos-eYFP for targeting the CN and MDJ in C57BL/6 mice, respectively) or we combined intrinsic expression of one opsin (for targeting the CN in Gad2-IRES-Cre × Ai32 RCL-ChR2(H134R)/EYFP transgenic mice) with electrical stimulation of the medial tegmental tract (for targeting MDJ fibers in the same mice) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

The spontaneous firing frequency of olivary cells in vitro depended on the membrane potential in that firing frequency tended to increase as membrane voltage was more depolarized (firing frequency from –56 to –51 mV: 0.057±0.066 Hz, n=9; N=9; from –51 to –46 mV: 0.083±0.086 Hz, n=18, N=15; from –46 to –41 mV: 0.20±0.11 Hz, n=5, N=5).</p><p>In general, CN stimulation exerts a strong hyperpolarizing effect in IO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), preventing spike generation. Indeed, in most cells (6 out of 7) an additional depolarizing current step (580.1±293.9 pA) was required to reduce the membrane potential to an average of –40.24±9.52 mV (n=6, N=6) and elicit one or more spikes. Only in one instance (1 out of 7) we could trigger spiking activity in the absence of a depolarizing current step; this event, which occurred at a membrane potential of –56.25±0.52 mV, probably resulted from a relatively strong secondary rebound component in the inhibitory synaptic response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The spikes driven by CN afferent stimulation (most of them in conjunction with a depolarizing current step) exhibited PRCs with a slope (–0.54±0.04, r<sup>2</sup>=0.78; n=8, N=7) similar to that of the subthreshold responses to CN stimulation (p=0.68, ANCOVA), but their ΔФ-intercepts (0.15±0.02, n=8, N=7) were significantly different (p&lt;0.0001, ANCOVA) in that the inhibition-triggered spikes could cause both phase advances and delays (compare second panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). The change in intertrial phase jitter of spiking activity after CN stimulation (ΔSDpost-pre-CN_supra = –22.95; n=7, N=6) was significantly different (p&lt;0.0001, F test) from that of the CN stimulation evoking subthreshold synaptic responses (ΔSDpost-pre of CN subthreshold stimulation = –39.16). Inhibition-driven suprathreshold responses like their subthreshold counterparts increased the post-stimulus STO amplitude, decrementing sequentially across the consecutive cycles (ΔSTO amplitude first cycle: 4.04±3.19 mV, p&lt;0.0001; second cycle: 2.89±2.79 mV, p&lt;0.0001; third cycle: 2.72±3.04 mV, p&lt;0.0001; fourth cycle: 2.5±2.93 mV, p&lt;0.0001; n=7, N=6, Friedman test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

We selected spikes for each condition evoked with the same current pulses (760±106.9 pA, range: 600–900 pA, for both conditions) and a comparable average membrane potential prior to stimulation (CN spikes: –36.26±3.75 mV, n=4, N=4; MDJ spikes: –36.92 mV ±4.86 mV, n=4; p=0.30, paired t-test).

We tested this in the realistic large-scale network model of the MAO highlighted above (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Negrello et al., 2019</xref>). Aiming at a realistic reconstruction of the interaction between incoming arborizations, model neurons were placed in a network according to locations derived from anatomical annotations of the MAO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Vrieler et al., 2019</xref>; Marylka Uusisaari, Nora Vrieler, and Nick Medvedev, unpublished data made available with the model). In the network, gap junctions between cells in the olivary network were established probabilistically as a function of proximity where cells within a radius of 120 μm were allowed to make connections. Conductances were randomized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>) and the resulting network was tuned to reproduce the observed proportion of oscillators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>When we studied the amplitude of oscillations and phase differences between stimulated and non-stimulated groups, we observed the same features as observed in the experiments; indeed, the characteristic features emerged from both simulations of single cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) and of the entire murine IO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>). Resetting of subthreshold activity and spike generation were more prominently affected at the preferred interval where MDJ excitation occurred one STO cycle after inhibition (note that the cycle in the model network is closer to 8 Hz; the preferred interval was 100 ms), than when inhibition or excitation occurred in isolation (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). The network responses including spiking probability and phase resetting also closely followed the pattern of changes in amplitude of the STOs in that the lowest and highest levels were reached with the combinations of the inhibitory and excitatory inputs occurred at the appropriate cycle intervals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>). To examine the result of interactions between converging GABAergic and AMPA inputs in detail, we swept over a set of intervals between inhibition and excitation pulses and recorded amplitude of rebound and synchrony levels over time. When focal stimulation of the excitatory input to a group of cells occurred one cycle after inhibition onset (cycle T=120 ms, 8 Hz), the network produced the highest amplitude of rebound, largest spiking probability and effective phase resets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref>). For most stimulus intervals, combined stimulation detached the oscillation of the stimulated group, which could last for over a second (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig8video1 fig8video2">Figure 8—videos 1 and 2</xref>). This effect was also evident when comparing the evolution of phase distributions of cells in the network for the different intervals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). When network cells received a modicum of stochastic input (i.e., according to an Ornstein Uhlenbeck process, with a mean of 0 pA and an SD of 0.2 pA), the resetting effects on the oscillations were less prominent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig8video3">Figure 8—video 3</xref>), indicating that a network under normal awake conditions is unlikely to be synchronous for longer periods.

Here, we present the first systematic investigation on the effects of combined inhibition and excitation on STOs and spike probability of IO neurons, elucidating how inhibitory GABAergic afferents from the CN and excitatory glutamatergic afferents from the MDJ together control phase and amplitude of these oscillations and thereby their spike timing. Our data show that stimulation of the inhibitory input generates a powerful phase resetting of the STOs of IO neurons, and that subsequent stimulation of their excitatory input one oscillation cycle later optimizes the probability to maximally depolarize the cell and generate a spike. In contrast, excitation following inhibition by only several tens of milliseconds minimizes depolarization as well as spike generation. These maximum and minimum spike probabilities following combined stimulations of the inhibitory and excitatory olivary inputs at specific intervals are relatively high and low, respectively, highlighting the sensitivity to and relevance of interval timing of both inputs in olivary gate control.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Olivary responses to CN and MDJ stimulation</title><p>Our data elucidate how activation of afferents presented to the IO, either independently or jointly at varying intervals, affect STO amplitude, phase and spike probability. Inhibitory sub- and suprathreshold synaptic responses triggered by CN afferents and suprathreshold excitatory activity triggered by MDJ afferents affect STO amplitude and reset their phase, albeit with different effects with regard to their strength and timing; CN inhibition prominently resets to trough and suprathreshold MDJ excitation moderately resets to peak. By contrast, subthreshold excitatory synaptic responses following MDJ stimulation evoke smaller amplitude changes, weaker phase resetting, and a higher intertrial phase jitter of the STOs. In line with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Leznik et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Best and Regehr, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bazzigaluppi et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bazzigaluppi et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lefler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Turecek et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Turecek et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Garden et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Garden et al., 2018</xref>), we show that stimulation of either CN or MDJ afferents in vitro elicits transient STOs in a subset of non-oscillating neurons with the hyperpolarizing component of the synaptic response directly affecting the phase and amplitude of such induced oscillations. These findings may well also hold in intact animals, since cell-attached and whole-cell recordings of inferior olivary neurons in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chorev et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Khosrovani et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Van Der Giessen et al., 2008</xref>) as well as multiple single unit recordings of complex spike activity of ensembles of Purkinje cells in awake behaving animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Negrello et al., 2019</xref>) indicate that a significant fraction of ‘silent’ olivary neurons can be ‘awakened’ and start to oscillate, depending on the status of the peripheral input.</p><p>When the CN and MDJ afferents are stimulated jointly, the effects are contingent on interstimulus interval, with differential effects on oscillation amplitude, resetting of phase, direction of phase change (either advanced or delayed), post-stimulus intertrial phase jitter, as well as spike probability. We tested a range of stimulus intervals and found that when afferent stimulation of excitatory MDJ input occurs around 150 ms after inhibitory CN afferent stimulation (i.e., ~1 phase cycle), the oscillation phase is strongly reset and the probability to generate an olivary complex spike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crill, 1970</xref>) is significantly increased. By contrast, when MDJ afferents are stimulated 50 ms after inhibition, STOs show poor resetting with a high level of jitter and complex spike generation is suppressed. These data suggest that the IO in general sets permissive time windows during which its afferents can suppress or facilitate complex spike generation, and that the pre-existing beat of these intrinsic windows can be overruled in a most dominant fashion when MDJ excitation follows CN inhibition by approximately 1 phase cycle of the post-CN stimulus STO.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Prediction based on cyto-architecture of olivary neuropil</title><p>The olivary neuropil is characterized by the so-called glomeruli, which comprise a core of dendritic spines that are coupled by dendrodendritic gap junctions and surrounded by axon terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nĕmecek and Wolff, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bowman and King, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sotelo et al., 1974</xref>). Ultrastructural 3D analysis of olivary neurons in the PO and rostral MAO following the use of a combination of intracellular labeling with double or triple labeling of afferents indicates that each and every spine of the entire dendritic arbor is innervated by both an inhibitory and excitatory input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Zeeuw et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">De Zeeuw et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">De Zeeuw, 1990</xref>). Moreover, the vast majority of both the inhibitory and excitatory afferents terminates onto these spines within the glomeruli. Given that there are only very few local interneurons in the IO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">De Zeeuw, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fredette et al., 1992</xref>), this dominant configuration implies that the interaction between the inhibitory and excitatory inputs onto the electronically coupled spines over time is likely to play an important role in IO function. In line with theoretical models of excitable dendritic spines that receive both an inhibitory and an excitatory input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Segev and Parnas, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Segev and Rall, 1988</xref>), it has been advocated that the inputs from the CN and the MDJ onto the dendritic spines of IO neurons control the occurrence of their spikes in a highly timing-sensitive manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">De Zeeuw, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">De Zeeuw et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Gruijl et al., 2014b</xref>). Our cell physiological data shown here indicate that the cyto-architectonic organization of the olivary neuropil and its inputs indeed appears properly designed to generate well-timed STOs and action potentials in IO neurons, and that the phase and timing of these events strongly depend on the moments when the inhibitory and excitatory inputs are activated with respect to each other. Via their interactions over time, phase and spike timing of IO neurons can be both delayed and advanced, the reliability of the periodicity of their occurrences can be controlled, and the size of the cluster of olivary neurons in which these processes take place can be spatially regulated.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>How inhibitory or excitatory input in isolation affect spiking probability and STOs</title><p>The prominent impact of combined activation of the afferents from the CN and MDJ at the one cycle interval (i.e., CN inhibition followed by MDJ excitation one STO cycle later) in oscillating IO cells appears dominant in that the spike generation occurs, in the vast majority of trials, largely independent from the phase of the pre-existing STO at the moment of the initial inhibition provided by the GABAergic input from the CN. In fact, the combined activation at such an interval usually leads to a higher generation of spikes even when there is no pre-existing STO at all. However, the relative impact of the pre-existing phase and amplitude of the STO on spiking is greater when the MDJ afferents are stimulated in isolation. Indeed, under this condition activation of MDJ afferents virtually only leads to spiking when stimulation is presented near the peak of an oscillation (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Leznik et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Khosrovani et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Van Der Giessen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Garden et al., 2017</xref>). Likewise, the impact of the phase of a pre-existing STO is significant when the CN afferents are stimulated in isolation in that this will determine to what extent the inhibition will delay the subsequent phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).</p><p>The impact of CN input on STOs differs substantially from that of MDJ input. STOs induced by CN input have on average a smaller Vhyp, possibly due to the flooring effect of HCN channels, while STOs induced by MDJ input show a more depolarized resting membrane potential. Despite these differences, the STOs induced by CN input slightly, but significantly, outlast those induced by MDJ input. This might be due to the prominent impact of CN afferents on phase resetting as well as to their asynchronous release of GABA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Best and Regehr, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Turecek and Regehr, 2019</xref>), which together promote a more effective resetting and thereby also persistence of oscillations. These effects are indeed also observed in the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The relatively mild phase resetting and amplitude boost of the MDJ excitation-driven synaptic responses may be related to the conductances that are recruited during their hyperpolarizing phase. Whereas the hyperpolarizing component triggered by CN input is mediated by GABAAR-activated currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Devor et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lefler et al., 2014</xref>), that triggered by MDJ input is mediated by SK and HCN channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bal and McCormick, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Marshall and Lang, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Garden et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Garden et al., 2018</xref>). These channels might be partially inactivated in oscillating neurons during their relatively large membrane depolarizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Milligan et al., 2006</xref>), reducing the impact of the excitation-mediated Vhyp.</p><p>Interestingly, the release of both GABA and glutamate may also affect the STOs indirectly by their local impact on the level of electrotonic coupling in the olivary glomeruli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lefler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mathy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Turecek et al., 2014</xref>). For example, repetitive release of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA from the cerebellar terminals at the olivary spines can reduce the level of coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lang et al., 1996</xref>), possibly by shunting the spines with their relatively long necks from the dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Llinas et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">De Zeeuw et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">De Zeeuw, 1990</xref>), and thereby transiently reduce the strength of the STOs both in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lefler et al., 2014</xref>) and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lang, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bazzigaluppi et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bazzigaluppi et al., 2012b</xref>). Moreover, given the prominent glial sheaths surrounding the core of innervated and coupled dendrites inside the glomeruli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">De Zeeuw et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">De Zeeuw, 1990</xref>) and given the observed long-lasting GABAergic effects on the hyperpolarization of IO neurons in both the experimental and modeling data, enduring entrapment of GABA in the glomeruli for about 60 ms may also contribute. Thus, even though a single stimulation of the CN pathway can induce or reset STOs robustly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), repetitive stimulation may scramble the activity for a relatively long period, rendering a quasiperiodic oscillator network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Negrello et al., 2019</xref>). Likewise, depending on the duration and frequency of stimulation, the local impact of the excitatory glutamatergic afferents on the level of dendrodendritic coupling in the glomeruli varies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mathy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Turecek et al., 2014</xref>), which in turn will affect the presence and strength of the STOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Gruijl et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Negrello et al., 2019</xref>). The potential impact of coupling on STOs following MDJ stimulation is supported by the finding that application of gap junction antagonists reduces excitation-mediated hyperpolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Garden et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, the impact of either CN or MDJ input on olivary oscillations is rich and dynamic, even when they do not occur conjunctively in a particular pattern.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Cause and consequence of minimal and maximal IO firing</title><p>We show that when excitation follows inhibition by 50 ms and hits the peak of the hyperpolarizing component of the CN synaptic response, the STO amplitude boost is small, likely as a result of the depolarization-driven deactivation of HCN channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bal and McCormick, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Milligan et al., 2006</xref>). The HCN channel conductance is activated at the trough of an oscillation and facilitates the initiation of a new STO cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Garden et al., 2018</xref>). For this interval, the weaker impact on the post-stimulus phase could derive from the weak amplitude boost of the first cycle of the oscillation. The most obvious explanation for the reduced spike probability at this interval is that excitatory synaptic responses are time-wise furthest away from spike threshold given that excitation arrives at the trough of the hyperpolarizing component of the inhibitory response. Importantly, this sequence can bring the firing frequency below that of spontaneous activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, bottom panel).</p><p>Conversely, excitation that follows inhibition by 150 ms is most conducive to spike generation, as excitation is presented around the peak of the rebound component of the inhibitory response, which further brings the cell to spike threshold. Irrespective of whether a spike is elicited or not during an interval where excitation follows inhibition by about one cycle, larger phase shifts occur for any given phase at which the stimuli arrive, as reflected in the steeper slope of the PRC. Furthermore, in contrast to the other intervals for dual inputs or for that matter single input stimulation, which all have ΔФ-intercept values that are either close to zero or negative and thus incur phase delays, the ΔФ-intercept for presentation of inhibition and subsequent excitation 150 ms later shows a pronounced positive ΔФ-intercept. Thus, following combined stimulation the phase can be either delayed or advanced depending on when nucleo-olivary and mesodiencephalic inputs hit the phase of the ongoing oscillation, thereby endowing the IO with a temporal interval that tunes phase shifts in both directions. For the same proxy one-cycle interval we find that if spikes are elicited the intertrial phase jitter is strongly reduced, whereas this phase jitter is increased in the absence of spikes. The effect of spiking on reducing phase variability might be explained by synergistic mechanisms in which decoupling caused by long-lasting inhibition is potentiated by spikes driven by MDJ inputs, which if triggered close to threshold at low firing frequency may in turn also lead to a decreased coupling strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mathy et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Functional implications of timing sensitivity between inhibitory and excitatory inputs</title><p>Our findings on the effects of combined CN inhibition and MDJ excitation on IO STOs and spike probability support the idea that the close proximity of excitatory and inhibitory inputs on electrically coupled dendritic spines endow olivary neurons with a gating mechanism that allows for increases or decreases of their firing based on specific combinations of their inhibitory and excitatory inputs over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Segev and Parnas, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Segev and Rall, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">De Zeeuw et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">De Zeeuw, 2021</xref>). We show that inhibitory and excitatory synaptic responses have both hyperpolarizing and depolarizing components, which make them suitable to modify subthreshold and suprathreshold activity when triggered at specific time intervals. Given that these features were also replicated in our network model and that the size of olivary clusters with sub-cycle phase differences could also be controlled by the inhibitory and excitatory inputs in this model, it is attractive to hypothesize that the IO circuitry may allow for phase-based computing that is under control of the synaptic inputs from the CN and MDJ. Such analog computing system can facilitate the generation of a complex array of properly sequenced actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Holden et al., 2017</xref>), in which the sequence of events can be maintained at a variety of speeds or frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jacobson et al., 2009</xref>). Indeed, in line with the findings from our olivary network model, systems recordings of complex spike activity in the cerebellar cortex using chronically implanted multi-electrode arrays in freely moving rats indicate that the different IO clusters may be able to generate olivary oscillations with subtle phase differences, supporting intervals shorter than the cycle period, and to maintain these oscillations at a constant phase difference across large global changes in frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jacobson et al., 2009</xref>). Accordingly, the patterns of complex spike activity can be related to ongoing reflex-like behavior and associative sensorimotor behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Welsh et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Van Der Giessen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">De Gruijl et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hoogland et al., 2015</xref>), and disturbing these patterns at the sub-cycle range can affect the latencies of these motor behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kistler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Van Der Giessen et al., 2008</xref>). The IO may thus underlie not only rhythmic activity and synchronization, but also temporal patterning that requires CN-MDJ intervals at various cycle durations and that may enable the olivo-cerebellar system to gate temporal patterns at different rates without distortion, facilitating execution of the same behavioral task at different speeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Welsh et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ozden et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">De Gruijl et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hoogland et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lawrenson et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In addition to online control of temporal patterns of complex spike activity that may facilitate ongoing coordination of sensorimotor behavior and/or cognitive functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Welsh et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hoogland et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Romano et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Romano et al., 2022</xref>), increases and decreases of complex spike activity are also critical for cerebellar motor learning in that they facilitate induction of long-term depression and potentiation at the parallel fiber to Purkinje cell synapses, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ito and Kano, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schonewille et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gutierrez-Castellanos et al., 2017</xref>) as well as opposite plasticity at the synapses of the molecular layer interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gao et al., 2012</xref>).

All data and charts are expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Membrane voltage, Vm, was determined as the average of the voltage baselines preceding the current steps used for the I-V curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). When measuring the spontaneous spiking as a function of Vm, membrane voltage was taken as the average of a spontaneous activity trace (231±153 s, ranging from 22 to 599 s). Rn was measured as the slope of the linear part of the I-V curve. For the I-V curve, current steps were typically provided from –0.4 nA to 1 nA. The linear part of the curve was usually between –0.4 nA and 0.1 nA. Phase values are predominantly presented as measurements of the PRC (for details, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) and as their lag distribution. Phases of STOs were extracted using DAMOCO MATLAB toolbox, from which phase lags were calculated based on the coupled oscillator approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kralemann et al., 2008</xref>) across trials for three cycles before and after stimulation.

When multiple normally distributed groups were compared, a one-way ANOVA test is followed by a post hoc uncorrected Fisher’s LSD multiple comparison test. Otherwise, for unpaired data, Kruskal-Wallis test followed by uncorrected post hoc Dunn’s test was used, or in case of paired data a Friedman test followed by post hoc uncorrected Dunn’s test.

In short, the model is a reconstruction of the olivary MAO network, constituted by three-compartment Hodgkin-Huxley type cell models (soma, axon, dendrite), where model cells were placed according to annotated somata positions (kindly made available by Marylka Yoe Uusisaari, Nora Vrieler, and Nicholas Medvedev). Olivary cells in the reconstructed network followed a homogeneous connectivity. This is despite evidence that these cells are clustered, but it is a parsimonious assumption compatible with the questions of this study. We applied a probability of connectivity specifying a mean degree of 10 connections per cell. Cells were allowed to connect to cells in other neighboring cells within a radius of 120 µm. The electrotonic conductance across gap junctions of connected cells in our model was randomly picked beween 0 and 0.03 mS/cm<sup>2</sup> so that maximum coupling coefficients would be around 10% (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">De Zeeuw et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">De Zeeuw et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schweighofer et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Gruijl et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Latorre et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Conductance parameters of the olivary cells models were randomized to create observed levels of variability in STO properties (e.g., amplitude, frequency, ADHD) and a large variety of possible neighborhoods. We used uniform random distributions within a range (rather than gaussians) to create disparate parameter ranges and highly heterogeneous cell behavior. As these are high dimensional spaces from which we draw, this results in a broad class of model neurons. The network oscillation was largely governed by the interaction between calcium channels (v 1.3 and v3.1), BK and SK channel models. Conductance ranges were selected to cover the observed variety of neuronal responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bazzigaluppi and de Jeu, 2016</xref>). Networks were tuned to produce 30–70% of intrinsically oscillating cells, covering the ranges reported in the literature (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). Cell parameterizations were created with the function ‘CreateDefaultNeurons.m’.</p><p>For the network inputs we designed a subset of cells in the center of the network with ‘GABA’ and ‘AMPA’ currents being delivered to the dendrites of the modeled cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">De Zeeuw et al., 1998</xref>).

ultimately playing critical roles in controlling motor coordination and plasticity. Using transgenic mice or optogenetic techniques to independently control a major excitatory and inhibitory pathway to the inferior olive, the authors show solid evidence that the probability and phase of olivary neuron output depend critically on the relative timing of excitation and inhibitory inputs. Network models predict that appropriately timed excitatory and inhibitory input patterns efficiently synchronize larger clusters of inferior olivary neurons, raising the possibility that input timing can gate the output of the motor commands. These valuable findings have the potential to impact the field's understanding of sensorimotor processing.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83239.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Colgin</surname><given-names>Laura L</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00hj54h04</institution-id><institution>University of Texas at Austin</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.09.04.506491">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.04.506491v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

In figure 7C an interval of 50ms seems to be extremely efficient in activating the neuron and resetting the oscillations, which is not in line with the main experimental (Figure 5D) or theoretical (Figure 4) results. Figure 8 is difficult to follow and its main input to the study is not clear. Is it the change in the number of affected neurons as a function of the interval?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This study combines the use of transgenic mice, optogenetic approaches, and patch-clamp recordings in slices to examine the interplay between specific excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs and intrinsic oscillations in neurons of the inferior olive. Through analyses of the response phase and amplitude, the authors show convincingly that excitation has an especially powerful effect on response amplitude and firing when it occurs during post-inhibitory rebound. These findings build on many previous studies of this circuitry and are perhaps not surprising from a mechanistic point of view. However, the value of the work is derived from both the specificity achieved in selectively activating known sources of inhibition and excitation and also the thorough and systematic analyses the authors employ to examine the complex interactions between synaptic inputs and intrinsic voltage-gated conductances. Overall the study could be better supported in places, as documented below but provides a significant advance in understanding the circuitry underlying sensorimotor coordination.</p><p>1. The presentation of health criteria for cells and the quality of recordings needs improvement. Membrane potentials are reported for both oscillating and non-oscillating cells, including an average and a range. This is a straightforward measurement for non-oscillating cells but not for oscillators. Presumably, the authors are simply averaging out the oscillations over a long time frame but this should be spelled out explicitly. Resting potentials of -40 mV would seem to be quite depolarized for a healthy neuron for either category and the variation in Vm across cells (nearly 27 mV) seems enormous.</p><p>2. The authors need to present the criteria for rejecting recordings on the basis of health, or the value of series resistance compensation, both of which are unaddressed currently. It would also be important to report whether there was a correlation between average membrane potential and the magnitude of intrinsic oscillations for the relevant cells. It would be expected that the average Vm of cells would strongly affect the relative balance between excitatory and inhibitory currents as well as their interactions with voltage-gated ion channels.</p><p>3. Related to the previous comment, the authors should report in the Methods whether membrane potentials reported are corrected for the electrode junction potential, as well as the value of that potential.</p><p>4. It would be helpful in the Discussion if there was more attention paid to the natural firing patterns of inputs, and what physiological conditions might produce different time separations between excitatory and inhibitory inputs.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The oscillations in these cells are known to be highly voltage-dependent due to T-type Ca channels and h channels. Therefore, there is no surprise for the effects of inhibitory and excitatory inputs in altering the STOs. The main novelty of the findings in this paper involves the quantification of how the inputs affect the IO neurons. That said, there are numerous questions that the authors should address, some minor and some more significant.</p><p>Specific suggestions:</p><p>1. How were Vm and Rn measured? No details are given. Because both CaT and h channels are active at rest, how they were measured and then compared among cells is very important.</p><p>2. Although presumably CN and MDJ inputs are monosynaptic, some mention of this and whether there are any connections among IO neurons other than electrical would be helpful for readers outside of the field.</p><p>3. The rebound from a hyperpolarization is highly voltage-dependent. You can't just measure the amplitude from the baseline without knowing the voltage at the baseline and the voltage of the prior hyperpolarization. The rebound should be plotted as a function of the voltage of the prior hyperpolarization.</p><p>4. In figures 2C and 3C there are no scale bars for either x or y axes.</p><p>5. In Suppl Figure 1, were the synaptic blockers added sequentially and thus additive, or are the responses shown from only a single blocker?</p><p>6. No figure was provided for the effect of PTX on CN inputs. This should be included. Also, why didn't 100uM PTX fully block the inhibition? Some ideas for this would be useful.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;How inhibitory and excitatory inputs gate output of the inferior olive&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Laura Colgin (Senior Editor).</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have even less confidence in the rigor of the electrophysiology than I did in the previous version. I asked:</p><p>1. For details on Vm and Rn. The response for Vm was ok, but not Rn. Where is the linear portion of the I-V curve (actually it should be called a V-I) curve? No V-I is shown so I have no idea whether there was a linear portion and what the rest of the V-I plots look like.</p><p>2. Details about rebound being v. dependent. They now show plots, and indeed rebound varied 2-4 fold depending on Vm, but as far as I can tell, none of this was used in their analyses such as in Figure 2 and elsewhere.</p><p>3. I asked about 100uM PTX. They now show data from what appears to be one cell but claim that &quot;reanalysis&quot; indicated a complete block in 5 of 5. Where are the data?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83239.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Some additional analyses and figures are necessary to support the major conclusions.

PTX and CNQX were added in all cells (8 in total), whereas APV could only be successfully added in 4 out of 8 cells, due to the relatively long duration of the required recordings (&gt;80 mins).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e) A figure should be provided to show the effect of PTX on CN inputs.

However, upon re-analysis of all cells we found that the 2 cells with a seemingly suboptimal inhibition had irregular oscillations with high noise that distorted the outcome and conclusions. Taking this into consideration, careful re-inspection of individual traces revealed that inhibitory synaptic responses were in fact absent for all 5 out of 5 cells.

The authors should explain whether there was a correlation between average membrane potential and the magnitude of intrinsic oscillations for the relevant cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added the criteria to the Methods sections. Our criteria to reject cells were based on stability and access resistance value where cells typically showed access resistance values of less than 20 MΩ (on average 14.09 ± 8.74 MΩ (n=93) with 81% of cells ≤ 20 MΩ; 17% &gt; 20 MΩ and &lt; 40 MΩ; 2% &gt; 40 MΩ and &lt; 60 MΩ). If the recordings showed an access resistance of &gt; 40 MΩ and/or the baseline was unstable for &gt; 5 minutes the recording was rejected.</p><p>With respect to the correlation between average membrane potential and the magnitude of intrinsic oscillations, the distribution was virtually identical to what is observed in the model (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Notably, there is an entire upper triangular part of the scatter that has no data points. This feature of the distribution of data points is explainable by the non-linear effect of Calcium low threshold (CaT) conductance on mean membrane potential, the upper triangle is void of data points, because oscillations amplitude is a function of CaT, which impacts mean membrane potential. Please find the new supplementary figure for model cells, copied below for convenience.</p><p>The Pearson R is also very close (0.2224 for experiment vs 0.22798 for the model). Though the p-value for the experiment was over 0.05 (experimental p-value = 0.066), there appears to be a trend. Both STO and mean membrane potential were measured during spontaneous activity.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-83239-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>i).

Is it the change in the number of affected neurons as a function of the interval?</p></disp-quote><p>Though this is not evident in the current version of the manuscript, this entire study originated with the observation that modeling predicts the phase responses from both types of input and thus predicted their interaction and consequences to network dynamics. The network model extrapolates from the individual cell data and produces predictions about the behavior of the network in a functional setting (see e.g., new Supplement figure –Figure 8—figure supplement 2- with network responses under perturbation). The ways in which the model is in line with the experimental data and which predictions it makes is now better explained in the Results and Discussion.</p><p>The main purpose of the model is to extend our understanding of the interaction between synaptic arborizations in the olive with the ongoing subthreshold oscillation in a network setting. We had also keenly noticed the 50 ms difference. We find that this difference is mostly dependent on properties of the GABA response – we had originally used exclusively a dendritic GABA, whereas now we use a combination of dendritic and somatic GABA, which leads to better alignment with the experimental data, and we include an enduring entrapment mechanism of GABA released within the glomeruli. Now the maximum rebound happens at one STO cycle (in the model ~100 ms), which we indeed had originally expected.</p><p>Our newly presented modeling data now better highlights the experimental findings and we thus feel the model contributes in substantial ways to the manuscript. Furthermore, it is fully open-source and in an open repository, which allows anyone to reproduce and extend our results. To improve the integration with the main text, and in line with the general advice of the Editorial Report (see above) we have extensively modified Figures 7 and 8, added a new Figure 9 regarding the expected responses. We have also added substantial supplements detailing (1) model tuning, (2) responses to stochastic input, (3) and phase differences.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This study combines the use of transgenic mice, optogenetic approaches, and patch-clamp recordings in slices to examine the interplay between specific excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs and intrinsic oscillations in neurons of the inferior olive. Through analyses of the response phase and amplitude, the authors show convincingly that excitation has an especially powerful effect on response amplitude and firing when it occurs during post-inhibitory rebound. These findings build on many previous studies of this circuitry and are perhaps not surprising from a mechanistic point of view. However, the value of the work is derived from both the specificity achieved in selectively activating known sources of inhibition and excitation and also the thorough and systematic analyses the authors employ to examine the complex interactions between synaptic inputs and intrinsic voltage-gated conductances. Overall the study could be better supported in places, as documented below but provides a significant advance in understanding the circuitry underlying sensorimotor coordination.</p><p>1. The presentation of health criteria for cells and the quality of recordings needs improvement. Membrane potentials are reported for both oscillating and non-oscillating cells, including an average and a range. This is a straightforward measurement for non-oscillating cells but not for oscillators. Presumably, the authors are simply averaging out the oscillations over a long time frame but this should be spelled out explicitly. Resting potentials of -40 mV would seem to be quite depolarized for a healthy neuron for either category and the variation in Vm across cells (nearly 27 mV) seems enormous.</p></disp-quote><p>For panel D of Figure 1 membrane voltage, Vm, was determined as the average of the voltage baselines preceding the current steps used for the I-V curve. When measuring the spontaneous spiking as a function of Vm, membrane voltage was taken as the average of a spontaneous activity trace (231 ± 153 s, ranging from 22 to 599 s).</p><p>Rn was measured as the slope of the linear part of the I-V curve. For the I-V curve, current steps were typically provided from -0.4 nA to 1nA. The linear part of the curve was usually between -0.4 nA and 0.1 nA.</p><p>In our observations, 27mV of STO amplitude is rare, but not unreasonable with respect to analysis of conductance spaces in single cell models. For instance, bifurcations from resting to oscillatory behavior via CaT in single cell modelling show that they are still in the oscillatory domain (see panel row 2, column 3 of our modelling figure above, which is now also a new supplementary dataset). Interestingly, such cells would be spontaneously spiking in the absence of gap junctions (supplementary cells parameter space A). For the two cells in our dataset with very depolarized membrane potentials (~ -40mV), we note that Vm was not corrected for the liquid junction potential. This applies to all cells reported. If corrected, Vm would be ~7mV more negative. We have now added this information to the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors need to present the criteria for rejecting recordings on the basis of health, or the value of series resistance compensation, both of which are unaddressed currently. It would also be important to report whether there was a correlation between average membrane potential and the magnitude of intrinsic oscillations for the relevant cells. It would be expected that the average Vm of cells would strongly affect the relative balance between excitatory and inhibitory currents as well as their interactions with voltage-gated ion channels.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer. Please see our answers highlighted above at the general points 1a, g and h.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Related to the previous comment, the authors should report in the Methods whether membrane potentials reported are corrected for the electrode junction potential, as well as the value of that potential.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our answer to Essential revision point 1i.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. It would be helpful in the Discussion if there was more attention paid to the natural firing patterns of inputs, and what physiological conditions might produce different time separations between excitatory and inhibitory inputs.</p></disp-quote><p>See Essential revisions point 2; we have added a few additional phrases to the general functional implications part in the Discussion on this topic.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The oscillations in these cells are known to be highly voltage-dependent due to T-type Ca channels and h channels. Therefore, there is no surprise for the effects of inhibitory and excitatory inputs in altering the STOs. The main novelty of the findings in this paper involves the quantification of how the inputs affect the IO neurons. That said, there are numerous questions that the authors should address, some minor and some more significant.</p><p>Specific suggestions:</p><p>1. How were Vm and Rn measured? No details are given.

The rebound from a hyperpolarization is highly voltage-dependent. You can't just measure the amplitude from the baseline without knowing the voltage at the baseline and the voltage of the prior hyperpolarization. The rebound should be plotted as a function of the voltage of the prior hyperpolarization.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for bringing this up.

Figure 1 (now Figure 3—figure supplement 1). The drugs were added sequentially: first PTX, then CNQX, and finally, if possible, also APV. PTX and CNQX were added in all cells (8 in total), whereas APV could only be successfully added in 4 out of 8 cells, due to the relatively long duration of the required recordings (&gt;80 mins).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

As explained in detail above at the general point (e), we now show a full blockage of inhibition following application of 100 μm PTX (see also panel below, which has been included as a Figure 2—figure supplement 1) We thank the Reviewer for drawing our attention to this point.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I have even less confidence in the rigor of the electrophysiology than I did in the previous version. I asked:</p><p>1. For details on Vm and Rn. The response for Vm was ok, but not Rn. Where is the linear portion of the I-V curve (actually it should be called a V-I) curve? No V-I is shown so I have no idea whether there was a linear portion and what the rest of the V-I plots look like.</p></disp-quote><p>Please note that all the curves are uploaded to the DRYAD repository (folder: “Figure 1”, filename: Rn calculations) along with the Manuscript. As an example, please see the plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>. The red rectangle highlights the data points selected for the linear regression to determine input resistance. We note that (1) linearity is not completely absent beyond the range selected for Rn calculations (in this case linearity is observed up to 0.4 nA) and that (2) even if we had used all the data points from the curve, it wouldn't have significantly altered the computed input resistance. For instance, if all data points in the example shown would have been included for the linear regression analysis, the input resistance and R<sup>2</sup> would have been 26.61 ΩM and 0.90, instead of 27.93 ΩM and 0.99. This was true for all cells (see DRYAD).</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-83239-sa2-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Details about rebound being v. dependent. They now show plots, and indeed rebound varied 2-4 fold depending on Vm, but as far as I can tell, none of this was used in their analyses such as in Figure 2 and elsewhere.</p></disp-quote><p>While it's true that rebound amplitude exhibits a voltage-dependent nature, we must emphasize that variations in membrane voltages across different cells – differences that merely fall within a range of 2 to 3 mV – only have a negligible impact in this particular instance. Such minute differences are too small to significantly alter our observations. Most critically, our assertions are firmly rooted not just in empirical data, but also have been rigorously affirmed by computational modeling studies that corroborate our experimental findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. I asked about 100uM PTX. They now show data from what appears to be one cell but claim that &quot;reanalysis&quot; indicated a complete block in 5 of 5.

Specifically, PTX entirely eliminated GABAergic responses triggered by CN stimulation across the board.
