We seek to understand whether a mutation’s impact at the molecular and cellular levels scale with the severity of brain malformation. Here, we focus on two mutations at the valine 409 residue of TUBA1A, V409I, and V409A, identified in patients with pachygyria or lissencephaly, respectively. We find that ectopic expression of <italic>TUBA1A</italic>-V409I/A mutants disrupt neuronal migration in mice and promote excessive neurite branching and a decrease in the number of neurite retraction events in primary rat neuronal cultures. These neuronal phenotypes are accompanied by increased microtubule acetylation and polymerization rates. To determine the molecular mechanisms, we modeled the V409I/A mutants in budding yeast and found that they promote intrinsically faster microtubule polymerization rates in cells and in reconstitution experiments with purified tubulin. In addition, V409I/A mutants decrease the recruitment of XMAP215/Stu2 to plus ends in budding yeast and ablate tubulin binding to TOG (tumor overexpressed gene) domains. In each assay tested, the <italic>TUBA1A</italic>-V409I mutant exhibits an intermediate phenotype between wild type and the more severe <italic>TUBA1A</italic>-V409A, reflecting the severity observed in brain malformations. Together, our data support a model in which the V409I/A mutations disrupt microtubule regulation typically conferred by XMAP215 proteins during neuronal morphogenesis and migration, and this impact on tubulin activity at the molecular level scales with the impact at the cellular and tissue levels.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins are molecules made up of long chains of building blocks called amino acids. When a mutation changes one of these amino acids, it can lead to the protein malfunctioning, which can have many effects at the cell and tissue level. Given that human proteins are made up of 20 different amino acids, each building block in a protein could mutate to any of the other 19 amino acids, and each mutations could have different effects.</p><p>Tubulins are proteins that form microtubules, thin tubes that help give cells their shape and allow them to migrate. These proteins are added or removed to microtubules depending on the cell’s needs, meaning that microtubules can grow or shrink depending on the situation. Mutations in the tubulin proteins have been linked to malformations of varying severities involving the formation of ridges and folds on the surface of the brain, including lissencephaly, pachygyria or polymicrogyria.</p><p>Hoff et al. wanted to establish links between tubulin mutations and the effects observed at both cell and tissue level in the brain. They focused on two mutations in the tubulin protein TUBA1A that affect the amino acid in position 409 in the protein, which is normally a valine. One of the mutations turns this valine into an amino acid called isoleucine. This mutation is associated with pachygyria, which leads to the brain developing few ridges that are broad and flat. The second mutation turns the valine into an alanine, and is linked to lissencephaly, a more severe condition in which the brain develops no ridges, appearing smooth.</p><p>Hoff et al. found that both mutations interfere with the development of the brain by stopping neurons from migrating properly, which prevents them from forming the folds in the brain correctly. At the cellular level, the mutations lead to tubulins becoming harder to remove from microtubules, making microtubules more stable than usual. This results in longer microtubules that are harder for the cell to shorten or destroy as needed. Additionally, Hoff et al. showed that the mutant versions of TUBA1A have weaker interactions with a protein called XMAP215, which controls the addition of tubulin to microtubules. This causes the microtubules to grow uncontrollably.</p><p>Hoff et al. also established that the magnitude of the effects of each mutation on microtubule growth scale with the severity of the disorder they cause. Specifically, cells in which TUBA1A is not mutated have microtubules that grow at a normal rate, and lead to typical brain development. Meanwhile, cells carrying the mutation that turns a valine into an alanine, which is linked to the more severe condition lissencephaly, have microtubules that grow very fast. Finally, cells in which the valine is mutated to an isoleucine – the mutation associated with the less severe malformation pachygyria – have microtubules that grow at an intermediate rate.</p><p>These findings provide a link between mutations in tubulin proteins and larger effects on cell movement that lead to brain malformations. Additionally, they also link the severity of the malformation to the severity of the microtubule defect caused by each mutation. Further work could examine whether microtubule stabilization is also seen in other similar diseases, which, in the long term, could reveal ways to detect and treat these illnesses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>tubulin</kwd><kwd>microtubule</kwd><kwd>tubulinopathy</kwd><kwd>brain development</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Fellowship, T32GM136444</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hoff</surname><given-names>Katelyn J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM136253</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moore</surname><given-names>Jeffrey K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011866</institution-id><institution>Colorado Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Center for Neuroscience Pilot Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Franco</surname><given-names>Santos J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005508</institution-id><institution>Boettcher Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Boettcher Webb-Waring Biomedical Research Program Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Franco</surname><given-names>Santos J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007180</institution-id><institution>Children's Hospital Colorado</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Program in Pediatric Stem Cell Biology</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Franco</surname><given-names>Santos J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The mechanistic origins of distinct brain malformations associated with different substitutions at α-tubulin residue 409 are examined, revealing disruption of neuronal migration and microtubule regulation by XMAP215 that scales from protein to tissue.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Brain development requires cargo transport, force generation, and structural reinforcement by the microtubule cytoskeleton. The regulation of microtubules must be finely tuned to meet specific demands for different cell types, time points in development, and even different locations within a cell. Particularly in neurons, the spatial and temporal regulation of microtubules establishes cargo transport networks, facilitates efficient signal transduction, and supports the extension and retraction of neurites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dent and Baas, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dent and Kalil, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">He et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Witte et al., 2008</xref>). Accordingly, defects in microtubule regulation in neurons have been linked to brain malformations such as lissencephaly, microcephaly, and autism spectrum disorders, among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bahi-Buisson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chakraborti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Srivastava and Schwartz, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Brain malformations such as lissencephaly, pachygyria, and polymicrogyria are associated with defects in neuronal migration. During neuronal migration, neurons that are born at the neuroepithelium must migrate out of the ventricular zone along radial glia cells to reach their destination at the cortical plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barkovich et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barkovich et al., 2005</xref>). Throughout the course of radial migration, cortical neurons must transition through various morphologies, first by transitioning from a bipolar to a multipolar state, then back to a bipolar state to complete migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Nadarajah et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Noctor et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tabata and Nakajima, 2003</xref>). After arriving at the cortical plate, the neurons are correctly positioned and polarized to connect to each other and send and receive information. During this dynamic process of neuronal morphogenesis, microtubules generate force and provide structural support. Therefore, microtubule networks must be acutely regulated during these transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chesta et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dehmelt et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dent et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">He et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sainath and Gallo, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Winding et al., 2016</xref>). For example, the microtubule motor, kinesin-6, is important for establishing a leading process that is required for the transition from a multipolar to bipolar state and subsequent neuronal migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Falnikar et al., 2013</xref>). Together this suggests the critical importance of regulating microtubules in the right place and at the right time during the morphological transitions neurons must undergo for migration and, ultimately, proper brain development.</p><p>‘Tubulinopathies’ encompass a wide range of heterozygous, missense mutations in the genes encoding α- and β-tubulins that are associated with a spectrum of brain malformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bahi-Buisson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fallet-Bianco et al., 2014</xref>). α- and β-tubulins are encoded by a number of different genes, known as isotypes, that differ in amino acid sequence. The expression of different isotypes varies across different cell types as well as during different stages of development. Tubulinopathy mutations have been identified in three of the eight β-tubulin isotypes, and in one of the seven α-tubulin isotypes, a gene known as <italic>TUBA1A</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bahi-Buisson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ludueña and Banerjee, 2008</xref>). <italic>TUBA1A</italic> is the most highly expressed α-tubulin isotype in post-mitotic neurons in the developing brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Buscaglia et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gloster et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gloster et al., 1999</xref>). To date, a total of 121 heterozygous, missense mutations have been identified in <italic>TUBA1A</italic> and are associated with neurodevelopment disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hebebrand et al., 2019</xref>). It remains unclear whether the different severities of malformations observed in these patients are a result of differences in genetic background or are a result of a specific functional difference in the mutant tubulin. A few of these <italic>TUBA1A</italic> mutants have been identified as loss-of-function mutants that are unable to properly assemble into microtubule polymer and thus result in an undersupply of tubulin in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Belvindrah et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Keays et al., 2007</xref>). However, other <italic>TUBA1A</italic> mutants appear to be gain-of-function, as they are capable of microtubule assembly and act dominantly to perturb microtubule function in migrating neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aiken et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aiken et al., 2019</xref>). If haploinsufficiency does not explain all <italic>TUBA1A</italic> tubulinopathies, then it is necessary to define clear mechanistic models for how different mutations in α-tubulin can result in different developmental outcomes. Only a small fraction of <italic>TUBA1A</italic> mutants have been studied, and more continue to be identified in the clinic. Therefore, it is important to establish clear mechanistic themes that will be useful in predicting the molecular, cellular, and tissue-level phenotypes of specific mutations.</p><p>The fundamental role of α-tubulin is to complex with β-tubulin into heterodimers and form microtubule polymers that are dynamic and highly regulated via both intrinsic and extrinsic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bodakuntla et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Borys et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Goodson and Jonasson, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Manka and Moores, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Mitchison and Kirschner, 1984</xref>). Purified tubulin assembles into dynamic microtubules in the absence of extrinsic microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) that are found in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Horio and Hotani, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Mitchison and Kirschner, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Walker et al., 1988</xref>). This intrinsic activity is in part regulated by the series of conformational states that tubulin undergoes as it transitions from free heterodimer into microtubule polymer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chrétien et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mandelkow et al., 1991</xref>). In recent years, studies using cryo-electron microscopy and recombinant tubulin approaches have advanced the field’s understanding of the transitions that accompany GTP hydrolysis as free tubulin assembles into microtubule lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Geyer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Manka and Moores, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Roostalu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zheng et al., 1995</xref>). In addition to nucleotide-dependent conformational changes, tubulin must transition from a ‘curved’ free heterodimer to a straight conformation in the microtubule lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Buey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Jánosi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Nawrotek et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Nogales and Wang, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ravelli et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rice et al., 2008</xref>). Tubulin domains that control the curved-to-straight transition are not completely understood. The ability of tubulin to adopt a range of conformational states not only impacts its intrinsic microtubule dynamics, but also tubulin’s interactions with a wide spectrum of MAPs. For example, doublecortin (DC) is predominantly expressed in the developing brain and its N-terminal DC-like repeat domain binds at the corner of four tubulin subunits in a straight microtubule lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Fourniol et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Manka and Moores, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Moores et al., 2006</xref>). On the other hand, members of the XMAP215 protein family possess a variable number of TOG (tumor overexpressed gene) domains, some of which preferentially bind to curved tubulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ayaz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ayaz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Slep and Vale, 2007</xref>). XMAP215 proteins use this activity to either pull curved tubulin toward the microtubule plus end for polymerization or drive lattice-bound tubulin into a curved state and promote catastrophe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ayaz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brouhard et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Farmer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Geyer et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, understanding the effects of tubulin conformations on both intrinsic activity and extrinsic regulatory mechanisms are essential for elucidating the regulation of microtubule dynamics.</p><p>In this study we investigate the molecular mechanism of two previously identified tubulinopathy-associated mutations at the valine 409 residue of <italic>TUBA1A</italic>, V409I, and V409A. The patient harboring the V409A mutation exhibited lethal lissencephaly, whereas the patient with the V409I mutation presents with a milder malformation known as pachygyria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bahi-Buisson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fallet-Bianco et al., 2014</xref>). Studying these two mutations that occur at the same residue, yet are associated with varying degrees of brain malformations in patients, has potential to provide insight into how perturbing tubulin activity and the microtubule cytoskeleton in slightly different ways ultimately impacts brain development. We find that the expression of V409I or V409A dominantly disrupts neuron migration and morphology in mice and neuron branching during in vitro development. Additionally, V409I/A mutants increase microtubule acetylation and polymerization rates in neuronal cultures. By modeling the V409I/A mutants at the corresponding residue in budding yeast, V410, we find that the mutants increase microtubule polymerization and depolymerization rates in cells and disrupt XMAP215/Stu2 activity. Furthermore, the V410A mutation promotes faster microtubule polymerization in reconstitution experiments with purified tubulin, indicating a change in tubulin’s intrinsic polymerization activity. We propose that these results may be reconciled by the V410I/A mutants adopting a persistently straightened state as compared to wild-type (WT) tubulin, and this drives intrinsically faster microtubule polymerization rates in vitro. Importantly, we find that the severity of the V409I and V409A mutations scale from protein activity, to microtubule dynamics in cells, to neuron morphology and migration. Together, our results suggest that the <italic>TUBA1A</italic>-V409I/A mutations cause brain malformations by subverting dynamic regulation typically conferred by XMAP215.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>TUBA1A</italic>-V409I/A mutants dominantly disrupt cortical neuron migration and morphology</title><p>The V409 residue of <italic>TUBA1A</italic> is located in helix 11’ of α-tubulin, near the intradimer interface on the cytoplasmic surface of the microtubule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alushin et al., 2014</xref>; PDB: 3J6F; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To determine whether <italic>TUBA1A</italic>-V409I/A variants act as loss- or gain-of-function mutations, we first sought to establish whether the mutant proteins can polymerize into microtubules. We expressed a hexahistidine (6X-His)-tagged <italic>TUBA1A</italic> construct in cortical neuron cultures harvested from P0 rats.

We find that the amount of 6X-His signal retained after soluble protein extraction is similar between WT- and V409I/A-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

To answer this question, we performed in utero electroporations to ectopically express <italic>TUBA1A</italic> in migrating neurons in the developing mouse brain. At embryonic day (E) 14.5, we electroporated neural progenitors in the cortical ventricular zone, which give rise to immature excitatory neurons that migrate from the ventricular zone into the upper cortical plate. The cDNA expression plasmids used for the electroporations encode for either WT or mutant <italic>TUBA1A</italic>, along with GFP to identify the electroporated cells. The majority of GFP + neurons ectopically expressing <italic>TUBA1A</italic>-WT successfully migrate from the ventricular zone to the upper cortical plate by E18.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast, neurons ectopically expressing <italic>TUBA1A</italic>-V409I do not migrate to the upper cortical plate as robustly as WT control cells by E18.5, as evidenced by many neurons remaining in the ventricular, subventricular, and intermediate zones. Strikingly, a majority of <italic>TUBA1A</italic>-V409A-expressing neurons fail to migrate at all by E18.5 and remain primarily in the ventricular and subventricular zones. To quantify migration for comparison across experiments, we divided the cortical sections into four equal segments from the ventricular zone to the top of the cortical plate and measured the proportion of GFP signal in each segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Approximately, the first quartile represents the ventricular and subventricular zones, the second quartile represents the intermediate zone, the third quartile represents the lower cortical plate, and the fourth quartile represents the upper cortical plate. We find that the largest proportion of <italic>TUBA1A</italic>-WT-expressing cells (43.4%) are found in the upper cortical plate region (labeled in orange), while the largest proportion of <italic>TUBA1A</italic>-V409I-expressing cells (45.4%) are in the intermediate zone and lower cortical plate, and the largest proportion of <italic>TUBA1A</italic>-V409A-expressing cells (49.4%) are in the ventricular/subventricular zones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In each of our experiments, untransfected control cells successfully reach the cortical plate, as evidenced by abundant DAPI signal in the upper cortical plate segment, indicating that the radial glia cells that support migration are not impaired by the transfection of mutant <italic>TUBA1A</italic> in our experiments. These results suggest that the <italic>TUBA1A</italic>-V409I/A mutants act dominantly to disrupt neuron migration, with <italic>TUBA1A</italic>-V409A being more severe than the <italic>TUBA1A</italic>-V409I mutant.</p><p>To further our understanding of how this migration defect occurs, we next used high-resolution confocal microscopy to examine the morphologies of cells that remain in the intermediate and ventricular zones 4 days after transfection. We find that the <italic>TUBA1A</italic>-WT-expressing cells in the intermediate and ventricular zones exhibit a clear bipolar morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). <italic>TUBA1A</italic>-V409I-expressing cells in the intermediate and ventricular zones also show a primarily bipolar morphology, however it is again evident that there are more <italic>TUBA1A</italic>-V409I-expressing cells in these regions as compared to WT-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Most strikingly, the <italic>TUBA1A</italic>-V409A-expressing cells in the intermediate and ventricular zones have elaborate multipolar morphologies with many processes and branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). These complex morphologies and the high density of <italic>TUBA1A</italic>-V409A-expressing cells in these regions create a tangled nest of processes that make it difficult to measure the exact number of processes per cell. We conclude that <italic>TUBA1A</italic>-V409A-expressing cells exhibit severe migration defects accompanied by morphological defects, while <italic>TUBA1A</italic>-V409I-expressing cells exhibit intermediate migration defects without a strong morphological phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title><italic>TUBA1A</italic>-V409I/A mutants increase neurite branching and decrease neurite retraction events</title><p>The microtubule cytoskeleton plays a crucial role in the series of morphological changes that cortical neurons must undergo throughout the course of radial migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Nadarajah et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Noctor et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tabata and Nakajima, 2003</xref>). When immature neurons are born, they extend numerous neurites to probe their environment for directional cues. Once these cues have been identified, neurons must retract most of their neurites and become bipolar, such that one neurite becomes the axon and a neurite on the opposite side of the cell becomes the leading process that guides radial migration. Therefore, it is particularly crucial that microtubules are able to deftly respond to various cues throughout development that promote these different morphology transitions. Based on the highly branched morphologies of V409A neurons in the ventricular and intermediate zones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), we hypothesized that V409 mutants could either (1) initiate ectopic neurite growth, (2) promote faster neurite growth, or (3) inhibit or slow neurite retraction.</p><p>To distinguish between these hypotheses, we examined the in vitro development of cultured primary neurons ectopically expressing the 6X-His-tagged <italic>TUBA1A</italic> (WT or mutant) plasmids described above. We first compared the number of primary, secondary, and tertiary neurites at two morphologically distinct stages of in vitro cortical neuron development, stage 2 (DIV1) and stage 3 (DIV2). Stage 2 neurons are characterized as being multipolar with all neurites being approximately similar in length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dotti et al., 1988</xref>). On average, there is no appreciable difference in the number of neurites quantified in stage 2 cells expressing WT or V409I/A mutant <italic>TUBA1A</italic>. Most neurons at stage 2 have four primary neurites, and we rarely observe secondary or tertiary branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref> and B). Consistent with this finding, stage 3 WT and V409I/A mutant neurons have a similar number of primary neurites (5.1±0.4, 4.9±0.4, 5.4±0.4 for WT, V409I, and V409A, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). However, <italic>TUBA1A</italic>-V409I-expressing cells exhibit a slight, but measurable increase in secondary branches as compared to WT cells (0.6±0.2, 0.9±0.3 branches/cell for WT and V409I, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Strikingly, <italic>TUBA1A</italic>-V409A-expressing cells have a significantly greater number of secondary branches, and some also exhibit tertiary branches (secondary: 0.6±0.2, 2.2±0.7 branches/cell, tertiary: 0.01±0.03, 0.3±0.2 branches/cell for WT and V409A, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). These data fail to support the hypothesis that <italic>TUBA1A</italic>-V409I/A mutants initiate ectopic primary neurite growth because we find a similar number of primary neurites in WT and mutant-expressing cells. Our data instead lend support to the alternative hypotheses that there is either faster neurite growth or insufficient neurite retraction, as evidenced by the increase in neurite branching.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title><italic>TUBA1A</italic>-V409I/A mutants alter neuron morphologies.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative days in vitro 2 (DIV2) cortical neurons expressing cytoplasmic GFP and 6X-His-tagged <italic>TUBA1A</italic>-WT, -V409I, and -V409A.

The duration of growth and retraction events is also not significantly different; however, neurites in V409I-expressing cells, and more strikingly V409A, have a lower proportion of retraction events per neurite as compared to WT (34.6%, 25.4%, and 16.6% for WT, V409I, and V409A, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

We predicted that V409I/A-expressing cells may maintain neurites under microtubule destabilizing conditions that are sufficient to stimulate neurite loss in WT controls. We stimulated neurite loss in vitro by placing the neuron cultures at 4°C over the course of 6 hr. At low temperatures, microtubules destabilize, which ultimately leads to neurite retraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Breton and Brown, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tilney and Porter, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Weber et al., 1975</xref>). During our time course experiment, cells expressing <italic>TUBA1A</italic>-WT, -V409I, or -V409A were fixed at 2-hr intervals and stained for β-II tubulin, a highly abundant β-tubulin isotype in cortical neurons, to label microtubules in neurites. After 4 hr at 4° C, the average number of neurites in <italic>TUBA1A</italic>-WT-expressing cells (identified by cytoplasmic GFP displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>) is decreased from 4 to 1.5. The remaining neurites are depleted for β-II tubulin signal and nearly all have the retraction bulbs that are characteristic of retracting neurites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D-F</xref>). By 6 hr at 4°C, the number of neurites per cell is further diminished and β-II tubulin signal is only found in the cell soma of neurons expressing <italic>TUBA1A</italic>-WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In contrast to WT controls, neurite loss and the accumulation of retraction bulbs is more gradual in <italic>TUBA1A</italic>-V409I-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–G</xref>). The most severe effect is detected in <italic>TUBA1A</italic>-V409A-expressing cells where neurites containing robust β-II tubulin signal are maintained throughout the time course, and retraction bulbs begin to form only after 6 hr at 4°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G–H</xref>). Together, these data suggest that expression of <italic>TUBA1A</italic>-V409I or -V409A creates hyper-stable microtubules in neurites that decrease neurite retraction events and lead to excessive branching.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title><italic>TUBA1A</italic>-V409I/A mutants alter microtubule dynamics in neurons</title><p>We next sought to determine if the increase in neurite branching and resistance to cold-induced microtubule destabilization seen in <italic>TUBA1A</italic>-V409I/A-expressing cells is a result of altered microtubule dynamics. To test this, we first quantified levels of tubulin post-translational modifications (PTMs) in WT- and mutant-expressing cells. Tyrosinated tubulin is a marker of dynamic, newly formed microtubules and is typically evenly distributed among the axon and dendrites (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Westermann and Weber, 2003</xref>). Acetylated tubulin is a marker of stable microtubule polymer and is highly localized to the axon, but largely absent in the dendrites.</p><p>As expected, stage 3 control cells ectopically expressing <italic>TUBA1A</italic>-WT have acetylated tubulin localized primarily to the axon and tyrosinated tubulin throughout the neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). Additionally, <italic>TUBA1A</italic>-WT cells have the characteristic peak of tyrosinated tubulin at the distal tip of the axon, followed by a sharp increase in acetylated tubulin in the more proximal regions of the process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Both <italic>TUBA1A</italic>-V409I- and -V409A-expressing neurons also exhibit tyrosinated tubulin throughout the neuron, similar to that observed in control cells expressing <italic>TUBA1A</italic>-WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B-D</xref>). <italic>TUBA1A</italic>-V409I-expressing cells have a modest, yet statistically insignificant increase in microtubule acetylation at the distal axon tip, and a significant increase in microtubule acetylation in the region more proximal to the soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). <italic>TUBA1A</italic>-V409A cells exhibit a striking increase in microtubule acetylation at the distal axon tip, as well as in the more proximal region of the process (first 10 µm from distal tip: 1.238±0.303, 1.801±0.372, 2.331±0.596 AU; second 10 µm: 2.442±0.416, 3.505±0.556, 3.868±0.702 AU for WT, V409I, an V409A, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

In a similar analysis of the most distal 10 µm of dendrites, we find that there are no significant differences in acetylated tubulin levels between WT and V409I/A cells, and thus no difference in the ratio of acetylated to tyrosinated tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E-F</xref>).

These data suggest that cells expressing V409I/A mutants have increased levels of microtubule acetylation as compared to WT, and V409A cells in particular have abnormally high levels of acetylation at the distal axon tip.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title><italic>TUBA1A</italic>-V409I/A microtubules have altered microtubule dynamics in neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative days in vitro 2 (DIV2) cortical neurons expressing plasmids with cytoplasmic GFP and 6X-His-tagged <italic>TUBA1A</italic>-WT, -V409I, and -V409A.

Similar to our work in neurons, the V410A mutant has the strongest effect on microtubule dynamics while the V410I mutant has a more intermediate impact.

Therefore, we sought to determine how <italic>tub1/tub3</italic>-V410I/A affect extrinsic and/or intrinsic modes of regulation to alter microtubule dynamics. The α-tubulin V409 (human) or analogous V410 (yeast) residue resides on the external surface of the tubulin heterodimer near the binding sites of a wide variety of MAPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Löwe et al., 2001</xref>). In particular, one structural analysis highlights the α-tubulin V410 residue as a potential interactor with the TOG2 domain of Crescerin1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Das et al., 2015</xref>). The Crescerin1 TOG2 domain has a similar structure to the TOG1 domain of Stu2, the yeast homologue of XMAP215. Additionally, the V410 residue appears to reside at the interface between α-tubulin and the TOG1 domain of Stu2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ayaz et al., 2012</xref>). As Stu2/XMAP215 is the major microtubule polymerase in cells, we predicted that the increase in microtubule polymerization observed in <italic>tub1/tub3</italic>-V410I/A cells could be a result of increased Stu2 activity on the mutant microtubules. To test this, we first used Stu2-3GFP to measure Stu2 localization at astral microtubule plus ends in cells where all the α-tubulin is either WT, V410I, or V410A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

Disrupting the interaction between the Stu2 TOG2 domain and tubulin heterodimers decreases the localization of Stu2 to microtubule plus ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Geyer et al., 2018</xref>). We therefore predicted that the decreased localization of Stu2 at <italic>tub1/tub3</italic>-V410I/A microtubule plus ends may be a result of lowered affinity between the mutant tubulins and Stu2 TOG domains. To test this prediction, we purified tubulin heterodimer from budding yeast in which the purified α-tubulin was either Tub1-WT, -V410I, or -V410A. Additionally, we purified the two TOG domains in Stu2 fused to a GST tag (referred to as GST-TOG1/2). Using a low concentration of either WT or V410I/A mutant tubulin in the presence of increasing concentrations of GST-TOG1/2, we find that V410I, and more significantly V410A, mutant tubulin has decreased affinity for GST-TOG1/2 as compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). For reference we used previously published K<sub>D</sub> values for WT yeast tubulin affinity for either TOG1 or TOG2 to determine an expected binding curve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Geyer et al., 2015</xref>). These results indicate that the decrease in Stu2 localization we see at the <italic>tub1/tub3</italic>-V410I/A microtubule plus ends is a consequence of the decreased affinity of Stu2 TOG1/2 domains for the mutant tubulin.</p><p><italic>STU2</italic> is an essential gene in budding yeast, presumably because of its important role in regulating microtubule dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wang and Huffaker, 1997</xref>). Based on the increased microtubule polymerization rates observed for V410I/A microtubules, and the decreased affinity between V410I/A and Stu2 TOG domains, we predicted that <italic>tub1/tub3</italic>-V410I/A microtubules would be resistant to the depletion of Stu2. To test this, we constructed <italic>tub1</italic>-V410I or -V410A yeast strains where we could conditionally deplete Stu2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kosco et al., 2001</xref>). Upon addition of copper to the media of these cells, synthesis of <italic>STU2</italic> mRNA is repressed and Stu2 protein is degraded. We find that after 1.5 hr in 500 µM copper sulfate (CuSO<sub>4</sub>), Stu2-HA is almost undetectable via western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Under these conditions, the proportion of WT cells with visible astral microtubules decreases from 53% to 34% (0.526±0.036, 0.345±0.27 at 0 and 1.5 hr, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

These data indicate that V410I and V410A microtubules persist in the absence of Stu2, and therefore the mutant tubulins may not require Stu2 polymerase activity to the same extent as WT.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Purified <italic>tub1</italic>-V410A has increased microtubule polymerization rates in vitro</title><p>Stu2 TOG domains preferentially bind to the kinked conformation of tubulin and have low affinity for straight heterodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ayaz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ayaz et al., 2012</xref>). Based on our in vitro binding assays, we hypothesized that α-tubulin V410I/A heterodimers may adopt a straighter state. The V410 residue resides in helix 11’ of α-tubulin, which is located at the hinge point between α- and β-tubulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Löwe et al., 2001</xref>), and makes it a prime candidate for affecting the conformational states of the heterodimer. We predicted that a straighter heterodimer would increase microtubule polymerization rates as a straight heterodimer is more compatible with forming the microtubule lattice. Therefore, we reasoned that if the changes observed in V410I/A microtubule dynamics are a result of a straightened heterodimer conformation, the mutants should have intrinsically faster polymerization rates in vitro.</p><p>To test this, we used interference reflection microscopy (IRM) to measure the intrinsic polymerization activity of our purified yeast Tub1-WT, -V410I, and -V410A heterodimers in an in vitro dynamics assay. We used GMPCPP-stabilized, rhodamine-labeled porcine microtubule ‘seeds’ attached to the surface of the coverslip via anti-rhodamine antibodies to nucleate the assembly of microtubules from the purified tubulin in the reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We used three concentrations of purified tubulin, between 0.5 and 0.9 µM, to measure microtubule dynamics in vitro. Within this concentration range, we find that soluble tubulin assembles from the stabilized seeds and forms dynamic microtubules. If tubulin concentration is too high, the tubulin will spontaneously nucleate away from the stabilized seeds (to form microtubules, oligomers, aggregates, etc.) and will not be visible on the microscope. If the tubulin concentration is too low, the tubulin will not sustain assembly from the seeds. In our experimental setup, we are unable to observe microtubule dynamics below 0.5 µM tubulin. For each concentration, we measured the change in microtubule length over time of WT or V410I/A mutant tubulin in a completely purified system using unlabeled tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata2">Figure 6—source data 2</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>V410A has intrinsically faster microtubule polymerization rates in vitro.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Graphic depicting aggregates and non-seeded nucleation when tubulin concentrations are too high, no nucleation when concentrations are too low, and dynamic microtubules when concentrations are at an appropriate level.

However, with purified tub1-V410A tubulin, we were unable to observe microtubule dynamics at these three concentrations, nor did we observe any at higher concentrations up to 1.5 µM or lower concentrations down to 0.1 µM (data not shown). Based on our previous data, we predict that tub1-V410A tubulin exhibits increased assembly activity and would be more dynamic at lower concentrations. If tub1-V410A tubulin exhibits higher assembly activity than WT tubulin, even the low end of our usable concentration range may be too high for this mutant, and we would be unable to visualize microtubule dynamics because the mutant may readily assemble away from seeds (similar to top panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). To circumvent these issues while still testing the intrinsic capabilities of tub1-V410A, we mixed WT and tub1-V410A tubulin in a one-to-one ratio, for a total tubulin concentration of 0.5, 0.7, or 0.9 µM. At this WT:V410A one-to-one ratio, we find an increase in microtubule polymerization rates at each concentration tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Since the amount of either WT or V410A tubulin that is present in each of these one-to-one mixtures (i.e., 0.25, 0.35, or 0.45 µM) is not sufficient to support microtubule assembly on its own, we conclude that the increased microtubule polymerization is a synergistic effect of the blend of WT and V410A mutant tubulin.</p><p>The fitted lines of the data collected at each tubulin concentration provide us with important information about the intrinsic properties of the WT and mutant microtubules formed in vitro. The slopes of the fitted lines represent the concentration-dependent polymerization rate, and we find that WT/V410A has an ~2-fold increased rate as compared to WT and V410I (11.6 compared to 5.8 and 6.5 µm/hr/µM). The x- and y-intercepts represent the critical concentration and apparent off rate constants, respectively (x-intercepts=0.01, 0.02, and 0.02 µM; y-intercepts=–0.07, –0.13, and –0.18 µm/hr for WT, V410I, and WT/V410A, respectively). In contrast to the increase observed in microtubule polymerization rates, the microtubule depolymerization rates were not different between WT and either the V410I or V410A mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). These data indicate that <italic>tub1</italic>-V410A has significantly increased intrinsic microtubule polymerization as compared to WT. Together, our data explain the intrinsic mechanism by which the V409/V410A mutant has the most severe phenotypes across scales, while V409/V410I has more mild effects.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The missense, heterozygous mutations identified in human tubulin genes and associated with brain malformations are numerous and varied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bahi-Buisson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fallet-Bianco et al., 2014</xref>). To date, we do not have a good understanding of how different mutations in tubulin genes have such a wide spectrum of detrimental effects on brain development. Investigating the molecular impact of different tubulinopathy mutations and how these mutants affect greater tissue level development is critical to advancing our understanding of the role of the microtubule cytoskeleton during neurodevelopment and disease. In this study, we aim to determine the mechanism of two different substitutions at the valine 409 residue of <italic>TUBA1A</italic> that are associated with different severities of brain malformations. We find that ectopically expressed <italic>TUBA1A</italic>-V409I/A mutants assemble into microtubules in neuron cultures and dominantly disrupt radial neuron migration, and most significantly in cells expressing <italic>TUBA1A</italic>-V409A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Our work indicates that the mutation associated with the most severe brain phenotype, <italic>TUBA1A</italic>-V409A, also has the most severe impact on neurite branching and microtubule dynamics, while the milder -V409I mutant has intermediate phenotypes. These findings provide evidence that the impact of tubulinopathy mutations scale up from altered microtubule polymerization activity and loss of regulation by MAPs to cellular and tissue defects.</p><p>As neurons migrate from the ventricular zone to the cortical plate, they must transition through different polarization states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Nadarajah et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Noctor et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tabata and Nakajima, 2003</xref>). The overexpression or depletion of a wide variety of signaling molecules and cytoskeletal proteins delay or inhibit neuron morphology transitions that impair subsequent migration (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Cooper, 2014</xref>). Several cases of brain malformations similar to those investigated in this study have been linked to mutations that disrupt radial migration by inhibiting the multipolar-to-bipolar transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ohshima et al., 2007</xref>). While there are numerous factors that are required for proper neuron migration, our data support a hypothesis that <italic>TUBA1A</italic>-V409I/A mutants disrupt and/or delay proper morphology transitions. At the cellular level, we find that neurons ectopically expressing <italic>TUBA1A</italic>-V409I and -V409A disrupt neuron morphogenesis by promoting excessive branch stabilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A–E</xref>). We find that <italic>TUBA1A</italic>-WT and <italic>TUBA1A</italic>-V409I/A expressing neurons extend and retract neurite branches at similar rates, however the mutant-expressing cells have neurites that retract less often and spend more time in a paused state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–E</xref>). In the context of a developing cortex, neurons need to efficiently extend and retract neurites to sample the surrounding space, respond to developmental cues, and ultimately polarize to form a bipolar neuron. Our data suggests that the <italic>TUBA1A</italic>-V409I/A mutant-expressing cells have a more elaborate yet static morphology, with neurites that spend less time sampling space as compared to WT neurons. Our findings present the question of whether <italic>TUBA1A</italic>-V409I/A mutants completely fail to migrate to the cortical plate, or whether migration is merely delayed. Future studies addressing this question, potentially by monitoring the migration of neurons at later developmental time points or via in vitro slice cultures, will provide insight into whether neuronal migration is completely impaired or simply delayed. To the best of our knowledge, there are no tubulinopathy mutations to date that disrupt neuron migration via impaired neuron morphology transitions. Therefore, future work will be required to determine whether this is a common mechanism for particular types of brain malformations.</p><p>Our findings support the idea that microtubule stability plays a determining role in neuron branching and morphogenesis. Previous studies have identified that taxol-treated neurons have an increase in neurite extension, axon formation, and branching, while nocodazole treatments result in diminished neurite extension and increased retraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">He et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Witte et al., 2008</xref>). The altered expression of, or mutations in, MAPs also alter neuron morphogenesis (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lasser et al., 2018</xref>). For example, the MAP SSNA1 promotes axonal branching by mediating microtubule nucleation and branching, further highlighting the role of microtubule dynamics in neuron morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Basnet et al., 2018</xref>). Neurons must tightly control both microtubule turnover and nucleation to control neurite branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Basnet et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Witte et al., 2008</xref>). Both taxol treatment and SSNA1 overexpression result in increased neurite branching, yet each drives this phenotype via separate mechanisms; Taxol suppresses microtubule turnover, whereas overexpression of SSNA1 induces microtubule nucleation and branching. We find that DIV2 neurons ectopically expressing <italic>TUBA1A</italic>-V409I or -V409A are resistant to cold-induced neurite loss and have increased levels of microtubule acetylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2F–H ,</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3C</xref>). Our analysis of microtubule dynamics in neurons reveals a similar number of polymerizing microtubules, but faster polymerization rates when V409I and V409A is expressed, compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>). We also find that the duration of polymerization events is shorter when V409I and V409A is expressed, compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Whether these shorter polymerization events are followed by transitions to depolymerization (i.e., catastrophe) or to a stable, non-polymerizing state is unclear. Our data suggest that the V409 mutants do not promote increased nucleation as compared to WT, but rather V409I, and more strongly V409A, increase the content of stable microtubule polymer in neurons. This may be due in part to increased polymerization rates; however, we cannot rule out changes in transition frequencies or depolymerization rate, neither of which are accessible in our dynamics data.</p><p>Our results from modeling V409 mutants in budding yeast further reveal the mechanistic origins of the highly stable microtubules in neurons. Similar to our results in neurons we find that, compared to WT, <italic>tub1</italic>/<italic>tub3</italic>-V410I/A microtubules have faster polymerization rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). In yeast we are able to analyze additional microtubule dynamics parameters, and we find that <italic>tub1</italic>/<italic>tub3</italic>-V410I/A microtubules also have increased depolymerization rates, decreased catastrophe frequencies, and increased dynamicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E, F,I</xref>). Dynamicity is calculated as the total change in microtubule length (taking into account states of growth and shrinkage) divided by the change in time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Jordan et al., 1993</xref>). It is interesting that despite the <italic>tub1</italic>/<italic>tub3</italic>-V410I/A microtubules undergoing catastrophe less often than WT, they have increased dynamicity values. This suggests that the increase in dynamicity is driven by increased polymerization and depolymerization rates, as opposed to frequent transitions between the states of polymerizing and depolymerizing. Accordingly, V410I/A microtubules reach longer lengths and are longer lived. Assuming these dynamic parameters hold in neurons (as we find the polymerization rates do), longer microtubules that catastrophe less often could also contribute to the increase in microtubule acetylation that we observe in neurons expressing <italic>TUBA1A</italic>-V409I/A. Our data support a model in which the V409I/A mutants promote excessive neurite branching similar to taxol-treated neurons, but alter microtubule dynamics in a way that is distinct from the mechanisms of taxol.</p><p>Microtubule dynamics in cells are reliant on both extrinsic factors that interact with microtubules and intrinsic factors conferred by the tubulin heterodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bodakuntla et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Borys et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Goodson and Jonasson, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Manka and Moores, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Mitchison and Kirschner, 1984</xref>). One way in which tubulin heterodimers intrinsically control microtubule dynamics is by adopting a series of conformations as microtubules polymerize and depolymerize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chrétien et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mandelkow et al., 1991</xref>). Free heterodimer exists in a kinked conformation, which straightens out as the heterodimer is assembled into the microtubule lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Buey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Jánosi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Nawrotek et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Nogales and Wang, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ravelli et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rice et al., 2008</xref>). XMAP215/Stu2 is thought to play an important role in driving microtubule polymerization by binding free tubulin near microtubule plus ends and facilitating the transition from the kinked, free heterodimer to the straight heterodimer in the microtubule lattice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). We find that V410I/A tubulins have weaker affinity for Stu2 TOG1/TOG2 domains in our in vitro binding assays, and that V410I microtubules, and more significantly -V410A microtubules, have less Stu2 at their plus ends in yeast cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). Our finding that V409I, and more so V409A, have decreased XMAP215/Stu2 activity and faster microtubule polymerization rates seem paradoxical.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Potential models for the effect of α-tubulin V409I/A on XMAP215/Stu2 and microtubule polymerization.</title><p>Wild-type (WT) tubulin undergoes a series of conformational states as it transitions from a curved free heterodimer into the straight microtubule lattice, which is essential for tubulin binding to a variety of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), such as XMAP215/Stu2 (center). Our data suggest that V409I, and more severely V409A, have decreased XMAP215/Stu2 activity at microtubule plus ends, yet have faster microtubule polymerization rates. <bold>Model 1:</bold> V410I/A tubulin unbinds from TOG (tumor overexpressed gene) domains faster, thus increasing the concentration of free tubulin to promote faster microtubule polymerization. However, if the faster microtubule polymerization rates were solely driven by a decrease in XMAP215/Stu2 and/or free tubulin concentration, we would not expect to see an increase in intrinsic polymerization rates in V409A as compared to WT, as we do in our reconstitution experiments. Therefore, we favor the second model. <bold>Model 2:</bold> the V410I/A tubulin heterodimer is intrinsically altered in a way that disrupts normal XMAP215/Stu2 regulation and drives faster microtubule polymerization.

These two models are not mutually exclusive as it is common for MAPs to influence tubulin conformation states and vice versa. However, these two models can be distinguished by their dependence on TOG binding. The first model posits that V410I/A tubulin exhibits faster polymerization than WT tubulin because WT tubulin visits a slow step in the microtubule assembly pathway when it is bound to the TOG domains of XMAP215/Stu2. In the second model, V410I/A tubulin exhibits faster polymerization regardless of whether XMAP215/Stu2 is present. Our finding that V410A increases the rate of tubulin polymerization in the absence of extrinsic MAPs favors the second model and is consistent with an effect on tubulin’s intrinsic conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Additionally, when Stu2 is conditionally depleted in cells, <italic>tub1</italic>/<italic>tub3</italic>-V410I/A microtubules are maintained while WT microtubules are lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Further experiments are needed to directly test whether V410 mutants limit the range of heterodimer conformations to adopt an intrinsically straighter state. At the cellular level, this model predicts that limiting tubulin conformational states could diminish regulation that is typically conferred by Stu2.</p><p>Tight control over microtubule dynamics is essential for cells, and particularly in neuron morphogenesis and migration as the cytoskeletal must nimbly respond to cues throughout the migratory process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kapitein and Hoogenraad, 2015</xref>). XMAP215/Stu2 works in cells as an extrinsic regulator to finely tune microtubule dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brouhard et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hahn et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lee et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">van der Vaart et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Vasquez et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zanic et al., 2013</xref>). XMAP215’s polymerase activity is required for axon outgrowth and microtubule bundling, and in the growth cone XMAP215 plays a role in linking microtubules and F-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hahn et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lowery et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Slater et al., 2019</xref>). When XMAP215 is depleted in neurons, the number of polymerizing microtubules and the rate of polymerization decrease, and axons are shorter due to slower axon growth rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hahn et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lowery et al., 2013</xref>). As most of the role of XMAP215 in neurons has been explored primarily in the axon and growth cone, future studies should focus on the role XMAP215 plays in neuron morphogenesis and migration, including in establishing neuron polarity and branching. Beyond XMAP215/Stu2, which preferentially binds to the kinked conformation of tubulin, there are numerous other MAPs that bind to a range of particular tubulin conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Brouhard and Rice, 2018</xref>). Therefore, we predict that the activity of multiple extrinsic regulators would be impacted by mutations that alter the conformational state of the tubulin heterodimer. How these regulatory mechanisms are impacted by tubulin conformational states and the subsequent effects of these changes on microtubule networks in cells will be a major focus of future studies.</p><p>Our results, particularly for the V410A mutant, highlight how tubulin mutants can create unexpected dissonance between extrinsic and intrinsic factors. Compared to WT tubulin, V410A mutant tubulin promotes faster polymerization rates in cells and in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6C</xref>). It is interesting that in our in vitro system, we were unable to identify a concentration at which homogeneous V410A polymerizes from the GMPCPP-stabilized porcine tubulin seeds. However, blending V410A with WT tubulin in a one-to-one ratio supports the assembly of microtubules with significantly increased polymerization rates as compared to WT at the same concentrations of total tubulin. This suggests that V410A may be unable to polymerize from GMPCPP seeds on its own, but it drives fast polymerization when mixed with WT tubulin. Based on our data acquired from neuron cultures, and particularly from budding yeast in which all the α-tubulin in the cell is V410A, we know that this mutant assembles into microtubules that polymerize faster and are longer lived in cells. Why then is V410A able to assemble into microtubules when it is the only source of α-tubulin in the cell, but not when it is the only source of α-tubulin in vitro? Beyond V410A, how synergistic interactions between different tubulin heterodimers occur (such as different mutants or isotypes) is an important question to address both in regard to tubulinopathy disease as well as normal tubulin biology. In tubulinopathy patients that harbor heterozygous mutations, the mutant tubulin comprises at most 50% of either the α- or β-tubulin pool. This underscores the necessity of future work to (1) determine the relative protein constituency of different tubulin isotypes in different cell types and (2) use blending experiments in vitro to recapitulate these relative proportions. Additionally, this is an important consideration for furthering our understanding of how normal tubulin biology works in cells. Using mutants that affect particular intrinsic properties of tubulin (e.g., conformation, GTPase activity, etc.) in various blends with WT tubulin will provide insight into how these different properties work in trans to alter microtubule dynamics, and whether some mutants or isotypes might elicit outsized effects.</p><p>We propose a model in which the V409I/A mutants are intrinsically altered in a way that perturbs XMAP215/Stu2 regulation and ultimately drive faster microtubule dynamics that perturb neuron morphologies and migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). An isoleucine or alanine substitution at the valine 409 residue of <italic>TUBA1A</italic> seems relatively insignificant. However, these subtle changes lead to drastic consequences that scale from altered microtubule dynamics to an underdeveloped neocortex. Strikingly, <italic>TUBA1A</italic>-V409I presents an intermediate phenotype between WT and <italic>TUBA1A</italic>-V409A in each assay we tested, tracking with the observed brain malformations observed in these patients. To date, there are numerous missense, heterozygous mutations in human tubulin genes that are associated with brain malformations, yet the molecular mechanisms driving these tissue level defects remain unknown. Based off our work and that of others, there does not appear to be a consistent mechanism for how <italic>TUBA1A</italic> tubulinopathy mutations affect microtubule networks and neuron cell biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aiken et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Belvindrah et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gartz Hanson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Keays et al., 2007</xref>). The well-established conformational dynamics of tubulin raise the possibility that mutations altering one region of the heterodimer could allosterically affect distant regions, and thus disrupt the normal conformational transitions that heterodimers undergo during assembly and disassembly. Therefore, it is crucial to use quality genetic models to further our understanding of the molecular mechanism of these patient-associated mutations. Additionally, our work highlights the need for more detailed studies into how different regions of the tubulin heterodimer impact tubulin conformational states, and how this affects extrinsic regulation that ultimately result in altered microtubule dynamics. Investigating how subtle alterations in specific regions of the heterodimer can have long ranging effects across microtubule networks will be a primary focus of future work.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Images were collected on a Nikon Ti-E microscope equipped with a 1.45 NA 100× CFI Plan Apo objective, piezo electric stage (Physik Instrumente, Auburn, MA), spinning disk confocal scanner unit (CSU10; Yokogawa), 488 and 561 nm lasers (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA), and an EMCCD camera (iXon Ultra 897; Andor Technology, Belfast, UK) using NIS Elements software (Nikon). Cells were grown asynchronously to early log-phase in non-fluorescent media and adhered to slide chambers coated with concanavalin A. Slide chambers were sealed with VALAP (Vaseline, lanolin, and paraffin at 1:1:1). Z-series consisting of a 7 µm range at 0.4 µm steps were acquired every 4 s for 10 min at 30°C. Astral microtubule lengths were measured in each frame as the distance from the spindle pole body to the microtubule plus end. Cell genotypes were blinded for analysis.

The following day the colony was diluted 500-fold in 1 l of Terrific Broth media (Fisher, BP2468-2) with 100 µg/ml carbenicillin and 15 µg/ml chloramphenicol and grown at 37°C until the OD<sub>600</sub> reached approximately 0.5. The cultures were shaken at 18°C for 1 hr, then induced with 0.2 mM isopropyl β-<sub>D</sub>-1-thiogalactopyranoside for 18 hr (Fisher, BP1620-1). Following induction cells were pelleted at 6200× <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 6°C and resuspended in a 1:1 ratio with a buffer consisting of 2× PBS, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 20 µl benzonase (25 U/µl), and 1× protease inhibitors (2 cOmplete EDTA-free Tablets per 100 ml; Roche, 04693132001). The cells were lysed by two passes through a microfluidizer at 1500 bar. Cell lysate was then clarified by spinning at 12,000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C.</p><p>A 5 ml GSTrap HP column (GE, 17-5282-01) was pre-equilibrated with 5 column volumes (CV) of wash buffer (2× PBS, 1 mM DTT) at 1 ml/min. The clarified lysate was then loaded onto the column at 0.5 ml/min. The following washes were all done at 1 ml/min. The column was washed with 10 CV of wash buffer with 0.1% Tween 20, then 2 CV of 2× PBS with 5 mM ATP and 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. The column incubated in this buffer for 20 min. The column was then washed with 5 CV of 6× PBS, followed by 5 CV of wash buffer. GST-TOG1/2 was eluted from the column in 1 ml fractions into a deep 96-well plate with wash buffer plus 5 mM reduced glutathione, pH 8.0. The eluted fractions were run on a gel and stained with Coomassie. Fractions containing GST-TOG1/2 were pooled and dialyzed against three changes (after 2 hr, overnight, then another 2 hr) of coupling buffer (100 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 100 mM NaCl, pH 8.2) at 4°C. The dialyzed sample was concentrated in 0.5 ml centrifuge concentrating filters (Sigma Z677108) that had been pre-equilibrated with coupling buffer. GST-TOG1/2 was concentrated to 14.5 µM and stored in 25 µl aliquots at –80°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Yeast tubulin purification</title><p>Purification of yeast tubulin was based on previously described methods with slight modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Johnson et al., 2011</xref>). Protease deficient yeast cells (JEL1) were transformed with pRS426-GAL-Tub1-internal 6X-His and pRS424-GAL-Tub2 (untagged) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lindsley and Wang, 1993</xref>). tub1-V410I and -V410A mutants were constructed in the pRS426-GAL-Tub1-internal 6X-His plasmid with QuikChange XL. Cells were grown in five or six 5 ml cultures of selection media (-ura -trp) supplemented with 2% glucose for either 3 or 2 days, respectively, at 30°C. Five ml cultures were then transferred to 50 ml cultures of the same media to grow for 24 hr. Cultures were then transferred to 1 l cultures of YPGL, consisting of 10 g yeast extract (Fisher, BP1422), 20 g peptone (Fisher, BP1420), 30 ml glycerol (Fisher, G33), and 33 ml lactate (Sigma, L1375). Yeast extract, peptone, and 850 ml ddH<sub>2</sub>O was combined and autoclaved the day before it was needed. The glycerol and lactate were added immediately after media came out of the autoclave, then allowed to cool at room temperature overnight. After 20–24 hr of growing in 1 l cultures and the OD<sub>600</sub> was between 5.0 and 9.0, 1 l of cells was induced with 20 g galactose (Chem-Impex, 01449) for 5 hr. Cells were spun down at 4°C for 15 min at 4000 rpm (3040 RCF) in a J6 centrifuge (Beckman Coulter Life Sciences). Supernatant was discarded and pellets were stored in 15 ml conical tubes in –80°C. This process was done three times for a total of approximately 100 g of cells before moving on to purification.</p><p>Cell pellets were thawed on ice and combined with cold lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 30 mM imidazole) plus freshly added 50 µm GTP (Sigma G8877) and 1 mM PMSF (Acros Organics, 215740050) to a total of approximately 150 ml. While cells were thawing, the microfluidizer (Microfluidics, M-110P) was packed with ice to cool. Cells were passed through the microfluidizer four times at 27,000 PSI with 10 min on ice between each pass. The cells were chased with 50 ml lysis buffer supplemented with 50 µM GTP and 1 mM PMSF. The lysed cells were clarified in an Avanti J-26S XPI centrifuge (Beckman Coulter Life Sciences) at 41,000 RCF for 30 min at 4°C. The pellets were discarded and the supernatant was applied to a 5 ml His60 Ni column (Takara, 635680) that was pre-equilibrated with 20 CV of lysis buffer. The column was washed with 10 CV of lysis buffer supplemented with 50 µM GTP, then with 10 CV of wash buffer (25 mM PIPES pH 6.9, 1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 30 mM imidazole, 200 mM NaCl) with 50 µM GTP. Protein was eluted from the column with 10 CV of elution buffer (25 mM PIPES pH 6.9, 1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 300 mM imidazole, 200 mM NaCl) with 50 µM GTP into 2 × 5 ml samples followed by 4 × 10 ml samples. Samples from the wash and elution steps were run on a gel and Coomassie staining was used to determine which fractions contained tubulin. Elution fractions with tubulin were pooled and 20% glycerol was added before flash freezing the samples in liquid nitrogen and storing at –80°C.</p><p>Elution fractions from the Ni column were thawed in a room temperature water bath and 10 µl of nuclease (Pierce, 88701) was added per 25 ml of sample, then sat for 1 hr at room temperature. Two HiTrap Q HP 1 ml columns (GE, 17-1153-01) were strung together on an AKTA FPLC (GE) and equilibrated with 10 CV (20 ml) of ddH<sub>2</sub>O, 5 CV of Buffer A (25 mM PIPES pH 6.9, 2 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1 mM EGTA), 5 CV of Buffer B (25 mM PIPES pH 6.9, 2 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 2 mM EGTA, 1 M NaCl), and 10 CV of Buffer A, all run at 1 ml/min. The column was then equilibrated at 2 ml/min with 12.5 CV of 80% Buffer A and 20% Buffer B, both supplemented with 50 µM GTP. Sample from Ni column was injected into a 50 ml Superloop that was washed with diH<sub>2</sub>O followed by Buffer A. The sample was applied to the column at 0.5 ml/min using Buffer A. Once the sample was loaded the tubulin was eluted with 30 CV of Buffer A and a 20–60% gradient of Buffer B, both supplemented with 50 µM GTP. Elution was collected in 0.5 ml fractions in a 96 deep-well plate. Elution fractions were run on a gel and Coomassie staining determined which fractions had pure tubulin and would be used to concentrate the protein.</p><p>Amicon ultra 0.5 ml centrifuge concentrating filters with a 10 kDa cutoff (Sigma, Z677108) were prepared with two rounds of 0.4 ml 1% Triton X-100, ddH<sub>2</sub>O, and PEM (0.1 M PIPES, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) spinning at 800 RCF for 5 min at 4°C. Up to 0.450 ml of pure tubulin sample was applied to the concentrating filters and spun at 4°C at 800 RCF for anywhere between 2 and 5 min, depending on the concentration of the sample. The concentration was checked after each spin on a Take3 Micro-volume Plate (BioTek) using 260 and 280 nm absorbance to ensure that the concentration was increasing but aggregates were not forming. Samples were constantly kept on ice or at 4°C and concentrated to 2.2 µM (tub1-V410I), 2.3 µM (tub1-V410A), and 3 µM (TUB1). Concentrated protein samples were run through a Zeba spin 2 ml desalting column (Thermo, 89890) that was prepared by spinning at 1000 RCF for 2 min at 4°C to remove storage buffer, then washed three times with 0.4 ml PEM. Up to 0.7 ml of concentrated sample was added to each desalting column, then spun down at 1000 RCF for 2 min at 4°C. The flow-through sample was supplemented with 50 µM GTP, aliquoted into 20 µl samples that were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80°C. At least two separate rounds of purifications were used as technical replicates for in vitro assays that used this purified tubulin.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>TOG binding assay</title><p>Pierce Glutathione Magnetic Agarose Beads (Thermo, 78602) were used to separate purified GST-TOG1/2 (above) and anything bound in complex with TOG1/2 from the rest of the reaction; 100 µl of bead slurry (equates to 25 µl settled beads) were equilibrated twice with 40 µl wash buffer (125 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) by vortexing for 10 s and removing buffer by placing tube on magnetic stand. In separate tubes, 100 nM tubulin (WT, V410I, or V410A; purification described above) was mixed with a range of GST-TOG1/2 concentrations (from 9.8 nM to 5 µM) at 4°C for 15 min. Reaction was added to the equilibrated beads and rotated at 4°C for 1 hr. Tubes were placed on magnetic stand and supernatant was collected. The supernatant was prepared with Laemmli sample buffer and β-mercaptoethanol and loaded onto a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. The gel was transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore, IPFL85R), blocked with a PBS Blocking Buffer (LI-COR, 927–70001) at room temperature for 1 hr, and probed with mouse anti-α-tubulin (4A1; 1:100) or mouse anti-β-tubulin (E7; 1:100) overnight at 4°C. The following day the membranes were washed once for 5 min with 1× PBS, then incubated at room temperature in the dark for 1 hr with goat anti-mouse-680 (LI-COR, 926-68070; 1:15,000). Membranes were washed twice with 1× PBST, then once with 1× PBS before imaging on an Odyssey Imager (LI-COR, 2471). Both α- and β-tubulin band intensity was analyzed using Image Studio v5.2 (LI-COR). Tubulin band intensity represents the amount of tubulin in solution that is not bound to GST-TOG1/2.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Stu2 depletion and yeast immunofluorescence</title><p>Stu2 depletion strains originally constructed from Kosco et al. were graciously gifted from Dr Tim Huffaker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kosco et al., 2001</xref>).

remain largely unknown. Using a combination of approaches and model systems, Hoff et al., provide evidence that disease-associated α-tubulin mutations increase microtubule polymerization rates and block the recruitment of a regulatory binding protein, which combinatorially promotes excessive neurite branching that disrupts neuronal migration.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Tubulinopathy mutations in <italic>TUBA1A</italic> that disrupt neuronal morphogenesis and migration override XMAP215/Stu2 regulation of microtubule dynamics&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>There is general agreement from the reviewers that the yeast data is rigorous, soundly interpreted, and represents the core of the manuscript. However, there are concerns about the interpretation of the neuronal data and the conclusion that the mutations affect dimer conformation. It is therefore suggested that the authors expand the neuronal data, since performing structural studies on tubulin dimer conformation is outside the scope of this paper. In addition, there are many areas where it is suggested that the authors soften their wording when there is no direct evidence to support their conclusions. In particular, the reviewers strongly recommend the authors remove/extensively limit all the discussion of the enhancement of tubulin straightening for which there is no convincing data. Please read the individual reviewer comments for more information.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) To determine if the results from their yeast model that the V409 mutations have a strong effect on microtubule polymerization are consistent in neurons, the authors should assay directly for an effect on microtubule polymerization in neurons using a +TIP marker, such as EB3-GFP.</p><p>2) As suggested by Reviewer 1, please define the neurites you are analyzing. Even if you cannot assign them as axons or dendrites, please define them as primary, secondary, tertiary, etc., as is common across the neurobiology field.</p><p>3) Both Reviewer 1 and 3 expressed concerns about the analysis and conclusions of the neurite retraction assays. Please address both comments, but especially please see Reviewer 1's helpful third comment about convincing ways to analyze neurite retraction.</p><p>4) Both Reviewer 1 and 3 noted that conclusions about morphology transitions are not supported by the data presented in the paper. Please either address this experimentally as suggested by the reviewers, or remove this conclusion. The authors should also address the other possibilities such as a delay in neuronal migration, as suggested by Reviewer 3.</p><p>5) During the discussion, all three reviewers raised concerns about the lack of data and over-interpretation for how the mutants relate to the conformation of the tubulin dimer. At the very least, the authors should provide a structure of the tubulin dimer with the residues highlighted. This can easily be done in pymol or a similar program. Perhaps once the authors include this data, they may modify their conclusions on whether these mutations could feasibly affect dimer conformation, or if, based on the residue locations, there are other models that the authors may want to discuss. Reviewer 2 has the most thorough review on this point.</p><p>6) It was agreed in the reviewer discussion that the authors should discuss potential effects on the total amount of tubulin available for polymerization if TOG-tubulin binding is inactivated. This could be the reason for the enhancement in microtubule polymerization rates observed with the mutants and would be consistent with most of the data.</p><p>7) Finally, please provide precise n for the number of cells per condition and the number of replicates. In addition, please present the statistical tests in the legends, as is outlined in the <italic>eLife</italic> guide to authors.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Given the findings from their yeast model that the V409 mutations have a strong effect on microtubule polymerization, the authors should assay directly for an effect on microtubule polymerization in neurons (e.g. using EB3-GFP).</p><p>2. The authors find that yeast V410 mutants are insensitive to the loss of Stu2. Would mammalian neurons be similarly less sensitive to the loss of XMAP215?</p><p>3. The authors claim at several points that the V409 mutants delay or interfere with neurite retraction. This claim is not supported by their data. For example, on line 190-191, the authors state just two ways in which the V409 mutations might affect neurite growth: &quot;(1) insufficient neurite extension, or (2) insufficient neurite retraction.&quot; There are more possibilities, such as ectopic neurite growth, which is different from neurite retraction (i.e., there is difference between a neurite that a wild-type neuron might extend and retract versus an additional, ectopic neurite that a wild-type neuron would not normally extend). The authors consider more than just these two possibilities.</p><p>The main support for the idea that neurite retraction is disrupted seems to be the cold treatment assay shown in Figure 2C. This seems an odd assay to test whether the V409 mutations affect neurite retraction. Why not just analyze neurite growth and retraction over time, without any cold treatment? If neurons expressing V409 mutant tubulin have abnormal neurite retraction, this should be determined by visualizing the growth and retraction of a neurite over time using a marker such as GFP, not β-tubulin. A time-lapse imaging experiment would provide convincing data on whether neurite retraction is affected.</p><p>Cold is typically used to destabilize microtubules, and, indeed, the label shown in Figure 2C is for β-tubulin. Instead of neurite retraction, it seems that a conclusion about microtubule stability could be drawn from these experiments -? But these data are difficult to interpret because they are not quantified. And the authors should state in the main text when the neurons are shifted to 4°C (the control neuron at 0h appears to be Stage 2).</p><p>Most importantly, however they are used, these data in Figure 2C need to be quantified.</p><p>4. Figure 2B: The authors quantify branches (or neurites), but are these axons? Dendrites? Are the secondary and tertiary branches extending from axons or dendrites? The authors need to clarify whether axons or dendrites are being quantified.</p><p>5. Lines 450-452: The authors claim that their &quot;data support a hypothesis that TUBA1A-V409I/A mutants disrupt and/or delay proper morphology transitions.&quot; This conclusion is not supported by their data. The authors do not analyze neuronal morphology in the mouse cortices expressing V409 mutant tubulin, and the authors found the V409 mutant tubulin does not affect the morphological transition of cultured cortical neurons from Stage 2 to Stage 3.</p><p>6. Figure 3: The authors quantify tyrosination and acetylation along a presumably significantly large stretch of axons and dendrites (the actual length should be reported in the methods). Given that these PTMs vary in intensity along the neurite length (e.g. tyrosinated tubulin is reportedly highest near the tips of axons or growth cones), could this approach be missing a potential phenotype?</p><p>7. Lines 527-531: It would be helpful to know how specifically how (the loss of) XMAP215 affects developing neurons. The current description is quite vague.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors should revise the discussion and introduce structural models to present the defects and their impact on the structural organization in the early part of the paper (Figure 1 or its supplements) The structural presentation can also be included in figure discussing the structural models for TOG proteins figure 4 and some discussion or potential experiments measuring the impact on TOG proteins concentrations on the tubulin concentration in cells.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– In figure 2B, data points are represented as single cells (at least 27 cells per condition).

To address this, we transfected primary cortical neuron cultures with a pCIG2 plasmid that co-expresses TUBA1A (either WT or mutant) with GFP-MACF43, a plus-end binding protein that binds to EB1 and tracks growing microtubule plus ends (PMID: 19632184).</p><p>We find that the speeds of GFP-MACF43 comets are faster in V409I, and more significantly V409A expressing neurons, compared to WT controls. This indicates that V409I and V409A mutants lead to increased microtubule polymerization rates as compared to WT. This data is now presented in Figure 3E-H. These results are in agreement with our yeast data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) As suggested by Reviewer 1, please define the neurites you are analyzing.

The longest neurite was considered to be the axon as these were stage 3 neurons, however we did not stain for an axonal marker, and therefore we are unable to definitively call it the axon. Additionally, the secondary and tertiary branches quantified in Figure 2B and Figure 2—figure supplement 1B extended from both axons and dendrites.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Both Reviewer 1 and 3 expressed concerns about the analysis and conclusions of the neurite retraction assays.

To test this, we have now imaged DIV2 neurons expressing either WT or V409 mutant tubulin and cytoplasmic GFP every 30 seconds over a 15-minute time course in a stagetop incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2. We then measured the length of neurites and branches from the base of the process to the distal tip at each time point. We find that the growth and retraction rates are similar between WT and V409 mutants, however the V409 mutants have more processes that remain in a paused state and fewer that are retracting. These data are shown in Figure 2C-E and Table 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Both Reviewer 1 and 3 noted that conclusions about morphology transitions are not supported by the data presented in the paper. Please either address this experimentally as suggested by the reviewers, or remove this conclusion. The authors should also address the other possibilities such as a delay in neuronal migration, as suggested by Reviewer 3.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the suggestion by the reviewers to analyze the cells in the WT and V409 mutant in utero electroporation images. To address this, we used a Stellaris 5 confocal microscope with 5 HydS tunable detectors to obtain high-resolution images of cells in the ventricular/subventricular and intermediate zones (as defined in Figure 1D). We find that particularly V409A expressing cells have highly complex cell morphologies, as compared to the bipolar morphology of WT cells. These images are now included as a new panel F in Figure 1.</p><p>It is interesting that V409I expressing cells also appear to have a more bipolar morphology as compared to V409A, but still have many more cells in these regions as compared to WT. This suggests to us that there may be a delay in neuronal migration, as suggested by Reviewer 3. We have addressed this point in the discussion, page 16 lines 531-536.</p><p>While we agree that delayed neuronal migration is an intriguing potential explanation for both V409 mutants, comparing rates of neuronal migration would best be addressed by a combination of a time course of in utero electroporation experiments and ex vivo assays of living cells (i.e. slice cultures). We feel this is beyond the scope of the current manuscript and would be better suited as a central focus of future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) During the discussion, all three reviewers raised concerns about the lack of data and over-interpretation for how the mutants relate to the conformation of the tubulin dimer.

Reviewer 2 has the most thorough review on this point.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewers’ concerns about the over-interpretation of how these mutants could alter the conformation of the tubulin dimer as we did not directly test this idea. As suggested, we have included a PyMOL structure of the tubulin dimer as a new panel A in Figure 5 with the V409 residue of interest highlighted.</p><p>Additionally, we have softened the language in the discussion as we did not directly test this model. However, we feel it is still important to discuss the possibility of these mutants altering the conformation of the heterodimer, particularly since we see increased microtubule polymerization rates in the V410A in vitro microtubule dynamics assays. These results clearly indicate that the V410A mutant has an intrinsic effect on microtubule dynamics. Additionally, we see reduced binding between both mutants and TOG domains, which preferentially bind to the kinked conformation of tubulin. Nevertheless, we agree that without directly testing these predictions, we cannot make strong conclusions about tubulin. We believe that our revised</p><p>discussion (p18-19, lines 603-619) strikes the appropriate balance of presenting altered tubulin conformation as one of several possible models to consider.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) It was agreed in the reviewer discussion that the authors should discuss potential effects on the total amount of tubulin available for polymerization if TOG-tubulin binding is inactivated.

The results of our in vitro experiments do not support the model where an increased concentration of mutant tubulin is sufficient to explain increased microtubule polymerization rates.</p><p>However, we have also added more discussion regarding the various activities of</p><p>XMAP215/Stu2 (p19, lines 628-631). We think this is an interesting and somewhat unexplored area of neuronal development and are very interested in further understanding XMAP215’sroles in cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Finally, please provide precise n for the number of cells per condition and the number of replicates.

We agree with the reviewer’s speculation that microtubule dynamics in neurons expressing V409 mutant TUBA1A should be less sensitive to the loss of XMAP215. However, we would point out that even though V410 mutant yeast cells retain microtubules during Stu2 depletion, Stu2 is still essential in these cells. It may be that Stu2 retains some level of activity toward V410 mutant tubulin, which may be exquisitely important in some contexts; e.g., at the yeast kinetochore.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

We have now updated this section in the results on page 7, lines 218-221 to consider other possibilities. Additionally, we now address these possibilities by conducting new, time-lapse imaging of neurite dynamics in neurons cultured in standard conditions, as suggested by the reviewer. These results are now included in Figure 2C-E and Figure 2—figure supplement 1C. As explained further in our response to Essential Revisions point #3, above, the results of these new experiments reveal that neurites in cells expressing V409 mutants spend more time in a paused state and less time in a retraction state. We thank the reviewer for this suggestion.</p><p>We also agree with the reviewer that the cold shock assay is a better test of microtubule</p><p>stability.

These data are now found in Figure 3A-D and Figure 3-figure supplement 1A-F. Our new analysis shows that, compared to WT, there is an increase in microtubule acetylation in V409I/A axons, and particularly high levels at the very distal tip of V409A axons.

We have now added a PyMOL structure of where TUBA1A-V409 resides on the heterodimer using PDB: 3J6F in Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and describe how this residue may interact within the dimer and on the external side of the microtubule (page 5 lines 147-149).</p><p>Additionally, we have added another PyMOL structured modified from PDB: 4FFB in Figure 5A where yeast α/β-tubulin is complexed with the TOG1 domain of Stu2 to highlight how residue V410 may interact with Stu2.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that it would be interesting to measure the impact of TOG</p><p>concentrations on the free tubulin concentration available in cells. This is an experiment we have thought about previously, and we predict that overexpressing TOG domains in cells would bind up and saturate the free tubulin pool, and ultimately hinder microtubule polymerization. Because we see decreased binding affinity between TOG domains and the V410I/A mutants, we would predict that mutant microtubules would still assemble in the presence of overexpressed TOG domains.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– In figure 2B, data points are represented as single cells (at least 27 cells per condition). What is the number of replicates for this. How were the statistics performed? Here average values of independent replicated should be displayed and statistical tests should be performed on these numbers.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now provided the precise number of cells per condition, the number of replicates, and statistical tests in all figure legends. We have also made these plots into superplots to display the average values of independent replicates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Throughout the manuscript, the precise Ns should be displayed (number of cells per condition, number of replicates), and the statistical tests should be presented in the legends, not in the methods.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see response above and Essential Revisions #7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– 2C and S1C are the same. The point of this was not clear.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you to the reviewer for pointing this out. Our intention was to show that the images shown in the main figure were expressing either WT or V409 mutant tubulin, as indicated by the cytoplasmic GFP.
