The first key step of its infection cycle is conidial germination, but there is limited information available on the molecular events supporting this process. We show here that germination is accompanied by a sharp decrease in expression of FoSir5, an ortholog of the human lysine deacetylase SIRT5. We observe that FoSir5 decrotonylates a subunit of the fungal pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (FoDLAT) at K148, resulting in inhibition of the activity of the complex in mitochondria. Moreover, FoSir5 decrotonylates histone H3K18, leading to a downregulation of transcripts encoding enzymes of aerobic respiration pathways. Thus, the activity of FoSir5 coordinates regulation in different organelles to steer metabolic flux through respiration. As ATP content is positively related to fungal germination, we propose that FoSir5 negatively modulates conidial germination in <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> through its metabolic impact. These findings provide insights into the multifaceted roles of decrotonylation, catalyzed by FoSir5, that support conidial germination in <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>conidial germinaiton</kwd><kwd>lysine crotonylation</kwd><kwd>phytopathogenic fungi</kwd><kwd>ATP metabolism</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31972213</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liang</surname><given-names>Wenxing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32102149</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Ning</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZR2019BC070</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Ning</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZR2020KC003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liang</surname><given-names>Wenxing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Shandong Province 'Double-Hundred Talen Plan'</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WST2018008</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liang</surname><given-names>Wenxing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Taishan Scholar Construction Foundation of Shandong Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>tshw20130963</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liang</surname><given-names>Wenxing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>200873/Z/16/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pei</surname><given-names>Xueyuan</given-names></name><name><surname>Luisi</surname><given-names>Ben F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The decrotonylase FoSir5 modulates ATP synthesis that supports conidial germination in <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> through coordinated lysine decrotonylation in different organelles.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> is a transkingdom pathogen known to infect more than 100 plant species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Michielse and Rep, 2009</xref>) and immune-compromised patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nucci and Anaissie, 2007</xref>). Therefore, it is of great importance to gain insight into the molecular processes involved in pathogenesis of this fungus. <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> invades roots and can cause wilt diseases through colonization of xylem tissue. Fungal conidia are the first structures that the host immune system encounters during infection, and conidial germination is a crucial step for <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> infection. The early initiation stage of conidial germination represents a critical point to inhibit fungal growth and counteract pathogenic infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deng et al., 2015</xref>). However, the molecular mechanism by which <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> regulates its germination process remains largely unknown.</p><p>Lysine acetylation, one of the most common post-translational modifications (PTMs), is involved in regulation of conidial germination in plant-associated fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dubey et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2020b</xref>). In recent decades, besides acetylation, numerous other short-chain acylation modifications have been discovered on lysine (K) residues, including crotonylation, malonylation, succinylation, propionylation, glutarylation, and butyrylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hirschey and Zhao, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Park et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tan et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tan et al., 2014</xref>). Among them, lysine crotonylation (Kcr), first identified on histones, is also able to target other proteins involved in various cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xu et al., 2017</xref>). Kcr is recognized by histone-binding ‘reader’ modules, including AF9 YEATS, YEATS2, MOZ, and DPF2, in a type- and site-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xiong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>). Histone crotonylation by p300 has been shown to promote transcription in vitro and manipulating cellular concentration of crotonyl-CoA affects gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sabari et al., 2015</xref>). Although a recent proteomic analysis reveals that Kcr is tightly associated with virulence of the necrotrophic fungus <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2020a</xref>), it is not clear whether this modification is involved in the regulation of fungal germination.</p><p>Previous studies have identified mammalian histone deacetylase SIRT1 as being responsible for the removal of crotonylation in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Feldman et al., 2013</xref>). The NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent sirtuins (SIRTs) have an expanded repertoire of deacylase activities and display widespread subcellular distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bell and Guarente, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kanfi et al., 2012</xref>). Three mammalian sirtuins (SIRT3, SIRT4, and SIRT5) localize mostly or exclusively to the mitochondrial matrix, the powerhouse of the cell producing the bulk of cellular ATP through oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ryan, 2018</xref>). SIRT3 is considered the major deacetylase of mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lombard et al., 2007</xref>), while SIRT4 mainly functions as a lipoamidase that regulates pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mathias et al., 2014</xref>). SIRT5, which possesses poor deacetylase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Du et al., 2011</xref>), preferentially regulates the levels of lysine succinylation, malonylation, and glutarylation, playing multiple roles in regulating different metabolic pathways including glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, fatty acid β-oxidation, oxidative phosphorylation, the urea cycle, and ketogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hirschey and Zhao, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Park et al., 2013</xref>). However, no information on the regulation of crotonylation in mitochondria is available.</p><p>The SIRTs are also present in filamentous fungi and control a variety of cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Haigis and Sinclair, 2010</xref>). Seven SIRTs, NST-1 to NST-7, have been identified in <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic>, which mediate telomeric silencing in this fungus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Smith et al., 2008</xref>). In <italic>Podospora anserina</italic>, deletion of <italic>PaSir2</italic> resulted in a significant reduction of cell life span (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boivin et al., 2008</xref>). The sirtuins, HstD in <italic>Aspergillus oryzae</italic> and sirtuin A in <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic>, control secondary metabolite production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Itoh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kawauchi et al., 2013</xref>). However, except for the characterization of <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae MoSir2</italic> in biotrophic growth in host rice plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fernandez et al., 2014</xref>), relatively little is known about the function of SIRTs in plant pathogens.</p><p>In this study, we show that the <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> FoSir5, an ortholog of the human lysine deacetylase, possesses decrotonylase activities in vitro and in vivo. In mitochondria, FoSir5 interacts with and removes the crotonyl group from the E2 component dihydrolipoyllysine acetyltransferase (FoDLAT) of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), the activity of which links glycolysis to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The specific decrotonylation of K148 of FoDLAT by FoSir5 leads to decreased PDC activity and acetyl-CoA generation. FoSir5 is also distributed in nuclei, where it directly regulates the enrichment of crotonylated H3K18 (H3K18cr) on genes involved in the TCA cycle and electron transport chain (ETC) pathways. The integrated regulation by FoSir5 in different organelles represses mitochondrial ATP biosynthesis, impeding fungal conidial germination. Importantly, we find that by decreasing the expression of <italic>FoSir5</italic>, <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> increases the ATP supply that supports the energy consumption demands of germination, emphasizing the importance of this regulatory process. These findings provide a clear example in which plant pathogenic fungi control conidial germination through an exquisite regulatory network that links metabolic activity to the developmental program of infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>FoSir5 has both mitochondrial and extra-mitochondrial decrotonylase activity in <italic>vitro</italic></title><p>Members of the sirtuin family lysine deacetylases (KDACs) exhibit various subcellular localizations and are distributed in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">North and Verdin, 2004</xref>).

A total of three transformants from each group were obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The transformants from all groups had the same phenotypes, although only data for the mutant strain ΔFoSir5.3 (ΔFoSir5) and the overexpression strain FoSir5-Flag-1 (OE-1) are presented below. Then, we transformed and expressed FoDLAT-GFP in the Fo, ΔFoSir5, and OE-1 strains. The crotonylation levels of immunoprecipitated FoDLAT were then tested. Compared with that in the Fo strain, we found markedly increased crotonylation of FoDLAT in ΔFoSir5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). These data indicated that FoSir5 is responsible for the decrotonylation of FoDLAT. Although SIRT5 was reported to possess robust demalonylase, desuccinylase, and deglutarylase activities in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hirschey and Zhao, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Park et al., 2013</xref>), our results showed that FoSir5 had no detectable impact on succinylation, malonylation, or glutarylation of the FoDLAT protein in <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>To determine the crotonylation sites of FoDLAT, we purified the FoDLAT-GFP fusion protein from <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> and identified by mass spectrometry lysine 148 as a site of modification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To further confirm whether K148 is crotonylated in vivo, we mutated lysine 148 to arginine (R) or glutamine (Q), respectively, and developed a specific antibody against crotonylated K148 of FoDLAT (anti-K148cr-FoDLAT) to examine their crotonylation. Note that arginine and glutamine mimic non-acylated and acylated lysine, respectively, with respect to charge on the residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sun et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yu et al., 2020</xref>). The Western analyses detected signals with only the wild-type (WT) FoDLAT but not the Q and R mutants, indicating that K148 is indeed crotonylated in vivo. We also found that inactivation and overexpression of FoSir5 led to significantly increased and decreased K148 crotonylation of WT FoDLAT, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). To further verify that FoSir5 plays a role in the decrotonylation of FoDLAT, an in vitro decrotonylation assay was performed using recombinant proteins purified from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. The results showed that K148 crotonylation has also occurred on FoDLAT in <italic>E. coli</italic> and addition of FoSir5 in the presence of NAD<sup>+</sup> reduced K148 crotonylation of WT FoDLAT but not the Q form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). These data demonstrate that FoSir5 is responsible for K148 decrotonylation of FoDLAT.</p><p>To explore how this crotonylation site might affect FoDLAT function, we first generated a homology model of the fungal enzyme based on the crystal structure of the homologous human E2. In the PDC assembly, E2 is the dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase component, and comprises a biotin-lipoyl domain, an interaction domain that binds the dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E3) component, and the catalytic domain. The crotonylation site maps to an intradomain linker that is predicted to be flexible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref> and D). The flexibility enables the biotin-lipoyl domain to shuttle substrates between the E1 and E2 catalytic sites and then to the E3 site for an oxidation step. Given that DLAT is likely an essential component of PDC function (no DLAT deletion mutants could be obtained after numerous attempts in this research), we examined the impact of changed FoSir5 levels on the endogenous cellular activity of the PDC. PDC activity was elevated in the ΔFoSir5 strain and reduced in the OE-1 strain compared with the Fo and the complemented strain ΔFoSir5-C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). To further determine whether the crotonylation site of FoDLAT plays a role in PDC function, we detected PDC activity in the K148 mutant strains. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, the K148Q and K148R mutant strains demonstrated increased and decreased PDC activity, respectively. Furthermore, the levels of acetyl-CoA, a direct product of E2 catalytic activity, followed a pattern similar to that of PDC activity among the different strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Collectively, these data establish a specific and prominent role of FoSir5 in FoDLAT decrotonylation and PDC enzymatic inactivation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>FoSir5 directly regulates the expression of genes related to aerobic respiration through H3K18 decrotonylation</title><p>Subcellular fractionation showed a small portion of FoSir5 in the nuclei, and FoSir5 could remove crotonyl groups from histones in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, FoSir5 inactivation caused the accumulation of H3K18cr, but has little effect on H3K18ac or H3K9cr.

To examine this point in more detail, we tested conidial germination of Fo, ΔFoSir5, and ΔFoSir5-C mutant strains. We found that while inactivation of FoSir5 elevated conidial germination, reintroduction of FoSir5 recovered the phenotype of the WT strain. Conversely, overexpression of FoSir5 led to obviously decreased germination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>). Addition of exogenous ATP completely rescued the impeded germination of the OE-1 strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), confirming an important role of ATP in conidial germination. In support of these observations, either K148Q mutation of FoDLAT or overexpression of key genes of the TCA cycle and ATP metabolism including <italic>MDH</italic>, <italic>ATP5H</italic>, and <italic>CYC1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) led to elevated ATP and conidial germination, whereas the K148R mutant strain demonstrated decreased ATP level and germination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>).

In mitochondria, FoSir5 binds and decrotonylates FoDLAT at K148, and this modification inhibits the enzymatic activity of PDC leading to reduced production of acetyl-CoA. At the same time, FoSir5-catalyzed H3K18cr decrotonylation in the nucleus transcriptionally represses the expression of genes participating in the TCA cycle and ETC pathways with acetyl-CoA being the initial substrate. Consequently, the coordinated regulation by FoSir5 in different organelles results in the repression of mitochondrial ATP synthesis.

The information presented here indicates that a sirtuin family protein, FoSir5, functions as a lysine decrotonylase to modulate conidial germination in <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>. As such, these findings greatly expand our understanding of lysine decrotonylases and open up new possibilities for further investigations of the regulatory role of these enzymes.</p><p>The studies described here provide evidence that FoSir5 can modulate ATP synthesis through lysine decrotonylation in different organelles and thus conidial germination of <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>. Specifically, we found that (1) FoSir5 is distributed in different cellular compartments and possesses lysine decrotonylase activity; (2) in mitochondrion, FoSir5 removes a crotonyl group from the K148 residue of FoDLAT, and therefore inhibits PDC activity and acetyl-CoA production; (3) in the nucleus, FoSir5 represses the expression of genes associated with aerobic respiration by decrotonylating H3K18cr; (4) the coordinated regulation by FoSir5 in the mitochondrion and nucleus impacts on ATP synthesis; (5) ATP content is positively associated with conidial germination; and (6) <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> downregulates <italic>FoSir5</italic> level during germination to elevate ATP level required for this process. These findings indicate that fungal pathogens employ an elaborate mechanism to carefully control energy metabolism. The mechanism by which FoSir5 is downregulated during germination is a topic to be explored in future studies, but it is clear that this complex regulatory system serves as a salient example of how eukaryotes can control their development through regulating the action of a lysine decrotonylase.</p><p>Sirtuins are class III KDACs that require NAD for their deacylation activities. Seven sirtuin isoforms (SIRT1-SIRT7) are expressed in mammalian cells. These isoforms display widespread subcellular distributions, as SIRT1, SIRT6, and SIRT7 are nuclear, SIRT2 is predominantly cytoplasmic, and SIRT3-5 are mitochondrial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gertz and Steegborn, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Michishita et al., 2005</xref>). Recent studies have shown both the mitochondrial and extra-mitochondrial localization of SIRT5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Park et al., 2013</xref>), while SIRT1 and SIRT2 can accumulate in the cytosol and nucleus, respectively, under specific circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Byles et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vaquero et al., 2006</xref>). However, the synergistic action of sirtuins among different organelles is poorly characterized. Our findings that SIRT5 simultaneously act on histones in chromatin and enzymes in the mitochondria to modulate ATP generation provide a clear example of coordinated functions of one sirtuin protein in different cellular compartments. With the identification of more lysine deacylases in future research, it is likely that the findings reported here are only the beginning of what will be a widespread phenomenon in eukaryotes.</p><p>By converting pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, PDC is an important gatekeeper that links glycolysis to the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. Therefore, controlling the activity of this enzyme complex impacts on metabolic flux and the efficiency of ATP generation. In mammalian cells, pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatases dephosphorylate the E1α subunit and activate the PDC, while SIRT5-mediated desuccinylation of PDC subunits, including mainly E1α, E1β, and E3, suppresses PDC activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Park et al., 2013</xref>). The data described here provide evidence that FoSir5 decrotonylates the E2 subunit of the PDC at K148 and thus inhibits PDC activity in <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>. All these findings indicate that cells employ a variety of approaches to tightly regulate the activity of PDC. It will be of considerable interest to examine the coordinated effect exerted by different modifications in future studies.</p><p>Conidia are reproductive structures important for both dispersal and survival within harsh environments.

At 0, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hr, the cultures were centrifuged at 12,000× <italic>g</italic> for 15 min and the pellets were collected for RNA extraction. For validation of RNA-seq data, three batches of biological repeats of Fo and ΔFoSir5 were independently collected. RNA was extracted and reverse-transcribed using All-In-One RT MasterMix (abm). qRT-PCR was performed using M5 HiPer SYBR Premix EsTaq (Mei5bio). The transcript abundance of candidate genes was calculated using the 2<sup>−△Ct</sup> method, normalized to <italic>FoEF-1α</italic> (elongation factor 1α).

Briefly, the germinating conidia of different strains were harvested after growth in YPD medium with shaking at 150 rpm for 8 hr in 25°C. The germinating conidia were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde gently shaking for 25 min and then stopped with glycine with a final concentration of 125 mM for another incubation of 10 min. After cleaning with sterile water for several times, the cultures were frozen and ground with liquid nitrogen. The powder was re-suspended in the lysis buffer (250 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM DTT, 0.1% deoxycholate, and 1% Triton) and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) with a conidia/buffer ratio as 0.2 g/2 ml. The DNA was sheared into ~500 bp fragments using sonicator (Bioruptor Plus CHIP, ultrasonication for 30 s and stop for 30 s, 10 times). The supernatant was diluted after centrifugation with ChIP dilution buffer (1.1% Triton X-100, 16.7 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1.2 mM EDTA, 167 mM NaCl). Immunoprecipitation was conducted using 5 µl anti-GFP antibody (ab290, Abcam) or 5 µl anti-H3K18cr antibody (PTM-517, PTM Biolabs) together with protein A agarose (Roche) overnight at 4°C. After separation, beads were washed orderly by low-salt wash buffer (150 mM NaCl, 0.2% SDS, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 2 mM EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100), high-salt wash buffer (500 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.2% SDS, 0.5% Triton X-100), LiCl wash buffer (0.25 M LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0), and TE buffer. DNA bound to the beads was then eluted and precipitated. ChIP-qPCR was independently repeated three times. Relative enrichment values were calculated by dividing the immunoprecipitated DNA by the input DNA and internal control gene (<italic>β-tubulin</italic>).

The infected plants were transplanted in sterile soil-vermiculite mixture (1:1 ratio) and kept in plant growth chamber at 25°C and 90% relative humidity (RH). Severity of disease symptoms was recorded and scored according to the values ranging from 1 to 5: (1) few symptoms, only first true leaf necrotic or curled; (2) clear symptoms, first three leaves developed symptoms; (3) severe symptoms, leaves necrotic and curled, defoliation, growth retardation; (4) rotted plant but still alive; (5) dead plant. Disease index was calculated using the following formula: Disease index=Σ (number of leaves in each disease grade × grades value)/(total number of assessed leaves × the highest grade value) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yuan et al., 2019</xref>). This inoculation experiment was repeated twice to verify consistency in the observed results. qRT-PCR analysis of <italic>F. oxysporum EF-1α</italic> transcript levels was performed using tomato plants harvested after 14-day infection with different strains. The expression of tomato <italic>RCE1</italic>, a constitutively expressed gene, was used as a control for the use of equal amounts of RNA for RT-PCR.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Methodology, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Funding acquisition, Software</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Funding acquisition, Software, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Supervision, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Putative FoSir5 interacting proteins.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-75583-supp1-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>RNA-seq gene expression data.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-75583-supp2-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>Primers used in the study.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-75583-supp3-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-75583-transrepform1-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>The RNA-seq raw reads are available in NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database with the accession number of PRJNA687117.</p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31972213 and 32102149), the Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation (ZR2019BC070 and ZR2020KC003), Shandong Province 'Double-Hundred Talent Plan' (WST2018008), and Taishan Scholar Construction Foundation of Shandong Province (tshw20130963).

K148cr was the only Kcr site identified by MS in our analysis. Although some other lysine residues in FoDLAT are also susceptible to crotonylation as indicated by the results, we haven’t found them, probably due to low abundance of these modified sites or technical limitation of the detection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Could other histone modifications be removed or other histone lysine residues be targeted by FoSIRT5?

We tested for the modifications with anti-H3K18ac and anti-H3K9cr as suggested, and observe that FoSir5 has little effect on these modifications (Figure 3A, line 250-251).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Increased and decreased pathogenicity of d-FoSIRT5 and OE-FoSIRT5, respectively, is likely due to increased and decreased germination rates (lines 324-325 and 397).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, and we have changed the text accordingly (line 351-353).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Strengths: the authors present FoSIRT5 decrotonylates a subunit of the fungal pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (FoDLAT) at K148 and histone H3K18 which affects acetyl-CoA levels and ATP contents.</p><p>Weaknesses: the authors only show the correlations of FoSIRT5 functions in conidial germination in F. oxysporum, which might be involved with decrotonylating the PDC subunit and H3K18.</p><p>The claims are not fully supported by their data.</p><p>1) No direct evidence to show FoSIRT5 decrotonylates FoDLAT at K148 by specific antibody or MS/MS data, like the histone H3K18.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to the reviewer’s constructive comments. To address the reviewer’s concern, FoDLAT K148 site-specific crotonylation antibody (anti-K148cr-FoDLAT) was generated by using a FoDLAT crotonylated peptide (KEEKSESK(cr)SESASAC) as an antigen. The Western analyses with the antibody detected signals with only the wild-type (WT) FoDLAT but not the Q and R mutants, indicating that K148 is indeed crotonylated in vivo (Figure 2C and D). We also found that inactivation and overexpression of FoSir5 led to significantly increased and decreased K148 crotonylation of WT FoDLAT, respectively (Figure 2C and D). Besides, FoSir5 also plays a role in the decrotonylation of FoDLAT K148cr in vitro (Figure 2E). These data demonstrate that FoSir5 is responsible for K148 decrotonylation of FoDLAT. Changes have been made accordingly in the revised manuscript (line 209-222, 579-583).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The author should show whether the crotonylated levels of FoDLAT-K148 alteration during conidial germination in F. oxysporum. Moreover, how is the K148Q/R- FoDLAT affect the germinating conidia?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the concerns. (1) Based on the suggestions, we immunoprecipitated FoDLAT-GFP proteins at different time points during germination and detected the crotonylation level of K148 using anti-K148cr-FoDLAT. As shown in Figure 4A, the K148cr of FoDLAT exhibited a rapid growth at 8 hpr and kept a relatively high level afterwards (12-24 hpi). (2) We have already demonstrated in Figure 5E and F that K148Q mutation of FoDLAT led to elevated ATP and conidial germination, whereas the K148R mutant strain demonstrated decreased ATP level and germination.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) How are the ChIP assays of FoSIRT5 during conidial germination?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the query. We have demonstrated that FoSir5 is responsible for decroronylation of H3K18cr. During conidial germination, (1) <italic>FoSir5</italic> expression decreased; (2) the level of H3K18cr was elevated; (3) the target genes directly regulated by FoSir5 and H3K18cr showed increased expression. Thus, we speculated that declined enrichment of FoSir5 in these genes happened during germination. As suggested by the reviewer, we performed the ChIP assays during conidial germination using anti-GFP antibody in FoSir5-GFP strain driven by the native promoter. The results illustrated that declined enrichment of FoSir5 in promoter regions of 8 energy-related genes was observed during germination (Figure 4F, line 293-294).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 4 only presents the correlations of ATP production during conidial germination, with no direct data to introduce the deletion or OE FoSIRT5 during the germination process.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this point. As suggested, we have now measured the ATP content in FoSir5 mutant and overexpression strains. The results show that ΔFoSir5 and OE-1 exhibit a continuous high and low level of ATP during the whole germinating process, respectively (Figure 4—figure supplement 1), further confirming the relationship between FoSir5 and ATP. Changes have been made to the text (line 298-301).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The quality of most of the figures is not high, such as low resolutions of fluorescence microscopy data, bar graph figures are lack labeling of the p-value. In figure 2—figure supplement 1. the MS data should highlight the b4 – b3 peaks to reach the Kcr value. In figure D no K148 crotonylation site in the model of FoDLAT.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for pointing this mistake out. It has been corrected in the new figures with higher resolution.</p><p>As presented in many related articles (Bulgarelli, Rott et al., 2012, Chen, Wang et al., 2018, Nützmann, Reyes-Dominguez et al., 2011, Sarikhani, Mishra et al., 2018), we perform statistical analysis as follows: the different letters above the mean values of three replicates indicates a significant difference between different samples (p &lt; 0.05, ANOVA) and the double asterisks represent p &lt; 0.05 (t-test). We can provide the p value if needed.</p><p>Upon the reviewer’s request, we highlighted the b3 and b4 peaks in new Figure2—figure supplement 1B.</p><p>The model of the FoDLAT domains were predicted based on homology templates in human and yeast. Unfortunately, crystal structure of FoDLAT between aa. 126-183 was missing, probably due to the lack of filamentous fungi templates information. As an alternative, we marked this area with a dotted line and pentacle indicates the K148 crotonylation site in new Figure2—figure supplement 1C.</p><p>References:</p><p>Bulgarelli D, Rott M, Schlaeppi K, Ver Loren van Themaat E, Ahmadinejad N, Assenza F, Rauf P, Huettel B, Reinhardt R, Schmelzer E, Peplies J, Gloeckner FO, Amann R, Eickhorst T, Schulze-Lefert P (2012) Revealing structure and assembly cues for Arabidopsis root-inhabiting bacterial microbiota. <italic>Nature</italic> 488: 91-5</p><p>Chen Y, Wang J, Yang N, Wen Z, Sun X, Chai Y, Ma Z (2018) Wheat microbiome bacteria can reduce virulence of a plant pathogenic fungus by altering histone acetylation. <italic>Nat Commun</italic> 9: 3429</p><p>Du J, Zhou Y, Su X, Yu JJ, Khan S, Jiang H, Kim J, Woo J, Kim JH, Choi BH, He B, Chen W, Zhang S, Cerione RA, Auwerx J, Hao Q, Lin H (2011) Sirt5 is a NAD-dependent protein lysine demalonylase and desuccinylase. <italic>Science</italic> 334: 806-9</p><p>Nützmann HW, Reyes-Dominguez Y, Scherlach K, Schroeckh V, Horn F, Gacek A, Schümann J, Hertweck C, Strauss J, Brakhage AA (2011) Bacteria-induced natural product formation in the fungus Aspergillus nidulans requires Saga/Ada-mediated histone acetylation. <italic>Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A</italic> 108: 14282-7</p><p>Sarikhani M, Mishra S, Maity S, Kotyada C, Wolfgeher D, Gupta MP, Singh M, Sundaresan NR (2018) SIRT2 deacetylase regulates the activity of GSK3 isoforms independent of inhibitory phosphorylation. <italic>eLife</italic> 7</p></body></sub-article></article>
