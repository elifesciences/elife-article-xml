BCO1 activity is associated with the reduction of plasma cholesterol in humans and mice, while dietary β-carotene reduces hepatic lipid secretion and delays atherosclerosis progression in various experimental models.

To explore the direct implication of dietary β-carotene on regulatory T cells (Tregs) differentiation, we utilized anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody infusions. Our data show that β-carotene favors Treg expansion in the plaque, and that the partial inhibition of Tregs mitigates the effect of β-carotene on atherosclerosis resolution.

These particles ultimately lead to the production of chemoattractant cues for circulating monocytes that transmigrate across the endothelial layer to reach the intima and then differentiate to macrophages to become cholesterol-laden foam cells. During lesion development, macrophages promote local inflammation and plaque weakening by degrading extracellular matrix components such as collagen fibers, which can evolve in the rupture of the lesion and thrombus formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Newby et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Conventional therapies aim to lower plasma cholesterol to mitigate the progression of atherosclerosis. Novel strategies are currently under development to stimulate the resolution of plaque inflammation more directly, and eventually a reduction in lesion size, in a process named atherosclerosis regression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Goldberg et al., 2020</xref>). Among these strategies, the modulation of CD4<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells (Tregs) number is gaining interest over the past years since the discovery that regressing lesions are enriched in Tregs, where they promote plaque stabilization and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Andersson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Witztum and Lichtman, 2014</xref>). Tregs typically express the surface marker CD25, which has been utilized to target and eliminate Tregs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Onda et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sharma et al., 2020</xref>). However, strategies to deplete CD25<sup>+</sup> Tregs do not affect CD25<sup>-</sup> Tregs, which possess similar immunomodulatory properties as CD25<sup>+</sup> Tregs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Couper et al., 2007</xref>). Among the different Tregs markers, the forkhead box P3 (FoxP3) acts as lineage specification factor regulating gene expression of proteins implicated in the immunosuppressive activity of these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fontenot et al., 2005</xref>). Cell culture studies show that retinoic acid, the transcriptionally active form of vitamin A, promotes Treg differentiation by upregulating FoxP3 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Elias et al., 2008</xref>); however, whether dietary vitamin A affects Tregs during atherosclerosis development and resolution remains unanswered.</p><p>Humans obtain vitamin A primarily from β-carotene and other provitamin A carotenoids present in most fruits and vegetables. Upon absorption, provitamin A carotenoids are cleaved by the action of β-carotene oxygenase 1 (BCO1), the limiting enzyme in vitamin A formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">von Lintig and Vogt, 2000</xref>). Our data show that the enzymatic activity of BCO1 mediates the bioactive actions of β-carotene in various preclinical models of obesity and atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hessel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Amengual et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Amengual et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lobo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Coronel et al., 2022</xref>).

We also reported that subjects harboring a genetic variant linked to greater BCO1 activity were associated with a reduction in plasma cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Amengual et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we tested the effect of dietary β-carotene on atherosclerosis resolution in two independent experimental models.

To achieve these lesions, we utilized two distinct mouse models of atherosclerosis in combination with WD-VAD. In our first model, we established LDLR deficiency in wild-type mice by injecting anti-sense oligonucleotide targeting the low-density lipoprotein receptor (ASO-LDLR) weekly for a period of 16 wk. The characteristics of the plaques before undergoing resolution were established by sacrificing a subset of mice after 16 wk on diet (baseline). The remaining mice were injected once with SO-LDLR to promote atherosclerosis resolution and divided into two groups fed either WD-VAD (resolution–control) or WD-β-carotene (resolution–β-carotene). Mice were harvested 3 wk after SO-LDLR injections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>β-Carotene accelerates atherosclerosis resolution in wild-type mice infused with antisense oligonucleotide targeting the low-density lipoprotein receptor (ASO-LDLR).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Four-week-old male and female wild-type mice were fed a purified Western diet deficient in vitamin A (WD-VAD) and injected with ASO-LDLR once a week for 16 wk to induce atherosclerosis.

For the remaining outcomes (plasma lipid profile, retinoid levels, and plaque composition), we did not observe sex differences in any of our experiments, and therefore, we combined results from both sexes. Both resolution groups, independently of β-carotene, showed drastic reduction in total plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels in comparison to the baseline group. HDL-C levels remained constant between groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Using pooled samples, we compared plasma cholesterol and triglyceride partitioning between groups by fast performance liquid chromatography (FPLC). Very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and LDL fractions in both resolution groups showed a comparable reduction in total cholesterol and triglyceride content in comparison to baseline mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). Lipid normalization was accompanied by the upregulation of hepatic LDLR expression at the mRNA and protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>).</p><p>Despite mice being fed a WD-VAD for several weeks, HPLC measurements of circulating vitamin A and hepatic retinoid stores ruled out vitamin A deficiency in any of the experimental groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref>). However, mice fed WD-β-carotene showed an increase in hepatic vitamin A content in comparison to those fed WD-VAD, which was mediated by the conversion of β-carotene to vitamin A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Hepatic <italic>Cyp26a1</italic> expression, which is commonly utilized as a surrogate marker of vitamin A and retinoic acid production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Emoto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abu-Abed et al., 2002</xref>), appeared upregulated in response to WD-β-carotene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>To determine the effect of β-carotene supplementation on atherosclerosis resolution, we examined lesion size and composition at the level of the aortic root (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Lesion area remained constant among the three experimental groups as previously reported in mice treated with ASO-LDLR under similar experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Basu et al., 2018</xref>). We next examined plaque composition by focusing on two parameters commonly utilized as a surrogate indicators of atherosclerosis resolution: CD68<sup>+</sup> area, a myeloid (macrophage) marker that represents plaque inflammation, and collagen area, a marker of plaque stability in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Libby and Aikawa, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Soehnlein and Libby, 2021</xref>). In comparison to baseline mice, the lesions of resolution–control and resolution–β-carotene groups presented a reduction in CD68 content of approximately 36 and 45%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). The collagen content in lesions increased in both resolution groups in comparison to baseline, reaching statistical significance only in the β-carotene-fed mice. In this group, we observed 215 and 60% increase in collagen content compared to the baseline and the resolution–control groups, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). Lastly, we plotted the relative CD68 and collagen contents in the lesion to perform a descriptive discriminant analysis. Individual samples from three distinct experimental groups clustered together, highlighting significant differences between the three experimental groups for all the comparisons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>).</p><p>To validate the results obtained in our ASO-LDLR reversible model of atherosclerosis, we utilized <italic>Ldlr<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice fed WD-VAD subjected to a dietary switch strategy to lower cholesterol in plasma and promote atherosclerosis resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Amengual et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yu et al., 2017</xref>).

This discrepancy could be attributed to the duration of the β-carotene feedings: 12 wk in our progression study vs. 3–4 wk in our resolution studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>).

Exogenous retinoic acid promotes alternative macrophage activation in various cell culture models, and skews naïve T cells to anti-inflammatory Tregs by directly upregulating the transcription factor FoxP3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">He et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mucida et al., 2007</xref>).

Studies carried out by Loke’s group highlighted the interplay between alternative macrophage activation and Treg differentiation, a process that was proposed to be mediated by the production and release of retinoic acid by the macrophage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gundra et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Broadhurst et al., 2012</xref>). This hypothesis has not been demonstrated to date, partially due to the technical difficulty to quantify retinoic acid production in biological samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kane et al., 2008</xref>). We recently overcame this limitation and demonstrated for the first time that alternatively activated macrophages produce and release retinoic acid in a STAT6-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pinos et al., 2023</xref>). We also demonstrated that exogenous retinoic synergizes with interleukin 4 (IL4) to stimulate the expression of arginase 1, which is considered an anti-inflammatory marker in murine macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pinos et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Murray et al., 2014</xref>). Arginase 1 catalyzes the production of ornithine, which is a precursor of proline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Szondi et al., 2021</xref>). Together with its derivative hydroxyproline, proline is a key limiting amino acid in the synthesis of collagen. These results indicate that the combination of retinoic acid with anti-inflammatory signals typically present during regressing lesions could favor atherosclerosis resolution by stimulating collagen deposition by the macrophage.</p><p>Our PCR data in liver homogenates show β-carotene supplementation upregulates Cyp26a1 expression in the liver, which, together with Cyp26b1 and Cyp26c1, are widely considered as surrogate markers for retinoic signaling in tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abu-Abed et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ross and Zolfaghari, 2011</xref>).

To examine whether β-carotene also stimulates retinoic acid signaling in the atherosclerotic lesion, we stained the lesions of <italic>Foxp3<sup>EGFP</sup></italic> mice with Cyp26b1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H and I</xref>). Among the three Cyp26s, we selected Cyp26b1 based on our recent RNAseq data in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages exposed to retinoic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pinos et al., 2023</xref>). We observed that Cyp26b1 was the only Cyp26 family member responsive to retinoic acid in macrophages. Our immunostaining showed that Cyp26b1 co-localizes with the macrophage marker CD68, in agreement with results obtained in human lesions showing that CYP26B1 are present in macrophage-rich areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Krivospitskaya et al., 2012</xref>). This study also reported an association between aggravated atherosclerosis with an SNP in the <italic>CYP26B1</italic> gene with a greater retinoic acid catabolic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Krivospitskaya et al., 2012</xref>). These data suggest that greater retinoic acid levels in the lesion could decrease atherogenesis in humans, in agreement with our preclinical findings.</p><p>Despite the upregulation of Cyp26b1 expression, Treg expansion in regressing lesions in response to β-carotene was partially suppressed in mice injected with anti-CD25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). To rule out intact β-carotene as the driving factor responsible for these effects, we quantified the number of Tregs in our experiment using <italic>Bco1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. As expected, both resolution groups displayed a greater number of Tregs in comparison to baseline mice, although we did not observe any effect in response to β-carotene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>). These data suggest that vitamin A formation is required for Treg expansion in the atherosclerotic lesion of mice. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that a dietary intervention with a nutrient administered at physiological concentrations can modulate Treg levels in the atherosclerotic lesion. As a reference, our diets were supplemented with 50 mg of β-carotene/kg in comparison to 80 mg of β-carotene/kg in carrots (USDA Database).</p><p>Our HPLC analyses in liver and plasma revealed that our experimental approach did not result in vitamin A deficiency despite feeding our mice vitamin A-deficient diets for several weeks to develop atherosclerosis. This was not surprising since mice are notably resistant to vitamin A deficiency. Protocols to develop vitamin A deficiency in wild-type mice require feeding the dams a vitamin A-deficient diet during pregnancy through weaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gundra et al., 2017</xref>), although the use of genetic models lacking key proteins in vitamin A transport, uptake, or storage are more adequate and time-efficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Quadro et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">O’Byrne et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Amengual et al., 2014</xref>). Future experiments utilizing these genetic models could shed light on the role of vitamin A deficiency on Treg expansion and its consequence on atherosclerosis resolution.</p><p>To establish a direct link between the effect of β-carotene supplementation and Tregs in our experimental model, we decided to deplete Tregs in <italic>Foxp3<sup>EGFP</sup></italic> mice by infusing them with anti-CD25, following Sharma and colleagues’ approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sharma et al., 2020</xref>).

Therefore, strategies targeting FoxP3<sup>+</sup> cells directly are an attractive approach to specifically dissect the role of Tregs in our experimental model. For example, the use of <italic>Foxp3<sup>DTR</sup></italic> mice (#016958, Jackson Labs), which express the diphtheria toxin receptor, would allow us to specifically deplete FoxP3<sup>+</sup> cells independently of the expression of CD25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kim et al., 2007</xref>). This approach would also eliminate CD8<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>FoxP3<sup>+</sup> Tregs, a relatively new Treg subpopulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Churlaud et al., 2015</xref>). However, Treg depletion in <italic>Foxp3<sup>DTR</sup></italic> mice requires injections with diphtheria toxin, which can result in potential adverse effects under certain experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Christiaansen et al., 2014</xref>). Future studies dissecting the contribution of T cell subpopulations and the role vitamin A and other nutrients could play in their differentiation are needed to fully understand their role during atherosclerosis resolution.</p><p>Whether β-carotene supplementation during atherosclerosis resolution alters Treg content in other organs and disease models was outside the scope of this study. For example, an increase in Treg number in developing tumors could result in the reprogramming of pro-inflammatory macrophages toward resolving macrophages that could contribute to tumor expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ohue and Nishikawa, 2019</xref>). In summary, partial Treg depletion was sufficient to mitigate the effects of β-carotene on plaque composition during the resolution of atherosclerosis, providing a direct link between β-carotene and Treg number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–I</xref>).</p><p>Another question remains unanswered: what is the source of vitamin A that favors Treg expansion in the lesion? Our HPLC analyses show that circulating β-carotene in wild-type mice is marginal, although hepatic vitamin A stores highlight an increase in vitamin A formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 1H and 3A and B</xref>). It is not clear whether naïve T cells express BCO1, which would enable them to locally produce vitamin A and its derivative retinoic acid. Previous work has related tissue macrophages as responsible for retinoic acid production and suggested that these cells would release it to signal nearby naïve T cells, which, in turn, could differentiate into Tregs. Retinoic acid could have originated from β-carotene or retinol/retinyl esters stored in the cell, although our RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that BCO1 expression in plaque macrophages is relatively limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). Plaque macrophages, and T cells to a lesser extent, express various scavenger receptors that have been linked to the uptake of retinoids and carotenoids such as the scavenger receptor class BI, lipoprotein lipase, and the cluster of differentiation 36 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Reboul, 2019</xref>). Determining whether naïve T cells rely on plaque macrophages to obtain retinoids and activate FoxP3 to differentiate into Treg is not clear to this day.</p><p>In summary, we report for the first time that vitamin A production from β-carotene favors Treg expansion in the atherosclerotic lesion, a process that contributes to atherosclerosis resolution. Together with the cholesterol-lowering effects of β-carotene described in the past, it unveils a dual role of dietary β-carotene and the enzyme BCO1: (1) BCO1 delays atherosclerosis progression by reducing plasma cholesterol and (2) favors atherosclerosis resolution by modulating Treg levels and macrophage polarization status.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal husbandry and diets</title><p>All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign.

Total lesion area, CD68<sup>+</sup>, and collagen-positive areas were quantified using ImageJ software (NIH).</p><p>Aortic root sections were fixed in 10% formalin, permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 in phosphate buffer, and stained using anti-FoxP3 (clone MF-14; BioLegend), anti-GFP (Cat# ab290; Abcam), anti-CD25 (clone IL2R.1; Thermo Fisher Scientific), anti-arginase 1 (Cat# 16001-1-AP; Thermo Fisher Scientific), anti-Cyp26b1b (Cat# 21555-1-AP; Thermo Fisher Scientific), and anti-Ki67 (clone SP6; Abcam). EdU+ cells in the lesion were visualized using Click-IT EdU Imaging Kit (Invitrogen). Secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa fluorophores were purchased from Molecular Probes (Life Technologies). Images were taken using a Zeiss Axioscan.Z1 slide scanner (Carl Zeiss). Quantifications were performed using the ImageJ software (NIH).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data represented as bar charts are expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software Inc, San Diego, CA) by one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test. Differences between groups were considered significant with an adjusted p-value&lt;0.05. Sample sizes were estimated based on previous experiments performed in our lab using comparable experimental approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Amengual et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yu et al., 2017</xref>). Experimental samples were codified to prevent bias during analyses. The relationship between the two dependent factors, CD68 and collagen contents, and group differences was evaluated by descriptive discriminant analysis. Briefly, models were fitted under null and alternative hypotheses and goodness of fit was evaluated using the likelihood ratio test with randomized inference (bootstrap; n = 1000 simulations). Simultaneous hypothesis testing was corrected using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Benjamini et al., 2001</xref>). The resulting false discovery rate (FDR) was considered significant with a cut-off &lt;0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

The authors have previously shown that beta carotene reduces atherosclerosis progress and hepatic lipid metabolism, and now they seek to extend these findings by feeding mice a diet with excess beta carotene in a model of atherosclerosis regression (LDLR antisense oligo plus Western diet followed by LDLR sense oligo and chow diet). They show some metrics of lesion regression are increased upon beta carotene feeding (collagen content) while others remain equal to normal chow diet (macrophage content and lesion size). These effects are lost when beta carotene oxidase (BCO) is deleted. The study adds to the existing literature that beta carotene protects from atherosclerosis in general, and adds new information regarding regulatory T-cells. However, the study does not present significant evidence about how beta-carotene is affecting T-cells in atherosclerosis. For the most part, the conclusions are supported by the data presented, and the work is completed in multiple models, supporting its robustness. However there are a few areas that require additional information or evidence to support their conclusions and/or to align with the previously published work.</p><p>Specific additional areas of focus for the authors:</p><p>The premise of the story is that b-carotene is converted into retinoic acid, which acts as a ligand of the ROR transcription factor in T-regs. The authors measure hepatic markers of retinoic acid signaling (retinyl esters, Cyp26a1 expression) but none of these are measured in the lesion, which calls into question the conclusion that Tregs in the lesion are responsible for the regression observed with b-carotene supplementation.</p><p>There does not appear to be a strong effect of Tregs on the b-carotene induced pro-regression phenotype presented in Figure 5. The only major CD25+ cell dependent b-carotene effect is on collagen content, which matches with the findings in Figure 1 +2. This mechanistically might be very interesting and novel, yet the authors do not investigate this further or add any additional detail regarding this observation.

The authors use either LDLR-ko mice or WT mice injected with ASO-LDLR to establish diet-induced hyperlipidemia and promote atherogenesis during 16 weeks, and then they promote resolution by switching the mice for 3 weeks to a regular chow, either deficient or supplemented with b-carotene. Supplementation was successful, as measured by hepatic accumulation of retinyl esters. As expected, chow diet led to reduced hyperlipidemia, and plaque remodeling (both reduced CD68+ macs and increased collagen contents) without actual changes in plaque size. But, b-carotene supplementation resulted in further increased collagen contents and, importantly, a large increase in plaque regulatory T-cells (TREG). This accumulation of TREG is specific to the plaque, as it was not observed in blood or spleen. The authors propose that the anti-inflammatory properties of these TREG explain the atheroprotective effect of b-carotene, and found that treatment with anti-CD25 antibodies (to induce systemic depletion of TREG) prevents b-carotene-stimulated increase in plaque collagen and TREG.</p><p>An obvious strength is the use of two different mouse models of atherogenesis, as well as genetic and interventional approaches. The analyses of aortic root plaque size and contents are rigorous and included both male and female mice (although the data was not segregated by sex). Unfortunately, the authors did not provide data on lesions in en face preparations of the whole aorta.</p><p>Overall, the conclusion that dietary supplementation with b-carotene may be atheroprotective via induction of TREG is reasonably supported by the evidence presented. Other conclusions put forth by the authors (e.g., that vitamin A production favors TREG production or that BCO1 deficiency reduces plasma cholesterol), however, will need further experimental evidence to be substantiated.</p><p>The authors claim that b-carotene reduces blood cholesterol, but data shown herein show no differences in plasma lipids between mice fed b-carotene-deficient and -supplemented diets (Figs. 1B, 2A, and S3A). Also, the authors present no experimental data to support the idea that BCO1 activity favors plaque TREG expansion (e.g., no TREG data in Fig 3 using Bco1-ko mice).</p><p>As the authors show, the treatment with anti-CD25 resulted in only partial suppression of TREG levels. Because CD25 is also expressed in some subpopulation of effector T-cells, this could potentially cloud the interpretation of the results. Data in Fig 4H showing loss of b-carotene-stimulated increase in numbers of FoxP3+GFP+ cells in the plaque should be taken cautiously, as they come from a small number of mice. Perhaps an orthogonal approach using FoxP3-DTR mice could have produced a more robust loss of TREG and further confirmation that the loss of plaque remodeling is indeed due to loss of TREG.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.87430.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Pinos</surname><given-names>Ivan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Illinois Urbana Champaign</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Urbana</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Coronel</surname><given-names>Johana</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Illinois Urbana Champaign</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Urbana</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Albakri</surname><given-names>Asma'a</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Illinois Urbana Champaign</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Urbana</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Blanco</surname><given-names>Amparo</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Illinois Urbana Champaign</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Urbana</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>McQueen</surname><given-names>Patrick</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Illinois Urbana Champaign</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Urbana</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Molina</surname><given-names>Donald</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Illinois Urbana Champaign</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Urbana</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Sim</surname><given-names>JaeYoung</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Illinois Urbana Champaign</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Urbana</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Fisher</surname><given-names>Edward A</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>New York University Grossman School of Medicine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">New York</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Amengual</surname><given-names>Jaume</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Illinois Urbana Champaign</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Urbana</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>eLife Assessment</bold></p><p>This study presents a valuable conceptual advance of how Vitamin A and its derivatives contribute to atherosclerosis.

The authors have previously shown that beta carotene reduces atherosclerosis progress and hepatic lipid metabolism, and now they seek to extend these findings by feeding mice a diet with excess beta carotene in a model of atherosclerosis regression (LDLR antisense oligo plus Western diet followed by LDLR sense oligo and chow diet). They show some metrics of lesion regression are increased upon beta carotene feeding (collagen content) while others remain equal to normal chow diet (macrophage content and lesion size). These effects are lost when beta carotene oxidase (BCO) is deleted. The study adds to the existing literature that beta carotene protects from atherosclerosis in general, and adds new information regarding regulatory T-cells. However, the study does not present significant evidence about how beta-carotene is affecting T-cells in atherosclerosis. For the most part, the conclusions are supported by the data presented, and the work is completed in multiple models, supporting its robustness. However there are a few areas that require additional information or evidence to support their conclusions and/or to align with the previously published work.</p><p>Specific additional areas of focus for the authors:</p><p>1. The premise of the story is that b-carotene is converted into retinoic acid, which acts as a ligand of the RAR transcription factor in T-regs. The authors measure hepatic markers of retinoic acid signaling (retinyl esters, Cyp26a1 expression) but none of these are measured in the lesion, which calls into question the conclusion that Tregs in the lesion are responsible for the regression observed with b-carotene supplementation.</p></disp-quote><p>Answer: We agree with the Reviewer’s comment, which prompted us to quantify the expression of the retinoic acid-sensitive maker Cyp26b1 in the atherosclerotic lesions. Cyp26b1, together with Cyp26a1 and c1, contain retinoic acid response elements (RAREs) in their promoter, and therefore, are highly sensitive to retinoic acid. Indeed, the mRNA/protein expression of Cyp26s are widely considered surrogate markers for retinoic acid levels in cells or tissues.</p><p>We typically use Cyp26a1 as a surrogate marker for retinoic acid signaling in the adipose tissue and the liver, as we did in this study. However, our RNA seq data in murine bone-marrow derived macrophages (mBMDMs) exposed to retinoic acid revealed that Cyp26b1 is the only Cyp26 family member responsive to retinoic acid (PMID: 36754230). Actually, Cyp26a1 or c1 were not expressed in our mBMDMs (data not shown). Unlike the M2 marker arginase 1, Cyp26b1 did not respond to IL-4 (Figure iA). Hence, Cyp26b1 is an adequate marker to evaluate retinoic acid signaling in the lesion of mice, rich in macrophages.</p><p>Before staining the lesions, we validated the Cyp26b1 antibody by staining mBMDMs exposed to retinoic acid (Figure iB).</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>(A) mBMDMs were divided in M0 or M2 (exposed to IL-4 for 24 h), and then treated with either DMSO or retinoic acid for 6 h before harvesting for RNA seq analysis. Exploring the RNA seq dataset, we identified Cyp26b1 as a RA-sensitive gene in mBMDMs (PMID: 36754230). (B) Validation of Cyp26b1 antibody in mBMDMs exposed to retinoic acid confirms the suitability of this antibody for measuring retinoic acid signaling in our experimental settings.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-87430-sa3-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>In the current version of the manuscript, we include the results of Cyp26b1 quantifications (Figure 5H, I), (Lines: 362 - 366). To put these findings in perspective to human studies, we discuss these results with the role human CYP26B1 plays in the atherosclerotic lesion (Lines: 450 - 464).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. There does not appear to be a strong effect of Tregs on the b-carotene induced pro-regression phenotype presented in Figure 5. The only major CD25+ cell dependent b-carotene effect is on collagen content, which matches with the findings in Figure 1 +2. This mechanistically might be very interesting and novel, yet the authors do not investigate this further or add any additional detail regarding this observation. This would greatly strengthen the study and the novelty of the findings overall as it relates to b-carotene and atherosclerosis.</p></disp-quote><p>Answer: As the Reviewer points out, the effects of β-carotene on collagen content are more pronounced than those on CD68 content in the lesion. Indeed, we have observed the majority of the experiments in this manuscript.</p><p>Collagen accumulation in the lesion is a complex process, where smooth muscle cells secrete collagen and plaque macrophages (typically) degrade it. Matrix metalloproteases produced by macrophages contribute to the degradation of collagen, and studies show that retinoic acid regulates the expression of metalloproteinases in various cell types (PMID: 2324527, 24008270). We explored the expression of metalloproteases in macrophages exposed to retinoic acid in our mBMDM RNA seq, but we did not observe any significant result (data not shown).</p><p>Interestingly, M2 macrophages can secrete collagen by upregulating arginase 1 expression. In the current version of the manuscript, we acknowledge this in the results (Lines: 358-359) and in the discussion section (Lines: 443-449).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

We considered displaying our data segregated by sex, although for some experiments, we did not have matching numbers of male and female mice, which could be distracting for the reader.The goal of our study was to analyze changes in plaque composition. Therefore, our experimental approach was designed to study atherosclerosis resolution (plaque composition changes, but not plaque size) instead of atherosclerosis regression (both plaque composition and size change).

For clarity, we rephrased our plasma lipids results for each of our experimental designs (Lines: 230 – 236, 270 – 272, and 288-290). We also include a clarification in the discussion section about the differential effects of β-carotene on plasma lipids when mice undergo atherosclerosis progression and resolution.

In the current version of the manuscript, we stained the aortic roots from Bco1-/- mice for FoxP3.

These new data strengthen our manuscript and now we included these results as a Supplementary Figure 3D, E.

We now acknowledge a second experimental approach would help us confirm our findings employing a blocking antibody targeting CD25. We favored the use of anti-CD25 infusions over other depletion methods based on the experimental protocol carried out by our collaborators in which the examined the effect of Tregs on atherosclerosis regression (PMID: 32336197). The utilization of FoxP3-DTR mice would nicely complement our findings.

Additional discussion and synthesis are required to elaborate on the significance of the findings. For example, the idea of beta carotene supplementation for cardiovascular prevention has attracted attention for years but recent meta-analysis showed no benefit, and, if anything, an increase in cardiovascular events. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) went as far to recommend AGAINST the use of beta-carotene for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.</p><p>In light of the above point and elife editorial policies, please revise the title to include species.</p></disp-quote><p>Answer: Thanks for your feedback. Carotenoid metabolism in mammals is complex, and establishing direct parallelisms between humans and rodents must be done with caution. For example, β-carotene supplementation in humans inevitably results in the accumulation of this compound in plasma, while in rodents, β-carotene is quickly metabolized to vitamin A. Our findings over the years reveal that the effects of β-carotene in mice derive exclusively from its role as vitamin A precursor.</p><p>In the current study, we confirm our previous work utilizing Bco1-/- mice, which are unable to produce vitamin A when fed β-carotene. Then, we observe that vitamin A promotes atherosclerosis resolution in mice independently of alterations in plasma cholesterol in two independent mouse models. Lastly, we utilized anti-CD25 blocking antibodies to deplete Tregs to establish a direct connection between dietary β-carotene/vitamin A and Tregs in the lesion. While this experimental approach failed to completely deplete Tregs, our morphometric assays indicates that these infusions were sufficient to partially mitigate the effect of β-carotene on atherosclerosis resolution.</p><p>Regardless, in the discussion section of our manuscript, we attempt to consolidate our preclinical studies with clinical data (Lines: 374 – 376, and 461 – 464).</p><p>We have also revised the title, as suggested by Reviewer 1.

A common protocol to achieve deficiency in mice requires feeding a vitamin A deficient diet to dams during their pregnancy and lactation to deplete new-born pups of vitamin A stores. Even in that situation, pups display enough vitamin A stores to sustain circulating vitamin A levels to those observed in wild-type mice. In the current version of the manuscript, we have included a paragraph in the discussion to cover this “interesting” aspect. (Lines: 476 – 483).</p></body></sub-article></article>
