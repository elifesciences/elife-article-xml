However, their organization during the acquisition of spatial memory remains less clear. In this study, we used neuronal population voltage imaging to investigate the synchronization patterns of mice CA1 pyramidal neuronal ensembles during the exploration of a new environment, a critical phase for spatial memory acquisition. We found synchronous ensembles comprising approximately 40% of CA1 pyramidal neurons, firing simultaneously in brief windows (~25ms) during immobility and locomotion in novel exploration. Notably, these synchronous ensembles were not associated with contralateral ripple oscillations but were instead phase-locked to theta waves recorded in the contralateral CA1 region. Moreover, the subthreshold membrane potentials of neurons exhibited coherent intracellular theta oscillations with a depolarizing peak at the moment of synchrony. Among newly formed place cells, pairs with more robust synchronization during locomotion displayed more distinct place-specific activities. These findings underscore the role of synchronous ensembles in coordinating place cells of different place fields.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hippocampal CA1</kwd><kwd>synchronous ensembles</kwd><kwd>learning</kwd><kwd>place cells</kwd><kwd>theta oscillation</kwd><kwd>sharp-wave ripple</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00wnb9798</institution-id><institution>National Science and Technology Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOST 110-2320-B-A49A-525</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Bei-Jung</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>CA1 pyramidal neurons exhibit synchronous spiking during movement and pauses in novel environments, reflecting a neural signature of spatial learning.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The establishment of long-term memory involves the initial acquisition and subsequent consolidation of memory traces, processes intricately connected to the modification of synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Takeuchi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Moser et al., 2015</xref>). Synchronous ensembles, characterized by the simultaneous firing of multiple neurons over tens of milliseconds (referred to as population synchrony), play a pivotal role in influencing synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Axmacher et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Paulsen and Sejnowski, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wang, 2010</xref>). The hippocampus, a crucial region for long-term memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Harris et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Squire and Wixted, 2011</xref>), has been a focal point of synchronous ensemble studies. Within the hippocampus, synchronous ensembles are hypothesized to play roles in reactivating and consolidating labile memory traces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">BuzsÃ¡ki, 2015</xref>). However, their organization during memory acquisition remains less understood.</p><p>In the hippocampus, synchronous ensembles among CA1 pyramidal cells (CA1PCs) are predominantly observed during sharp-wave ripples, the brain waves associated with memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">BuzsÃ¡ki, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">NÃ¡dasdy et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cheng and Frank, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dragoi and Tonegawa, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Liu et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Colgin, 2016</xref>). During these events, 10â18% of CA1PCs generate spikes, particularly during offline consummatory behavioral states or sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">BuzsÃ¡ki and da Silva, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Csicsvari et al., 1998</xref>). These synchronous ensembles are biased toward experience-dependent reactivation, consolidating labile memory traces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gillespie et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yagi et al., 2023</xref>). Furthermore, synchronous ensembles firing action potentials in short windows of 10â30 ms enhance information processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Harris et al., 2003</xref>) and discriminate distinct behavioral contingencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">El-Gaby et al., 2021</xref>). Although synchronous ensembles of CA1PCs during offline memory consolidation are well-characterized, their organization during online acquisition of spatial memory, such as when animals enter a new environment and new place cells form, remains unclear.</p><p>Previous studies have identified correlated activities among place cells during theta oscillation, where 1â3% of place cellsâ spikes co-activate in a forward order matching animalsâ trajectory in the theta cycles when animalsâ locations overlap in the place fields of these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Skaggs, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dragoi and BuzsÃ¡ki, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Foster and Wilson, 2007</xref>). Because these place cells fire at distinct theta phases in the same cycle, this coordinated firing operates on the timescale of theta periods (~125ms; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mizuseki and Buzsaki, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">OâKeefe and Recce, 1993</xref>). Population synchrony on shorter timescales (10â30ms) is speculated to be reduced by the presence of theta oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mizuseki and Buzsaki, 2014</xref>).</p><p>The subthreshold membrane voltage (subVm), influenced by synaptic inputs and intrinsic conductances, directly triggers spiking activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lee and Brecht, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Petersen, 2017</xref>). Additionally, properties of subVm support the organization of neuronal representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Giocomo et al., 2007</xref>). Although correlated membrane potentials have been proposed to underlie the synchrony of neuronal ensembles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lampl et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Poulet and Petersen, 2008</xref>), multicellular recordings of subVms have not yet provided direct experimental evidence. Given the intricate interaction among subVm, spiking, and place cell formation, it is crucial to investigate the temporal relationships of sub- and suprathreshold neuronal activities among CA1PCs during novel exploration.</p><p>In this study, we used voltage imaging to investigate the temporal dynamics of sub- and suprathreshold neuronal activities in CA1PCs during novel exploration. Additionally, we implanted electrodes in the contralateral CA1 region to monitor theta and ripple oscillations. We found synchronous ensembles involving approximately 40% of CA1PCs exhibited transient population synchrony and correlated subthreshold membrane potentials when mice ran and stopped in a new maze. Moreover, these synchronous ensembles occurred outside of contralateral ripples (c-ripples) and were phase-locked to intracellular theta oscillations as well as extracellular theta oscillations recorded from the contralateral CA1 region. Notably, cell pairs with stronger synchronous activities established more distinct place fields that overlapped less. In essence, synchronous ensembles facilitated temporal association among place cells representing diverse features of spatial memory. This plastic network, driven by synchronous ensembles, may contribute to the stabilization of place cells, establishing place fields that effectively tile the environment.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To investigate the temporal relationships between neuronal activities during novel exploration, we simultaneously recorded many neurons as animals explored a new environment for the first time. To achieve this, we employed voltage imaging in conjunction with an air-lifted plastic track that allowed mice to explore an environment while remaining head-fixed under a microscope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To ensure a genuinely novel experience, all pre-training and habituation were performed in a separate room distinct from the one where the imaging experiments were conducted. On the day of imaging, the mice were introduced to the recording room for the first time and initially confined to a specific corner of the track (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> top view). Subsequently, as the imaging session commenced, the confinement was lifted, granting mice the freedom to explore the track while imaging was conducted.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Population synchrony during novel exploration.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the behavioral setup for voltage imaging.

Notably, the grand average CCG exhibited heightened spike counts around zero lags, unlike flattened counts calculated from randomly selected cells of different sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the peak in the grand average CCG measured 23Â±14ms (mean Â±s.d., n=71 cells from 5 sessions; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), indicating the timescale of the population synchrony. Furthermore, pairwise CCGs of many cell pairs showed significant peaks compared to jittered data (percentage of significant pairs: 63% (median), n=497 pairs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4A and B</xref>). Among pairs with significant peaks, the absolute values of the peak lags ranged from 0.8 to 4.3ms (25<sup>th</sup>-75<sup>th</sup> percentiles) with a median of 2.1ms, and the FWHM of the peaks ranged from 20 to 46ms (25<sup>th</sup>-75<sup>th</sup> percentiles) with a median of 30ms (n=315 pairs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4C and D</xref>). These results highlight the synchronous spiking between neurons on the millisecond timescale.</p><p>To systematically reveal individual synchronous events, we counted the number of spikes from all simultaneously recorded neurons within sliding windows of 25ms. To compare the summed spikes with controls, we randomly jittered the spike trains to perturb spike timings while maintaining spike rates. We identified moments of population synchrony when spike sums exceeded the average of the jittered spike sums plus four standard deviations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Using the same criterion for event detection, we observed over a 7.8-fold increase in synchronous events in the original data compared to jittered controls (mean event rate: 0.94Â±0.17 Hz for the original data, 0.12Â±0.01 Hz for the jittered data, n=10 segments, p=0.002, <italic>W</italic>=55, Wilcoxon signed-rank test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). The observed population synchrony was not attributable to spikes in complex bursts, as synchronous event rates did not differ significantly with or without the inclusion of later spikes in bursts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1âfigure supplement 5</xref>). Furthermore, we calculated the percentage of neurons participating in these synchronous events to examine the synchronous ensemble sizes. The ensemble sizes ranged from 32% to 53% (25<sup>th</sup>-75<sup>th</sup> percentiles) with a median of 42%, which were larger than the synchronous ensemble sizes associated with ripples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">BuzsÃ¡ki and da Silva, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).

To test whether there is a co-occurrence of synchronous ensembles and c-ripples, we first detected c-ripples from LFP recordings. C-ripples were detected in three of the five recording sessions, and all occurred during immobility (mean c-ripple rate: 0.04Â±0.02 Hz during immobility, 0 Hz during locomotion). In the two recording sessions where we did not detect any c-ripples, we verified the recording quality of the LFP signal by running multiple tests after the recording sessions. C-ripples were identified in the same animals during quality tests, indicating that the absence of c-ripples during novel immobility in the recording session was not due to the deterioration of LFP recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>To visualize both c-ripples and synchronous ensembles, we plotted voltage traces of neurons alongside simultaneously recorded c-ripple oscillations. It was typical for synchronous ensembles to occur far away from c-ripple episodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). To delve into the relationship between neuronal activities and c-ripples, we aligned traces of c-ripple power with population synchrony and c-ripples. In a recording session where 64 synchronous ensembles and 12 c-ripples were detected during immobility, the LFP power at c-ripple frequency (120â240 Hz) exhibited no discernible peaks within any of the synchronous events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, left upper and middle panels). Nevertheless, the same LFP power displayed substantial peaks during every c-ripple event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, right upper and middle panels). A striking contrast between synchronous events and c-ripples was also evident when spiking probabilities during these events were examined. During population synchrony, the mean spiking probability averaged across all cells was high, while the spiking probability was almost zero during c-ripple events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, lower panel). In the three sessions where c-ripples were identified, we calculated the percentages of c-ripple events coinciding with synchronous ensembles and vice versa. Remarkably, there was no co-occurrence of c-ripples and synchronous ensembles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Furthermore, we quantified c-ripple-modulated spiking by calculating the ratio of the difference in mean firing rates during in-c-ripple and out-c-ripple periods to the sum of the mean firing rates during both periods. Indexes of most cells were negative, and a striking 85% of cells displayed c-ripple modulation indexes of â1, indicating complete suppression of their spiking activities during c-ripples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

Furthermore, the membrane voltages triggered by these two categories of spikes showed a significant difference in the hyperpolarization phase of the theta oscillation. Synchronous spikes were situated within cycles of theta oscillations featuring more hyperpolarized troughs than spikes outside synchronous ensembles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1C and D</xref>). Thus, compared to spikes not participating in synchronous ensembles, synchronous spikes showed a more robust modulation by theta oscillation of membrane voltage during immobility and locomotion in the context of novel exploration.</p><p>Notably, phase locking of spikes to their subVm theta oscillation and the synchronous spikes among many neurons suggest that subVms of different neurons would be correlated at the theta frequency. To explore the possibility, we divided the 180 s subVm traces into 1 s segments with 50% overlap and calculated the cross-correlation and magnitude-squared coherence function for each pair of cell segments. Segments were sorted into the immobility or locomotion group based on the animalsâ speed during each segment (kept below 1 cm/s for immobility and above 3 cm/s for locomotion for more than 90% of the time). In total, we analyzed 511 cell pairs from 5 sessions. Indeed, the cross-correlation of subVm between cell pairs revealed a high correlation at zero lag and periodic modulation of the correlation at theta frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Furthermore, the subVm theta coherences were increased in both groups (immobility: 0.50, locomotion: 0.40, median, n=511 pairs) and were negatively correlated with soma distances (immobility: â0.46, locomotion: â0.48, n=511 pairs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Taken together, during novel exploration, CA1PCs generate synchronous activity associated with theta oscillation and exhibit correlated and theta-coherent subVms.</p><p>Correlated intracellular theta and theta-phase locking of the synchronous ensembles raise the question of whether population synchrony among CA1PCs extends beyond synchrony derived from these effects. To address this, we analyzed population synchrony after randomizing the theta cycles during which neurons spiked, while keeping their theta phases unchanged. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2</xref> illustrates a significant reduction in synchronous event rates following theta cycle randomization. The finding indicates spiking at specific theta cycles plays a major role in driving population synchrony.</p><p>To further investigate synchronous ensembles across different datasets, we analyzed publicly available hippocampal recordings âhc-11â from the CRCNS repository (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Grosmark and BuzsÃ¡ki, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Grosmark et al., 2016</xref>), where rats navigated novel mazes for water rewards (see Method). Using our algorithm, we identified a significant number of synchronous ensembles during the first three minutes of novel navigation. On average, the rates of synchronous events were 6.4-fold higher than those detected in jittered controls (mean event rate: 2.0Â±0.3 Hz for the original data vs. 0.32Â±0.03 Hz for jittered data, n=8 sessions, p=0.0078, <italic>W</italic>=36, Wilcoxon signed-rank test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3A</xref>). To assess whether ripple oscillations were associated with these synchronous ensembles, we analyzed ripple event rates and their relationship to population synchrony. During this period, ripple events were infrequent (mean ripple rate: 0.02Â±0.01, n=8 sessions), and ripple power peaked during ripple episodes but remained low at the timings of population synchrony (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3B</xref>). Nevertheless, LFP traces aligned to population synchrony revealed prominent theta oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3C</xref>). Synchronous ensembles were modulated by LFP theta oscillation (modulation strength: 0.30Â±0.04, n=8 sessions, p&lt;0.001), and the timings of individual ensembles were consistently locked to the preferred phase of each session, suggesting a functional coupling of synchronous ensembles to theta oscillations important for information processing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Synchrony between place cells with distinct place tunings</title><p>When animals explore a novel maze, spatially tuned spiking activity can form within a few minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rolotti et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sheffield et al., 2017</xref>). However, how synchronous ensembles organize their spatially tuned activities during novel exploration remains to be determined. Synchronous ensembles, generating spikes coincidently in short intervals, might display correlated spiking at longer time windows that match behavioral timescales of exploration, potentially leading to shared place responses. On the other hand, CA1PCs are interconnected through inhibitory interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">TakÃ¡cs et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">English et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Maccaferri et al., 2000</xref>).

For instance, in an illustrative session depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, the seventh and eighth place cells had highly similar spatial tunings with a correlation coefficient as high as 0.7.

In other words, cell pairs with more precisely co-active spikes during locomotion exhibited more distinct place-tuning profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>). This anti-correlation between synchronization strength and place tunings indicates coordination between place cells' temporal and spatial coding.

Thus, place cells with distinct place fields are linked by synchronous activity during novel locomotion.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our findings reveal the presence of synchronous ensembles comprising a substantial number of CA1PCs during both locomotion and immobility in a novel environment. These ensembles concurrently engage neurons representing diverse aspects of the environment and are rarely observed during c-ripple events. Instead, they closely align with LFP and intracellular theta oscillations. Our data demonstrate theta-associated synchronous ensembles during spatial memory acquisition, coordinating numerous CA1 place cells that transmit information about different segments of the environment.</p><p>The correlation between observed population synchrony and theta oscillations is intriguing. Theta oscillations are typically associated with the sequential activation of neurons over time, resulting in reduced neuronal synchrony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mizuseki and Buzsaki, 2014</xref>). However, theta oscillations come in different types, each characterized by distinct pharmacological properties and behavioral correlates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kramis et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bland, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">BuzsÃ¡ki, 2002</xref>). For example, type 1 theta, or translational theta, occurs during voluntary movements and is sensitive to N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) blockers. On the other hand, type 2 theta, or attentional theta, is slightly slower and is blocked by muscarinic receptor antagonists, emerging during states of arousal or attention, such as when entering a new environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sainsbury et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sainsbury, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barry et al., 2012</xref>). Consistent with these distinctions, the peak of the power spectrum density shows a distinctively slower theta frequency during immobility compared to locomotion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><p>During theta oscillations, cholinergic neurons in the medial septum excite downstream CA1PCs, leading to increased firing rates and membrane potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nakajima et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Markram and Segal, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Fraser and MacVicar, 1996</xref>). Given the widespread influence of cholinergic inputs on numerous CA1PCs, theta-coupled cholinergic inputs may drive depolarization and firing across many CA1PCs. Additionally, they could enhance the likelihood of synchronicity. Furthermore, GABAergic neurons in the medial septum, activated during theta oscillations, could activate interneurons in the CA1 region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">BuzsÃ¡ki, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">TÃ³th et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Colgin, 2013</xref>). These CA1 interneurons, in turn, have the capability to entrain the activities of pyramidal neurons at both sub- and suprathreshold levels, thereby promoting synchronization among pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cobb et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Stark et al., 2013</xref>). In summary, cholinergic and GABAergic neuron activation during theta waves may contribute to the excitation of CA1PCs and the consequent increase in their synchronicity.</p><p>Theta oscillations have long been implicated in memory acquisition. Specifically, theta power correlates positively with learning performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Landfield et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Berry and Thompson, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Belchior et al., 2014</xref>). Perturbing generation of theta waves leads to impairment in memory acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Winson, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mitchell et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mizumori et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">MâHarzi and Jarrard, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wang et al., 2015</xref>), while electrical stimulation restoring theta rhythms rescues learning performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">McNaughton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lee et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, increased spike-theta coherence correlates with better memory, and stimulations that boost theta phase-locking of spikes enhance memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hasselmo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rutishauser et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Siegle and Wilson, 2014</xref>). Despite abundant evidence supporting a link between theta oscillations and memory, the precise network mechanism by which theta oscillations support memory acquisition remains unclear. Theta oscillations are hypothesized to link spatially distributed neurons into functional ensembles to support memory acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Colgin, 2016</xref>). The identified synchronous ensembles support the hypothesis, providing a network substrate that links theta rhythms to the initial stage of memory acquisition.</p><p>Recent studies have demonstrated elevated coactivity of hippocampal principal cells during theta-associated dentate spikes, events that are temporally coupled to theta oscillations and distinct from sharp-wave ripples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">McHugh et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dvorak et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Farrell et al., 2024</xref>). These findings highlight a network state characterized by rich synchronous ensembles associated with theta, but not ripple, oscillationsâa pattern consistent with our results. Our analyses of publicly available data further support these observations, revealing theta-associated population synchrony in a different dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3</xref>). These results suggest that hippocampal neurons achieve synchrony through network mechanisms distinct from ripple-related events, reinforcing the hypothesis that this phenomenon is generalizable across experimental conditions and behavioral contexts.</p><p>Previous studies have reported that a small percentage of CA1PCs generate spikes during ripple episodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">BuzsÃ¡ki, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">BuzsÃ¡ki and da Silva, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yagi et al., 2023</xref>). These measurements are typically conducted in familiar environments. In contrast, when animals are introduced to a novel environment, c-ripple-associated spiking activities are strongly suppressed, and CA1PCs exhibit prominent hyperpolarizing responses in their membrane potentials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4Ai-Ci</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Interestingly, after familiarization training, a larger proportion of CA1PCs display positive c-ripple modulation of spiking activities and depolarizing responses associated with c-ripples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4AiiâCii</xref>). Consistent with the observation of ripple-associated spiking activity in familiar environments, our study underscores the influence of contextual novelty on hippocampal dynamics. Specifically, brain states associated with novelty may modulate the activity of neurons upstream of CA1PCs, driving their membrane potentials toward hyperpolarization during c-ripples. While the reduced correlation between c-ripples and spikes in novel environments may initially appear counterintuitive, this unique neuronal activity pattern likely reflects adaptive changes in hippocampal circuits related to the animalsâ behavioral states, such as heightened vigilance in novel environments.</p><p>While contralateral LFP recordings can capture large-scale hippocampal theta and ripple oscillations, they do not fully reflect ipsilateral-specific dynamics, such as variations in theta phase alignment or locally generated ripple events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">BuzsÃ¡ki et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Szabo et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Huang et al., 2024</xref>). Given that ripple oscillations can emerge locally and independently in each hemisphere, interpretations based on contralateral recordings must be made with caution. Further studies incorporating simultaneous ipsilateral field potential recordings will be essential to more precisely understand local-global network interactions. Despite these considerations, our findings provide robust evidence for the existence of synchronous neuronal ensembles and their role in coordinating newly formed place cells. These results advance our understanding of how synchronous neuronal ensembles contribute to spatial memory acquisition and hippocampal network coordination.</p><p>Although CA1PCs are known to exhibit weaker recurrent connectivity than that of CA3 pyramidal neurons, CA1PCs did communicate through monosynaptic connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Deuchars and Thomson, 1996</xref>). These connections can be dynamically adjusted by the spike-timing-dependent plasticity mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Caporale and Dan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Markram et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bi and Poo, 1998</xref>), and therefore could be affected by the transient population synchrony. In addition, CA1PCs are known to communicate through inhibitory interneurons. Multiple pyramidal neurons converge onto a single interneuron, and individual connections are often weak and unreliable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">English et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ali et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ali et al., 1998</xref>). This connectivity scheme requires multiple pyramidal neurons spiking synchronously within the time window of synaptic integration to effectively activate postsynaptic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">English et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, population synchrony among CA1PCs may propagate to downstream areas, synchronizing neurons outside the hippocampus. With their large ensemble sizes, these synchronous ensembles may synergistically convey relevant information or reorganize the connectivity of the neuronal networks.</p><p>Prior studies in sensory systems have commonly revealed that neurons with synchronous activities typically share similar sensory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alonso et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Engel et al., 1991</xref>). However, the synchronous ensembles we have identified often encompass neurons with distinct preferences for place fields. Pairwise synchrony demonstrates a negative correlation with place field overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). These findings indicate that synchrony does not necessarily imply similar tunings between neurons. Furthermore, these synchronous ensembles involve place cells encoding different spatial information. Recognizing the crucial role of neuronal synchrony in binding distributed neurons in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Axmacher et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wang, 2010</xref>), population synchrony may serve as a mechanism to integrate diverse features of the same environment into a cohesive mental map.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal</title><p>Time-pregnant wild-type C57BL/6 J female mice underwent in utero virus injection of CamkII-cre virus (105558-AAV1, Addgene) into the left side of the lateral ventricles.

For mice subjected to imaging experiments where they explored an air-lifted plastic track, the initial training phase involved acclimating the mice to head fixation and treadmill running, which took place over 3â5 days in a separate room distinct from the recording setup. Following this training, the imaging experiments were conducted. On the day designated for imaging, the mice were introduced to the recording room for the first time just before the imaging session. During the imaging experiments, the mice were securely held in a head-fixed position beneath the microscope and on an air-lifted plastic track that rested on an air table (AirLift, Neurotar; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Subsequently, the gates were opened upon the start of imaging, allowing the mice to explore the new environment during their initial laps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, Top view).

The emission light was separated from the excitation light using a primary dichroic mirror (FF735-Di02â25x36, Semrock), followed by a secondary dichroic mirror (565dclp, Chroma) and an emission filter (FF01-609/57-30-D, Semrock). Each image stack consisted of 100 planes, separated by 2 Î¼m, covering depths from the window surface to 200 um below the surface.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Histological processing and quantification of soma depth</title><p>Mice with Voltron2<sub>552</sub> labeling were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injections of ketamine (250 mg/kg) and xylazine (25 mg/kg) and transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 2 mL/g). The brains were post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight and then washed in PBS. Coronal brain sections, 50 Î¼m thick, were prepared using a VT1200 vibratome (Leica). Sections were mounted with Vectashield mounting medium containing DAPI (VectorLabs) to visualize nuclei. The soma depth of Voltron-labeled cells was measured relative to the border between the <italic>stratum pyramidale</italic> (SP) and the <italic>stratum radiatum</italic>. Depth values were normalized to the thickness of the SP, with larger depth ratios indicating somata located deeper along the radial axis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Voltage imaging preprocessing and spike detection</title><p>Fluorescence intensities were corrected for brain movement using rigid registration. Regions of interest (ROIs) were manually selected by grouping pixels that cover individual somata. Previous studies have described and validated the procedure for imaging preprocessing and spike detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abdelfattah et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Huang et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdelfattah et al., 2019</xref>). In short, the fluorescence intensities of individual neurons were calculated by averaging the fluorescence intensities of pixels from the same ROIs. Bleaching was corrected by calculating the baseline fluorescence (F<sub>0</sub>) at each time point as an average of the fluorescence intensities within Â±0.5 s around the time point. The dF/F was calculated as the F<sub>0</sub> minus the fluorescence intensity of the same time point divided by F<sub>0</sub>. Positive fluorescence transients were detected to identify spikes from the high-passed dF/F traces created by subtracting the dF/F traces from the median-filtered version with a 5 ms window. To simulate the noise of recordings, high-passed dF/F traces were inverted, and the amplitudes of the transients detected from the inverted traces were used to construct a noise distribution of the spike amplitudes. A threshold was set by comparing the amplitudes of the detected transients with the noise distribution of the spike amplitudes to minimize the sum of type I and type II errors. Spikes were first detected when transients were larger than the threshold. Then, spike amplitudes smaller than half of the top 5% spike amplitudes were excluded. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was calculated for each neuron as a ratio of the averaged spike amplitudes over the standard deviation of the high-passed dF/F traces, excluding points 2ms before and 4ms after each detected spike to estimate the quality of the recordings. The crosstalk between ROIs was routinely checked by examining the refractory periods of neurons in auto-correlograms. Only neurons meeting the following criteria were included: (1) SNR larger than 5, (2) full width at half maximum of the spike waveform longer than 0.8ms, (3) mean spike rates higher than 0.1 Hz, (4) distances between soma pairs at least 70 Î¼m. Sessions with at least nine neurons meeting the selection criteria were used for further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Behavioral states of locomotion and immobility</title><p>The periods of locomotion were defined as instances when the animalsâ speed exceeded 3 cm/s, while periods of immobility were determined as instances when the animalsâ speed fell below 1 cm/s.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Mean firing rates during locomotion and immobility</title><p>To calculate the mean firing rates during locomotion, we counted the number of spikes during locomotion periods and divided this number by the total duration of locomotion. Similarly, for mean firing rates during immobility, we calculated the number of spikes that occurred during immobility periods and divided this number by the total duration of immobility.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Correlation between instantaneous firing rate and animal speed</title><p>To estimate the instantaneous firing rates of individual neurons over time, we convolved their spike trains with a Gaussian window of 250ms. Subsequently, we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient between these instantaneous firing rates and the animalâs speed for each neuron.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Grand average cross-correlogram (CCG)</title><p>Grand average CCGs were generated by constructing histograms of relative spike timings between spikes of a reference cell and spikes of all other neurons in the same session as the target cell population. Histograms were binned using 1 ms time bins. Spike counts were normalized by the number of reference spikes times the number of all other neurons. An equal number of cells from different sessions were randomly selected to form the shuffled target cell population to assess the statistical significance of the CCG peaks. Subsequently, grand average CCGs were computed using shuffled spike trains for comparison. Grand average CCGs were calculated using all spikes in the 180 s recording periods, subsets of spikes during immobility periods (immobility grand average CCGs), and subsets of spikes during locomotion periods (locomotion grand average CCGs).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Detection of the population synchrony</title><p>To assess population synchrony, we counted the number of spikes from all neurons within a sliding window of 25ms. To test the significance of the synchrony, we generated surrogate data by jittering spike timings within aÂ±75 ms window 500 times. The means and standard deviations of each sample point were calculated over the jitter population. Population synchrony was detected as peaks when the spike count in the original data exceeded the mean plus four standard deviations of the spike counts in the jittered data. Synchrony was also evaluated in modified spike trains, including those where later spikes in bursts were removed and those where spike times were shuffled across theta cycles while preserving phases. To estimate synchronous event rates, we divided the entire 180 s recordings into halves and calculated the event rate in each of the 90 s segments. Additionally, ensemble sizes were quantified by counting the percentage of neurons participating in each synchronous event.</p><p>To detect population synchrony in a publicly available dataset, we analyzed the âhc-11â dataset from CRCNS, which contains hippocampal recordings from rats running on novel mazes for water rewards at designated locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Grosmark and BuzsÃ¡ki, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Grosmark et al., 2016</xref>). Spikes recorded during the first three minutes of the novel-maze running epochs were used to identify synchronous ensembles and generate jittered control data. Spike counts for both the original and jittered data were calculated using a sliding 25 ms window. The algorithm for testing the significance of synchrony was the same as described above. Synchronous event rates were estimated using the entire 3 min spike trains for both the original and jittered data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Pairwise cross-correlogram (CCG) of neuronal pairs</title><p>To compute the CCG, we first determined the time difference between spikes in the target and reference neurons and then binned these values into 1 ms time bins. CCGs were only computed for pairs with more than 100 counts within the CCG window of Â±500ms to ensure reliable correlation. We defined the peak of the CCG as the local maxima within Â±30ms of lag. To assess the significance of cross-correlations, we generated surrogate data by jittering the spike times of the target neuron within aÂ±75ms window. We computed the CCG peak for a thousand iterations and calculated p-values by comparing the percentile of the peak in the null distribution of the jittered peak values. The synchronization strength was estimated as the ratio between the original CCG peak and the mean spike count of the same bin as the original CCG peak averaged across the jittered histograms. For display purposes, the CCGs were smoothed using a 5-point moving average. CCGs were calculated using all spikes in the 180 s recording periods, subsets of spikes during immobility periods (immobility pairwise CCGs), and subsets of spikes during locomotion periods (locomotion pairwise CCGs).</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>LFP c-ripple analysis</title><p>To detect c-ripples, we performed band-pass filtering of the LFP signal between 120 and 240 Hz, followed by computing the envelope using the absolute values of the Hilbert transform, which was then low-pass filtered at 20 Hz. The start and end times of c-ripples were identified by setting the upper and lower thresholds at the mean plus 7 and 3.5 times the standard deviation of the envelope, respectively. For a c-ripple event to be included, three conditions had to be met: (1) values within the event were higher than the lower threshold, (2) at least one value exceeded the upper threshold, and (3) the minimum duration of the event was 30ms. The start and end times of a c-ripple event were defined as the positive and negative crossings of the lower threshold, respectively. We defined in-c-ripple periods as the time between the start and end of detected c-ripple events, while out-c-ripple periods were periods outside the in-c-ripple periods. The envelope peak values of the detected c-ripple events were used as the time of c-ripple occurrence. These timings were utilized as trigger timings to calculate averages triggered by c-ripples. Two co-occurrences were quantified: the percentages of c-ripple oscillations that occurred with synchronous ensembles and the percentages of synchronous ensembles that occurred with c-ripple oscillations. The same ripple detection algorithm was applied to the hc-11 dataset. To account for artifacts in the recordings, raw traces and power spectra of the detected events were plotted and inspected for false positives.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>C-ripple modulation index</title><p>We utilized the c-ripple modulation index to assess changes in firing rates during c-ripples compared to periods outside c-ripples. This index was computed as the ratio of the difference in mean firing rates during in- and out-c-ripple periods to the sum of the mean firing rates during both periods. Specifically, we first calculated the mean firing rate during in-c-ripple periods and the mean firing rate during out-c-ripple periods. Next, we subtracted the mean firing rate during out-c-ripple periods from the mean firing rate during in-c-ripple periods and divided the result by the sum of the mean firing rates during both periods. The resulting c-ripple modulation index indicates the magnitude and direction of the firing rate modulation during c-ripples compared to periods outside c-ripples. To assess the significance of the modulation index, we shuffled the spike timings and repeated the calculation a thousand times to generate a distribution of modulation indices from the shuffled data. The original modulation index was then compared to this distribution, and its significance was determined if it exceeded the 95% confidence level of the shuffled indices.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>LFP traces triggered by population synchrony and analysis</title><p>The midpoints of the synchronous event intervals were utilized as triggers to align LFP traces from both our recordings and the hc-11 dataset. These traces were aligned within aÂ±1 s window around the trigger time points. To calculate the spectral density functions of the aligned LFP traces, we performed a 16,384-point fast Fourier transform of the 2 s LFP traces. The power spectra were then estimated as the squared absolute values of the Fourier coefficients. C-ripple power was calculated as the sum of the power distributed between 120 and 240 Hz. To calculate theta modulation strength and preferred angles of the synchronous ensembles, LFP was first filtered within the theta frequency range.

To facilitate comparison between neurons, modulation strengths were normalized by the total length of all vectors. The significance of the modulation strength was tested by shuffling the spike timings and recalculating the modulation strength a thousand times to generate a distribution based on the shuffled spike timings. The original modulation strength was then compared to the distribution, with significance determined if it exceeded the 95% confidence interval of the shuffled values.

To examine variations in fluorescence waveforms triggered by spikes within and outside synchronous events, we categorized the fluorescence traces based on whether the spikes occurred within or outside these events. Subsequently, we performed pairwise comparisons of the fluorescence values from the same neuron, concentrating on spikes occurring during corresponding behavioral states. Neurons with four or fewer triggering events in any of these categories were omitted from the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-23"><title>Cross-correlation and coherence analysis to the subVm traces</title><p>To calculate cross-correlation and theta coherence of subVm between pairs of neurons during locomotion and immobility, we initially divided the 180 s subVm traces into 1 s segments with a 50% overlap. These segments were then categorized into the locomotion group if the animalâs speed remained above three cm/s for more than 90% of the time within that segment. Similarly, segments were sorted into the immobility group if the animalâs speed remained below one cm/s for more than 90% of the time within that segment. Subsequently, we computed the cross-correlation and magnitude-squared coherence function of frequency for pairs of co-occurred segments belonging to a specific cell pair. Mean cross-correlations of individual cell pairs were averaged across segments that occurred in the same behavioral states (i.e. locomotion or immobility states). To estimate theta coherence, we averaged the values of the coherence function within the theta frequency range (4â12 Hz). Theta coherences from the same cell pair during the same behavioral state were pooled together, and the average was used as an estimate for the theta coherence of that cell pair during a particular behavioral state. Finally, Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated between the mean theta coherences of cell pairs and their soma distances.</p></sec><sec id="s4-24"><title>Spatial analysis</title><p>We partitioned a 90-cm-long track into 36 spatial bins to analyze spatial tuning properties. For each cell, the spatial tuning curve was computed by determining the mean firing rate, defined as the number of spikes within the bin when the animalâs speed exceeded three cm/s, divided by the total dwell times using the same speed threshold. The peak firing rates were identified as the maximal rate on the spatial tuning curve. Spatial selectivity was calculated as one minus the circular variance of the spatial tuning curve. Neurons were classified as place cells when their spatial selectivity exceeded 0.25, and peak firing rates exceeded 1 Hz. To assess the similarity of spatial tuning between pairs of neurons, Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated for the spatial tuning curves. To explore the relationship between levels of synchronization and spatial tuning similarity among pairs of place cells, Spearman correlation coefficients were computed between synchronization strengths of cell pairs and correlation coefficients of their spatial tuning curves.</p></sec><sec id="s4-25"><title>Data analysis and statistics</title><p>Data analysis was performed using MATLAB (Mathworks, R2019b), and results were presented as standard error of the mean unless otherwise specified.

In this study, using innovative imaging techniques, they examined spike synchrony of hippocampal cells during locomotion and immobility states. The authors demonstrated that hippocampal place cells exhibit prominent synchronous spikes locked to theta oscillations.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The single cell voltage imaging used in this study is a highly novel method that may allow recordings that were not previously possible using existing methods.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for recognizing the strengths of our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The strength of evidence remains incomplete because of the main claim that synchronous events are not associated with ripples. As was mentioned in previous rounds of review, ripples emerge locally and independently in the two hemispheres. Thus, obtaining ripple recordings from the contralateral hemisphere does not provide solid evidence for this claim. The papers the authors are citing to make the claim that &quot;Additionally, we implanted electrodes in the contralateral CA1 region to monitor theta and ripple oscillations, which are known to co-occur across hemispheres (29-31)&quot; do not support this claim. For example, reference 29 contains the following statement: &quot;These findings suggest that ripples emerge locally and independently in the two hemispheres&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>In our previous revisions, we took care to limit our claim to what our data directly supported: that synchronous ensembles of CA1 neurons were not associated with ripple oscillations recorded in the <italic>contralateral</italic> hippocampus. To address reviewer concerns, we changed the Title, modified the Abstract, adjusted relevant text in the Results, and explicitly acknowledged the methodological limitations in the Discussion.</p><p>In this round, we further revised the manuscript to directly address the editorâs and reviewerâs remaining concerns:</p><p>(1) We replaced the word âsurprisinglyâ with a more neutral âMoreoverâ to avoid implying that the observed dissociation was unexpected given the use of contralateral recordings.</p><p>Introduction (line 67-69):</p><p>âMoreover, these synchronous ensembles occurred outside of contralateral ripples (c-ripples) â¦â</p><p>(2) We removed the clause stating that ripples âco-occur across hemispheresâ, along with the associated citation to Buzsaki et al. (2003), to avoid potential misinterpretation. The sentence now simply states that we recorded ripple and theta oscillations in the contralateral CA1.</p><p>Introduction (line 63-64):</p><p>âAdditionally, we implanted electrodes in the contralateral CA1 region to monitor theta and ripple oscillations.â (co-occurrence claim removed)</p><p>(3) We carefully replaced all mentions of âripplesâ in the manuscript with âc-ripplesâ (i.e., contralateral ripples) to ensure that the scope of our findings is clearly defined and cannot be misinterpreted.</p><p>(4) We strengthened the acknowledgment of the methodological limitations in the Discussion.</p><p>Discussion (line 528-533):</p><p>âWhile contralateral LFP recordings can capture large-scale hippocampal theta and ripple oscillations, they do not fully reflect ipsilateral-specific dynamics, such as variation in theta phase alignment or locally generated ripple events (Buzsaki et al., 2003; Szabo et al., 2022; Huang et al., 2024). Given that ripple oscillations can emerge locally and independently in each hemisphere, interpretations based on contralateral recordings must be made with caution. Further studies incorporating simultaneous ipsilateral field potential recordings will be essential to more precisely understand local-global network interactions.â</p><p>These revisions ensure that our manuscript now presents a consistent and appropriately limited interpretation across all sections. We hope these clarifications address all remaining concerns and accurately reflect the scope of our findings.</p></body></sub-article></article>
