response to changes in neuronal activity. While neurons are the main drivers of synaptic plasticity, glial cells are increasingly recognized for their roles as active modulators. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, using <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuromuscular junction (NMJ) as a model system for a tripartite synapse, we show that peripheral glial cells collaborate with neurons at the NMJ to regulate activity-induced synaptic remodeling, in part through a protein called shriveled (Shv). Shv is an activator of integrin signaling previously shown to be released by neurons during intense stimulation at the fly NMJ to regulate activity-induced synaptic remodeling. We demonstrate that Shv is also present in peripheral glia, and glial Shv is both necessary and sufficient for synaptic remodeling. However, unlike neuronal Shv, glial Shv does not activate integrin signaling at the NMJ. Instead, it regulates synaptic plasticity in two ways: (1) maintaining the extracellular balance of neuronal Shv proteins to regulate integrin signaling, and (2) controlling ambient extracellular glutamate concentration to regulate postsynaptic glutamate receptor abundance. Loss of glial cells showed the same phenotype as loss of Shv in glia. Together, these results reveal that neurons and glial cells homeostatically regulate extracellular Shv protein levels to control activity-induced synaptic remodeling. Additionally, peripheral glia maintain postsynaptic glutamate receptor abundance and contribute to activity-induced synaptic remodeling by regulating ambient glutamate concentration at the fly NMJ.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>synaptic plasticity</kwd><kwd>neuron–glia interactions</kwd><kwd>peripheral glia</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01s5ya894</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS102260</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Karen T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01s5ya894</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS080946</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Karen T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Peripheral glia regulate synaptic remodeling at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuromuscular junction by balancing neuron-derived signals and controlling ambient glutamate levels, thereby revealing distinct glial mechanisms in activity-dependent synaptic plasticity.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The nervous system is highly plastic, with the capacity to undergo dynamic alterations in structure and strength in response to changing stimuli and environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lamprecht and LeDoux, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Citri and Malenka, 2008</xref>). This activity-induced synaptic remodeling process is highly conserved across species and plays crucial roles in circuit formation during development, as well as in stabilizing existing connections post-development. Synaptic remodeling represents a finely orchestrated process, with communications across both the pre- and postsynapses to allow the growth of new synapses, and the stabilization and strengthening of existing ones. While much of the research on synaptic plasticity has concentrated on interactions between presynaptic axon terminals and postsynaptic cells, most synapses are tripartite synapses, with glial cells as the third cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Araque and Navarrete, 2010</xref>). Beyond simply providing metabolic support, glial cells are increasingly recognized for their roles as active modulators of synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sancho et al., 2021</xref>). However, the mechanisms by which glial cells and neurons collaborate to coordinate activity-induced synaptic remodeling are not well understood.</p><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a genetically tractable system and a tripartite glutamatergic synapse that serves as an excellent model system to investigate mechanisms underlying activity-induced synaptic remodeling by glial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Banerjee and Bhat, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Freeman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2020</xref>). The peripheral glial cells at the fly NMJ perform some of the key functions similar to mammalian glia, including controlling neuronal excitability and conduction velocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kottmeier et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rey et al., 2023</xref>), recycling of neurotransmitters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rival et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Danjo et al., 2011</xref>), and engulfing and clearing debris during damage to allow the growth of new boutons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fuentes-Medel et al., 2009</xref>). They also release proteins such as transforming growth factor (TGF-β) to support synaptic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fuentes-Medel et al., 2012</xref>), TNF-α (eiger) to influence neuronal survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Keller et al., 2011</xref>), Wingless to regulate GluR clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kerr et al., 2014</xref>), and laminin to control animal locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Petley-Ragan et al., 2016</xref>). Nevertheless, the role of peripheral glia in regulating activity-induced stabilization and remodeling of the existing synapses at the NMJ remains unknown.</p><p>Previous studies on activity-induced synaptic remodeling at the fly NMJ demonstrated that neuronal activity leads to the enlargement of existing boutons, accompanied by increases in postsynaptic GluR abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2024</xref>). Intense neuronal stimulation triggers the release of a protein called Shriveled (Shv) by presynaptic motoneurons, which activates βPS integrin bi-directionally to stimulate synaptic bouton enlargement and elevate GluR levels on the postsynaptic muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). Consequently, <italic>shv</italic> mutants display defective post-tetanic potentiation (PTP), a form of functional synaptic plasticity similar to the early phase of long-term potentiation (LTP) seen in mammalian neurons. Here, we demonstrate that the Shv protein is also expressed in glial cells and is released extracellularly by peripheral glial cells. Glial Shv not only regulates basal GluR clustering but is also required for activity-induced synaptic remodeling. We further demonstrate that while glial Shv is present extracellularly, it does not respond to neuronal activity, nor does it activate integrin signaling, unlike Shv derived from neurons. Instead, glial Shv contributes to synaptic plasticity regulation by modulating the levels of Shv release from neurons and by controlling the levels of ambient glutamate concentration. Restoring ambient glutamate concentration could correct basal GluR abundance and defective synaptic plasticity caused by the loss of glial cells. These results further reveal that regulation of ambient extracellular glutamate concentration by glia is an important mechanism contributing to synaptic plasticity regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Shv is expressed in peripheral glia</title><p>To determine the role of Shv in glia, we first monitored its presence in different cell types.

The peripheral glia can be divided into three subtypes: wrapping glia (WG) is the innermost layer, wrapping and contacting the peripheral nerve bundle; the subperineurial glial (SPG) covers the WG, establishing the blood–brain barrier; the perineurial glia (PGs) is located on the outermost surface of the nerve that is also part of the blood–brain barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Awasaki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stork et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brink et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Freeman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fernandes et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

This activity-induced decrease in glial Shv levels, along with reduced integrin activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), suggests that glial Shv does not act by directly inhibiting integrin signaling. We further investigated whether the decrease in extracellular glial Shv results from altered release. To address this, we monitored intracellular Shv levels using a permeabilized preparation (we found that detergent treatment stripped away extracellular Shv signal). When combined with non-permeabilized extracellular staining, this approach provides insights into total Shv levels. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, there was no intracellular accumulation of Shv and the intracellular levels remained unchanged following stimulation, suggesting that reduced extracellular glial Shv is unlikely due to defects in the release machinery.</p><p>Next, we tested the hypothesis that glial Shv instead influences integrin signaling by regulating Shv release from neurons. To this end, we monitored Shv secreted by neurons or glia using the endogenously tagged Shv-eGFP line and tissue-specific knockdown of <italic>shv</italic>. When <italic>shv</italic> was selectively knocked down in glia, an increase in extracellular Shv-eGFP level was observed at the NMJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), which likely originated from neurons.

A similar compensatory upregulation from glia was obtained when Shv was knocked down in neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). To validate that our staining protocol is selective for extracellular proteins, we also stained for cysteine string protein (CSP), an intracellular synaptic vesicle protein predominantly located in the presynaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zinsmaier et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Umbach et al., 1994</xref>), under the same conditions.

One plausible explanation is that glial Shv is required for normal glial growth or survival.

These observations suggest that glial Shv is not essential for maintaining normal glial structure or survival and is consistent with the idea that glial Shv does not activate integrin, as integrin signaling is required to maintain the integrity of peripheral glial layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xie and Auld, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hunter et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>An alternate possibility is that Shv modulates glial function to rescue activity-induced synaptic remodeling. Glial cells have an established role in providing support and maintaining glutamate homeostasis in the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Augustin et al., 2007</xref>). The <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval NMJ is a glutamatergic synapse with high ambient glutamate concentration in the hemolymph, with an average in the range of 1–2 mM glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2009</xref>). Surprisingly, the larval NMJ does not contain the excitatory amino acid transporter 1 protein (Eaat1), which is essential for removing extracellular glutamate, suggesting that high extracellular glutamate is better tolerated and removed by diffusion through the hemolymph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rival et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2009</xref>). The high ambient glutamate concentration is maintained by the cystine/glutamate antiporter (Cx-T), which imports cystine and exports glutamate into the extracellular milieu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Augustin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grosjean et al., 2008</xref>). The purpose of the high extracellular glutamate is not well understood, but it is thought to control GluR clustering and maintain a reserved pool of GluR intracellularly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2009</xref>). Given that we observed significantly upregulated GluR clustering when Shv was reduced in glia, we hypothesized that glial Shv may influence the levels of ambient extracellular glutamate. To detect glutamate level at the synapse, we took advantage of the GAL4/UAS and LexA/LexAop systems to express the glutamate sensor (iGluSnFR) in neurons while simultaneously knocking down or upregulating Shv in glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marvin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

Despite this increase in GluR expression, we did not observe any change in extracellular glutamate levels, as measured by live imaging using the neuronal iGluSnFR sensor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

This is consistent with an earlier report demonstrating that Rpr expression is sufficient to induce apoptosis and trigger cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">White et al., 1996</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> shows that glial ablation caused the same phenotype as <italic>shv</italic> knockdown in glial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), with elevated basal GluR levels and blocked activity-induced synaptic remodeling. We hypothesized that if a primary role of glial cells in synaptic plasticity regulation is to maintain ambient extracellular glutamate levels, similar to glial Shv, then correcting extracellular glutamate concentration should be sufficient to restore synaptic plasticity, even in the absence of functional glia. Strikingly, incubating NMJs with 2 mM glutamate not only restored basal GluR levels but also rescued activity-induced synaptic remodeling caused by glial ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B, C</xref>). These results are in line with previous reports that showed low ambient glutamate levels significantly elevated GluR intensity at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2009</xref>), but such increase can be reversed by glutamate supplementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Augustin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2009</xref>). Together, these data confirm that the ability of peripheral glial cells to maintain high ambient extracellular glutamate concentrations at the NMJ is crucial for synaptic plasticity.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Acute ablation of glia elevated basal GluR levels and disrupted activity-induced synaptic remodeling, but extracellular glutamate incubation is sufficient to compensate for the loss of glia.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Transient <italic>rpr</italic> expression is sufficient to trigger death of glial cells.

We demonstrate that neurons and glia jointly orchestrate activity-induced synaptic remodeling at the NMJ, with Shv playing a pivotal role. While neurons release Shv in an activity-dependent manner to regulate synaptic remodeling through integrin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2017</xref>), release of Shv by peripheral glial cells does not rely on neuronal activity and does not activate integrin signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>). Instead, glial Shv influences activity-induced synaptic remodeling by keeping the levels of Shv released by neurons in check (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–F</xref>) and controlling ambient extracellular glutamate levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>Our data suggest that one mechanism underlying activity-induced synaptic remodeling by glia is through indirect control of Shv release from neurons, thereby maintaining minimal integrin signaling under ambient conditions. We propose that this low baseline integrin signaling enables neurons to respond with high sensitivity to enhanced integrin activation by Shv release from neurons following neuronal activity, leading to rapid synaptic remodeling. Conversely, knocking down Shv in glia removes this suppression, resulting in increased Shv release from neurons, higher basal integrin signaling, GluR levels, and pathway saturation, thereby inhibiting activity-induced synaptic remodeling. Supporting this, overexpression of Shv in neurons elevated basal pFAK and abolished synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). These findings also raise several intriguing questions, including how neurons and glia distinguish different sources of Shv, and how they sense and communicate this information to regulate extracellular Shv levels from different cells. Based on western blot analyses of adult heads and larval brains showing that Shv is present as a single band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), the functional differences in neuronal or glial Shv are not likely due to the presence of different isoforms. Consistent with this, FlyBase also suggests that <italic>shv</italic> encodes a single isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Öztürk-Çolak et al., 2024</xref>). However, while we did not detect obvious post-translational modifications when Shv protein was expressed in neurons or glia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>), we cannot exclude the possibility that different cell types process Shv differently through post-transcriptional or post-translational mechanisms. Notably, <italic>shv</italic> is predicted to undergo A-to-I RNA editing, including an editing site in the coding region, which will result in a single amino acid change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">St Laurent et al., 2013</xref>). Given that ADAR, the editing enzyme, is enriched in neurons and absent from glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jepson et al., 2011</xref>), it is possible that such cell-specific editing could contribute to functional differences. It will be interesting to investigate this in the future.</p><p>We found that another main function of glial Shv is to regulate ambient extracellular glutamate concentration. We report that overexpression of <italic>shv</italic> elevated ambient glutamate levels at the synapse measured using a genetically encoded glutamate sensor, whereas knockdown of <italic>shv</italic> in glia reduced its level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Furthermore, ablating glia recapitulated the phenotypes of <italic>shv</italic> knockdown in glia, and transiently restoring extracellular ambient glutamate concentration efficiently rescued synaptic plasticity. Based on reports that it has been shown that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval NMJ maintains a surprisingly high ambient extracellular glutamate concentration, with an average in the range of 1–2 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Augustin et al., 2007</xref>). How Shv regulates extracellular glutamate concentration remains to be explored, but a likely mechanism is by affecting the levels or functions of the cystine/glutamate (Cx-T), which imports cystine and exports glutamate into the extracellular matrix. While Shv has been shown to activate integrin, it encodes a homolog of the mammalian DNAJB11 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2016</xref>), which functions as a molecular chaperone vital for proper protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shen et al., 2002</xref>). Shv thus could potentially be required for the proper folding and the function of the Cx-T, which is located on glial cell membrane at the fly NMJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Augustin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grosjean et al., 2008</xref>). Aligned with this, mutations in Cx-T also resulted in elevated basal GluR levels at the fly NMJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Augustin et al., 2007</xref>). Future studies examining the functional interactions between Cx-T and Shv will shed light on mechanisms for Shv-dependent regulation of ambient extracellular glutamate levels at the NMJ.</p><p>How does extracellular glutamate regulate GluR levels and synaptic plasticity? Changes in glutamate levels have been shown to directly impact neurotransmission, glutamate receptor activity, and influence GluR clustering by internalizing the desensitized GluR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Featherstone and Shippy, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yao et al., 2018</xref>). We have also shown that basal GluR level is homeostatically regulated by extracellular glutamate concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). It is plausible that a high extracellular glutamate concentration enables the NMJ to maintain a reserved pool of GluRs that can be readily mobilized to the surface upon neuronal activity. Additionally, activation of GluR and downstream signaling pathways could trigger local protein translation machineries to prime the synapses to respond rapidly to changes in neuronal activity. Future studies examining intracellular mechanisms controlling activity-induced GluR increases will lead to better insights on synaptic plasticity regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Briefly, a target Cas9 cleavage site in Shv was selected at the 3′ end of Shv without obvious off-target sequence in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome using CRISPR optimum Target Finger. The sgRNA target sequence: 5′-<named-content content-type="sequence">GCCGGCGAGCACTTTTATTG</named-content> was cloned into the pU6-BbsI-chiRNA vector (Addgene, #45946). The vector for HDR contains the 5′ homology arm containing Shv genomic region (1000 base pairs at the 3′ end of the Shv gene with the stop codon removed) plus eGFP sequence, and the 3′ homology arm (1020 base pair downstream of the Cas9 cleavage site in the Shv gene region) was cloned into pHD-DsRed (Addgene, # 51434). Both cloned vectors were injected into fly stocks containing Cas9 (BDSC 55821) and positive genome editing screen by the presence of DsRed by BestGene Inc Insertion was confirmed by sequencing and western blots.</p><p>LexAop-Shv RNAi and LexAop-Shv fly lines were generated by subcloning Shv-RNAi hairpin sequence based on VDRC Shv-RNAi design or the coding regions of Shv which contains a V5 tag into the pJFRC19-13XLexAop2-IVS-myr::GFP vector (Addgene, 26224). Both lines were inserted into the X chromosome specific position by microinjecting the plasmid into a P{CaryP}attP18 fly line (BDSC, 32107).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>RU486 feeding</title><p><italic>repo-GeneSwitch</italic> embryos were collected in 3 hr windows and early third-instar larvae (48 hr after larval hatching) were fed with food containing 10 µM RU486 (1:1000, 10 mM stock) or 0.1% EtOH (vehicle control) for 24 hr before dissection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gatto and Broadie, 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Immunochemistry</title><p>Dissection and stimulation of the third-instar larvae fillets were done as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, dissected NMJs were fixed for 3 min at room temperature (RT) with Boutin’s fixative for GluR staining. For all other antibodies, 4% paraformaldehyde was used (25 min at RT). The fixed samples were subsequently washed with either 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (PBST) or with PBS alone for a detergent-free condition. The samples were then blocked with 5% normal goat serum in either PBST or PBS, as specified. Primary antibodies used were: Rabbit anti-pFAK, 1:250 (Invitrogen, 44-624G), Rabbit anti-HA, 1:1000 (Sigma, H6908), Rabbit anti-GluRIIC, 1:1000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2024</xref>), rat anti-Elav, 1:500 (7E8A10, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank at the University of Iowa (DSHB)); mouse anti-Repo, 1:50 (8D12, DSHB); mouse anti-GFP, 1:100 (4C9, DSHB). Cy3/Alexa-647 conjugated anti-HRP, 1:100 for non-permeabilized staining or 1:250 for permeabilized staining (Jackson ImmunoResearch). For iGluSnFR imaging experiments involving <italic>Mhc-GluRIIA</italic>, HRP staining was done after live imaging by incubating with HRP-Cy3 for 5 min. Secondary antibodies used were Alexa Fluor 488 or 405 conjugated, diluted at 1:250 (Invitrogen). For experiments with glutamate incubation, dissected preps were incubated with 2 mM glutamate solution for 1 hr or 10 min before performing stimulation protocol as indicated. Mock controls were treated the same way but without 2 mM glutamate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Imaging and image analysis</title><p>Images of synaptic boutons from muscle 6/7, A2 or A3 were taken using Olympus FV3000 confocal microscope at 60X with 1.6 zoom. Images showing expression patterns were taken at lower magnifications with either 10X or 60X objectives. 40x water objectives are used when performing live imaging of iGluSnFR. Mock controls (unstimulated larvae) were always dissected, immunostained, and imaged in parallel with stimulated genotypes for each experiment using the same conditions. Type Ib boutons were analyzed to establish changes in bouton size and GluR levels. Image analyses for GluRIIC, bouton size, and extracellular staining were done using the same protocol as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>Third-instar larvae were dissected and immersed in a modified HL-3 solution containing NaCl (70 mM), KCl (5 mM), MgCl<sub>2</sub> (10 mM), sucrose (115 mM), HEPES (5 mM), trehalose (5 mM), and NaHCO<sub>3</sub> (10 mM), at pH 7.2, with specified concentrations of CaCl<sub>2</sub> (0.25 or 0.5 mM). Current-clamp recordings were performed on muscle area 6 in abdominal segments A2 or A3, using suction electrodes to stimulate the severed ventral nerves with a 0.3 ms stimulus duration. The recording electrode, filled with 3 M KCl and having a resistance between 15 and 40 mΩ, was used to acquire data. Data with resting potentials more hyperpolarized than –60 mV were analyzed, while datasets were excluded if resting potentials deviated by more than 10 mV during recording or if there was a sudden drop in EPSP amplitude, indicating incomplete nerve function. The experimental setup included an Axopatch 200B Amplifier, a Digidata 1440A for digitization, and pClamp 10.3 software (Molecular Devices) for control. Data analysis was conducted using MiniAnalysis (Synaptosoft), Clampfit (Molecular Devices), and Microsoft Excel, with nonlinear summation applied to correct the average EPSP.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Western blot</title><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> larval brain extract was obtained by homogenizing 6–10 larval brains collected on ice in RIPA buffer with EDTA 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% NP-40, 0.5% NaDoc, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 10 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, 250 nM cycloporin A, protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) using mortar and pestle.

Previously they reported that shv mutants have impaired synaptic plasticity. Normally a high stimulation paradigm should increase bouton size and GluR expression at synapses but this does not happen in shv mutants. The phenotypes relating to activity-dependent plasticity were completely recapitulated when Shv was knocked down only in neurons and could be completely rescued by incubation in exogenously applied Shv protein. The authors also showed that Shv activation of integrin signaling on both the pre- and post-synapse was the molecular mechanism underlying its function in plasticity. Here they extend their study to consider a role of Shv derived from glia in modulating synaptic features at baseline and remodeling conditions. The authors show evidence that Shv is expressed in both neurons and glia. Despite the fact that neuron-specific RNAi knockdown of Shv recapitulated the plasticity phenotypes seen in whole animal mutants, the authors asked whether glial-specific knockdown would have any effects. Surprisingly, knockdown of Shv only in glia also blocked plasticity, just like neuron-specific knockdown, and supporting an important role for glial-derived Shv in plasticity. Unlike neuronal knockdown, though, glial knockdown also caused abnormally high baseline GluR expression. Restoring Shv in ONLY glia in mutant animals is sufficient to completely rescue the plasticity phenotypes and baseline GluR expression, but glial-Shv does not appear to activate integrin signaling which was shown to be the mechanism for neuronally derived Shv to control plasticity. This suggests a different or indirect mechanism of action for glial-derived Shv. This led the authors to hypothesize that glial Shv might work via controlling the levels of neuronal Shv and/or extracellular glutamate. To test these hypotheses, they provide evidence that in the absence of glial Shv, synaptic levels of Shv go up overall, suggesting that glial Shv could somehow have a suppressive effect on release of neuronal Shv. This would indirectly modulate integrin signaling to control plasticity. Using an extracelluar glutamate sensor in presynaptic boutons, they also observe decreased signal (extracellular glutamate) from the sensor in glial Shv KD animals, and increased signal in glial Shv overexpression animals, supporting the hypothesis that glial Shv can regulate glutamate levels somehow. These results establish glia as an important source of Shv in these processes and identify some mechanisms for how this might be accomplished. Several outstanding questions remain-most importantly: how/why do glial-derived and neuronal-derived Shv have different effects when in the same space? No obvious isoform or size differences were found, and the same rescue construct expressed either in neurons or glia could have different effects on integrin activation or glutamate levels. Answering these questions using modified rescue constructs will be an important future direction to understand Shv function specifically and how neurons and glia work together in this context--and potentially many other contexts.</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>The authors addressed my and the other reviewers' concerns from the original review adequately and this has strengthened the paper substantially.</p><p>One small omission to correct: In Figures 4 and 6, the graphs in the figures do not have a legend for the colored bars.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.104126.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Chang and colleagues provides compelling evidence that glia-derived Shriveled (Shv) modulates activity-dependent synaptic plasticity at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ).

Previously they reported that shv mutants have impaired synaptic plasticity. Normally a high stimulation paradigm should increase bouton size and GluR expression at synapses but this does not happen in shv mutants.

The authors also showed that Shv activation of integrin signaling on both the pre- and post- synapse was the molecular mechanism underlying its function. Here they extend their study to consider the role of Shv derived from glia in modulating synaptic features at baseline and remodeling conditions. This study is important to understand if and how glia contribute to these processes. Using cell-type specific knockdown of Shv only in glia causes abnormally high baseline GluR expression and prevents activity-dependent increases in bouton size or GluR expression post-stimulation. This does not appear to be a developmental defect as the authors show that knocking down Shv in glia after basic development has the same effects as lifelong knockdown, so Shv is acting in real time. Restoring Shv in ONLY glia in mutant animals is sufficient to completely rescue the plasticity phenotypes and baseline GluR expression, but glial-Shv does not appear to activate integrin signaling which was shown to be the mechanism for neuronally derived Shv to control plasticity. This led the authors to hypothesize that glial Shv works by controlling the levels of neuronal Shv and extracellular glutamate. They provide evidence that in the absence of glial Shv, synaptic levels of Shv go up overall, presumably indicating that neurons secrete more Shv. In this context which could then work via integrin signaling as described to control plasticity. They use a glutamate sensor and observe decreased signal (extracellular glutamate) from the sensor in glial Shv KD animals, however, this background has extremely high GluR levels at the synapse which may account for some or all of the decreases in sensor signal in this background. Additional controls to test if increased GluR density alone affects sensor readouts and/or independently modulating GluR levels in the glial KD background would help strengthen this data. In fact, glialspecific shv KD animals have baseline levels of GluR that are potentially high enough to have hit a ceiling of expression or detection that accounts for the inability for these levels to modulate any higher after strong stimulation and such a ceiling effect should be considered when interpreting the data and conclusions of this paper. Several outstanding questions remain-why can't glial derived Shv activate integrin pathways but exogenously applied recombinant Shv protein can? The effects of neuronal specific rescue of shv in a shv mutant are not provided vis-à-vis GluR levels and bouton size to compare to the glial only rescue. Inclusion of this data might provide more insight to outstanding questions of how and why the source of Shv seems to matter for some aspects of the phenotypes but not others despite the fact that exogenous Shv can rescue and in some experimental paradigms but not others.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate your insightful comments. We have added new data and modified the text to address your concerns. In doing so, the manuscript has been substantially strengthened. Please also see the enclosed point-by-point response.</p><p>To address the question of whether altered GluR density alone affects sensor readouts, we expressed GluR using a mhc promoter-driven GluRIIA fusion line, which increases total GluRIIA expression in muscle independently of the Gal4/UAS system. As shown in Figure 6 – figure supplement 1, mhc-GluRIIA animals exhibited elevated levels of not only GluRIIA but also the obligatory GluRIIC subunit. Despite this increase in GluR expression, we did not observe any change in extracellular glutamate levels, as measured by live imaging using the neuronal iGluSnFR sensor (updated Figure 6A). These results suggest that elevated GluR density alone does not alter iGluSnFR sensors dynamics and further support our conclusions.</p><p>In regard to the question about ceiling effect, we do not think that the lack of GluR enhancement in repo&gt;shv-RNAi is due to a saturated postsynaptic state. This is based on results in Figure 6, which shows that GluR levels can increase up to fourfold upon stimulation in the presence of glutamate, whereas repo&gt;shv-RNAi results in only a ~2-fold increase in baseline GluR concentration. These results suggest that the synapse retains the capacity for further upregulation.</p><p>To address the question of why exogenously applied Shv activates integrin while glial derived Shv does not, we tested whether glia and neurons could differentially modify Shv. Based on Western blot analyses of adult heads and larval brains showing that Shv is present as a single band (Fig. 1A and Figure 2 – figure supplement 1B), the functional differences in neuronal or glial Shv is not likely due to the presence of different isoforms. Consistent with this, FlyBase also suggests that shv encodes a single isoform. However, while we did not detect obvious posttranslational modifications when Shv protein was expressed in neurons or glia (Figure 5 – figure supplement 1A), we cannot exclude the possibility that different cell types process Shv differently through post-transcriptional or post-translational mechanisms. Notably, shv is predicted to undergo A-to-I RNA editing, including an editing site in the coding region, which will result in a single amino acid change (St Laurent et al., 2013). Given that ADAR, the editing enzyme, is enriched in neurons and absent from glia (Jepson et al., 2011), such cell-specific editing could contribute to functional differences. It will be interesting to investigate this in the future. We have now included this in the Discussion section.</p><p>Additionally, we have now included new data on neuronal Shv rescue of shv<sup>1</sup> mutants as suggested in the updated Figure 4. Consistent with previous findings that neuronal Shv rescues integrin signaling and electrophysiological phenotypes (Lee et al., 2017), we found that it also restores bouton size, GluR levels, and activity-induced synaptic remodeling. These results support the functional contribution of neuronal Shv.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Chang and colleagues provides compelling evidence that glia-derived Shriveled (Shv) modulates activity-dependent synaptic plasticity at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ).

We speculate that neuronal Shv normally has a dominant role in maintaining GluR levels during development, mainly through its ability to activate integrin signaling. Consistent with this, we have shown that mutations in integrin leads to a drastic reduction in GluR levels at the NMJ (Lee et al., 2017). While we have shown that neuronal knockdown of shv elevates Shv from glia (Fig. 5E), glial Shv cannot activate integrin signaling (Fig. 5B, 5C). Additionally, high levels of glial Shv will elevate ambient glutamate concentrations (Figure 6A), which will likely reduce GluR abundance and impair synaptic remodeling (Augustin et al. 2007, Chen et al., 2009, and Figure 6B). Therefore, neuronal knockdown of Shv resulted in the same phenotype as shv<sup>1</sup> mutant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) In Fig 3B, SPG shv RNAi has elevated GluR baseline, while PG shv RNAi has a lower baseline.

To address this, we monitored the levels of intracellular Shv using a permeabilized preparation (we found that the addition of detergent to permeabilize the sample strips away extracellular Shv). Combined with the extracellular staining results, we can get an idea about the total amount of Shv. As shown in the updated Figure 5D, intracellular Shv levels (permeabilized) remained unchanged following stimulation, indicating that there is no intracellular accumulation and that the observed decrease in extracellular Shv is unlikely due to impaired release machinery.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) In Fig 5E, what will happen after stimulation?

We have now addressed this in the discussion and also enclosed below:</p><p>Based on Western blot analyses of adult heads and larval brains showing that Shv is present as a single band (Fig. 1A and Figure 2 – figure supplement 1B), the functional differences in neuronal or glial Shv is not likely due to the presence of different isoforms. Consistent with this, FlyBase also suggests that shv encodes a single isoform (Ozturk-Colak et al., 2024). However, while we did not detect obvious post-translational modifications when Shv protein was expressed in neurons or glia (Figure 5 – figure supplement 1A), we cannot exclude the possibility that different cell types process Shv differently through posttranscriptional or post-translational mechanisms. Notably, shv is predicted to undergo A-to-I RNA editing, including an editing site in the coding region, which could result in a single amino acid change (St Laurent et al., 2013). Given that ADAR, the editing enzyme, is enriched in neurons and absent from glia (Jepson et al., 2011), such cell-specific editing could contribute to functional differences. It will be interesting to investigate this in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) It is claimed that Sup Fig 2 shows no observable change in gross glial morphology, further bolstering support that glial Shv does not activate integrin. This seems quite an overinterpretation. There is only one image for each condition without quantification. It is hard to judge if glia, which is labeled by GFP (presumably by UAS-eGFP?), is altered or not.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this concern. To strengthen our claim, we now include additional images (Figure 5, figure supplement 2). No obvious change in overall glial morphology was observed, with glia continuing to wrap the segmental nerves and extend processes that closely associate with proximal synaptic boutons (Figure 5, figure supplement 2). These observations suggest that glial Shv is not essential for maintaining normal glial structure or survival, and is consistent with the idea that glial Shv does not activate integrin, as integrin signaling is required to maintain the integrity of peripheral glial layers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) The hypothesis that glutamate regulates GluR level as a homeostatic mechanism makes sense. What is the explanation of the increased bouton size in the control after glutamate application in Fig 6?</p></disp-quote><p>We speculate that it could be due to a retrograde signaling mechanism activated by elevated extracellular glutamate, allowing neurons to modulate bouton morphology in response to synaptic demand. It will be interesting to investigate this possibility in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(12) What could be a mechanism that prevents elevated glial released Shv to activate integrin signaling after neuronal shv RNAi, as seen in Fig 5E?</p></disp-quote><p>One potential mechanism is post-translational or post-transcriptional processing of Shv. Although our Western blots did not reveal differences in the molecular weight of glial vs. neuronal Shv, we cannot exclude the possibility that modifications not readily detectable by this method are responsible. Additionally, as mentioned in the Discussion section, post-transcriptional processing such as A-to-I RNA editing could introduce changes in the Shv protein, potentially altering its ability to interact with or activate integrin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(13) Any speculation on how the released Shv pool is sensed?</p></disp-quote><p>The same RNA editing modification mentioned earlier or post-translational modifications in Shv may also influence how it is sensed by target cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Issues Regarding Cell Type-Specific Secretion and the Role of Shv:</p><p>Extracellular Secretion of Shv:</p><p>(1) The data in Figure 1 suggest that Shv is not secreted under resting conditions, challenging the proposed extracellular role of Shv. It remains unclear whether Shv secretion can be confirmed using Shv-eGFP (knock-in) following high K+ stimulation.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not being clear. In Figure 1, Shv signals we’ve shown are from permeabilized preparation, which preferentially labels intracellular Shv. We do observe secreted Shv-eGFP following stimulation (Figure 5E), consistent with our hypothesis. However, endogenous extracellular Shv-eGFP signal is very weak, and was therefore detected using the GFP antibody and amplified with a fluorescent secondary antibody. We have now also included additional controls in Figure 5E to demonstrate the specificity of the staining.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In Figure 5D, total Shv staining should be included to evaluate potential presynaptic accumulation of intracellular Shv, which may lead to extracellular secretion upon stimulation. Additionally, the representative images of glial rescue do not seem to align with the quantification data; more extracellular Shv signals were observed after stimulation.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comments. We monitored the levels of intracellular Shv using a permeabilized preparation (detergent treatment stripped away extracellular Shv signal). When combined with non-permeabilized extracellular staining, this approach provides insights into total Shv levels. We found no intracellular accumulation of Shv and the intracellular levels remained unchanged following stimulation (updated Figure 5D), suggesting that reduced extracellular Shv is not likely due to impaired release. Additionally, we have selected another image for glial rescue by avoiding the trachea region, which better represent the quantification data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In Figure 5E, &quot;extracellular&quot; Shv staining in repo&gt;shv-RNAi samples appears localized within synaptic boutons. This raises concerns about the staining protocol potentially labeling intracellular proteins. Control experiments using presynaptic cytosolic markers are needed to confirm staining specificity.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the thoughtful suggestion. To validate that our staining protocol is selective for extracellular proteins, we also stained for cysteine string protein (CSP), an intracellular synaptic vesicle protein predominantly located in the presynaptic terminals (Zinsmaier et al., 1990; Umbach et al., 1994), under the same conditions. CSP was detected only in the permeabilized condition (updated Figure 5E), suggesting that the non-permeabilizing protocol is selective for extracellular proteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The study does not clarify why Shv knockdown in either perineurial glia or subperineurial glia abolishes stimulus-dependent synaptic remodeling. Does Shv secretion occur from PG, SPG, or both toward the synaptic bouton?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this point. SPG is the middle glial cell layer in the fly peripheral nervous system and may also influence the PG layer through signaling mechanisms (Lavery et al., 2007). Consistent with this, we observed a stronger effect on GluR levels when SPG was disrupted compared to PG. It will be interesting to distinguish whether Shv is released by PG or SPG in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The possibility of an inter-glial role for Shv via integrin signaling in regulating glial morphogenesis is underexplored. The rough morphological characterization in Supplemental Figure 2 requires more detailed quantification and the use of sub-glial typespecific GAL4 drivers.</p></disp-quote><p>We now include additional images (Figure 5, figure supplement 2) to examine the overall glial morphology. There was no obvious change in gross glial morphology, with glia continuing to wrap the segmental nerves and extend processes that closely associate with proximal synaptic boutons when shv is knocked down in glia (Figure 5, figure supplement 2).

If anti-HRP staining was used to normalize signals, it suggests the experiment may have involved fixed tissue. However, iGluSnFR typically measures glutamate levels in live cells, raising concerns about the validity of this approach in fixed samples.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not being clear about the method used to measure iGluSnFR. The original figure was generated from imaging iGluSnFR signals immediately following fixation. To address the reviewer’s concern and validate these results, we have now performed live imaging experiments using a water dipping objective to measure iGluSnFR intensity in unfixed preparations (new Figure 6A). To label synaptic boutons, we co-expressed mtdTomato using the neuronal driver, nSybGAL4. The results from the live imaging experiments confirmed our original observations that glial Shv required to control ambient extracellular glutamate levels (see updated Fig. 6A and text). Additionally, to ascertain that the decrease in iGluSnFR signal reflects a decrease in ambient extracellular glutamate levels rather than glutamate depletion caused by high levels of GluR, we upregulated GluR levels using mhc-GluRIIA, which drives GluRIIA expression in muscles (Petersen et al., 1997). We found mhc-GluRIIA animals exhibited elevated levels of not only GluRIIA but also the obligatory GluRIIC subunit. However, iGluSnFR signals at the synapse remained unchanged (Figure 6A), suggesting that elevated GluR density alone does not reduce signals. Taken together, these results suggest that glial Shv plays a critical role in controlling ambient extracellular glutamate levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) As shown in Figure 2, repo&gt;shv-RNAi increases GluR levels before high K+ stimulation, potentially saturating postsynaptic GluR expression and precluding further increases upon stimulation.</p></disp-quote><p>Our data in Figure 6 show that GluR levels can increase up to four-fold upon stimulation in the presence of glutamate, whereas repo&gt;shv-RNAi results in only a ~2-fold increase in baseline GluR concentration. These results suggest that the synapse retains the capacity for further upregulation. Thus, we do not think that the lack of GluR enhancement in repo&gt;shv-RNAi is due to a saturated postsynaptic state, but rather reflects a requirement for glial Shv in activity-dependent modulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Despite glial shv knockdown lowering extracellular glutamate levels, GluR levels unexpectedly increase (Figure 6B). This contradicts the known requirement for high ambient glutamate concentrations to promote GluR clustering and membrane expression (Chen et al., 2009). Furthermore, adding 2 mM glutamate reverses these increases, suggesting additional complexity in the regulation of Shv synaptic remodeling.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment and the opportunity to clarify this point. While it may seem counterintuitive at first glance, our observations are in line with previous reports that showed low ambient glutamate levels significantly elevated GluR intensity at the Drosophila NMJ (Chen et al., 2009), but such increase can be reversed by glutamate supplementation (Augustin et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2009). We have revised the text to more clearly reflect this connection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) If glial Shv promotes GluR expression, why does the increased extracellular Shv from neuronal shv knockdown (elav&gt;shv-RNAi, Figure 5E) fail to elicit stimulus-dependent GluR elevation?</p></disp-quote><p>We speculate that this is because glial Shv does not activate integrin signaling (Figure 5B, C), and elevated glial Shv increases ambient glutamate concentration (Figure 6A), thereby reducing GluR expression (Augustin et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2009). This is indeed what we observed when shv is knocked down in neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional Issues:</p><p>(11) The type of bouton used for quantification (e.g., Ib or Is boutons) is not specified, which is critical for interpreting the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not being clear. We analyzed type Ib boutons as done previously (Lee et al., 2017 and Chang et al., 2024), and have now included this information in the Methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(12) The extent of Shv protein depletion in the repo-GeneSwitch system needs validation to confirm the efficacy of the knockdown.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We confirmed the efficiency of acute shv knockdown by the repo-GeneSwitch system by performing Western blot analysis of dissected larval brains (Figure 2 – figure supplement 1B). Acute glial knockdown using the repo-GeneSwitch driver resulted in a 30% reduction in Shv levels, similar to the decrease observed with the repo-GAL4 driver, suggesting that the GeneSwitch driver is functional. Furthermore, knockdown of shv by the ubiquitous tubulin-GAL4 driver completely eliminated Shv protein, indicating that the RNAi construct is effective.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) General comment on statistics/data presentation: The authors employ an unusual method of using both one-way ANOVA and multiple t-test stats for the same data. Would a 2-way ANOVA be the more appropriate solution to this problem (to analyze across genotype and stimulation condition)? Also a chart in the supplementals showing all comparisons rather than just the fraction explicitly reported in the graphs would be helpful (it is not clear if no indication on significance indicates no difference or just not reported between some of the baseline levels, especially since everything is presented as ratios and in some cases this could help with data interpretation of which baseline levels are different and how they compare to other baselines and other post-stim levels). Further, there are no sample sizes given for any experiment, nor are any values of means, SD, etc ever explicitly given.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the thoughtful suggestion. While a two-way ANOVA could be used to examine interaction effects between genotype and stimulation condition, our analysis was designed to address a specific biological question: whether each genotype, independent of baseline levels, is capable of undergoing activitydependent synaptic remodeling. To this end, we used t-tests to directly compare unstimulated vs. stimulated conditions within each genotype, allowing us to determine whether stimulation produces a significant effect in an all-or-none manner. In parallel, we applied one-way ANOVA with post hoc tests to analyze differences among baseline (unstimulated) conditions across genotypes. This approach is justified by the fact that stimulation was applied acutely and separately, and therefore the baseline values should not be influenced by the stimulated condition. Because we were not aiming to compare the extent of synaptic remodeling between genotypes, we did not use a two-way ANOVA to analyze interaction effects across all conditions.</p><p>In response to the reviewer’s suggestion, we have now added the sample number in the graphs. Additionally, in the Methods section, we include information that each sample represents biological repeats, and that data are presented as fold-change relative to unstimulated controls from the same experimental batch. This normalization is necessary, as absolute GluR intensities can vary depending on microscope settings and staining conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) To clarify distinct roles of Shv coming from neurons vs glia it would help if the authors could include more data on the rescue of shv mutants with UAS-Shv in neurons alone. This data is never shown in the manuscript and data on what effect this rescue has on the pertinent phenotypes in this paper (bouton size and GluR staining) is not reported in the referred to 2017 paper. What this does and does not do for these phenotypes has important implications for how to interpret the glia-only rescue findings.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We have now included new data on neuronal Shv rescue in shv<sup>1</sup> mutants as suggested (updated Figure 4A). Consistent with previous findings that neuronal Shv rescues integrin signaling and electrophysiological phenotypes (Lee et al., 2017), we found that it also restores bouton size, GluR levels, and activity-induced synaptic remodeling. These results support the functional contribution of neuronal Shv.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Figure 1C: Where are the images in the periphery taken? The morphology of the glia is odd in that &quot;blobs&quot; of glial membrane seemingly unattached to anything else are floating about? Perhaps these are a thin stack projection and so the connection to the main glia &quot;stalks&quot; are just cut off? Could a specific individual synapse be shown? Also consider HRP shown on its own so that where the actual boutons are could be more clear. It seems like both the Tomato and HRP channels are really overexposed making visualizing the morphology quite confusing. Also why not use the antibody against Shv to directly visualize expression which is more direct than a knock-in tagged version?</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 1C shows a single optical slice of the NMJ at muscle segment 2, selected to clearly highlight Shv-eGFP localization at a branch in close contact with the glial membrane. The glial stalk is not visible in this image because it lies in a different focal plane from the branch of interest. We have now specified this information in the figure legend. In the original figure, the HRP signal (405 channel) was oversaturated, which interfered with visual clarity. In the updated Figure 1C, we reduced the intensity of overexposed channels to better reveal the weak ShveGFP signal and fine glial processes. While we have generated an antibody against Shv, the amount is extremely limited, and hence the Shv-eGFP fusion serves as a valuable tool for visualizing subcellular localization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Do glutamate levels really rise in glia Shv KD? Although iGluSnFR signal changes could it be the high level of GluR at the synapse acting as sponges to sequester glutamate so that it can't stimulate the sensor as well? One way to test this would be to overexpress or KD GluRs in muscle in wildtype (or in the repo&gt;Shv RNAi background) to see if that alone can modulate iGluSnfR signals?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for suggesting this important control. To address the question of whether high level GluR density alone could influence neuronal iGluSnFR sensor readouts, we expressed GluR using a mhc promoter-driven GluRIIA fusion line, which increases total GluRIIA expression in muscle independently of the Gal4/UAS system. As shown in Figure 6 – figure supplement 1, mhc-GluRIIA animals exhibited elevated levels of not only GluRIIA but also the obligatory GluRIIC subunit. Despite this increase in GluR expression, we did not observe any change in extracellular glutamate levels, as measured by live imaging using the neuronal iGluSnFR sensor (updated Figure 6A). These results suggest that elevated GluR density alone does not alter iGluSnFR sensors dynamics and further support our conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The authors have some Shv constructs that can't be secreted or can't bind to integrins. Performing cell type specific rescues with these constructs might also help distinguish how source matters for each proposed sub-function of Shv though this may be outside the scope of this study.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for noticing the Shv constructs we have. We hope to further test subfunctions of Shv in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) At one point the authors discuss experiments that measure how much Shv is released by glia during neuronal stimulation. Then state that &quot;These data indicate that glial Shv does not directly inhibit integrin signaling.&quot; But how this experiment relates to integrin signaling is not explained and unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion. We have now updated the text to better explain our logic: “This activity-induced decrease in glial Shv levels, along with reduced integrin activation (Fig. 5B), suggest that glial Shv does not act by directly inhibiting integrin signaling.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Minor comments</p><p>(1) Readers are left wondering what causes the increased baseline of GluR after glial shv RNAi at Fig 1, which is addressed much later.

Our primary goal was to determine whether each genotype, regardless of baseline GluR levels, is capable of undergoing activitydependent synaptic remodeling in response to stimulation. For this reason, we focused on detecting the presence or absence of remodeling rather than comparing the extent of remodeling across genotypes. While a smaller effect on activity-induced bouton size was observed with alrm-GAL4, the change was still statistically significant, indicating that remodeling does occur in this genotype. Currently, we do not have a clear biological interpretation for differences in the magnitude of remodeling, and therefore chose not to emphasize cross-genotype comparisons.</p></body></sub-article></article>
