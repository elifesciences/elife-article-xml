Myofibers are highly adaptive and can be altered under different biological and disease conditions. Therefore, transcriptional and epigenetic studies on myofibers are crucial to discover how chromatin alterations occur in the skeletal muscle under different conditions. However, due to the heterogenous nature of skeletal muscle, studying myofibers in isolation proves to be a challenging task. Single-cell sequencing has permitted the study of the epigenome of isolated myonuclei. While this provides sequencing with high dimensionality, the sequencing depth is lacking, which makes comparisons between different biological conditions difficult. Here, we report the first implementation of single myofiber ATAC-Seq, which allows for the sequencing of an individual myofiber at a depth sufficient for peak calling and for comparative analysis of chromatin accessibility under various physiological and disease conditions. Application of this technique revealed significant differences in chromatin accessibility between resting and regenerating myofibers, as well as between myofibers from a mouse model of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (mdx) and wild-type (WT) counterparts. This technique can lead to a wide application in the identification of chromatin regulatory elements and epigenetic mechanisms in muscle fibers during development and in muscle-wasting diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>epigenetics</kwd><kwd>muscle</kwd><kwd>duchenne's muscular dystrophy</kwd><kwd>ngs sequencing</kwd><kwd>ATAC-Seq</kwd><kwd>regeneration</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Soleimani</surname><given-names>Vahab D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Single myofiber ATAC-Seq provides assessment of chromatin accessibility of a single myofiber without the confounding effects of other cell types present in skeletal muscle.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Skeletal muscle evolved for contraction and the production of force. The main component of skeletal muscle are myofibers which are formed from the fusion of myogenic precursor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buckingham et al., 2003</xref>) resulting in large postmitotic syncytia that are composed of repeating contractile units, called sarcomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huxley and Hanson, 1954</xref>). Myofibers exhibit wide variations in their metabolic activity and contractile properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zierath and Hawley, 2004</xref>). In addition, they have a highly adaptive nature where their size, myosin heavy chain isoform, energy metabolism, and the overall skeletal muscle mass, among other characteristics, are regulated by complex processes involving rates of protein turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bohé et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mittendorfer et al., 2005</xref>), as well as transcriptional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Quiat et al., 2011</xref>) and posttranscriptional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Weskamp et al., 2021</xref>) control of gene expression. Due to their adaptive nature, myofibers can change in response to exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zierath and Hawley, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wilson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dons et al., 1979</xref>), aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Deschenes, 2004</xref>) and diseases, such as sarcopenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Thompson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nilwik et al., 2013</xref>) and cachexia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Roberts et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, the study of the myofiber transcriptome and epigenome can provide key insights into how skeletal muscle adapts and changes under various stimuli, and it can potentially lead to the discovery of novel therapeutic venues for muscle related diseases.</p><p>Myofibers also act as a key signaling component of muscle stem cells (MuSCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lazure et al., 2020</xref>), which are in turn required for the regeneration of muscle fibers after injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Snow, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shadrach and Wagers, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dumont et al., 2015</xref>). Skeletal muscle is a very heterogenous tissue composed not only of myofibers and their associated MuSCs, but also numerous different non-myogenic cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Giordani et al., 2019</xref>). Previous studies using whole muscle sequencing captures not only the myofibers but also the other resident cell types in the muscle, making it challenging to attribute any changes in the transcriptome and epigenome specifically to myofibers as they could be due to changes in these other cell types. Recent advances in Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) now allow for high-dimensional analysis at a single-cell level. Recent studies using these technologies to study muscle tissue, such as single nucleus RNA-Seq and single nucleus ATAC-Seq have analyzed the transcriptome and epigenome of the myonuclei within the muscle fiber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Petrany et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dos Santos et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kim et al., 2020</xref>). However, they present certain limitations where they sequence all myonuclei present in the muscle and cannot distinguish between different myofibers, as well as having low sequencing depth with a limited capacity for downstream analyses.</p><p>The chromatin state plays a key role in transcriptional regulation and the determination of cellular identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>). Although the accessible regions make up only 3% of the total genome, it represents over 90% of known transcription factor binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Thurman et al., 2012</xref>). Chromatin accessibility is a determinant of gene expression, and changes in chromatin accessibility have been identified in different biological and disease conditions such as during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Trevino et al., 2020</xref>), cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Corces et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rendeiro et al., 2016</xref>), and neurological disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bastle and Maze, 2019</xref>). Thus, in recent years, the study of epigenetics and chromatin accessibility has become a promising field for the development of novel therapeutics. Today, ATAC-Seq is a widely used method that allows for the mapping of the accessible chromatin regions in the genome. ATAC-Seq relies on the hyperactive Tn5 transposase that fragments the accessible regions in the genome while simultaneously ligating sequencing compatible adaptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Corces et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buenrostro et al., 2015</xref>). Over the years, ATAC-Seq has been applied to many different cell types and tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Yan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rocks et al., 2022</xref>). However, to our knowledge, it has not been performed on a single myofiber, possibly due to the rigidity of their membrane, high levels of mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Janssen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ortenblad et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mishra et al., 2015</xref>), and the low number of myonuclei that are present in a single myofiber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Neal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cramer et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Here, we have adapted OMNI-ATAC-seq to determine the genome-wide chromatin accessibility of myonuclei contained within a single Extensor Digitorum Longus (EDL) muscle fiber of a mouse. The single myofiber ATAC-Seq (smfATAC-Seq) method that we applied in this study allows for the investigation of the accessible chromatin regions of a single myofiber, without the presence of other confounding cell types. The smfATAC-Seq has a sequencing depth of approximately 6 million final reads aligned which provides approximately 30,000 peaks called. Using this method, we provide comparative analysis of chromatin accessibility between resting and regenerating myofibers, as well as their MuSC progenitors. In addition, application of this method to the study of myofibers isolated from a mouse model of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (mdx) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McGreevy et al., 2015</xref>) and their WT counterparts provide a genome-wide assessment of changes in chromatin accessibility in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). This method can be used in the future to profile the epigenetic state of myofibers in different disease conditions, and under various physiological and physical stimuli, and to identify active cis-regulatory elements in muscle fibers.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of ATAC-Seq libraries from a single myofiber</title><p>A single EDL myofiber of a mouse contains an average of 200–300 myonuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Neal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cramer et al., 2020</xref>), making genome-wide analyses of the chromatin state difficult. With the advancements in next generation sequencing (NGS) and the development of the OMNI ATAC-Seq protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Corces et al., 2017</xref>), analysis of chromatin accessibility of samples with an input of as low as 500 cells is now possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Corces et al., 2017</xref>). However, myofibers present additional challenges with their rigid membrane and high levels of mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Janssen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ortenblad et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mishra et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we report a robust protocol for the successful application of ATAC-Seq on a single myofiber isolated from the EDL muscle. Our method relies on the lysis and permeabilization of a single myofiber followed by transposition with a hyperactive Tn5 transposase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Corces et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). DNA fragment sizes obtained from the smfATAC-Seq were of a similar range in size as those obtained from conventional OMNI ATAC-Seq which we have performed on 5000 MuSCs that were freshly isolated by Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, analysis showed that only 0.9–2.09% of reads were derived from the mitochondria in smfATAC-Seq (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), suggesting that this method is highly efficient for the removal of mitochondria from mitochondria-rich myofibers. Following the removal of mitochondrial reads, there were approximately 6 million final reads aligned and 30,000 peaks called, demonstrating a sufficient sequencing depth for downstream analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic of ATAC-seq performed on a single myofiber.</title><p>Schematic of the steps and reactions involved in the preparation of sequencing ready libraries of single myofiber DNA for ATAC-Seq.

Then, open chromatin regions were tagmented with hyperactive Tn5 transposase and the DNA fragments were purified through column purification. The tagmented DNA was then amplified by PCR and Nextera adaptors were incorporated.

myofibers under different physiological conditions</title><p>In addition to adapting the OMNI ATAC-Seq method to study the chromatin accessibility of a single myofiber, we also demonstrate the application of this technique for comparative analysis of chromatin accessibility between myofibers under different conditions. For that purpose, we performed ATAC-Seq on myofibers that were in a resting (uninjured) or regenerating (injured) state. Uninjured and injured (7 days post cardiotoxin (CTX) induced injury) myofibers were isolated from wild-type C57BL/6 mice and smfATAC-Seq was performed to compare the changes in chromatin accessibility during regeneration. In addition, as a further quality control, we compared the chromatin accessibility between myonuclei within a single myofiber and 5000 freshly isolated MuSCs. This analysis not only identified accessible regions of chromatin in myofibers and MuSCs, but it also revealed a repertoire of active cis-regulatory elements in each sample.</p><p>Apart from the myofibers and their associated MuSCs, skeletal muscle also contains many non-myogenic cells such as endothelial cells, adipocytes, hematopoietic cells, fibroblasts, fibro/adipogenic progenitors (FAPs), and macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Giordani et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De Micheli et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">De Micheli et al., 2020b</xref>). Our smfATAC-Seq method allows for the analysis of chromatin accessibility of a single myofiber without the confounding effect of these contaminating cell types. Given that the whole muscle contains non-myogenic cell types, we first compared smfATAC-Seq to an ATAC-Seq performed on whole EDL muscle by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ramachandran et al., 2019</xref> (GSM3981673) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ramachandran et al., 2019</xref>) for the enrichment of ATAC-Seq peaks on the genes of non-myogenic cells. We obtained the list of genes that are solely expressed in the whole muscle (RPM of at least 10) but not in the myofibers (RPM of 0) by using an RNA-Seq dataset performed on whole muscle and a single myofiber by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blackburn et al., 2019</xref> (GSE138591) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blackburn et al., 2019</xref>). This list represents genes that are only expressed by the muscle resident non-myogenic cell types, designated as “non-fiber muscle genes”. We determined the number of peaks in smfATAC-Seq that overlap with non-fiber muscle genes, which revealed that only 0.1% of the peaks overlapped with the top 100 non-fiber muscle genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). In comparison, 0.33% of the peaks in the whole EDL muscle ATAC-Seq (GSM3981673) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ramachandran et al., 2019</xref>) overlapped with the top 100 non-fiber muscle genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). The significant difference in the overlap with the non-fiber muscle genes between the whole muscle ATAC-Seq and smfATAC-Seq suggest that the whole muscle ATAC-Seq has enrichment of peaks associated with non-myogenic genes when compared to the smfATAC-Seq, which implies that smfATAC-Seq can successfully exclude the non-myogenic cell types. In contrast, the number of overlapping peaks with all the genes expressed in whole muscle in the EDL ATAC-Seq and smfATAC-Seq were similar (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). To further illustrate the absence of the non-myogenic cell types in the smfATAC-Seq samples, peaks at the promoter regions of marker genes of muscle resident cells were searched for. Specifically, Platelet and Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule 1 (<italic>Pecam1</italic>) was used to determine whether endothelial cells were present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Khan et al., 2005</xref>). Similarly, Resistin (<italic>Retn</italic>) and <italic>Cd45</italic> were used as markers for adipocytes and hematopoietic cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Steppan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McKinney-Freeman et al., 2009</xref>). The cell Surface Antigen <italic>Thy1</italic> was the marker selected for fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agorku et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, Lymphocyte antigen 6A (<italic>Ly6a</italic>) and Adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor E1 (<italic>Adgre1</italic>) were selected for fibro/adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) and macrophages, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Waddell et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Joe et al., 2010</xref>). None of these marker genes had ATAC-Seq peaks at their promoters, indicating that only a single myofiber is processed without any other contaminating cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>smfATAC-Seq can be successfully applied to myofibers under different conditions. For instance, we applied smf-ATAC-Seq to analyze the chromatin accessibility of myofibers under resting and CTX-mediated injury conditions. In a disease condition or in injury, not all myofibers undergo damage or regenerate to the same degree. Therefore, individual myofibers within a muscle can be in different physiological and disease conditions asynchronously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Folker and Baylies, 2013</xref>). Damaged or regenerating myofibers can be visualized by their characteristic feature of centrally located nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Roman and Gomes, 2018</xref>). Injured myofibers in this method were visually selected for the presence of the centrally located myonuclei by Hoechst staining and the selected myofiber was used for downstream processing with smfATAC-Seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). The selection of a specific myofiber that our smfATAC-Seq allows for, as well as the application of trypsin to remove any associated cells that may be present, results in the sequencing of DNA fragments corresponding purely to the myonuclei within a specific myofiber.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>smfATAC-Seq can effectively identify the accessible regions on a single myofiber.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative picture of an isolated WT C57BL/6 J uninjured myofiber stained for Hoechst showing the presence and location of myonuclei.

Whole muscle or muscle biopsies represent a pooled result of numerous cell types which are present in the muscle tissue. To overcome this limitation, single nucleus RNA-Seq (snRNA-Seq) and single nucleus ATAC-Seq (snATAC-Seq) have been developed and performed on myonuclei to allow for the computational removal of other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Petrany et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dos Santos et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kim et al., 2020</xref>). However, these methods still sequence all myonuclei present in the muscle and cannot distinguish between different myofibers within a muscle. Although snATAC-Seq provides high dimensionality, it is limited in sequencing depth due to the generation of sparse reads. Although computational pseudo bulking of snATAC-Seq can increase read numbers for comparative analysis between samples and conditions, the pooled reads represent the average of all myonuclei within the sample.</p><p>In this study, we have introduced a highly effective protocol based on the adaption of OMNI ATAC-Seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Corces et al., 2017</xref>) to quantify chromatin accessibility of a single EDL myofiber with high resolution and sequencing depth. This method allows for comparative analysis of chromatin accessibility within and between muscle types with a potential for wide-spread use in future studies to investigate myofiber-specific epigenetic alterations in skeletal muscle.</p><p>The smfATAC-Seq protocol that we introduce in this study investigates the open chromatin state of myofibers at a single myofiber resolution, and with a high sequencing depth that allows for peak calling and differential peak analysis. Using this method, we have demonstrated that accessible chromatin regions of myonuclei contained within a single EDL myofiber can be tagmented and that high-quality sequencing ready libraries can be generated from these fragments. Sequencing of these libraries allow for sufficient depth and peak calling that can be used for genome-wide analysis of chromatin accessibility between myofibers. In this study, we have also demonstrated that smfATAC-Seq strictly investigates a single myofiber without the confounding presence of muscle resident non-myogenic cell types. Additionally, application of trypsin to the isolated myofibers effectively removes MuSCs that are associated with myofibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blackburn et al., 2019</xref>) and was confirmed by the absence of peaks at the promoters of known genes associated with muscle stem and niche cells. Although all the smfATAC-Seq samples sequenced in this study were fast type myofibers, this protocol can be used to distinguish between different fiber types which could be applied to study myofiber heterogeneity under various physiological conditions. smfATAC-Seq peaks associated with genes involved in muscle structure and function such as <italic>Acta1</italic>, <italic>Ckm</italic> and the myosin heavy chain cluster, indicates that our smfATAC-Seq is a robust technique to investigate genome-wide chromatin accessibility of a single myofiber.</p><p>A key implication of this technique is its applicability to the study of changes in chromatin accessibility between myofibers in different contexts. As a demonstration of this, we have performed smfATAC-Seq on uninjured myofibers as well as injured myofibers isolated 7 days post-injury to investigate the changes in chromatin accessibility that occurs during regeneration. Through Pearson correlations and PCA analysis, we showed resting and injured myofibers cluster separately, indicating the power of smfATAC-Seq to determine chromatin signature from even the minute starting material of a single myofiber. In addition, through occupancy analysis, we showed that there is a large difference in the number of unique peaks present in the injured myofibers compared to uninjured myofibers. This indicates that there are major modifications to chromatin accessibility in the context of regeneration. However, GO term analysis of genes associated with the accessible chromatin regions in both injured and uninjured fibers are very similar in the biological processes and pathways that are enriched such as striated muscle cell development, actomyosin structure and sarcomere organization, which are key factors for the proper structure and function of muscle. Despite these similarities, there are certain trends in which uninjured myofibers have increased accessibility in genes involved in energy metabolism, while injured myofibers have greater accessibility in genes involved in myogenesis and inflammatory response which is what would be expected in the case of an injury and regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tidball, 2011</xref>). Despite the increase in chromatin accessibility during injury, the accessible chromatin regions in both injured and uninjured fibers are associated with genes involved in similar biological processes. This similarity at the gene network despite differences in chromatin profile may suggest activation of multiple enhancers on core muscle structural genes in the case of injury. Another possible reason could be the length of the recovery time where at 7 days post injury, a number of genes activated early in the regeneration process may have returned to levels seen in the steady state. Previously, a study investigating the changes in the transcriptional profile of MuSCs and various muscle resident cells throughout different time points of muscle injury using single cell RNA-Seq, revealed that after seven days of regeneration most cell types returned to a state that was similar to homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De Micheli et al., 2020a</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that harvesting the injured EDL myofibers 7 days post injury allowed these myofibers to return to a state reminiscent of homeostatic myofibers. Further, our analyses of the myofibers in this study indicates that this technique can effectively compare samples between conditions and could see future use in the study of chromatin accessibility of myofibers under different biologically relevant conditions.</p><p>We have also used smfATAC-Seq to compare changes in chromatin accessibility between MuSCs and myofibers. Our data shows that the regions of open chromatin in the myofibers correspond to genes involved in structural components of the muscle, such as the z-disc, which are important for the proper functioning of the muscle. On the other hand, open regions of chromatin in the MuSCs mostly correspond to genes involved in membrane permeability, adherens junction organization and signalling pathways implicated in the regulation of MuSC function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Relaix et al., 2021</xref>). The analysis also revealed that chromatin regions that are accessible in both MuSCs and myofibers correspond to genes that are crucial for the general function of cells such as those involved in mitochondrial transport, regulation of transcription, and regulation of metabolites and energy.</p><p>Lastly, we performed smfATAC-Seq on non-regenerating myofibers isolated from the mouse model of DMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McGreevy et al., 2015</xref>) and their WT counterparts. DMD is a type of muscular dystrophy caused by a loss-of-function mutation in the Dystrophin (<italic>DMD</italic>) gene that encodes for a protein that has a crucial role in muscle structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gao and McNally, 2015</xref>). Lack of functional dystrophin in DMD leads to unstable and fragile myofibers that continuously need to be regenerated, in turn leading to progressive muscle degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gao and McNally, 2015</xref>). We have not only shown that smfATAC-Seq can reliably investigate the chromatin accessibility from a single myofiber of mdx and WT EDL muscle, but through Pearson correlations, PCA and differential peak analysis we have also shown that DMD is associated with substantial alterations in chromatin accessibility in myonuclei. Through occupancy and GO term analyses, we have shown that a great proportion of peaks that are common between the mdx and WT myofibers are mostly associated with processes involved in muscle structure and organization. However, we have shown that mdx myofibers have more unique peaks compared to the WT, suggesting that chromatin accessibility of myonuclei is increased in the mdx disease model. Our analyses have shown that the unique peaks in mdx are associated with biological processes involved in myofiber structure and organization. On the other hand, unique peaks in the WT myofibers are associated with processes mostly involved in energy and metabolism. It is possible that the progressive muscle degeneration due to loss of muscle fiber integrity and stability causes mdx myofibers to compensate by increasing the activity of processes involved in muscle structure and organization while WT myofibers retain their activity in metabolism. It should be noted that the differences in chromatin accessibility that we have observed between resting and regenerating myofibers and between the mdx and WT myofibers are similar, which could be explained by the degeneration and continuous round of regeneration in the mdx myofibers.</p><p>Studies in the future could utilize smfATAC-Seq to further investigate the changes in chromatin accessibility in the mdx myofibers and investigate the changes associated with DMD at the level of chromatin to potentially investigate therapeutic avenues for this disease, as well as other muscle wasting diseases.</p><p>Overall, smfATAC-Seq is a robust molecular tool that can be used to analyze genome-wide chromatin accessibility of a single myofiber. The sequencing depth from this approach, allows for in-depth analysis, peak calling, quantitative analysis of chromatin accessibility and to identify active enhancers and promoters in a single muscle fiber. smfATAC-Seq can be used to study the epigenetic alterations that occur in muscle fibers during development, diseases, and in response to exercise.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">C57BL/6 J</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">The Jackson Laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Stock #: 000664</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">C57BL/10ScSnJ</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">The Jackson Laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Stock #: 000476</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">C57BL/10ScSn-<italic>Dmd</italic><sup>mdx</sup>/J</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">The Jackson Laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Stock #: 001801</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Tg(Pax7-EGFE)#Tagb (Pax7-nGFP)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sambasivan, R. et al. <break/>Distinct Regulatory Cascades Govern Extraocular <break/>and Pharyngeal Arch Muscle Progenitor <break/>Cell Fates.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Y M Dennis Lo as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Nora Yucel (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. The majority opinion of the group is that the article would potentially be suitable as a Tools and Resources article in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors state multiple times that this technique gives good sequencing depth. As such, information should be provided regarding number of high quality reads per sample, and whether replicates were downsampled before peak calling.</p><p>2) In Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, the x-axis label is not showing the correct size of the library.</p><p>3) Can the authors provide the smfATAC-Seq genome tracks for Myod1 and Myog loci to illustrate the chromatin accessibility changes in uninjured and injured myofibers since these two genes are essential for muscle regeneration?</p><p>4) In Line 169, remove redundant &quot;can be&quot; in the sentence.</p><p>5) The gene names in Figure 5C are not shown clearly.</p><p>6) The authors should consider a deeper analysis of the differential chromatin accessibility peaks (subdivided as promoters and distal regions), including prediction of TFs binding sites and integration with other appropriate datasets exploring epigenetic mechanisms (such as histone marks). In addition, the differential ATAC-seq peaks (mainly the ones overlapping putative promoters) should be combined with similar datasets exploring transcriptional changes and used to better infer gene networks characterizing the experimental groups. For example, by generating smfATAC-seq data from a slow-twitching muscle (Soleus), they could take advantage of available transcriptomic (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0016807) and proteomic (https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/embr.201439757) datasets.</p><p>7) Chromatin accessibility analysis in satellite cells was performed by isolating cells from the mouse hindlimb. However, these data were compared to the smfTAC-seq from EDL myofibers. The authors should acknowledge the limitation of this comparison.</p><p>8) If the authors intend for smfATACSeq to be performed broadly, it might be helpful to put it on a resource like https://www.protocols.io/ for other researchers to easily use and add notes.</p><p>9) It would be valuable to systematically compare enrichment at non-myogenic promoters to emphasize the myonuclear enrichment. This could be shown by overlaying TSS enrichment plots for genes that are characteristic of myogenic, vs immune vs vascular cells.</p><p>10) Total skeletal muscle ATAC-Seq has been previously published (Ramachandran, et al., PLoS Biology, 2019) in a variety of skeletal muscle types (including EDL vs soleus). How does smfATAC data compare to this ATACSeq data-- in particular are EDL-specific peaks also observed?</p><p>11) The authors should include motif analysis of differential chromatin regions (uninjured vs injured, mdx vs WT, using unchanged regions as background). The authors state (line 341) that &quot;Despite the increase in chromatin accessibility during injury, the accessible chromatin regions in both injured and uninjured fibers are associated with genes involved in similar biological processes.&quot; Motif analyses may in this case more be informative than GO, and could identify transcription factors with differential activity in the various experimental conditions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) The authors claim that the smfATAC-seq provides a high sequencing depth that allows for peak calling and differential peak analysis. Can the authors provide the exact sequencing depth in the method section?</p><p>2) In Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, the x-axis label is not showing the correct size of the library.</p><p>3) The concordance of the smfATAC-Seq data does not seem very good. In Figure 3, only 2 replicates are provided for uninjured fibers and they seem entirely separate. In Figure 6D, WT fibers also do not cluster very well. The authors should provide more replicates for the same condition to show the reproducibility of the approach.</p><p>4) In Figure 3F, there are very few unique peaks in uninjured fibers compared with MuSCs. Does it mean the uninjured fibers are less accessible than MuSCs, or is it due to the different nuclei number input for ATAC-seq? This comparison is not simple and the authors should use the same nuclei number input for different samples.</p><p>5) Can the authors provide the smfATAC-Seq genome tracks for Myod1 and Myog loci to illustrate the chromatin accessibility changes in uninjured and injured myofibers since these two genes are essential for muscle regeneration?</p><p>6) In MDX mice, the myofibers undergo regeneration and degeneration cycles. Currently, the authors only compare the uninjured WT myofibers and the MDX myofibers. Can the authors also provide a detailed comparison between the CTX injured myofibers and the MDX myofibers to illustrate the difference in the chromatin accessibility profiles of the two conditions, if any? Alternatively, when is the peak of regeneration and degeneration cycles during the life of an MDX mouse? Again, the current study lacks depth and shows no biological insight.</p><p>7) In Line 169, remove redundant &quot;can be&quot; in the sentence.</p><p>8) The gene names in Figure 5C are not shown clearly.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors should consider a deeper analysis of the differential chromatin accessibility peaks (subdivided as promoters and distal regions), including prediction of TFs binding sites and integration with other appropriate datasets exploring epigenetic mechanisms (such as histone marks).</p><p>In addition, the differential ATAC-seq peaks (mainly the ones overlapping putative promoters) should be combined with similar datasets exploring transcriptional changes and used to better infer gene networks characterizing the experimental groups.

The methods are also quite clear. If the authors intend for smfATACSeq to be performed broadly, it might be helpful to put it on a resource like https://www.protocols.io/ for other researchers to easily use and add notes. Other specific points in no particular order:</p><p>– In Figure 3B PCA is done on MuSCs vs uninjured vs injured fibers. It looks like the MuSCs are driving the differences in PC1, perhaps compressing the differences in fibers. Does injury segregate samples by PCA when the MuSCs are removed? On a similar note, in figure 6D, if injured fibers are included in the PCA along with mdx fibers (normalizing for what I assume are different sequencing preparations), are they intermediate to the mdx fibers, as stated in lines 384-386?</p><p>– It would be valuable to systematically compare enrichment at non-myogenic promoters to emphasize the myonuclear enrichment.

We now discuss the results of this analysis in the lines 184- 191 which reads as follows:</p><p>“Accessible chromatin regions are associated with various histone marks such as H3K27ac and H3K4me3 (4-6). Thus, we compared the smfATAC-Seq to publicly available datasets on ChIP-Seq on H3K27ac in EDL muscle that was previously performed by Ramachandran, et al., 2019 (GSM3515022, GSM3515023) (7). The comparative analysis has revealed that there were only 97 peaks in the smfATAC-Seq that did not overlap with the H3K27ac peaks, while the majority of the peaks, 6090 peaks, were common to the H3K27ac peaks present in the entire EDL muscle (Figure 2—figure supplement 2K).

Through this comparison, we show that smfATAC-Seq can also provide high resolution assessment of chromatin accessibility a single muscle fiber</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) If the authors intend for smfATACSeq to be performed broadly, it might be helpful to put it on a resource like https://www.protocols.io/ for other researchers to easily use and add notes.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer, and we are preparing a step-by-step protocol to be submitted to Bio-protocol.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) It would be valuable to systematically compare enrichment at non-myogenic promoters to emphasize the myonuclear enrichment.

First, we compared the enrichment of ATAC-Seq peaks on non-myogenic genes in our smfATAC-Seq with an independent ATAC-Seq performed on whole EDL muscle by Ramachandran et al., 2019 (GSM3981673) (7) (Table 2) which contains non myogenic muscle resident cells in addition to the myogenic cells as it is representative of the whole muscle. The results of this comparison can be seen in Table 2.</p><p>We have discussed the results of this analysis in the lines 127-143 which reads as follows:</p><p>“Given that the whole muscle contains non-myogenic cell types, we first compared smfATAC-Seq to an ATAC-Seq performed on whole EDL muscle from Ramachandran, et al., 2019 (GSM3981673) (7) for the enrichment of ATAC-Seq peaks on the genes of non-myogenic cells. We obtained the list of genes that are solely expressed in the whole muscle (RPM of at least 10) but not in the myofibers (RPM of 0) by using an RNA-Seq dataset performed on whole muscle and a single myofiber by Blackburn, et al., 2019 (GSE138591) (8). This list represents genes that are only expressed by the muscle resident non-myogenic cell types, designated as non-fiber muscle genes. We determined the number of peaks in smfATAC-Seq that overlap with non-fiber muscle genes which revealed that only 0.1% of the peaks overlapped with the top 100 non-fiber muscle genes (Table 2). In comparison, 0.33% of the peaks in the whole EDL muscle ATAC-Seq</p><p>(GSM3981673) (7) overlapped with the top 100 non-fiber muscle genes (Table 2). The significant difference in the overlap with the non-fiber muscle genes between the whole muscle ATAC-Seq and smfATAC-Seq suggest that the whole muscle ATAC-Seq has enrichment of peaks associated with non-myogenic genes when compared to the smfATAC-Seq which implies that smfATAC-Seq can successfully exclude the non-myogenic cell types. In contrast, number of overlapping peaks with all the genes expressed in whole muscle in the EDL ATAC-Seq and smfATAC-Seq were similar (Table 2).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Total skeletal muscle ATAC-Seq has been previously published (Ramachandran, et al., PLoS Biology, 2019) in a variety of skeletal muscle types (including EDL vs soleus).

We have determined that 65% of the peaks in the smfATAC-Seq overlap with the ATAC-Seq of the whole muscle by at least 1 bp. We have included a detailed table on the overlap between the two datasets (Table 3).</p><p>We discuss the results of this comparison in the lines 179-182:</p><p>“We also analyzed the overlap between the smfATAC-Seq on single EDL myofibers with the ATAC-Seq performed on the whole EDL muscle by Ramachandran, et al., 2019 (GSM3981673) (7).

The top motifs that were enriched in the sequences under peaks common to injured and uninjured myofibers include binding site for Mef2a (Figure 4—figure supplement 2A).

The labelling for the 300 bp was not placed correctly on the x-axis during the editing process. We have now placed the labels in the correct positions on the x-axis. The correct library size can now be accurately visualized on Figure 1—figure supplement 1A where the bioanalyzer peaks correspond to approximately 200 bp, 400 bp and 600 bp representing regions with mono-, di- and tri-nucleosomes respectively.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The concordance of the smfATAC-Seq data does not seem very good. In Figure 3, only 2 replicates are provided for uninjured fibers and they seem entirely separate. In Figure 6D, WT fibers also do not cluster very well. The authors should provide more replicates for the same condition to show the reproducibility of the approach.</p></disp-quote><p>It is well established that there is a high degree of variation between the myofibers of skeletal muscles. A recent study of RNA-seq on a single myofiber exhibited variations between the individual myofibers within the same condition (8). In addition, another recent study using snRNA-seq found great variation in the transcriptome of myonuclei from the same myofibers (9). In our smfATAC-Seq, while the two uninjured fibers are not identical, they are still very similar as they vary only along the principal component 2 which represents a variation of only 10%. Similarly, while the WT myofibers in Figure 6D also display heterogeneity, they are still more closely associated to the other WT myofibers than to the mdx myofibers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In Figure 3F, there are very few unique peaks in uninjured fibers compared with MuSCs. Does it mean the uninjured fibers are less accessible than MuSCs, or is it due to the different nuclei number input for ATAC-seq? This comparison is not simple and the authors should use the same nuclei number input for different samples.</p></disp-quote><p>The difference in the number of unique peaks between uninjured myofibers and MuSCs are possibly due to the difference in the number of input nuclei. OMNI ATAC-Seq was performed on 5000 MuSCs while the smfATAC-Seq was performed on a single myofiber that contains 200-300 myonuclei. The reason for the inclusion of the MuSC ATAC-Seq data in this manuscript was for the purpose of quality control comparison.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Can the authors provide the smfATAC-Seq genome tracks for Myod1 and Myog loci to illustrate the chromatin accessibility changes in uninjured and injured myofibers since these two genes are essential for muscle regeneration?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included IGV tracks for all the Myogenic Regulatory Factors (MRFs) in Figure 2 —figure supplement 3. We have included these results in the text on lines 211-217 which reads as follows:</p><p>“Muscle regeneration and repair rely on the temporal expression of Myogenic Regulatory factors (MRFs), Myf5, MyoD, Myog and Myf6/MRF4 (1-3). Therefore, we assessed the chromatin accessibility of the MRFs in MuSCs and in the myofibers under homeostasis and regeneration (Figure 2—figure supplement 3). We observed peaks in the promoter regions of Myf5 only in the MuSCs but not in the myofibers and peaks in the promoters of Myog and Myf6/MRF4 were solely observed in the myofibers (Figure 2—figure supplement 3). However, we observed peaks in the promoter regions of MyoD in both the MuSCs and myofibers (Figure 2—figure supplement 3).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In MDX mice, the myofibers undergo regeneration and degeneration cycles. Currently, the authors only compare the uninjured WT myofibers and the MDX myofibers. Can the authors also provide a detailed comparison between the CTX injured myofibers and the MDX myofibers to illustrate the difference in the chromatin accessibility profiles of the two conditions, if any? Alternatively, when is the peak of regeneration and degeneration cycles during the life of an MDX mouse? Again, the current study lacks depth and shows no biological insight.</p></disp-quote><p>The focus of a “Tools and Resource” paper is to validate a new method and not necessarily provide novel biological insights or discoveries. Due to the difference in the genetic background of the mice of injured (C57/BL6) and mdx (C57BL/10ScSn-Dmdmdx/J), the comparison between them might not be appropriate and informative. However, since GO term analysis revealed similar processes between injured and mdx myofibers, we assessed the overall difference in chromatin accessibility by performing heatmap clustering of Pearson correlation coefficients and the PCA analysis on mdx, WT and injured myofibers (Figure 6 —figure supplement 4). Figure 6 —figure supplement 4B shows that while mdx and WT myofibers are more similar to each other than they are to the injured myofibers. However the injured myofibers were more similar to mdx than they are to the WT myofibers. In the future, it would be interesting to perform smfATAC-Seq on mdx and WT mice that are injured in order to compare the myofiber chromatin accessibility during regeneration in a diseased context.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In Line 169, remove redundant &quot;can be&quot; in the sentence.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now removed the redundant wording in the revised text, please see line 242.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The gene names in Figure 5C are not shown clearly.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now edited the figure to make the gene names clearer and readable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):The authors should consider a deeper analysis of the differential chromatin accessibility peaks (subdivided as promoters and distal regions), including prediction of TFs binding sites and integration with other appropriate datasets exploring epigenetic mechanisms (such as histone marks).</p><p>In addition, the differential ATAC-seq peaks (mainly the ones overlapping putative promoters) should be combined with similar datasets exploring transcriptional changes and used to better infer gene networks characterizing the experimental groups.

We now discuss the results of this analysis in the lines 184-191 which reads as follows:</p><p>“Accessible chromatin regions are associated with various histone marks such as H3K27ac and H3K4me3 (4-6).

The comparative analysis has revealed that there were only 97 peaks in the smfATAC-Seq that did not overlap with the H3K27ac peaks, while the majority of the peaks, 6090 peaks, were common to the H3K27ac peaks present in the entire EDL muscle (Figure 2—figure supplement 2K). This demonstrates that the accessible regions that are assessed by smfATAC-Seq correspond to the regions of the chromatin marked by histones that are associated with open chromatin such as H3K27ac.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors have done a good job in demonstrating data quality, and making it available through GEO.

It looks like the MuSCs are driving the differences in PC1, perhaps compressing the differences in fibers. Does injury segregate samples by PCA when the MuSCs are removed? On a similar note, in figure 6D, if injured fibers are included in the PCA along with mdx fibers (normalizing for what I assume are different sequencing preparations), are they intermediate to the mdx fibers, as stated in lines 384-386?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now performed the PCA analysis solely with uninjured and injured myofibers, without the MuSC samples (Figure 3 —figure supplement 1).

Findings of this analysis is discussed in the lines 374-382 which reads as:</p><p>“Since the observed differential biological processes between WT and mdx myofibers were similar to those seen between injured vs uninjured myofibers, we then compared the overall differences in chromatin accessibility between mdx, WT, and injured myofibers. We performed heatmap clustering of Pearson correlation and PCA analysis between WT, mdx and injured myofibers (Figure 6—figure supplement 4). These analyses have revealed that injured myofibers were more similar to the mdx than they are to the WT C57BL/10ScSn myofibers. However, as expected due to the different backgrounds of the mice between injured and the WT and mdx mice, WT and mdx myofibers were more similar to each other than they are to the injured C57BL/6 myofibers (Figure 6—figure supplement 4).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It would be valuable to systematically compare enrichment at non-myogenic promoters to emphasize the myonuclear enrichment. This could be shown by overlaying TSS enrichment plots for genes that are characteristic of myogenic, vs immune vs vascular cells.</p></disp-quote><p>In addition to the figure that we presented in the initial submission (Figure 2—figure supplement 1), we have now looked at the enrichment of non-myogenic genes more globally. First, we compared the enrichment of ATAC-Seq peaks on non-myogenic genes in our smfATAC-Seq with an independent ATAC-Seq performed on whole EDL muscle by Ramachandran et, al. 2019 (GSM3981673) (7) (Table 2) which contains non myogenic muscle resident cells in addition to the myogenic cells as it is representative of the whole muscle. The results of this comparison can be seen in Table 2.</p><p>We have discussed the results of this analysis in the lines 127-143 which reads as follows:</p><p>“Given that the whole muscle contains non-myogenic cell types, we first compared smfATACSeq to an ATAC-Seq performed on whole EDL muscle from Ramachandran, et al., 2019 (GSM3981673) (7) for the enrichment of ATAC-Seq peaks on the genes of non-myogenic cells. We obtained the list of genes that are solely expressed in the whole muscle (RPM of at least 10) but not in the myofibers (RPM of 0) by using an RNA-Seq dataset performed on whole muscle and a single myofiber by Blackburn, et al., 2019 (GSE138591) (8). This list represents genes that are only expressed by the muscle resident non-myogenic cell types, designated as non-fiber muscle genes. We determined the number of peaks in smfATAC-Seq that overlap with non-fiber muscle genes which revealed that only 0.1% of the peaks overlapped with the top 100 non-fiber muscle genes (Table 2). In comparison, 0.33% of the peaks in the whole EDL muscle ATAC-Seq</p><p>(GSM3981673) (7) overlapped with the top 100 non-fiber muscle genes (Table 2). The significant difference in the overlap with the non-fiber muscle genes between the whole muscle ATAC-Seq and smfATAC-Seq suggest that the whole muscle ATAC-Seq has enrichment of peaks associated with non-myogenic genes when compared to the smfATAC-Seq which implies that smfATAC-Seq can successfully exclude the non-myogenic cell types. In contrast, number of overlapping peaks with all the genes expressed in whole muscle in the EDL ATAC-Seq and smfATAC-Seq were similar (Table2).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Total skeletal muscle ATAC-Seq has been previously published (Ramachandran, et al., PLoS Biology, 2019) in a variety of skeletal muscle types (including EDL vs soleus).
