Better detection of early symptoms and relevant disease correlations could improve pancreatic cancer prognosis. In this retrospective study, we used symptom and disease codes (ICD-10) from the Danish National Patient Registry (NPR) encompassing 6.9 million patients from 1994 to 2018,, of whom 23,592 were diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. The Danish cancer registry included 18,523 of these patients. To complement and compare the registry diagnosis codes with deeper clinical data, we used a text mining approach to extract symptoms from free text clinical notes in electronic health records (3078 pancreatic cancer patients and 30,780 controls). We used both data sources to generate and compare symptom disease trajectories to uncover temporal patterns of symptoms prior to pancreatic cancer diagnosis for the same patients. We show that the text mining of the clinical notes was able to complement the registry-based symptoms by capturing more symptoms prior to pancreatic cancer diagnosis. For example, ‘Blood pressure reading without diagnosis’, ‘Abnormalities of heartbeat’, and ‘Intestinal obstruction’ were not found for the registry-based analysis. Chaining symptoms together in trajectories identified two groups of patients with lower median survival (&lt;90 days) following the trajectories ‘Cough→Jaundice→Intestinal obstruction’ and ‘Pain→Jaundice→Abnormal results of function studies’. These results provide a comprehensive comparison of the two types of pancreatic cancer symptom trajectories, which in combination can leverage the full potential of the health data and ultimately provide a fuller picture for detection of early risk factors for pancreatic cancer.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest cancer types. Scientists predict it will become the second largest cause of cancer-related deaths in 2030. It has few or no symptoms at early stages and often goes undetected for an extended period. As a result, patients are often diagnosed at an advanced stage when they have few treatment options and lower survival rates. Only 11 percent of patients with pancreatic cancer survive five years past their diagnosis. Earlier detection and surgery to remove the tumor increase patient survival to 42% at five years. Those who undergo surgery at the earliest stage have an 84% survival rate at five years.</p><p>Developing ways to screen for and detect pancreatic cancer early could improve patient survival. Identifying early symptoms is critical. So far, studies show links between weight loss, abdominal pain, lower back pain, and new-onset diabetes and pancreatic cancer. But clinicians often overlook these symptoms or do not associate them with cancer. National health registries may be data sources that scientists can use to zoom in on early pancreatic symptoms and create alerts for clinicians.</p><p>Hjaltelin, Novitski et al. identified potential pancreatic cancer symptoms using patient registry data and electronic health records. Hjaltelin, Novitski et al. extracted potential pancreatic cancer-related disease or symptom trajectories from 7 million patients listed in the Danish National Patient Registry. They also scoured clinical notes in 34,000 patients’ electronic health records for symptoms. The electronic health records yielded more promising symptoms than the registry. But both data sources produced complementary information. The analysis showed that some symptoms, like jaundice, were associated with higher survival rates because they may lead to earlier diagnosis.</p><p>The data so far suggest that symptoms leading up to a pancreatic cancer diagnosis may be nonspecific and not occur in a particular order. As the cancer progresses, symptoms may become more specific and severe. Further assessment of the study’s results is necessary. Tools like artificial intelligence or advanced text mining may allow scientists identify more definitive early symptom trajectories and help clinicians identify patients earlier.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pancreas cancer</kwd><kwd>symptomology</kwd><kwd>disease progression</kwd><kwd>longitudinal analysis</kwd><kwd>patient stratification</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009708</institution-id><institution>Novo Nordisk Fonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NNF17OC0027594</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hjaltelin</surname><given-names>Jessica Xin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009708</institution-id><institution>Novo Nordisk Fonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NNF14CC0001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Novitski</surname><given-names>Sif Ingibergsdóttir</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>BrainDrugs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R279-2018-1145</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jørgensen</surname><given-names>Isabella Friis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>ImmunAid</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>779295</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jørgensen</surname><given-names>Isabella Friis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>ELIXIR-Converge</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>871075</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Siggaard</surname><given-names>Troels</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>RiskHunt3r</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>974537</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brunak</surname><given-names>Søren</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A comprehensive comparison of the two types of pancreatic cancer symptom trajectories can in combination leverage a fuller potential of large health data and ultimately aid the detection of early risk factors for pancreatic cancer.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pancreatic cancer has been predicted to become the second leading cause of cancer deaths, surpassing breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rahib et al., 2021</xref>).

Hence, improved knowledge of symptoms and diseases occurring early is of high importance to treat this cancer type at a curable stage and provide better prognosis and guide screening programs for pancreatic cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Risch et al., 2015</xref>). If the cancer is detected at an early stage, where surgical removal of the tumour is possible, the survival rate increases to 42% (‘American Cancer Society’, 2020). The patients with stage I disease have the highest 5-year survival of 83.7% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blackford et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Symptoms of pancreatic cancer are often mistaken for signs of less severe illnesses and overlooked in clinical practice. Some of the most frequent symptoms linked to pancreatic cancer are weight loss, abdominal pain, and anorexia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hidalgo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mizrahi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Park et al., 2021</xref>).

New-onset diabetes has additionally been found to co-occur with pancreatic cancer when accompanied by weight loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yuan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hart et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bruenderman and Martin, 2015</xref>).</p><p>National or regional disease registries hold longitudinal data on disease development. The registries in the Nordic countries are of high quality and among the oldest covering treatment in one-payer health care systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Laugesen et al., 2021</xref>). The National Danish Patient Registry (NPR) contains hospital diagnoses since 1977 and allows for large data-driven studies to detect temporal disease progression patterns relevant in the context of stratified medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jensen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Siggaard et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lademann et al., 2019</xref>).

However, much of the deeper phenotypic patient information resides within the free text of the electronic health records (EHRs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jensen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eriksson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Soguero-Ruiz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Delespierre et al., 2017</xref>). A small-scale study using 4080 mixed types of cancers attempted to build more general ‘event trajectories’ using text mining and pooled analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jensen et al., 2017</xref>). A prospective study investigating initial symptoms and diagnostic interval (time from onset to diagnosis) for known pancreatic cancer symptoms found no difference between pancreatic cancer patients and patients suspected of having pancreatic cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Walter et al., 2016</xref>). It has also been suggested that symptoms appear sporadically, adding to the complex nature of the disease manifestation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Evans et al., 2014</xref>). Other studies used primary care EHRs to detect pancreatic cancer symptoms and found jaundice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stapley et al., 2013</xref>), back pain, lethargy, and new-onset diabetes to be linked to pancreatic cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Keane et al., 2014</xref>). These studies detected pancreatic cancer symptoms using a single-disease approach, not considering the temporal ordering of symptoms or diseases.</p><p>In this paper, we present a large-scale study to investigate pancreatic cancer symptoms longitudinally. We cover all symptoms included in the International Classification of Disease (ICD-10) terminology symptom chapter 18. Additionally, we also include in the text mining vocabulary other known or suggested pancreatic cancer symptoms. We generate and compare disease and symptom trajectories using registry data and clinical notes in EHRs to characterize the temporal ordering of symptoms across data sources.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Extracting patient-level data from the Danish National Patient Registry and free text electronic health records</title><p>The Danish National Patient Registry (NPR) data spans the period 1994–2018, while the electronic health records (EHRs) used here are from 2006 to 2016.

We compared these symptoms to the most frequent symptoms in the NRP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). These are counts and show an overview of identified symptoms, which could also be present in the control population. The text mining approach was able to identify 16 unique symptoms in the clinical notes, not registered in NPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The most frequent symptoms exclusively found in the clinical notes were conditions related to ‘Intestinal disorders’, ‘Dorsalgia’ and ‘Embolisms’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). NPR contained 24 ICD-10 symptoms not found by text mining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Frequent symptoms exclusively identified in the NPR data comprised findings related to ‘Functional capacity’, ‘Dysphagia’, ‘Abnormal laboratory findings’, ‘Oedema’, and ‘Abnormal findings on medical images’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In NPR and free text clinical notes, 57 symptoms were identified that occurred in both sources. Of these, the 15 most frequent symptoms from the free text clinical notes and the NPR were compared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Amongst these, we could identify ‘Pain’, ‘Nausea and vomiting’, ‘Abnormal blood-pressure reading’, ‘Abdominal and pelvic pain’, and ‘Symptoms and signs concerning food and fluid intake’. From the hierarchical structure of the ICD-10 chapters, different levels of coding detail can be retrieved. In the symptom block ‘Symptoms and signs concerning food and fluid intake’, the majority of patients represent the subgroups ‘Abnormal weight loss’ (R63.4) and ‘Anorexia’ (R63.0). ‘Nausea and vomiting’, ‘Abnormal blood-pressure reading’ and ‘Weight loss’ were frequent symptoms in the free-text clinical notes, but have low occurrences in NPR. On the contrary, ‘Abdominal and pelvic pain’ was more frequent in NPR than in the clinical notes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We also compared these symptoms to well-known pancreatic cancer symptoms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) showing that most of these are also identified via the two data types.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison of pancreatic cancer symptoms in the Danish National Patient Registry (NPR) and electronic health records (EHRs).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Symptoms before the pancreatic cancer diagnosis identified in NPR (N<sub>NPR</sub> = 24), by text mining of clinical notes from EHRs (N<sub>notes</sub> = 16) or in both data sources (N<sub>both</sub> = 57).

A control group of 30,780 patients was generated by matching birth year, diagnosis year, age and sex. From these, 25,085 patients (82%) had a match for at least one symptom from a general symptom dictionary generated by combining general symptoms from the (1) ICD-10 chapter 18, (2) known pancreatic cancer symptoms from the literature, and (3) a systematic review of clinical notes for pancreatic cancer patients. Text mining the clinical notes identified 73 unique level-3 coded symptoms for the pancreatic cancer cases and 79 unique symptoms for the control group. The performance of the text mining methodology, using symptoms in clinical notes, was validated to check that the text mining method can correctly identify general symptoms. We used a test corpus comprising a random extraction of 200 clinical notes from 200 different patients. In these notes, a total of 807 symptoms were manually annotated and the text mining method was able to identify 675 correctly and 132 symptoms were not found. This yielded a sensitivity score of 83.4%. A specificity score of 99.8% was obtained since most clinical notes comprise non-symptom words describing the patient’s contact with the hospital. Symptoms incorrectly matched to the dictionary (false positives) constitute a total of 53 words and for example captured symptoms where the text mining did not catch the meaning of a negation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Pancreatic cancer trajectories from NPR</title><p>Longitudinal disease trajectories were generated for the pancreatic cancer patients, where significant directional diagnosis pairs were joined to represent patients that traverse a complete disease path.

In total 3863 patients followed at least one symptom trajectory which corresponds to 21% of all the pancreatic cancer cases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1d</xref>).

We also identified less known symptoms such as ‘Haemorrhage’ in respiratory pathways, ‘Haematuria’ (blood in urine) and ‘Pain in throat and chest’. Using the NPR registry, we also analysed significant pancreatic cancer disease trajectories across all disease chapters in the ICD-10 classification system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We detected several disease associations in the cardiovascular chapter (Chapter 9) such as ‘Angina pectoris’ (chest pain), ‘Acute myocardial infarction’, ‘Chronic ischemic heart disease’, and ‘Hypertension’. We also found the well-known risk factor ‘Type 2 Diabetes’. Other disease associations found are part of the Digestive system chapter 11 including ‘Cholelithiasis’ (gallstones) and ‘Disorders of lipoprotein metabolism’. From both length three and four trajectories, we can observe that patients having several cardiovascular diseases prior to pancreatic cancer tend to have worse survival. We additionally looked into the temporality of the significant symptoms prior to the pancreatic cancer diagnosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We found ‘Headache’ and ‘Enlarged lymph nodes’ to be one of the symptoms furthest away from the cancer diagnosis, ‘Abnormalities of heartbeat’ and ‘Pain in throat and chest’ being detected closer, and ‘Visible peristalsis’ and ‘Abdominal and pelvic pain’ being detected closest to cancer diagnosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Pancreatic cancer trajectories from clinical notes</title><p>The symptom trajectories were generated for the pancreatic cancer patients with available clinical notes 5 years prior to the diagnosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). All trajectories shown are significant in terms of direction with at least 20 patients following the complete path of three symptoms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1e</xref>). In total 311 text-mined patients followed at least one trajectory which corresponds to 10% of all the pancreatic cancer cases. A patient can follow several symptom paths. Most of the trajectories begin with ‘Pain’. From the Pain symptom, a large group traverses into ‘Jaundice’ from which most patients either end up with ‘Disorders of porphyrin and bilirubin metabolism’, ‘Fever’, and ‘Intestinal obstruction’. Patient groups that follow the trajectory starting with ‘Cough’ leading to ‘Jaundice’ and ending up with ‘Intestinal obstruction’ have shorter median survival (median survival ≤90 days). Also, the trajectory starting with ‘Pain’ progressing into ‘Jaundice’ and ending with ‘Abnormal results of function studies’ shows lower survival.</p><p>Overall, the trajectories progress from generic symptoms such as ‘Pain’, ‘Abnormalities of heartbeat’, ‘Dizziness’ and ‘Polyuria’ into more known risk factors of pancreatic cancer involving ‘Abdominal and pelvic pain’, ‘Anorexia’, and ‘Jaundice’.

We complemented pancreatic cancer symptoms from hospital diagnosis codes with symptoms extracted by text mining using free text in EHRs. We observed that symptoms were more abundant in the EHRs opposed to the NPR. For example, more than 2000 patients out of 3078 text-mined pancreatic cancer cases had ‘Pain’ according to the free text clinical notes but in the registry, it was less than 500 patients out of the 18,523 pancreatic cancer cases. On the contrary, there were some symptoms identified more abundantly in the NPR compared to the clinical notes.</p><p>From our trajectory analysis, we detected mainly symptom trajectories for patients in the longer survival group (&gt;90 days). This could be because patients in the short survival group (≤90 days) have fewer symptoms detected and thus will not show up in the symptom trajectories. For the text-mined symptom trajectories, we could detect more symptoms prior to the cancer diagnosis than in the registry-based trajectories using the NPR, despite the text-mining cohort being much smaller.</p><p>‘Jaundice’ can in some cases be a symptom of a late-stage cancer and thus poor survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Strasberg et al., 2014</xref>), but in other cases contribute as a clearer cancer symptom compared to the other more generic pancreatic cancer symptoms. Studies have found the diagnostic interval to be shorter for jaundice compared to for example weight loss for pancreatic cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Walter et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gobbi et al., 2013</xref>). It could therefore indicate a faster diagnosis but not necessarily a longer survival. We furthermore observed that disease trajectories including several cardiovascular diseases show lower survival, and it has been suggested in previous studies that cardiovascular diseases can play a role in pancreatic cancer prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ögren et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bertero et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, cardiovascular diseases have been indicated as a risk factor for certain other cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lau et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Strongman et al., 2019</xref>), and contrariwise it is also discussed whether cancer should be included in cardiovascular risk prediction tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blaes and Shenoy, 2019</xref>).</p><p>A limitation of this study is that our data is strictly hospital contacts, which may result in a set of identified symptoms and diagnoses occurring not at the earliest disease stage. By including data from general practitioners, future studies could potentially identify even earlier symptom patterns prior to pancreatic cancer. Causal patterns cannot be directly inferred from the trajectories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jensen et al., 2014</xref>). Confounders could for example be medication or other risk factors that are not accounted for in the analyses. In this type of trajectory study, we can only assess the association between diseases, but actual causal relationships will need to be validated by other types of studies, such as Mendelian randomization using genetics. Furthermore, the available period for the clinical notes (2006–2016) was shorter compared to the NPR (1994–2018). A direct comparison between the two data sources can be challenging since registry terms are not coded exactly as in the free text clinical notes. One example is acute abdomen in the symptom block ‘Abdominal and pelvic pain’, which describes a condition with severe abdominal pain that demands immediate medical attention. A clinical note might contain text that the patient was admitted with severe stomach pain but code it as the ICD-10 code ‘R10.0 - Acute abdomen’ in NPR which essentially would mean the same. Our text mining procedure had a sensitivity error of 83.4% which is in the expected range for the program Tagcorpus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pafilis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pafilis et al., 2015</xref>). Also, information bias may exist in the coding procedure within NPR and it might not always be trivial to code the correct symptom or diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schmidt et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lynge et al., 2011</xref>). From our study, we show that the inclusion of symptoms text-mined from clinical notes largely complemented ICD-10-coded symptoms from the patient registry.</p><p>This study showed that deep phenotypical information stored in registry data and free text EHRs can be useful for detecting temporal patterns prior to pancreatic cancer diagnosis. Furthermore, our study reveals a notable increase in the prevalence of early symptoms within EHRs suggesting the possibility of harnessing the complete potential of health data by incorporating multi-modality symptom trajectories derived from both EHRs and registry-based codes. This integrated approach provides a comprehensive representation of the symptomatology, enabling a more accurate assessment of disease trajectories and potentially facilitating early detection and intervention. Overall, our findings underscore the importance of comprehensive symptom assessment for improved prediction and patient outcomes in pancreatic cancer.</p><p>The sequence of events that leads up till the pancreatic cancer diagnosis supports that symptoms may appear in a messy and complex order. Patients start experiencing general and unspecific symptoms, which then become more specific and severe as the cancer advances. Future applications could leverage this knowledge and use AI and advanced text mining techniques to build longitudinal multi-modal trajectories for improved symptom extraction and early prediction of pancreatic cancer in the clinics. In clinical settings, this could ultimately serve as a guide for better screening procedures and improve the lives of pancreatic cancer patients.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study design</title><p>For the generation of the trajectories, we used disease codes from the hierarchical International Classification of Diseases (ICD) system.

ICD version 10 codes at level 3 were used for this study. The EHR data comprising clinical notes included all records from the Capital Region of Denmark and Region Zealand from the period of 2006–2016. The clinical notes contain information regarding a hospital encounter such as the reason for admission, findings, symptoms, operations, and treatments. Only patients with at least one clinical note within a five-year time interval before diagnosis were included. A control group was sampled to match sex, age, birth year and diagnosis year for a hospital contact with 10 control patients per pancreatic cancer patient. Diagnosis year was used instead of the specific date since a date limited the possible control matches. The clinical notes for the control group were additionally analysed in a five-year time interval before the hospital contact. This was done to ensure that the pancreatic cancer patients were compared with a similar age group and time-span. The registries and EHRs could be linked through a pseudo-anonymized version of the Central Personal Register (CPR) number, which all Danish citizens possess.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Preprocessing of patient cohorts</title><p>Status codes 01 and 90 have been included in the analysis, excluding the rest of the status codes to make sure only active residents in Denmark (01) and inactive dead individuals (90) are a part of the cohort.

This was to ensure that the analysis was based on the main medically relevant diagnoses in NPR.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Text mining clinical notes</title><p>A dictionary was constructed by including all symptoms from the ICD-10 symptom chapter 18. Known pancreatic cancer symptoms that were not already a part of chapter 18, were added to the vocabulary by both systematic review of pancreatic cancer clinical notes and literature studies. The final symptom dictionary comprised 691 symptoms. The symptoms were initially written in their singular forms and afterwards suffixes were added to ensure different variants of a symptom such as plural forms. Other word endings like ‘condition’ or ‘symptom’ were also added since these are sometimes put behind a symptom in Danish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Afterwards, the extended dictionary and the clinical notes from the patients and the control group were tokenized. The unique tokens from each were then compared to extract spelling errors on words longer or equal to five characters. To extract words with spelling errors, the tokens from the dictionary were fuzzy matched against the tokens from the clinical notes using the Python package fuzzysearch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Einat, 2020</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The text mining pipeline.</title><p>A dictionary was generated with symptoms and expanded with word endings to capture multiple forms of the same symptom.

It is a fast program written in C++, which for example is able to process thousands of PubMed abstracts per second (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pafilis and Jensen, 2016</xref>). A post-processing step was applied that removed sentences with negations and mentioning of other persons than the patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eriksson et al., 2014</xref>). This ensures that whenever there is a negation word in a sentence the word will not be tagged. For example, not, never, and no are a part of the negation dictionary. From the other person’s filter, the symptom will not be tagged if a sentence contains for example mother, brother etc. since it might relate to another person and not to the patient in question. The evaluation of the text mining was done using a confusion matrix of 200 randomly selected clinical notes. These were checked manually for incorrectly and correctly matched symptoms.

For the construction of the symptom trajectories the odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using a logistic regression model with all possible symptom pairs and stratified by the selection criteria for the controls.</p><p>Subsequently, each symptom pair, with OR &gt;1 and a significant p-value &lt;0.05, was tested for directionality and Bonferroni-corrected based on the same approach as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jensen et al., 2014</xref>. For the text-mined symptoms, the day of admission was used as the time registered for the symptom, since capturing the symptom as early as possible is crucial for the purpose of this study.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Approvals</title><p>The work was approved as a registry study that does not require ethical permissions in Denmark as well as patient consent.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>As is customary in <italic>eLife</italic>, the reviewers have discussed their critiques with one another. What follows below is the Reviewing Editor's edited compilation of the essential and ancillary points provided by reviewers in their critiques and in their interaction post-review.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This study presents valuable and solid findings on the symptoms and disease trajectories preceding a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Please address the major concerns of both reviewers. Revisions should include, (1) an error analysis for the text mining evaluation results with information on recall errors, and (2) a discussion on how the findings of this work could be applied in practice towards early detection and prognosis of pancreatic cancer.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) It is difficult to compare results from the free-text entries and diagnosis codes, as the former are based on only a small subset of patients. If possible, the authors should examine the subset of NPR data relating to patients with free-text clinical records available. Such an analysis could help show a lot more directly what is captured by free-text entries versus diagnosis codes.</p><p>This analysis would also allow us to examine free-text notes and diagnosis codes together – if the aim is to help detect pancreatic cancer earlier, and especially if free-text notes and diagnosis code entries capture different symptoms and early-warning signs, using more of the available information could be highly advantageous.</p><p>2) &quot;We found that for patients with short survival ({less than or equal to}90 days), symptoms could be tracked further back in the clinical notes, whereas patients with longer survival showed symptoms appearing closer to diagnosis. This could indicate that the pancreatic cancer had metastasized further in the patients with short survival.&quot;. Could cancer stage or spread at diagnosis be obtained from the NPR or clinical notes? That would allow for the testing of this hypothesis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>For the results in Figure 1, raw frequency of symptom occurrence was used to depict their relevance to the disease. However, it should be noted that some symptoms may be common for both pancreatic cancer patients and controls. In fact, your text mining method detected at least one symptom in the clinical notes of nearly 90% of the control group. Therefore, the authors may consider moving results in Figure 3 immediately after Figure 1 results.</p><p>Regarding Figure 3, I noticed that for each symptom, there are two color bars representing each patient group based on their median survival days. I'm curious why the purple bar is typically longer in this figure. Additionally, could you please clarify the meaning of the black dots mentioned in the figure caption, as they are not entirely self-explanatory?</p><p>Symptoms in Figure 2 are color-coded by their higher-level groups. Can this be done also for Figure 1 results, so that it makes it more obvious to tell the differences in the two data sources?</p><p>Typo in Table 1.

For example, what symptoms are C25, R50, and R52 in the first row?</p><p>S2. For example, it is stated that &quot;One of the trajectory groups is formed by cardiovascular diseases (1720 patients)&quot; but it's unclear which rows in S2 correspond to this number.</p><p>The equations in the Methods section are not displayed well in PDF.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84919.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revision:</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) It is difficult to compare results from the free-text entries and diagnosis codes, as the former are based on only a small subset of patients.

However, we performed two different types of analyses on the two data sets: (1) a population-wide study for the NPR registry data and (2) a case-control study using the text-mined data set. The purpose using two approaches was to uncover and compare potential symptoms at the trajectory-level using the entire cohorts, and not only for a limited patient-cohort.</p><p>However, to address the problem highlighted by the reviewer, we have generated symptoms trajectories for the registry-based analysis and now compare these versus the text-mining analysis, and have added the diagnosis-wide trajectories (including other chapters of the ICD-10) to the Supplementary figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This analysis would also allow us to examine free-text notes and diagnosis codes together – if the aim is to help detect pancreatic cancer earlier, and especially if free-text notes and diagnosis code entries capture different symptoms and early-warning signs, using more of the available information could be highly advantageous.</p></disp-quote><p>This could be interesting, but is out of scope for this paper. Here we would like to stress the proof-of-concept that the two data types can complement each other. The next steps would be to generate these multimodal trajectories to for example test if they are predictive of pancreatic cancer. Nonetheless, we acknowledge the significance of this perspective and have incorporated it into the Discussion section of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) &quot;We found that for patients with short survival ({less than or equal to}90 days), symptoms could be tracked further back in the clinical notes, whereas patients with longer survival showed symptoms appearing closer to diagnosis.

In this version of the manuscript, we chose to only showcase symptom trajectories for both data types since these are more directly comparable, as suggested by the reviewer.
