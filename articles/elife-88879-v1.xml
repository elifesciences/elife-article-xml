Analysis of colonic epithelial cell diversity by single-cell RNA-sequencing has revealed the existence of a cluster of <italic>BEST4</italic>+ mature colonocytes in humans. However, if the role of <italic>BEST4</italic> is involved in regulating tumour progression remains largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that <italic>BEST4</italic> overexpression attenuates cell proliferation, colony formation, and mobility in colorectal cancer (CRC) in vitro, and impedes the tumour growth and the liver metastasis in vivo. BEST4 is co-expressed with hairy/enhancer of split 4 (<italic>HES4</italic>) in the nucleus of cells, and HES4 signals <italic>BEST4</italic> by interacting with the upstream region of the <italic>BEST4</italic> promoter. <italic>BEST4</italic> is epistatic to <italic>HES4</italic> and downregulates TWIST1, thereby inhibiting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in CRC. Conversely, knockout of BEST4 using CRISPR/Cas9 in CRC cells revitalises tumour growth and induces EMT. Furthermore, the low level of the <italic>BEST4</italic> mRNA is correlated with advanced and the worse prognosis, suggesting its potential role involving CRC progression.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>colorectal cancer</kwd><kwd>bestrophin-4</kwd><kwd>hairy/enhancer of split 4</kwd><kwd>TWIST1</kwd><kwd>epithelial-mesenchymal transition</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82103539</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Zijing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82074298</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Ziyi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100017513</institution-id><institution>Sichuan Association for Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021YFH0005</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Zijing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100017513</institution-id><institution>Sichuan Association for Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022YFH0003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Jilin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100020207</institution-id><institution>Health Commission of Sichuan Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2023104</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Zijing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82173253</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Jilin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The inhibition of colorectal cancer (CRC) proliferation, migration, and invasion is attributed to BEST4, which exhibits epistasis over Hes4 in the downregulation of Twist1 and consequent suppression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in CRC.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common tumour worldwide. A steady increase in the morbidity and mortality of CRC has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rawla et al., 2019</xref>). When diagnosed in advanced stages, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) may occur as CRC metastasize to distal organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Pastushenko and Blanpain, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sunlin Yong et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yeung and Yang, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). EMT is a reprogramming process in which epithelial E-cadherin and TJP1 are suppressed, and mesenchymal N-cadherin and VIM are induced, transcriptionally mediated by Twist and the Snail family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dongre and Weinberg, 2019</xref>). Overexpression of TWIST1 significantly enhances the migration and invasion capabilities of CRC cells; furthermore, it is closely associated with metastasis and poor prognosis in patients with CRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yusup et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The inhibition of EMT in breast cancer and prostate cancer has been associated with calcium-activated chloride channels (CaCCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Porretti et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Walia et al., 2012</xref>), leading to various evaluations of CaCCs as a potential for cancer therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Miotto and Struhl, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Qu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sui et al., 2014</xref>). The bestrophin (<italic>BEST</italic>) chloride channel, which is a member of a recently identified gene family, encodes several integral membrane proteins expressed on the basolateral membranes of epithelial cells; they regulate CaCCs to maintain homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Marmorstein et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tsunenari et al., 2003</xref>). Although there are four human evolutionarily related genes (<italic>BEST1âBEST4</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Miller et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tsunenari et al., 2003</xref>), <italic>BEST4</italic> is expressed predominantly in the colon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fagerberg et al., 2014</xref>), where it gates electrolyte transportation in human intestinal epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ito et al., 2013</xref>). However, its role and the mechanism in regulating the development of CRC are currently unknown.</p><p>In a recent analysis based on single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis, it was discovered that a group of mature colonocytes expresses <italic>BEST4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Parikh et al., 2019</xref>), and the subset of this group coexists with hairy/enhancer of split 4 positive (<italic>HES4</italic><sup>+</sup>) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Parikh et al., 2019</xref>). <italic>HES4</italic> belongs to a family of seven Hes genes (Hes1â7) that encodes a transcription factor with a basic helix-loop-helix motif. It is known to play a critical role in determining the fate and differentiation of progenitor cells during the development of various organs. The previous study has demonstrated the antagonistic role of HES4 in regulating TWIST1 through protein-protein interaction, which governs the differentiation of bone marrow stromal/stem cell lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cakouros et al., 2015</xref>). Inhibiting the TWIST1 transcriptional factor has been shown to mediate commitment to the differentiation of human bone marrow stem cells, as reported by several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cakouros et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">El Yakoubi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Murato and Hashimoto, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Nichane et al., 2008</xref>). Given this information, it is tempting to speculate that BEST4 may be associated with HES4 and TWIST1 in regulating EMT during CRC progression.</p><p>The objectives of the present study are as follows: (1) to establish the role of BEST4 in CRC growth both in vitro and in vivo; (2) to determine the underlying molecular mechanisms by which BEST4 interacts with HES4 and TWIST1, thereby inducing EMT; and (3) to investigate the correlation between BEST4 expression and prognosis of CRC.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>BEST4</italic> inhibits CRC proliferation, clonogenesis, migration, and invasion in vitro</title><p>To evaluate the effect of BEST4 on tumour growth, we constructed <italic>BEST4-</italic>expressing HCT116 and Caco2 CRC cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>) and showed that <italic>BEST4</italic> overexpression halved cell proliferating rates of their respective empty vector (EV) controls when they were monitored in live and analysed using InCucyte (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>).

Immunoblotting analysis of tissue lysates from five paired randomly selected samples showed that BEST4 protein was downregulated in CRC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1G</xref>). Using public datasets of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx), we measured <italic>BEST4</italic> mRNA expression in CRC and matched normal tissues with the online Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gepia.cancer-pku.cn/">http://gepia.cancer-pku.cn/</ext-link>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> the normal colorectal control tissues consistently expressed higher <italic>BEST4</italic> than the CRC.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Correlation of the <italic>BEST4</italic> mRNA expression with clinicopathology and outcomes of patients diagnosed with CRC.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Heatmap based on the top 100 differentially expressed genes (downregulated and upregulated) in CRCs compared with ANTs.

(<bold>G</bold>) A working model delineates the mechanism by which <italic>BEST4</italic> is transcriptionally activated by <italic>HES4</italic> and suppressed epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through TWIST1 inhibition: (a) the expression of <italic>BEST4</italic> is regulated by interactions of its upstream promoter region with HES4. <italic>BEST4</italic> positively promotes the transcriptional activity of HES4 on <italic>BEST4</italic> by physically binding to HES4 in a positive feedback loop. (b) The complex formed by BEST4 and HES4 interacts with TWIST1 and inhibits the promoter activity of TWIST1. HES4 alone is insufficient to inhibit TWIST1 promoter activity, and BEST4 is required. Inhibition of TWIST1 promoter activity by HES4 is BEST4-dependent. (c) The complex formed by BEST4 and HES4 destabilised TWIST1; the same effect caused by HES4 required BEST4 intermediation. The HES4-BEST4-TWIST1 axis counteracts EMT induction. *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01; CRC, colorectal cancer; ANT, adjacent normal tissue; T, tumour.</p><p><supplementary-material id="fig5sdata1"><label>Figure 5âsource data 1.</label><caption><title>Original files for western blot analysis displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>.</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip" xlink:href="elife-88879-fig5-data1-v1.zip"/></supplementary-material></p><p><supplementary-material id="fig5sdata2"><label>Figure 5âsource data 2.</label><caption><title>PDF file containing original western blots for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, indicating the relevant bands and treatments.</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip" xlink:href="elife-88879-fig5-data2-v1.zip"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-88879-fig5-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig5s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 5âfigure supplement 1.</label><caption><title><italic>BEST4</italic> suppresses epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) independently of its channel functions.</title><p>(<bold>AâC</bold>) Incubation of HCT116 cell lines expressed BEST4 or empty vector (EV) with DIDS (300 Î¼M), a gradient increased CaCCinh-A01 and ionomycin (1 Î¼M), respectively, overnight.

An axis comprising <italic>HES4/BEST4/</italic> TWIST1 governs the induction of EMT in CRC. <italic>BEST4</italic> interacts with <italic>HES4</italic> at the transcriptional and translational levels, and downregulates TWIST1 expression, resulting in EMT inhibition but independent of its channel functions. Our findings support the notion in several ways: (1) <italic>HES4</italic> binds to the promoter region of <italic>BEST4</italic>; (2) BEST4 colocalises with HES4 and TWIST1 in the nucleus of cells, and protein-protein interactions; (3) the BEST4 inhibitory role in EMT exhibits upregulation of epithelial TJP1 and E-cadherin, and downregulation of mesenchymal VIM and TWIST1 in CRC; and finally (4) low <italic>BEST4</italic> mRNA levels were significantly correlated with malignant lesions and worse outcomes of CRC patients. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first characterisation of the role of BEST4 in suppressing CRC progression and the underlying molecular mechanisms.</p><p>CaCCs are expressed widely in several types of epithelial and endothelial cells and are classified as calcium-dependent chloride channels (e.g. anoctamin-1 [ANO1 or TMEM16]), chloride channel accessory proteins (CLCAs), and members of the BEST family. The latter is a recent addition to the class of molecularly defined chloride channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Huang et al., 2012</xref>). Calcium-dependent chloride channels and CLCAs are differentially expressed in CRC and normal colon tissues, exerting pro- or anti-growth effects, while little is known of BEST family in CRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sanders et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sui et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). There are four subtypes of the <italic>BEST</italic> family in mammals that assemble as pentamers to form Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>-</sup> channels and maintain cellular physiological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Marmorstein et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Milenkovic et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tsunenari et al., 2003</xref>). Subtypes of <italic>BEST1-3</italic> are responsible for vitelliform macular dystrophy, regulating the cilia of olfactory sensory neuronal activity; others regulate cGMP-dependent calcium-activated chloride conductance in vascular smooth muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Matchkov et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Pifferi et al., 2009</xref>). An intrinsic function of the <italic>BEST4</italic> gene in modulating CRC growth remains poorly illustrated. In the present study, we demonstrated that BEST4 functionally inhibits the development of CRC in vitro and in vivo. BEST4 is transcriptionally regulated and physically interacts with upstream <italic>HES4</italic>, leading to downregulation of TWIST1 and EMT suppression. This suppression is independent of physiological Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>-</sup> channels since inhibition of BEST4-associated Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and Cl<sup>-</sup> fluxes did not alter TJP1/E-cadherin and TWIST1 protein expression.</p><p>The recent identification of a heterogeneous BEST4<sup>+</sup> and HES4<sup>+</sup> subgroup in a human colonic epithelial lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Parikh et al., 2019</xref>) led us to consider their potential role in regulating CRC progression. Among the HES family, which is associated with intestinal progenitor cells in adenoma transformation, HES1 and HES4 are a paralog pair, with other members more distantly related (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Katoh and Katoh, 2004</xref>).

The whole process is regulated by transcriptional factors of the Snail family and TWIST1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dongre and Weinberg, 2019</xref>). TWIST1 (a basic helix<bold>-</bold>loop-helix transcription factor) reprograms EMT by repressing the expression of E-cadherin and TJP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Nagai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yang et al., 2004</xref>) and simultaneously inducing several mesenchymal markers, typically VIM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bulzico et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Meng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Nagai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yang et al., 2004</xref>), which is a pivotal predictor of CRC progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Vesuna et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yusup et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>). The TWIST1 transcriptional factor plays a crucial role in inducing EMT, which contributes to the malignant lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yang et al., 2004</xref>). Its physical interaction with HES4 determines human bone marrow stromal/stem cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cakouros et al., 2015</xref>). TWIST1, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, represses the expression of E-cadherin and TJP1 and induces several mesenchymal markers including vimentin, which is a pivotal predictor of CRC progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Nagai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bulzico et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Meng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Nagai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Vesuna et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yusup et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>). Overexpression of TWIST1 significantly enhances the migration and invasion capabilities of CRC cells; furthermore, it is closely associated with metastasis and poor prognosis in patients with CRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yusup et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>). Despite TWIST1 importance in CRC, little is known about how it is controlled during EMT induction. Our present study reveals that TWIST1 colocalised and interacted with BEST4 in the nucleus of CRC HCT116 cells, leading to downregulation of TWIST1 and inhibition of EMT. HES4 also caused the same effect, but through intermediation with BEST4. Although the mechanistic insights of their interplay remain to be elucidated, the present study identifies the HES4-BEST4-TWIST1 axis that contributes to counter EMT in the development of CRC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>).</p><p>Lastly, our analysis of correlations reveals the clinical significance of BEST4 expression in CRC. In particular, the mRNA levels of BEST4 were lower in tissues of both precancerous adenomatous lesions and CRC than ANTs. These alterations are significantly correlated with large tumour size, positive nodes, and poor overall survival, especially in male patients. Interestingly, a previous study conducted on a Chinese cohort reported an approximately 40% higher incidence of CRC in males than in females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). But it remains to be investigated whether sex hormone-related factors play a role in the gender-specific downregulation of BEST4 and its impact on CRC in males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yu et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, the functional significance of BEST4 in CRC development and its interplay with other molecules is completely unknown. The present study demonstrates the role of BEST4 in inhibiting CRC proliferation, migration, and invasion both in models of in vitro and in vivo. Mechanically, <italic>BEST4</italic> is epistatic to HES4 for downregulating TWIST1 and inhibits EMT in CRC. Therefore, we reveals a previously unknown mechanism of the HES4-BEST4-TWIST1 axis that restrains the progression of CRC.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Clinical samples</title><p>A total of 124 samples of paired CRC and ANTs and 50 samples of paired adenoma and ANT were collected randomly from clinical specimens from patients undergoing intestinal resections or upper gastrointestinal endoscopies at the Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery and Digestive Endoscopy Centre, West China Hospital, China, between January and December 2013.

While we acknowledge the potential of intestinal epithelial organoids as a valuable model for this study and will consider establishing this system in future research, which falls outside the scope of our current work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors use three different human CRC cell lines with a lack of consistency in the selection of them. Please clarify (1) how these lines are different from each other, (2) why they pick up one or two of them for each experiment. To be more convincing, at least two lines should be employed for each in vitro experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for any confusion caused to the reviewer. In our study, we employed HCT116 and Caco2 cell lines to investigate the overexpression of BEST4 in the biological functions of CRC and its involvement in EMT. The selection of HCT116, a human CRC cell line, was based on its relatively lower expression level of BEST4 compared to other CRC cell lines. Conversely, Caco2 is a human colon adenocarcinoma cell line that closely resembles differentiated intestinal epithelial cells and exhibits microvilli structures. Given that BEST4 serves as a marker for intestinal epithelial cells, these two cell lines were chosen for investigating the in vitro effects of overexpressing BEST4 on proliferation, clonality, invasion, migration of colon cancer tumor cells and expression of downstream EMT-related markers. Similarly, we selected the HCT-15 cell line derived from human CRC for BEST4 knockout due to its comparatively higher expression level of BEST4 among other CRC cell lines. We employed the CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology to knockout BEST4 instead of utilizing shRNA for downregulating BEST4 expression, thereby limiting our selection to a single cell line.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors demonstrated associations between BEST4 and cell proliferation/ viability as well as migration/invasion, utilizing CRC cell lines, but it should be noted that these findings do not indicate a tumor-suppressive role of BEST4 as mentioned in line 120. Furthermore, while the authors propose that &quot;BEST4 functions as a tumor suppressor in CRC&quot; in line 50, there seems no supporting data to suggest BEST4 as a tumor suppressor gene.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for these inaccurate expressions, and we have made the necessary modifications to the corresponding parts in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The HES4-BEST4-Twist1 axis likely plays a significant role in CRC progression via EMT but not CRC initiation. Some sentences could lead to a misunderstanding that the axis is important for CRC initiation.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for these inaccurate expressions, and we have made the necessary modifications to the corresponding parts in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The authors mostly focus on the relationship of the HES4-BEST4-Twist1 axis with EMT, but their claims sometimes appear to deviate from this focus.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for confusing the reviewer. The objectives of our study are as follows: (1) to establish the role of BEST4 in CRC growth both in vitro and in vivo; (2) to determine the underlying molecular mechanisms by which BEST4 interacts with Hes4 and Twist1, thereby regulating EMT; and (3) to investigate the correlation between BEST4 expression and prognosis of CRC. We have made the necessary modifications to the corresponding parts in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Some experiments do not appear to have a direct relevance to their claims. For example, the analysis using the xenograft model in Figure 2E-J is not optimal for analyzing EMT. The authors should analyze metastatic or invasive properties of the transplanted tumors if they intend to provide some supporting evidence for their claims.</p></disp-quote><p>Sincerely thanks for catching this issue. The process of EMT transforms epithelial cells exhibiting a spindle fibroblast-like morphology, leading to the acquisition of mesenchymal characteristics and morphology, enabling these cells to acquire invasive and migratory abilities, with expression switching epithelial E-cadherin and Zo-1 to mesenchymal vimentin (Dongre and Weinberg, 2019)..The whole process is regulated by transcriptional factors of the Snail family and Twist1(Dongre and Weinberg, 2019). We utilized the xenograft model with overexpressed BEST4 to analyze the lysates of tumor tissue, revealing that BEST4 upregulated E-cadherin and downregulated vimentin and Twist1 (Figures 2I). These findings indicate that BEST4 inhibits EMT in vivo. Deletion of BEST4 may enable these cells to acquire invasive and migratory abilities, leading to metastasis in vivo. Therefore, we subsequently evaluated the metastatic potential of BEST4 in a CRC liver metastasis model by intrasplenically injecting HCT-15 cell lines with knockout of BEST4 (BEST4gRNA), wild-type control (gRNA), or knockout with rescue (BEST4-Rescued) into BALB/c nude mice. Our observations revealed a twofold increase in liver metastatic nodules in the absence of BEST4 compared to the control group (Fig. 2J-L). Although further in vivo experiments are required for confirmation, our research suggests a potential role for BEST4 in counteracting EMT induction in vivo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) In Figure 4H, ZO-1 and E-cad expression looks unchanged in the BEST4 KD.</p></disp-quote><p>Sincerely thanks for catching this issue. We have implemented the necessary modifications to the corresponding sections in the manuscript and performed a comprehensive quantification of all Western Blot data to ensure statistically significant differences, including those presented in the supplementary file.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) The in vivo and in vitro data supporting the whole transcriptome sequence analysis (Figure 5) is mostly insufficient. Including the following experiments will substantiate their claims: (1) BEST4 and HES4 immunostaining of human surgical tissue samples, (2) qPCR data of HES4, Twist1, Vimentin, etc. as shown in Figure 5C, 5D.</p></disp-quote><p>Sincerely thanks for catching this issue.</p><p>(1) Due to the substandard quality of the BEST4 antibody, we opted to evaluate the clinical significance of BEST4 in CRC by assessing mRNA results instead of protein levels using immunohistochemistry (IHC). After testing multiple antibodies for western blotting, only one (1:800; LsBio, LS-C31133) accurately indicated BEST4 protein expression while still exhibiting some non-specific bands. Consequently, we decided to transfect a HA-tagged BEST4 plasmid into the CRC cell line and used HA as a marker for BEST4 expression. Unfortunately, none of the antibodies employed for IHC were suitable as they failed to accurately distinguish between positive or negative staining for BEST4 and showed significant non-specific staining (data not shown). The challenge in detecting BEST4 protein in colorectal cancer tissues may be attributed to its low expression levels. Our findings are consistent with previous reports from the Human Protein Atlas database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000142959-BEST4/pathology">https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000142959-BEST4/pathology</ext-link>), which also did not detect any BEST4 protein expression in colorectal cancer tissues through IHC analysis.</p><p>(2) The qPCR data of E-cadherin, Twist1, and Vimentin mRNA expression in CRC tissue has already been published in other studies(Christou et al., 2017; Lazarova and Bordonaro, 2016; Zhu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015). It was found that E-cadherin is downregulated, while Twist1 and Vimentin are upregulated in CRC tissue compared to the adjacent normal tissues. The qPCR data of E-cadherin, Twist1, and Vimentin mRNA expression in CRC tissue has already been published in other studies(Christou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017; Lazarova and Bordonaro, 2016; Zhu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015). It was found that E-cadherin is downregulated, while Twist1 and Vimentin are upregulated in CRC tissue compared to the adjacent normal tissues. The analysis of mRNA expression data obtained from colorectal cancer samples and normal samples in the publicly available databases TCGA and GTEx also revealed a significant downregulation of _Hes_4 expression in colorectal cancer tissues, which will be our next research objective.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Some statements are inconsistent probably due to grammatical errors.

Previous research has demonstrated the antagonistic role of Hes4 in regulating Twist1 through protein-protein interaction, which governs the differentiation of bone marrow stromal/stem cell lineage (Cakouros et al., 2015). Based on these findings, we speculate that there may be an interactive regulation between BEST4/Hes4/Twist1, potentially influencing the process of cell polarity during epithelial-mesenchymal transition in colorectal cancer.

The process of EMT transforms epithelial cells exhibiting a spindle fibroblast-like morphology, leading to the acquisition of mesenchymal characteristics and morphology, enabling these cells to acquire invasive and migratory abilities, with expression switching epithelial E-cadherin and Zo-1 to mesenchymal vimentin (Dongre and Weinberg, 2019). When diagnosed in advanced stages, EMT may occur as CRC metastasize to distal organs (Pastushenko and Blanpain, 2019; Sunlin Yong, 2021; Yeung and Yang, 2017; Zhang et al., 2021).The whole process is regulated by transcriptional factors of the Snail family and Twist1(Dongre and Weinberg, 2019). Twist1 (a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor) reprograms EMT by repressing the expression of E-cadherin and ZO-1 (Nagai et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2004) and simultaneously inducing several mesenchymal markers, typically vimentin (Bulzico et al., 2019; Meng et al., 2018; Nagai <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016; Yang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004), which is a pivotal predictor of CRC progression (Vesuna et al., 2008; Yang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004; Yusup et al., 2017; Zhu et al., 2015).Overexpression of Twist1 significantly enhances the migration and invasion capabilities of colorectal cancer cells; furthermore, it is closely associated with metastasis and poor prognosis in patients with colorectal cancer(Yusup <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017; Zhu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015). We have supplemented and improved these parts of the introduction and discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors sufficiently prove that HES4/BEST4 regulates TWIST1 downregulation, however, we believe the findings are not enough to show *direct* regulation (refer also to line 273).

Although the interaction may not be direct, our co-immunoprecipitation (CO-IP) results demonstrated nuclear colocalization of Twist1 and BEST4 (Figure 4D; Figure 4-supplemental figure 1A). Furthermore, their interaction destabilized Twist1 and significantly inhibited the induction of EMT. We have made corrections to this section in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The discussion is very short and not satisfactory; is BEST4 an evolutionary conserved protein (besides the channel region)? Any speculation on which domain(s) is(are) important for the interaction with HES4 and TWIST1? How do the findings in the current study compare with recent, potentially contradicting data indicating a pro-tumorigenic function of BEST4 for CRC, including its upregulation (and not downregulation) in malignant intestinal tissues, and activation of PI3K/AKT signaling (PMID: 35058597)?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for our shallow discussion. We have supplemented and improved some parts of the discussion. The bestrophins are a highly conserved family of integral membrane proteins initially discovered in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (Sonnhammer and Durbin, 1997). Homologous sequences can be found across animals, fungi, and prokaryotes, while they are absent in protozoans or plants(Hagen et al., 2005). Conservation is primarily observed within the N-terminal 350â400 amino acids, featuring an invariant motif arginine-phenylalanine-proline (RFP) with unknown functional properties (Milenkovic et al., 2008). Mutations in this region can lead to the development of vitelliform macular dystrophy. However, the C-terminus is a potential site for protein modification and function(Marmorstein et al., 2002; Miller et al., 2019). There is currently no further literature research on the functional roles of different domains of BEST4. Although the crucial domain for the interaction with HES4 and TWIST1 is yet to be determined, requiring further investigation for clarification, our findings demonstrate that Hes4 directly binds to the upstream promoter region of BEST4 at 1470-1569 bp, thereby enhancing its promoter activity. These results provide valuable insights for future research.</p><p>Sincere thanks for catching this publication to us. We carefully read this study and would like to point out a few things.</p><p>a) Firstly, the study demonstrated that BEST4 expression is upregulated in clinical CRC samples, which contradicts the results of other published studies except for our own research. RNA-seq of tissue samples from 95 human individuals representing 27 different tissues was performed to determine the tissue specificity of all protein-coding genes, and the results indicated that the BEST4 gene is predominantly expressed in the colon (Fagerberg et al., 2014). In addition, BEST4 was reported to be exclusively expressed by human absorptive cells and could be induced during the process of human absorptive cell differentiation(Ito et al., 2013). Recently, the research from Simmonsâs group that published in Nature further proved that human absorptive colonocytes distinctly express BEST4 by single-cell profiling of healthy human colonic epithelial cells, and is dysregulated in colorectal cancer patients(Parikh <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019). Furthermore, the analysis of RNA-seq expression data obtained from colorectal cancer samples and normal samples in the publicly available databases TCGA and GTEx also revealed a significant downregulation of BEST4 expression in colorectal cancer tissues, which is consistent with our research findings. The literature above demonstrates a close relationship between BEST4 and the normal function of the human colon, and provide evidence for their loss in colorectal cancer patients.</p><p>b) Their study showed an increased expression of BEST4 protein levels in colorectal cancer patients through Western Blot. However, the antibody they used was only suitable for IHC-P and not for Western Blot (Abcam , ab188823); . In our study, we also utilized WB technology to detect the expression of BEST4 in colorectal cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. The results revealed a decreased expression of BEST4 protein levels in colorectal cancer patients. The antibody we used was specifically designed for WB detection (1:800; LsBio, LS-C31133 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.lsbio.com/antibodies/best4-antibody-n-terminus-wb-western-ls-c31133/29602">https://www.lsbio.com/antibodies/best4-antibody-n-terminus-wb-western-ls-c31133/29602</ext-link>).</p><p>c) The study demonstrated an upregulation of BEST4 protein levels in colorectal cancer patients using immunohistochemistry (IHC). However, the expression of BEST4 was assessed in colorectal cancer tissues through IHC utilizing publicly available protein expression databases such as the Human Protein Atlas. Interestingly, this analysis revealed a minimal presence of BEST4 protein in colorectal cancer tissues (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000142959-BEST4/pathology">https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000142959-BEST4/pathology</ext-link>), contradicting their research findings but aligning with our own observations.</p><p>d) Literature based on single-cell genomics analysis reports that only OTOP2 and BEST4 genes are expressed in a subset of the normal colorectal epithelial cells but not the rest(Parikh <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019). An inhibitory effect of OTOP2 on CRC has been recently shown BEST4, and the Otopetrin 2 (OTOP2), which encodes protonâselective ion channel protein were reported to distinct expressed in normal absorptive colonocytes and colocalized with each other (Drummond et al., 2017; Ito <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013; Parikh <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019). OTOP2 has been recently demonstrated to have an inhibitory effect on the development of CRC via being regulated by wide-type p53(Qu et al., 2019), while the role of BEST4 in CRC is less well studied, that indicate the potential of BEST4 to inhibit colorectal cancer. The Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) conducted by them revealed a significant enrichment of gene signatures associated with oncogenic signaling and metastasis, such as the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, in patients exhibiting higher BEST4 expression compared to those with lower BEST4 expression. However, our GSEA did not show any significant enrichment of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in patients with higher BEST4 expression compared to those with lower BEST4 expression. In contrast to their findings, our BEST4 overexpression cell line did not exhibit a significant increase in phosphorylated Akt levels. The present study concludes that our findings align with previous literature and public database analyses, providing evidence for the downregulation of BEST4 in colorectal cancer tissues and its potential as an anticancer agent. Discrepancies observed in other studies may be attributed to difference in experimental model, protocols, preparations or experimental conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>(1) Western blot data should be quantified.</p></disp-quote><p>Sincere thanks for catching this point to us.

These findings suggest that BEST4 knockout may potentially contribute to tumor proliferation in vivo; however, further research is required for confirmation. EMT transforms epithelial cells exhibiting a spindle fibroblast-like morphology, leading to the acquisition of mesenchymal characteristics and morphology, enabling these cells to acquire invasive and migratory abilities (Dongre and Weinberg, 2019).

Our study demonstrated that BEST4 inhibits EMT in colorectal cancer (CRC) both in vitro and in vivo.
