Here, we used bottom-up proteomics and label-free quantification to identify novel post-translational modifications (PTMs) on β-myosin heavy chain (β-MHC) in normal and failing human heart tissues. We report six acetylated lysines and two phosphorylated residues: K34-Ac, K58-Ac, S210-P, K213-Ac, T215-P, K429-Ac, K951-Ac, and K1195-Ac. K951-Ac was significantly reduced in both ischemic and nonischemic failing hearts compared to nondiseased hearts. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations show that K951-Ac may impact stability of thick filament tail interactions and ultimately myosin head positioning. K58-Ac altered the solvent-exposed SH3 domain surface – known for protein–protein interactions – but did not appreciably change motor domain conformation or dynamics under conditions studied. Together, K213-Ac/T215-P altered loop 1’s structure and dynamics – known to regulate ADP-release, ATPase activity, and sliding velocity. Our study suggests that β-MHC acetylation levels may be influenced more by the PTM location than the type of heart disease since less protected acetylation sites are reduced in both heart failure groups. Additionally, these PTMs have potential to modulate interactions between β-MHC and other regulatory sarcomeric proteins, ADP-release rate of myosin, flexibility of the S2 region, and cardiac myofilament contractility in normal and failing hearts.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>myosin heavy chain</kwd><kwd>post-translational modifications</kwd><kwd>heart failure</kwd><kwd>human</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16SDG2912000</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Parvatiyar</surname><given-names>Michelle S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006597</institution-id><institution>Florida State University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>46259</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Parvatiyar</surname><given-names>Michelle S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL128683</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pinto</surname><given-names>J Renato</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021AHAPRE216237</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Landim-Vieira</surname><given-names>Maicon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ACI-1548562</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Regnier</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32HL007828</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Childers</surname><given-names>Matthew C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30AR074990</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Regnier</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Analytical techniques and computational models reveal novel post-translational modifications on β-myosin heavy chain in the human hearts and highlight their potential as therapeutic targets.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The sarcomere is the smallest functional unit in striated muscle. The cardiac sarcomere is composed of thick and thin filament proteins that work together to generate force and shorten the sarcomere, and regulate sarcomere contraction and relaxation in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gordon et al., 2000</xref>). The cardiac thick filament is composed of myosin II polymers accompanied by associated proteins, myosin-binding protein C (MyBP-C), titin, and obscurin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gordon et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Craig and Woodhead, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). The major proteins of the cardiac thin filament include F-actin-containing myosin-binding sites – tropomyosin (Tm) and the cardiac troponin complex (cTn) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gordon et al., 2000</xref>). Myosin molecules of the thick filaments are constituted of six noncovalently associated polypeptides: two heavy chains and four light chains (LCs). The C-terminus of the two myosin heavy chains (MHCs) forms an α-helical coiled-coil tail that extends toward the center of the thick filament backbone. The paired, N-terminal heads of the two MHCs are positioned at the surface, facilitating interactions with actin filaments. Between the heads and the tail is a coiled-coil that makes up the myosin S2 rod segment. The neck region of myosin is the site of accessory protein binding that consists of two pairs of LCs: essential (ELC) and regulatory (RLC). Near the N-terminus, the individual MHC forms a distinct globular structure – myosin S1 fragment – that interacts with the actin filament in a cyclic fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Geeves and Holmes, 1999</xref>). Myosin binds to actin and ATP and undergoes several conformational changes that are essential to its function: (1) actomyosin complex formation along with release of P<sub>i</sub> and ADP from myosin cause a swinging motion during the force-generating powerstroke; (2) during rigor, ATP binding to myosin results in a reduction in actin affinity and dissociation of actomyosin; and (3) ATP hydrolysis occurs when myosin is dissociated from actin and primes the lever arm for the next cross-bridge cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tang et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Post-translational modification (PTM) of myofilament proteins can regulate their mechanical properties and modulate cardiac sarcomere function. PTMs have been shown to alter the canonical structure, function, localization, and half-life of modified sarcomeric proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mnatsakanyan et al., 2018</xref>). These modifications can instigate downstream effects on the functional properties of the myocardium, thus providing a rapid, efficient, and energetically favorable mechanism to alter contractile function compared to isoform switching. The context dependence of a modification may also be important as it may be influenced by other PTMs on the same protein or other proteins. Furthermore, PTMs on sarcomeric proteins may be inert under normal conditions, but their functional importance can become evident alongside pathological conditions. Therefore, these normally ‘silent’ PTMs represent novel targets for therapeutic intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sumandea and Steinberg, 2011</xref>). Localized, spatially confined pools of kinases, acetyltransferases, and other protein modifiers have been identified as essential for the efficient modification of myofilament proteins. Both histone acetyltransferase (HAT; p300/CBP-associated factor [PCAF]) and histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) have been found localized in the sarcomeric matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Samant et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gupta et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, HDAC6 has also been shown to assume a sarcomeric localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Demos-Davies et al., 2014</xref>). Of the PTMs identified on sarcomeric proteins, phosphorylation has been the most extensively characterized. However, acetylation, methylation, oxidation, SUMOylation, and ubiquitination have been reported as well, extending the repertoire of potential modifiers of the sarcomere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cui et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Terman and Kashina, 2013</xref>).</p><p>A number of sarcomeric proteins are phosphorylated, including MyBP-C, troponin T (TnT), and troponin I (TnI) by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), and myosin regulatory light chain (RLC) by myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sumandea and Steinberg, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Colson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Seguchi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chan et al., 2008</xref>). Several kinases are implicated in phosphorylation of striated muscle Tm, including tropomyosin kinase, PKA, and protein kinase Cζ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Heeley et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mak et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Montgomery and Mak, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Reddy et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wu and Solaro, 2007</xref>). Remarkably absent from the list of phosphorylated sarcomeric proteins in human hearts is β-MHC, encoded by <italic>MYH7</italic>, the predominant isoform of myosin in the adult human heart. The massive size of β-MHC, ~223 kDa, imposes limitations with current technological approaches and challenges our ability to obtain complete sequence coverage. In a study by Kawai et al. examining PTMs on <italic>MYH6</italic>, the predominant murine myosin isoform,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>) phosphorylation sites were identified in control hearts with a number of these residues not phosphorylated in HCM hearts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kawai et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, Jin et al. identified acetylated, methylated, and trimethylated residues in human β-MHC using size-exclusion chromatography (SEC)/middle-down mass spectrometry (MS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jin et al., 2017</xref>). Overall, detection of low-abundance PTMs on large proteins has remained elusive and protein enrichment strategies before liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) analysis or even greater instrument sensitivity can increase signal intensity of modified proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mnatsakanyan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhao and Jensen, 2009</xref>).</p><p>While many earlier studies were conducted in animals of varying species, examining changes in PTMs on sarcomeric proteins in the context of human heart disease may provide clues toward potential interventions. Identification of PTMs on β-MHC is the first step in discovering whether these modifications provide beneficial or adverse impacts on cardiac function and disease progression. With mass spectrometry techniques increasing in sensitivity, we are becoming more successful at uncovering even low-abundance PTMs that may have a significant impact on cardiac outcomes. As new reports emerge documenting the presence of PTMs in human sarcomeric proteins, the ensuing challenge remains: testing their in vivo functional consequences. Given the emerging importance of understanding the potential role of PTMs on cardiac muscle performance, we used LC/MS and MD simulations to investigate novel PTMs sites in key functional regions of β-MHC in human hearts in healthy and diseased states. This article provides insight into the potential of these modifications to fine-tune cardiac myofilament performance.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Human heart data bank</title><p>The patient groups from whom explanted heart tissues were collected included explanted hearts from healthy donors (nonfailing (NF)) and end-stage heart failure patients, who were reported to have either ischemic heart failure (I-HF) or non-ischemic heart failure (NI-HF).

This structure represents a post-rigor ATP-bound state of myosin and was used to assess proximity of the modified residues to structurally important regions in the myosin motor domain. An S2 fragment structure (PDB: 2FXM) was used to model K951-Ac.</p><p>Residue K34 is located between the SH3-like domain and the converter domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). K58 is located within the SH3-like domain, which typically serves as a module for protein–protein interactions. Therefore, it is anticipated that acetylation of either K34 or K58 may interfere with normal interactions of this domain. Residues S210, K213, and T215 are sequentially close in the primary structure, and it is interesting to note that they lie together on one face of the myosin motor domain near the ATP-binding pocket in a region called loop 1. This loop is notable for its influence on ATP/ADP cycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Murphy and Spudich, 1998</xref>). It is plausible, therefore, to expect that these modifications may influence ATP binding and/or Pi and ADP-release dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). S210-P was found to exist as a single modification only. The location and dynamics between modifications of residues K213-Ac and T215-P are interesting as they appear to be co-modifications. Although K213-Ac was only found coincident with phosphorylation of T215, T215-P was also found on its own, without K213-Ac. The K213-Ac/T215-P-modified sequence (amino acids 207–234, <italic>m/z</italic> 766.36) was detectable as an isotope dot product (idotp) with a value below 0.5, and therefore was unquantifiable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). The acetylated residue K429 is located within the myosin head-like domain at the actin-binding interface. The remainder of the modified residues K951 and K1195 are located within the coiled-coil of the S2 region, although K1195 is missing from the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>. The panels within <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> show closeup views of secondary structural elements and side-chain interactions that neighbor the K58-Ac, K213-Ac, T215-P, and K951-Ac modifications.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Normalized peak areas of the PTM sites</title><p>To investigate the potential significance of these newly identified PTMs for cardiac function, we assessed their abundance in the human heart samples we analyzed.

Beneath each histogram are the respective tryptic peptides where the reported PTMs were found. The residues shown in brackets are the trypsin digestion sites. Of interest is PTM K951-Ac as acetylation at this site is significantly decreased with ratios of approximately 14 in control hearts and 5 in failing hearts. Following the same trend (but not statistically significant) is K1195 also in the tail region. Both K34-Ac and K429-Ac are found in the myosin motor domain where they may be protected from HDAC activity. K429-Ac is a low-abundance PTM with ratios of modified peptides/IRP ratios of approximately 1 and 1.4. This site is buried within the actin-binding cleft and may have been modified prior to protein folding. K34-Ac, on the other hand, is more abundant with approximate modified peptide ratios of 5–10. Perhaps the most interesting observation can be made for the co-modified peptide containing K58-Ac as it may be more susceptible to removal by HDACs or lower HAT activity under I-HF conditions.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Calculations of post-translational modification (PTM) occupancy of acetylated residues on β-myosin heavy chain (β-MHC).</title><p>Peak areas of all modified peptide sequences (MOD) were normalized to the peak area of a common internal reference peptide sequence (IRP, 1504–1521).

The average ratios of T215-P ranged from 3 to 2, while in the control nondiseased hearts the modification was nearly undetectable in two samples.

For this reason, we expect they may have a limited role in driving pathogenesis, but may still have functional relevance. Another phosphorylated residue was the phospho-serine at S210 on peptide 6, with ratios of approximately 1–2 modified peptide/IRP in all groups. T215 on peptide 7 had ratios of approximately 1–2 of the modified peptides/IRP in all the groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). When examining the 3D structure of the β-MHC motor domain, we observed three modifications – at the lateral face of the myosin motor domain – with potential importance due to their proximity to the ATP-binding pocket: (1) S210-P (single), (2) T215-P (single), and (3) K213-Ac plus T215-P (double). However, the question remains whether PTMs with low occupancy on a protein such as β-MHC may in fact have subtle yet important roles in fine-tuning of its function. Additional factors to consider are whether specific PTM sites reported here are more labile and prone to action by phosphatases and deacetylases, which may have increased activity in the failing heart.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Calculations of post-translational modification (PTM) occupancy of phosphorylated residues on β-myosin heavy chain (β-MHC).</title><p>Peak areas of all modified peptide sequences (MOD) were normalized to the peak area of a common internal reference peptide sequence (IRP, 1504–1521).

4</xref>). In mature myosin, the tail forms a coiled-coil structure where the helical tails of two MHCs are wrapped around one another. Archetypal coiled-coil helices have a conserved sequence repeat of seven amino acids: positions <italic>a–g</italic> in which positions <italic>a</italic> and <italic>d</italic> are hydrophobic residues that form a ‘knobs in holes’ interlocking structure that promotes a well-packed hydrophobic core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Truebestein and Leonard, 2016</xref>). Myosin tails generally follow this archetypal pattern, but there are a small number of ‘skip’ residues that intermittently disrupt the heptad repeat pattern and increase local flexibility into the tail by weakening interactions in the hydrophobic core of the thick filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Taylor et al., 2015</xref>). In implicit solvent MD, the simulated S2 fragment was flexible (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>), larger magnitude C<sub>α</sub> RMSDs were associated with bending of the tail. Although bending occurred, the coiled-coil structure was largely preserved in the unmodified simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Some coiled-coil structure was lost in the K951-Ac simulations in the vicinity of the modification site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). In both modified and unmodified simulations, there was partial unfolding at the C-terminal end of the fragment. This is likely due to the truncation of the structure or the exclusion of the crystallographically present Hg atoms. In simulations without PTMs, K951 formed transient interactions with E949 of the opposite chain, but most interactions made by K951 were hydrophobic and involved L950 of the opposite chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and C</xref>). Acetylation of K951 had three effects on the structure of the tail. First, contacts made by K951 were altered: the frequency of salt bridge formation with Glu residues was diminished and K951-Ac interacted more frequently with other residues in the same chain as opposed to the opposite chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>). Second, the C-terminal end of the helix became bent and deviated from the typical coiled-coil structure. Third, the interhelical distance (measured by calculating the distance between C<sub>α</sub> pairs in the two helices) increased in the presence of the PTM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D and E</xref>). Additionally, K951-Ac altered the electrostatic potential of the S2 fragment, and notably the affected region is proximal to the interacting myosin heads in the super-relaxed conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). K951-Ac subverted the local coiled-coil structure of S2.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>K951-Ac increased flexibility of the myosin tail.</title><p>Structural changes in the S2 fragment caused by K951-Ac are shown in representative snapshots from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In the snapshots, the ribbon of residue 951 is colored red, chain A is colored blue, and chain B green. The atoms of neighboring side chains are displayed. The coiled-coil structure was preserved in the unmodified simulations (<bold>A</bold>). In the modified simulations (<bold>B</bold>), the coiled-coil structure was interrupted by kinks, a loss of α-helix structure, and increased separation of the chains. Collectively, these changes increased the local flexibility of S2. (<bold>C</bold>) Changes in S2 structure and dynamics caused by K951-Ac were associated with changes in local inter- and intra-chain contacts. (<bold>D</bold>) The inter-chain distance was monitored at six positions along S2, chosen to align with the heptad repeat position of the modified residue position. Distances between the C<sub>α</sub> atoms between these residues were tracked for the X-ray structure (shown) and the MD simulations. (<bold>E</bold>) K951-Ac increased the inter-helix distance (~1 Å) relative to the unmodified simulations. This effect propagated towards the N-terminal end of the helix. The effect may also propagate towards the C-terminus; however, the structure is truncated at residue 961 and unfolding of the helices occurred in these simulations. (<bold>F</bold>) In the super-relaxed conformation, the portion of S2 affected by this modification is located nearby the motor domains as indicated on this model (PDB ID: 5TBY).</p><p><supplementary-material id="fig7sdata1"><label>Figure 7—source data 1.</label><caption><title>Source data for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-74919-fig7-data1-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-74919-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2-4-2"><title>Lysine 58</title><p>The overall motor domain in the K58-Ac simulations sampled conformations similar to those sampled by the WT simulations: the K58-Ac simulations had similar average C<sub>α</sub> RMSD to the unmodified simulations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>). We examined changes in structure of the SH3-like domain caused by K58-Ac. SH3 domains are typically modules of protein–protein interaction and canonically bind to proline-rich sequence with polyproline helical structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kurochkina and Guha, 2012</xref>). Putative poly-Pro-binding pockets are formed by K58 and K72 as well as K72, T70, T60, S53, and E55 found on the surface of MYH7’s SH3 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and C</xref>). There is no direct structural evidence that these residues do form binding pockets; we have inferred this structural role from homology to other SH3 domains. In the unmodified simulations, both putative binding pockets remained intact and accessible to potential binding partners. In the K58-Ac simulations, however, the uncharged, acetylated Lys alternated between two conformations: a ‘native-like’ conformation in which the side chain projected into solvent and an ‘intercalated’ conformation in which the aliphatic portion of K58 was sandwiched in between K72 and T70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and C</xref>). The ‘intercalated’ conformation was associated with a disruption of the native contact network among SH3 residues, an increase in the solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) of residue K58 (partially attributable to the intrinsic increase in SASA of acetylated Lys), and a decrease in the SASA of K72 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Importantly the ‘intercalated’ conformation abolished one of the putative poly-Pro-binding pockets on the surface of SH3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), suggesting that K58 acetylation impedes binding of the SH3 domain to its targets.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>K58-Ac altered the solvent-exposed surface of myosin’s SH3-like domain.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative structural changes in the SH3 domain associated with K58-Ac are shown in the endpoint structures of one unmodified (‘K58’) and two modified (‘K58-Ac’) simulations.

Loop 1 connects two α-helices that line the nucleotide-binding pocket. These helices in turn are connected to two loops that coordinate the contents of the nucleotide-binding pocket: switch 1 and the phosphate-binding loop. Loop 1 is flexible and is rarely resolved in X-ray structures. Residues 205–211 are not present in the 4DB1 X-ray crystal structure and thus were built into our structural model prior to performing our simulations. In the unmodified simulations of PTMs, T215 retained its crystallographic role as a helix capping residue and the crystallographic interactions between T215, D218, and Q219 were preserved. K213 formed a transient salt bridge with D337, transient hydrogen bonds with N334, and transient hydrophobic interactions with V338 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). These interactions tethered the C-terminal end of loop 1 to the upper 50 kDa domain. Residue–residue interactions were altered in the K213-Ac/T215-P simulations. K213 lost interactions with N334/D337 in the upper 50 kDa domain and instead formed interactions with T215. T215-P gained interactions with R204 and K206. The altered amino acid interactions caused loop 1 to sample from a distinct conformational ensemble in the PTM simulations: it formed a more compact structure that involved more interactions with other loop 1 residues as opposed to an extended conformation with interactions to other regions of myosin.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>K58-Ac/T215-P altered loop 1 structure and dynamics.</title><p>Molecular dynamics (MD) snapshots in (<bold>A</bold>) show representative structures from the unmodified (K213/T215) and modified (K213-Ac/T215-P) simulations.

The presence of PTMs on β-MHC may fine-tune its function, altering the dynamics of some myosin motors in the cardiac sarcomere. Cumulatively, the functional alteration of a select number of β-MHC molecules may be a ‘direct readout’ of the cardiac cellular environment that dictates the needed changes in PTM addition/removal in context with degree of pathological insult and remodeling. Therefore, the presence of PTMs on cardiac β-MHC in nondiseased hearts suggests they may contribute to the normal functional and contractile state of the protein and muscle filaments that contain them.</p><p>MD simulations were performed to better understand the functional significance of the β-MHC PTMs. Focus was placed on modifications in modified residues with significantly altered abundance in diseased states: K951-Ac within S2 as well as for modified residues in regions with greatest functional significance: K58-Ac within the SH3-like domain, and K213-Ac and T215-P near the ATP-binding pocket.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Acetylation of β-MHC</title><sec id="s3-1-1"><title>Lysine 951</title><p>It is reasonable to propose that the observed reduction in acetylation at K951 may be associated with declining myocardial function. Our simulations suggest that acetylation of K951 disrupts the native structure of the coiled-coil and increases flexibility within the tail. Increased tail flexibility may alter the orientation of myosin heads relative to the thin filament, alter association rates between the thick and thin filament, and may affect the ability of myosin to form the interacting heads motif. Our simulations alone are not able to assess which of these effects on myosin dynamics is most likely due to the limited fragment of myosin that was simulated. Specifically, effects of these modifications on the flexibility and of S2 in general as well as on interactions between the myosin heads and S2 cannot be directly derived from these simulations. Nevertheless, our simulations do provide strong evidence for increased local flexibility in the tail. We attribute this to altered electrostatic interactions in the vicinity of K951.</p></sec><sec id="s3-1-2"><title>Lysine 1195</title><p>Acetylation of K1195 may result in similar effects. PTM of this region may further modulate tail flexibility or the assembly of the myosin rod (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Taylor et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In our study, we see distinct differences in β-MHC acetylation that seem to be influenced more by location of the lysine than the type of heart disease (I-HF and NI-HF). The rod region is perhaps the more conformationally consistent portion of the myosin protein that is accessible to HATs but also HDACs. Therefore, one interpretation of the tendency for lower acetylation of K951 (p&lt;0.05) and K1195 (not significant) in the failing heart samples is that they are not in the globular domain and may be more accessible to HDACs. It is unknown whether HDAC-inhibition would preserve acetylation at these sites and whether maintenance of this PTM is functionally important. Recent studies have explored the functional significance of sarcomeric protein acetylation to understand the impact of HDAC on cardiac function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jeong et al., 2018</xref>). The levels of acetylated proteins in the heart examined in this study depend on HDAC activity as much as HAT activity. Class I HDACs promote pathological cardiac hypertrophy, while class IIa HDACs suppress cardiac hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, class II HDAC4 has been shown to be associated with the sarcomere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Samant et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gupta et al., 2008</xref>). Increased cardiac Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) expression and activity plays a role in heart failure development and progression by increasing class I HDAC activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Administration of the HDAC inhibitor ITF2357 (Givinostat) improved heart relaxation in heart failure in rodent models with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) by promoting myofibril relaxation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jeong et al., 2018</xref>). HDAC inhibitors are beneficial to cardiac function by targeting cytosolic and sarcomeric proteins by improving muscle contractility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Demos-Davies et al., 2014</xref>) and relaxation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jeong et al., 2018</xref>) as well as cardioprotection during ischemia/reperfusion injury by promoting autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xie et al., 2021</xref>). It remains unknown whether reduced PTM abundance at K951 accompanied and/or precipitated the functional decline in the nonischemic and ischemic failing hearts or rather was a secondary result of the altered cellular environment.</p></sec><sec id="s3-1-3"><title>Lysine 58</title><p>While the remaining simulated modifications did not have significantly altered abundance in diseased states, the proximity of these PTMs to critical functional sites in myosin merited investigation. K58 acetylation is markedly reduced in the I-HF hearts, and its localization near the SH3 domain may also be slightly more exposed, with potentially greater HDAC activity in ischemic hearts. The other acetylated residues K34 and K429 are located further into the interior of the myosin head and may be less affected by increased HDAC activity in diseased hearts. Preservation of acetylated lysines in β-MHC may be beneficial to normal heart function, and pathological conditions favoring greater HDAC activation may disrupt crucial constitutively acetylated residues hastening heart failure development. The K58-Ac simulations indicated that K58-Ac caused minimal structural perturbations overall compared to the nonmodified protein. Instead, the greatest impact of K58-Ac is the decrease in electrostatic potential and structure on the outer surface of the SH3 domain. Lowey et al. and others have provided evidence that an interaction between the ELC and actin is mediated by the SH3 domain of myosin S1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lowey et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aydt et al., 2007</xref>). In light of this, our simulations suggest that K58-Ac has the potential to impede interactions between the ELC and SH3-like domains, thereby reducing interaction between the ELC N-terminus of actin filaments and effectively increasing shortening velocity. It remains possible that acetylation could increase affinity of SH3 for the ELC via altered intermolecular interactions, but we find this the less likely scenario. We suggest that K58-Ac may provide a reversible means to decrease the electrostatic potential of the SH3 domain surface, which may alter its interactions/affinity for ELC and perhaps other sarcomeric regulatory proteins.</p><p>The doubly modified peptide K213-Ac/T215-P was deemed to contain high-confidence PTM sites; however, K213-Ac/T215-P were found to be detectable but not quantifiable. A set of studies on loop 1 sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Decarreau et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sweeney et al., 1998</xref>) demonstrated that the length and composition of loop 1 regulate ADP release: shorter loops were associated with decreased ATPase activity, sliding velocity in in vitro motility assays, and preferential binding of ADP relative to ATP. In our simulations, the modified loop 1 formed a more compact structure and we predict that these PTMs would effectively behave as shorter loops that stabilize ADP. However, our simulations were performed in a post-rigor-like ATP-bound, actin-free structure of myosin and have insufficient sampling to measure ATP affinity or ATP-binding/ADP-release rates. Additionally, the rules that govern the relationship between loop 1 and nucleotide binding have not been definitely established, which complicates in silico predictions made here. We speculate that these structural perturbations in the ATP-binding pocket could alter the ADP-release rate.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Phosphorylation of MHC</title><p>Several studies have provided insight on how phosphorylation of cardiac sarcomeric proteins alters myofilament performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kawai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sadayappan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wijnker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kuster et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Solaro and Kobayashi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yamasaki et al., 2002</xref>). Kawai et al. utilized LC-MS and found that the rod region of α-MHC (predominant myosin isoform in the adult mouse heart) was hypophosphorylated in the HCM-linked cTnC-A8V mouse model, leading to perturbed cross-bridge kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kawai et al., 2017</xref>). Additionally, the Frank-Starling mechanism may in turn be modified to increase cardiac output under conditions of increased venous return (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Monasky et al., 2013</xref>). Incidentally, phosphorylation of myofilament proteins by PKCβII and PKA influences length-dependent prolongation of heart muscle relaxation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Monasky et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Monasky et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, sarcomeric protein phosphorylation is regulated by reactive oxygen species (ROS), whereby oxidative stress tends to increase protein phosphorylation due to inhibition of protein phosphatase activation and stimulation of protein kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sumandea and Steinberg, 2011</xref>). Crosstalk between PTMs may in fact provide a higher order of regulation, for example, same-site competition, structural changes in secondary sites that make it more accessible for modification by other PTMs, or direct modification of the modification of a secondary PTM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liddy et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Extrapolation of function of modified regions</title><sec id="s3-3-1"><title>Comparing known cardiomyopathy-associated variants with identified PTM sites</title><p>To gain further insight on the potential functional significance of the PTMs identified on cardiac β-MHC, we compared our results with nearby known variants linked to cardiomyopathic diseases in humans.

A 60 min linear gradient from 3% to 45% B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) was performed. The LC eluent was directly nanosprayed into Q Exactive HF mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). During the chromatographic separation, the Q Exactive HF was operated in a data-dependent mode and under direct control of the Thermo Excalibur 3.1.66 (Thermo Scientific). The MS data were acquired using the following parameters: 20 data-dependent collisional-induced dissociation (CID) MS/MS scans per full scan (350–1700 <italic>m/z</italic>) at 60,000 resolution. MS2 were acquired in centroid mode at 15,000 resolution. Ions with single charge or charges more than 7 as well as unassigned charge were excluded. Raw data were searched with Proteome Discoverer 2.2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using Sequest HT and Mascot search engines and percolator as the PSM validator with species-specific FASTA database. Phosphorylation and acetylation were used as a dynamic modification in SequestHT and Mascot and PTMs were scored by ptmRS node in Proteome Discoverer 2.2. MS1-based quantification of peptides was performed using Skyline 4.0. The mass spectrometry data generated in this study has been deposited at Dryad and can be found at doi:10.5061/dryad.s4mw6m97g.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Proteomics data analysis</title><p>The area under the curve (AUC) for each peptide sequence was measured in Skyline 20.1, an open-source Windows client application software for targeted proteomics data analysis and bioinformatics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">MacLean et al., 2010</xref>). To determine the modification levels of each PTM site, the AUC of each modified peptide was measured and divided by the AUC of the unmodified common internal reference peptide (IRP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). The ratio of the modified peptide to IRP was compared among human heart samples from nondiseased controls and patients with I-HF and NI-HF. The IRP was chosen based upon recommendations from Sherrod et al. utilizing a known unmodified peptide between 7 and 20 amino acids (no methionine and cysteine residues), eluted across the chromatogram, and demonstrating consistent signal stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sherrod et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Model building</title><p>Starting coordinates for the wildtype (WT) β-MHC motor domain simulations were obtained from an X-ray crystallography structure of the post-rigor, ATP state of β-MHC in the Protein Data Bank (PDB, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.rcsb.org">https://www.rcsb.org</ext-link>; PDB ID: 4DB1, 2.6 Å, residues 1–777; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berman et al., 2000</xref>).

Missing heavy atoms were built using <italic>Modeller</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Webb and Sali, 2016</xref>), and conformer ‘A’ was chosen among residues with multiple conformations in the PDB entries. Hg atoms were removed from the 2FXM structure and ANP•Mn was replaced with ATP•Mg in 4DB1. Starting coordinates for the post-translationally modified variants were obtained via in silico modification of the WT structures using the <italic>leap</italic> module of <italic>AMBER</italic>. There were two modified variants of 4DB1: 4DB1-K58-Ac (corresponding to acetylation of Lys 58) and 4DB1-K213-Ac/T215-P (corresponding to simultaneous acetylation of Lys 213 and phosphorylation of Thr 215). There was one modified variant of 2FXM: 2FXM-K951-Ac (corresponding to acetylation of Lys 951). For 2FXM, K951 residues in both chains A and B were modified. Because both K951 residues were modified, our simulations sample the ‘most aggressive’ effects of acetylation at this site: diminished effects may be found for singly modified systems.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Force field and explicit solvent molecular mechanics</title><p>All 4DB1 simulations were performed with the AMBER20 package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Geeves and Holmes, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tang et al., 2016</xref>) and the ff14SB force field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maier et al., 2015</xref>).

Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> counterions were added to neutralize the systems and then 120 mM Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> ions were added. Each system was minimized in three stages. First, hydrogen atoms were minimized for 1000 steps in the presence of 100 kcal/mol restraints on all heavy atoms. Second, all solvent atoms were minimized for 1000 steps in the presence of 25 kcal/mol restraints on all protein atoms. Third, all atoms were minimized for 8000 steps in the presence of 25 kcal/mol restraints on all backbone heavy atoms (N, O, C, and C atoms). After minimization, systems were heated to 310 K during three successive stages. In each stage, the system temperature is increased by ~100 K over 100 ps (50,000 steps) using the NVT (constant number of particles, volume, and temperature) ensemble. During all heating stages, 25 kcal/mol restraints were present on the backbone heavy atoms (N, O, C, and C atoms). After the system temperatures reached 310 K, the systems were equilibrated over five successive stages using the NPT (constant number of particles, pressure, and temperature) ensemble. During each stage, the systems were equilibrated for 5.4 ns in the presence of restraints on backbone atoms. The strength of the restraints was decreased from 25 kcal/mol during the first stage to 1 kcal/mol during the fourth stage. During the final equilibration stage, the systems were equilibrated in the absence of restraints.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>MD protocol</title><p>Production dynamics for conventional MD simulations were then performed using the canonical NVT ensemble with an 8 Å nonbonded cutoff and 2 fs time step. Coordinates were saved every picosecond. Simulations were run in triplicate for 500 ns each. Unless specified otherwise, simulations were analyzed separately, and the results of replicate simulations were averaged together. To account for potential equilibration effects, the first 100 ns were excluded from subsequent analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Implicit solvent simulations</title><p>2FXM contains a linear fragment of S2 spanning ~130 residues.

On discussion, reviewer 2 specifically requests clarification why the findings should be of interest to readers of the broader remit represented by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>(3) Reviewer (2):</p><p>Considers that this is a thought-provoking study using an appealing strategy.

It was not clear what the overall percentage of PTM is for a given site, e.g. in a failing heart, what percentage of myosin K951 residues are acetylated? The first paragraph of the discussion states that &quot;phosphorylation and acetylation PTMs are present on β-MHC in non-diseased human hearts in low abundance.&quot; Is it not possible to determine what fraction of a particular peptide is modified? Otherwise, why would the authors state that PTMs are &quot;low abundance&quot; (first paragraph of the discussion)? Furthermore, if this information has been obtained, why would it not be clearly represented in the manuscript? It seems as though the quantification of PTMs is shown only relative to IRP.</p><p>b) Similarly, the PTM to IRP ratio is also confusing in that the stated range is 1-14. Does this mean that it is not possible for PTM abundance to be less than the IRP? Why not?</p><p>c). The authors mention that one way to interpret the loss of K951 acetylation in failing hearts is that there is a shift toward α-MHC. Perhaps it was outside the scope of the study, but was there no way of testing this hypothesis in some way?</p><p>d). The discussion is, in my view, far too long and wide-ranging. Some of the logic presented is also challenging. For instance, the PTMs discussed are shown to be more abundant in normal than in failing hearts. Yet, the authors draw parallels between the sites for the PTMs and the locations of cardiomyopathy-causing mutations. It seems strange to associate sites of &quot;normal&quot; PTMs with the locations of disease-causing mutations. Overall, the discussion is far longer than would normally be expected for the corresponding significant results, which really focused just on K951. My recommendation would be to focus the discussion drastically, state the most meaningful findings very clearly, and help the reader grasp the real significance of the work.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This paper tackles an important understudied problem of PTMs in the human β cardiac myosin protein.

Because the ionization efficiencies of acetylated/phosphorylated peptides are different from the unmodified peptides, we ended up not using the AUC (area under curve) data to calculate the percentage of occupancy. We could have done quantifications in this study but based upon the differences in ionization efficiencies these numerical determinations would not be highly accurate. Instead, we normalized the peptides with PTM to IRP so that we can compare the relative abundance (occurrence) of PTM across all samples. We modified the manuscript to further clarify that we reported the data in this manner. We found one confusing statement (on page 26 of the submitted manuscript) that referred to % occupancy and removed it because we are not able to accurately make these determinations.</p><p>Please find <xref ref-type="table" rid="sa2table1">Author response table 1</xref> of area under the curve calculations below that show how the normalization of modified to IRP were made.

Does this mean that it is not possible for PTM abundance to be less than the IRP? Why not?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the PTM abundance could be less than the IRP. We performed calculations of PTM relative quantification based on its ratio to IRP and the reported range of 1-14 is what we have observed. The ratio depends on the abundance of PTM relative to IRP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c). The authors mention that one way to interpret the loss of K951 acetylation in failing hearts is that there is a shift toward α-MHC. Perhaps it was outside the scope of the study, but was there no way of testing this hypothesis in some way?</p></disp-quote><p>While this statement is accurate in context with the shifts that occur in mouse hearts which has a different dominant isoform, a-MHC (mouse) and b-MHC (human) the upregulation of a-MHC in human heart failure does not occur as stated. Therefore, we removed these several statements from the text regarding an isoform switch. A more likely scenario underlying the reduction of K951-Ac in failing hearts is upregulation of HDACs in ischemic and non-ischemic heart failure, which has been documented by a number of groups.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d). The discussion is, in my view, far too long and wide-ranging. Some of the logic presented is also challenging. For instance, the PTMs discussed are shown to be more abundant in normal than in failing hearts. Yet, the authors draw parallels between the sites for the PTMs and the locations of cardiomyopathy-causing mutations. It seems strange to associate sites of &quot;normal&quot; PTMs with the locations of disease-causing mutations. Overall, the discussion is far longer than would normally be expected for the corresponding significant results, which really focused just on K951. My recommendation would be to focus the discussion drastically, state the most meaningful findings very clearly, and help the reader grasp the real significance of the work.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that our manuscript was very long. To address the reviewer’s concern, we have revised and shortened the manuscript substantially without affecting the quality of our study. The length of the results was cut by approximately 17% (orig. 9 pages and now 7 ½) and the discussion by 40% (orig. 9 pages and now 5 pages).</p><p>Our inclusion of a Table of CM mutation was intended to demonstrate importance of altering interactions/function of these regions due to inclusion of a PTM at that site. It is intended to be merely correlative; we understand your concern about including this data for “normal” PTMs, but in our view the PTMs may represent a “gain-of-function” or promote enhanced contractility –</p><p>We shortened but also rearranged the discussion so that it is now organized in a way that emphasized our major findings and highlighting the real significance of the work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This paper tackles an important understudied problem of PTMs in the human β cardiac myosin protein. The authors found acetylation sites and phosphorylation sites and used molecular dynamics simulations to predict the impacts of these PTMs on myosin function.</p><p>There is a lot of information in this very long (too long in my opinion) right now, its utility is unknown. The PTMs are very rare on this molecule and there are not enough samples to have much power (even though I know how hard it is to get samples).</p><p>The authors also make several statements about how MYH6 or α myosin is induced in human heart failure. To the best of my knowledge, the opposite is what happens in human heart failure.</p><p>I think this information may be better suited for a more specialized audience and journal.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate your critique and the opportunity to improve our manuscript and make it more accessible to the general reader. We have thoughtfully and carefully considered each point that you have made. We believe that the manuscript is now greatly improved and suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p></body></sub-article></article>
