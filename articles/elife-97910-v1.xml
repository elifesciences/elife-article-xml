In neurons, SNX4 accumulates in synapses, but how SNX4 affects synapse function remains unknown. We generated a conditional SNX4 knock-out mouse model and report that SNX4 cKO synapses show enhanced neurotransmission during train stimulation, while the first evoked EPSC was normal. SNX4 depletion did not affect vesicle recycling, basic autophagic flux, or the levels and localization of SNARE-protein VAMP2/synaptobrevin-2. However, SNX4 depletion affected synapse ultrastructure: an increase in docked synaptic vesicles at the active zone, while the overall vesicle number was normal, and a decreased active zone length. These effects together lead to a substantially increased density of docked vesicles per release site. In conclusion, SNX4 is a negative regulator of synaptic vesicle docking and release. These findings suggest a role for SNX4 in synaptic vesicle recruitment at the active zone.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neurotranmission</kwd><kwd>vesicle recruitment</kwd><kwd>plasticity</kwd><kwd>recycling endosome</kwd><kwd>hippocampal neuron</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010969</institution-id><institution>Alzheimer Nederland VU University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WE.03-2019-06</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van Weering</surname><given-names>Jan RT</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>SNX4 influences synaptic vesicle recruitment at the active zone, linking endosomal sorting to docked vesicle density and modulating neurotransmission efficiency during sustained activity.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Endosome sorting plays a critical role in the recycling and degradation of proteins in various eukaryotic cell types, including neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cullen and Steinberg, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huotari and Helenius, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sardana and Emr, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vietri et al., 2020</xref>). Synapses, in particular, rely on rapid recycling mechanisms to replenish synaptic vesicles (SVs) and facilitate neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kononenko and Haucke, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rizzoli, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Südhof, 2000</xref>). The extent to which endosome sorting is involved in these processes has been a subject of ongoing debate since the early studies on SV recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ceccarelli et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Heuser and Reese, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kononenko and Haucke, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Watanabe and Boucrot, 2017</xref>). While it has been demonstrated that depleting endosomal proteins affect neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tagliatti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Uytterhoeven et al., 2011</xref>), the precise role of these sorting proteins on SV maintenance and fusogenity remains not well understood.</p><p>Sorting nexins (SNXs) are evolutionary conserved organizers of endosome sorting that are recruited to endosome membrane domains by a phox homology (PX) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Carlton et al., 2005</xref>). SNX4 belongs to a subgroup of SNXs containing a C-terminal Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs (BAR) domain that recognizes and remodels curved endosome membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cullen and Steinberg, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Teasdale et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">van Weering et al., 2012a</xref>). While several SNX-BARs are associated with the retromer-related Endosomal SNX-BAR Sorting Complex for Promoting Exit (ESCPE)-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Simonetti et al., 2023</xref>), SNX4 forms a distinct sorting complex with SNX7, SNX30 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antón et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">van Weering et al., 2012b</xref>), SNX5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>), or SNX32 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sugatha et al., 2023</xref>) for endosome-to-cell surface recycling pathways and autophagosome traffic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Traer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">van Weering et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>). SNX4 emerges as a central hub in this endosome recycling pathway as the expression of SNX4 is required for the stable SNX7 and SNX30 protein levels in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antón et al., 2020</xref>). SNX4 is expressed in all cell types but to what extent this conserved principle also operates in highly polarized mammalian cells, such as neurons, remains unclear. In post-mortem brain material of Alzheimer’s disease patients, altered protein levels of SNX4 have been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2017</xref>). SNX4 is implicated in the recycling of the amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme (BACE-1), sorting it away from the endolysosomal pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Toh et al., 2018</xref>). Consequently, dysregulation of SNX4 may lead to the mislocalization of BACE-1 to late endosomal compartments, potentially contributing to altered amyloid-β-production. In yeast, Snx4 is essential for the endosome recycling of Snc1p, a homologue of the SNARE-protein VAMP2/synaptobrevin-2 (VAMP2/syb2) that is essential for synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hettema et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ma et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schoch et al., 2001</xref>). In neurons, SNX4 specifically accumulates in synapses, and its knockdown dysregulates protein pathways involved in neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vazquez-Sanchez et al., 2020</xref>). While its synaptic subcellular localization has been shown, the functional role of SNX4-dependent endosome sorting in synapses remains unknown.</p><p>In this study, we characterize the role of endosomal sorting protein SNX4 in synapse function using a novel conditional SNX4 knock-out mouse model. We show that SNX4 limits SV docking and release. SNX4 depletion enhances neurotransmission specifically during train stimulation, while the first evoked response is not significantly affected. SNX4 depletion does not impact vesicle recycling or the levels and localization of the SNARE-protein VAMP2/syb-2. The overall number of SVs is unaffected in SNX4 cKO neurons, but these synapses show an increased number of docked SVs at the active zone of the presynapse. The active zone length is decreased, thereby further increasing the density of SVs at the release site of SNX4 cKO synapses. Our data collectively shows that the endosomal sorting protein SNX4 is a negative regulator of SV docking and release.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Neuronal SNX4 protein levels are depleted in 21 days in conditional SNX4 knock-out mouse primary cultures</title><p>We generated a conditional knock-out mouse model for SNX4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> and Materials and methods section) to circumvent previously reported off-target effects using shRNA approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vazquez-Sanchez et al., 2020</xref>).

Both the amplitude and charge of the first evoked response showed a non-significant trend toward an increase in SNX4 cKO neurons (KO) compared to neurons infected with delta-Cre (control) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b, c, and d</xref>). The rescue condition where SNX4 was re-expressed at DIV14 (KO+SNX4) showed a decreased amplitude compared to KO but not to control. A similar trend was observed for total charge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b and d</xref>). Paired pulse ratios were not affected in SNX4 cKO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). We next investigated the effect of SNX4 depletion on synaptic transmission during sustained activity using a series of train stimulations at 5, 10, and 40 Hz (results in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). During a train of 100 action potentials (APs) at 40 Hz, the charge in SNX4 cKO neurons was highly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f and h</xref>). The average charge between pulse 90 and 100 was increased by 110% in SNX4 cKO synapses compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>). SNX4 overexpression rescued this increase in charge to wild-type (WT) levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f, g, and h</xref>). The size and refilling of the readily releasable vesicle pool (RRP) was estimated using back extrapolation of the cumulative charge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schneggenburger et al., 1999</xref>). While we found no significant differences in RRP estimate size in SNX4 cKO synapses compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i</xref>), the slope estimate of the cumulative charge was increased upon SNX4 depletion, which was rescued by SNX4 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2j</xref>). The amplitude and frequency of spontaneous miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) were not affected upon SNX4 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2k–m</xref>). In order to investigate a direct effect of SNX4 overexpression on neurotransmission, we expressed exogenous SNX4 on WT control background. Both the amplitude and charge of the first evoked response showed no effect in control+SNX4 neurons compared to control, and no differences were detected in the response to the 40 Hz stimulation train (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a–e</xref>), indicating that SNX4 overexpression in itself does not affect the neurotransmission protocols studied in SNX4 cKO experiments. Together these data show enhanced neurotransmission during train stimulation in SNX4 cKO autapses, while single EPSCs, mEPSCs, and the RRP size estimate remain unaffected. This suggests that vesicle recruitment during high-frequency train stimulation is limited by SNX4.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>SNX4 depletion increases sustained synaptic vesicle release.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic overview of experimental design using Cre intervention at days in vitro (DIV)0, SNX4 rescue at DIV14, and recording at DIV21.

SNX4 immunostaining showed clear co-localization with VAMP2/syb-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>).

We show that SNX4 cKO synapses elicit enhanced neurotransmission during train stimulation. SNX4 depletion did not affect vesicle recycling, basal autophagic flux, or the levels and localization of SNARE-protein VAMP2/syb-2. Electron microscopy showed that synapses had an increased number of docked vesicles at the active zone, while the overall number of SVs was normal. The active zone length was decreased upon SNX4 depletion, thereby further increasing the density of docked SVs at the release site. Taken together, our data shows that the endosomal sorting protein SNX4 is a negative regulator of SV docking and release. These findings indicate that SNX4 regulates SV recruitment at the active zone.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Enhanced SV recruitment and increased SV docking explain increased transmission in SNX4 cKO synapses</title><p>SNX4 cKO synapses showed a 110% increase in neurotransmission during intense stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>). A trend toward increased neurotransmission was observed already from the start of the train, and also in single evoked responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c and d</xref>), but became more prominent (and significant) during sustained stimulation. Despite the variability within all datasets, both trends and the significant effect during sustained stimulation were fully reversed by acute SNX4 expression. The total number of synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>) and fraction of active synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>) was not affected in SNX4 cKO neurons, suggesting an intrasynaptic effect. While approximately twice more vesicles were released during sustained stimulation in the absence of SNX4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>), our RRP estimation indicated a normal resting-state RRP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i</xref>). All measures of release probability were normal (normal paired pulse facilitation, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>, and shape of the rundown curve, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>), indicating that an increased release probability is an unlikely explanation for the observed increase in neurotransmission during sustained stimulation. The mEPSC recordings were also not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2k–m</xref>), this is consistent with the unaffected RRP estimate and single EPSC size and suggests that the observed increase in neurotransmission is not due to postsynaptic effects. Hence, this suggests that a higher recruitment rate of SVs to the releasable pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h and j</xref>) in SNX4 cKO synapses is responsible for the increased neurotransmission. While back extrapolation methods for estimating the RRP have their limitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Neher, 2015</xref>) and mechanisms of SV recruitment remain not fully understood, it is evident that the involvement of newly recruited vesicles becomes more prominent during high-frequency trains. In line with this, the increased neurotransmission of SNX4 cKO neurons was less prominent in 5 and 10 Hz trains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Hence, an increased contribution of newly recruited vesicles during sustained stimulation is consistent with the fact that neurotransmission is increased especially during high-frequency stimulation in SNX4 cKO synapses. No effects on neurotransmission were observed when overexpressing SNX4 on a control background, indicating that SNX4 is required but not rate limiting to limit synaptic release during prolonged stimulation.</p><p>The increase in neurotransmission during sustained stimulation was also observed with SV fusion reporter SypHy but not with the FM-64 dye. The latter method reports the release of only recycled vesicles, suggesting that these do not contribute significantly to the enhanced release. Finally, examining SV recycling with FM-64 dye indicates that the increased SV recruitment in SNX4 cKO synapses is not driven by an enhanced rate of the SV cycle, as endocytosis and release of recycled SVs were normal in SNX4 cKO synapses.</p><p>Ultrastructural characterization of SNX4 cKO synapses revealed a 50% increase in docked vesicles when normalized to active zone length. This increase might contribute to the enhanced SV recruitment and increased neurotransmission observed in SNX4 cKO synapses. If more vesicles are already docked at the start of stimulation, they may on average be recruited faster during train stimulation. SV docking is probably a dynamic equilibrium between various SV pools, modulated by activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kusick et al., 2020</xref>). However, an increase in docked SVs at the active zone also implies, on average, a closer proximity to calcium channels and therefore a higher release probability. However, measures of release probability were unaffected by SNX4 deficiency (as argued above), suggesting a normal channel coupling in SNX4 cKO synapses.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>SNX4 at the crossroad of endosomal sorting and autophagy regulating synaptic output</title><p>Increased neurotransmission upon depletion of endosomal genes has been shown by several labs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fernandes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Soykan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tagliatti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Uytterhoeven et al., 2011</xref>). These results are consistent with a postulated hypothesis that endosomes act as sorting stations for SV proteins and control the balance between novel and reused SV proteins that affect SV release and neurotransmission efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fernandes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Truckenbrodt et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Uytterhoeven et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In the presence of SNX4, the recycling process may lead to the reuse of older SV proteins that, as indirect consequence, potentially diminish the efficiency of SV exocytosis. In the absence of SNX4, older SV proteins are less recycled and traffic toward degradation, rendering the synapse with relatively more novel SV proteins, enhancing SV recruitment and fusion. Blocking the degradation pathway with HOPS/ESCRT mutants rescues the observed increased release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fernandes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Uytterhoeven et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, Skywalker and ARF6 mutants show increased SV sorting through endosomal intermediates, increasing SV docking and release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fernandes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tagliatti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Uytterhoeven et al., 2011</xref>). Our data is consistent with this literature, demonstrating enhanced neurotransmission upon inactivation of an endosome sorting gene. That said, SNX4 cKO synapses do not show an accumulation of endosomal intermediates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>) or decreased SV numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>) as reported for other endosome gene mutants, marking a novel finding in endosomal protein knock-out studies.</p><p>Endosomal sorting also mediates the delivery of active zone proteins, where disturbances in these pathways potentially correlate with smaller active zones and SVs, ultrastructural phenotypes were also observed in SNX4 cKO synapses. Previous studies suggest that the removal of SNX4 directs its cargo toward the degradative pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hettema et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Traer et al., 2007</xref>). Although the SNX4 cargo, particularly in mammalian neurons, is currently unknown, it is unlikely that VAMP2/syb-2 recycling explains our phenotype since the overall levels and localization of VAMP2/syb-2 remained unaffected upon SNX4 depletion.</p><p>Apart from endosome sorting, SNX4 has been reported to regulate several types of autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antón et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hanley et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>). Recent literature has shown that SV release could be regulated by synaptic autophagy (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Decet and Verstreken, 2021</xref>). Loss of ATG5 has been shown to result in increased neurotransmission, an effect independent from total SVs pool number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kuijpers et al., 2021</xref>). We did not observe changes in total ATG5 levels upon SNX4 depletion, consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antón et al., 2020</xref>), and no difference in basic autophagic flux of P62, contrasting with previous findings in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antón et al., 2020</xref>). This suggests that SNX4 may have a specialized role in neurons, that regulates synaptic transmission independent of autophagic flux by a yet-to-be determined mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>SNX-BAR proteins critical for synapse function</title><p>Many of our examined synaptic parameters remained unaltered or showed considerable variability, including our hypothesis that depletion of a synaptic endosomal sorting protein would disrupt synaptic recycling. This suggests the presence of redundant pathways compensating for SNX4 depletion, potentially involving other SNX-BAR complexes or endosomal sorting complexes like ESCPE, retriever, or retromer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Simonetti et al., 2023</xref>). Particularly SNX-BAR proteins, such as SNX7 and SNX30, are of potential interest for future research due to their ability to form selective complexes with SNX4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antón et al., 2020</xref>). The role of endosome sorting in the SV cycle is increasingly recognized through knock-out studies targeting various endosomal complexes, revealing changes in SV exocytosis, SV endocytosis, or endosome-like vesicle numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Inoshita et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tagliatti et al., 2016</xref>). Our data supports this, showing for the first time that a protein from the highly evolutionary conserved SNX-BAR protein family, such as SNX4, regulates SV docking at the active zone and sustained SV release. Taken together, we show that endosomal sorting protein SNX4 regulates SVs recruitment at the active zone. The precise regulation of vesicle availability is crucial for a synapse to effectively coordinate neurotransmission, a process heavily relying on endosome sorting mechanisms.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Laboratory animals and SNX4 cKO generation</title><p>Animals were housed and bred according to institutional and Dutch governmental guidelines (DEC-FGA 11-03 and AVD112002017824).

Samples of 450,000 neurons run in SDS-PAGE (10% 1 mm acrylamide gel with 2,2,2-trichloroethanol) using standard SDS-PAGE technique and transferred into polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) (1 hr, 0.25 mA, 4°C). Blots were blocked and incubated with primary antibodies (4°C overnight) in PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 (Sigma, P2287) (PBS-T) and 5% milk. Primary antibodies included polyclonal rabbit SNX4 (1:500; SySy, Cat. No. 392-003), monoclonal mouse actin (1:10,000; Chemicon, Cat. No. MAB1501), monoclonal mouse VAMP2/synaptobrevin2 (1:2000; SySy, CL 69.1), and polyclonal rabbit BACE-1 (1:500; Abcam ab20770). After washing with PBS-T, blots were incubated with secondary horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibodies (1:10,000; Sigma) in PBS-T and 5% milk (1 hr, room temperature). After washing with PBS-T, blots were developed with SuperSignal West Femto substrate (Thermo Scientific, 11859290) for 2 min. Chemiluminescence-labeled proteins were visualized with the Odyssey Imaging System (LI-COR) for appropriate times and analyzed with Image Studio 5.2 software (LI-COR) or ImageJ. A fixed region of interest (ROI) was used to measure the average intensity, which was then normalized to (1) the loading control (housekeeping genes actin or GAPDH) and (2) the control within each independent experiment (N) to account for weekly variations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Immunocytochemistry</title><p>Neurons at DIV21 were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, 15680) in PBS, pH 7.4, for 25 min at room temperature. After washing with PBS, cells were permeabilized for 5 min with 0.5% Triton X-100 (Fisher Chemical, T/3751/08)-PBS and incubated for 30 min with PBS containing 2% normal goat serum (Gibco, 16210-072) and 0.1% Triton X-100 to block nonspecific binding. Incubations with primary antibodies were performed overnight at 4°C. After PBS washing steps incubations with secondary antibodies followed for 1 hr at room temperature. Primary antibodies included polyclonal rabbit SNX4 (1:500; SySy, Cat.

Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings (Vm = −70 mV) were performed at room temperature with borosilicate glass pipettes (2.5–4.5 mOhm) filled with 136 mM KCl, 17.8 mM HEPES, 0.6 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 mM ATP-Mg, 0.3 mM GTP-Na, 12 mM phosphocreatine dipotassium salt, 45.3 mM phosphocreatine kinase, and 1 mM EGTA (pH 7.30). External solution contained the following (in mM): 10 HEPES, 10 glucose, 140 NaCl, 2.4 KCl, 4 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 4 CaCl<sub>2</sub> (pH = 7.30, 300 mOsmol). Recording was acquired with an MultiClamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices), Digidata 1550B, and Clampex 9.0 software (Molecular Devices). After whole-cell mode was established, only cells with an access resistance of &lt;15 MΩ and leak current of &lt;300 pA were accepted for analysis. Series resistance compensation was between 70% and 80%. Access resistance was measured before and after recordings. Recordings with a &gt;20% increase in access resistance were excluded from analysis, as well as recordings that showed voltage-clamp escape or clipping. GABAergic recordings were identified based on their postsynaptic decay kinetics and excluded. EPSCs were elicited by a 1 ms depolarization to 30 mV. Offline analysis was performed with MATLAB R2019a (Mathworks) using custom-written software routines (viewEPSC, downloaded from user vhuson on GitHub on September 13, 2023; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huson, 2019</xref>). RRP and slope estimates were obtained by a linear fit of cumulative total charge plot from pulse 80 to 100 for each individual cell with y-intercept for RRP estimate and slope as recruitment rate estimate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schneggenburger et al., 1999</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Live-cell imaging</title><p>Live imaging experiments were performed at DIV21 on a custom-build imaging microscope (IX81; Olympus) with an MT20 light source (Olympus) with a ×40 oil objective (NA = 1.3) appropriate filter sets (Semrock, Rochester, NY, USA) and an EM charge-coupled device camera (C9100-02; Hamamatsu Photonics, Japan). Xcellence RT imaging software (Olympus) controlled the microscope and image acquisition. Coverslips were perfused with Tyrode’s solution (119 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>-2H<sub>2</sub>O, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>-6H<sub>2</sub>O, 25 mM HEPES, and 30 mM glucose H<sub>2</sub>O, pH 7.4, mOsmol 280). For SV release experiments, time-lapse (2 Hz) recordings consisted of 30 s baseline recordings followed by two electrical field stimulations with 60 s recovery time in between and a final stimulation 10 s of NH4-Tyrode’s perfusion (2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.5 mM KCl, 119 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 30 mM glucose, 25 mM HEPES, 50 mN NH<sub>4</sub>Cl at pH 7.4). Electrical field stimulation was applied via parallel platinum electrodes powered by a stimulus isolator (WPI A385) delivering 30 mA, 1 ms pulses, regulated by a Master-8 pulse generator (AMPI) providing 100 APs at 40 Hz with a 0.5 s interval. Glass capillaries close to the isolated neuron were used for chemical stimulation. For the FM4-64 experiments, neurons were pre-imaging incubated in high potassium Tyrode’s for 10 min at 37°C (61.5 mM NaCl, 60 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>2H<sub>2</sub>O, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> 6H<sub>2</sub>O, 25 mM HEPES, and 30 mM glucose H<sub>2</sub>O, pH 7.4, mOsmol 280).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Imaging analysis</title><p>For live-cell imaging analysis, time-lapse recordings stacks were used to analyze SyPhy and FM4-64 fusion events (2 Hz, 1000×1000 pixels). In ImageJ fusion events were selected manually and fluorescence traces were measured in a circular 3×3 pixel ROI (0.6×0.6 µm<sup>2</sup>), somatic events not included. ROI intensity measures of SyPhy puncta were exported to a custom-built MATLAB program for semiautomated detection of fusion events and duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Moro et al., 2021</xref>). Fluorescence traces from the ROI were expressed as fluorescence change (deltaF) compared to initial fluorescence (F0), with the average of frames 1–10 for determining F0. Fusion events were automatically detected when displaying a sudden increase of two standard deviations above F0. SV pool numbers and synapses were estimated using MAP2 mask in automated image analysis software SynD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Schmitz et al., 2011</xref>). Active synapses were determined by 3× SD over baseline. Synapse detection settings were optimized to measure SyPhy and VAMP2/syb-2 puncta signal and kept constant within the same dataset. For FM4-64 puncta, fluorescence traces were expressed as change (DF) compared to baseline fluorescence (F0) and the average of the last 10 frames was used to determine the maximum FM4-64 release. For fixed-cell imaging analysis, VAMP2 puncta number within MAP2 mask were analyzed using automated SynD software (see above). For Sholl analysis, dendrite mask based on MAP2 staining was used to either determine the number of dendritic branches per shell or average VAMP2 intensity within the neurite mask.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Cryofixation electron microscopy</title><p>Dissociated hippocampal neurons (5000 k/well) from SNX4 cKO mice were plated on pre-grown cultures of rat glia on sapphire disks (Wohlwend GmbH) to form micro-networks of 2–10 neurons per sapphire disk. Prior to cell culture, sapphire disks were etched for 30 min in 60% sulfuric acid, washed, incubated in 3 M KOH overnight, washed and dried before carbon coating and subsequent baking at 180°C for 2 hr. Sapphire discs were coated by a mixture of 0.1 mg/ml poly-d-lysine (Sigma), 0.7 mg/ml rat tail collagen (BD Biosciences), and 10 mM acetic acid (Sigma) and placed in an agarose-coated 12-well plate to form glia monolayer islands selectively on sapphire disks. The sapphire disks were cryofixed in an EM-PACT2 (Leica Microsystems) high-pressure freezer in 5% trehalose/10% BSA in 0.05 M phosphate buffer pH 7.4 320 mOsm cryoprotectant. Frozen samples were postfixed in 1% OsO<sub>4</sub>/5% saturated K4Fe(CN)6 in H<sub>2</sub>O in acetone at −90°C for 74 hr and brought to 0°C at 5°C/hr. After a couple washes with ice-cold acetone, the sapphire disks were washed with propylene oxide and with an increasing Epon concentration series. The samples were embedded in fresh Epon overnight and left to polymerize at 65°C for 48 hr. Sapphire disks were separated from the Epon by dipping the samples in boiling water and liquid nitrogen and regions with micro-networks were selected by light microscopy. These regions were cut out and mounted on pre-polymerized Epon blocks for ultrathin sectioning. Ultrathin sections (80 nm) were cut parallel to the sapphire disk, collected on single-slot, formvar-coated copper grids, and stained in uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Hippocampal synapses were randomly selected at low magnification using an electron microscope (JEOL1010), and the conditions were blinded. For each condition, the number of docked SVs, total SV number, and active zone length were measured on digital images taken at 80,000-fold magnification using custom-written semiautomatic image analysis software running in MATLAB (Mathworks). For all morphological analyses the following requirements were set: clearly recognizable synapses with intact synaptic plasma membranes with a recognizable pre- and postsynaptic area and defined SV membranes. SVs were defined as docked if there was no distance visible between the SV membrane and the active zone membrane (pixel size 0.6505 nm).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistics</title><p>Data are shown as mean ± SEM. Data that violated both normality (Shapiro-Wilk) and homogeneity (Levene test) was tested with the two-sided Mann-Whitney U test. Data exhibiting a normal distribution yet significantly altered variation were tested with Welch’s t-test. When assumptions of homogeneity and normality were met, data were tested with Student’s t-test or one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test. For the analysis of electron microscopy data, electrophysiology data and live-cell imaging (pHluorin and FM dye), the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated for different variables applicable to each experiment such as culture batch, sapphire, or synapse originating from the same neuron. If ICC was close to 0.1 or above, indicating that a considerable portion of the total variance can be attributed to, e.g., culture week, multilevel analysis was performed to accommodate nested data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aarts et al., 2014</xref>). For electrophysiology data, we excluded outliers beyond mean ± 3× SD. Bar graphs were plotted as the mean with SEM, where individual data points represent fields of view, neurons, or synapses (EM dataset).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animals were housed and bred according to institutional and Dutch governmental guidelines (DEC-FGA 11-03 and AVD112002017824).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Statistics overview per figure.</title><p>Overview of experiments per figure with N number, mean, median, SEM, SD, performed statistical test, and p-value.</p></caption><media xlink:href="elife-97910-supp1-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-97910-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All supplemental data, used to create graphs and its raw data, is made available on Dataverse. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.34894/RMKROK">https://doi.org/10.34894/RMKROK</ext-link>.</p><p>The following dataset was generated:</p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy" id="dataset1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Poppinga</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Barrett</surname><given-names>NJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Cornelisse</surname><given-names>LN</given-names></name><name><surname>Verhage</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>van Weering</surname><given-names>JRT</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2024">2024</year><data-title>Raw imaging and ephys data SNX4 cKO per figure</data-title><source>DataverseNL</source><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.34894/RMKROK</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Dr. Sander Groffen for help with the conditional knock-out mouse design, Joke Wortel for housing and breeding the mice, Desiree Schut for helping with neuronal cultures, Robbert Zalm for cloning and lentiviral production, Marien P Dekker for assistance with EM analysis.

To address this, we have now performed experiments to investigate the miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents and added extra control groups such as overexpression of SNX4 on control background. In addition, we assessed SNX4-mediated neuronal autophagy as a potential molecular mechanism by which SNX4 affects synaptic output. Please see the detailed responses to this reviewers’ recommendations below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) The characterization of the neurite outgrowth presented in Figure 1 is a necessary starting point for the characterization of the model and the interpretation of the following data. Being the analysis conducted at 21 DIV, a significant portion of the neurite tree is out of the analyzed field. Adding sholl analysis will better indicate the complexity of the that appears to be influenced by SNX4 loss in the representative images shown in Figure 1f.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree and have now performed a Sholl analysis of dendrite branches to investigate dendritic complexity. (Figure 1(i), page 2-3, line 86-88). SNX4 depletion does not affect dendrite length or dendrite branching.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Analogously, the characterization of synapse number is of relevance for the interpretation of the data. For a better flow of the data, Figure 4 might be presented as Figure 2 (without the repetition of panel h in Figure 1). An explanation of how VAMP2 puncta are processed is necessary in the method section. A double labelling with a postsynaptic marker would allow trafficking organelles to be distinguished from mature synaptic contacts. Indeed, the analysis of VAMP2 intensity along neurite in mature 21DIV neurons should reveal peaks in the intensity profile that represent synaptic contacts. For unexplained reasons, the profile is rather flat in the two experimental groups. Focusing on axonal branches will surely result in a peaked profile for VAMP2 labelling.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree that the characterization of synapses is relevant for the interpretation of the data. We have now added a section in our Material and Methods how the VAMP2 puncta are processed (p14 line 517-520). Instead of labeling mature synapses using double labeling of VAMP2 and PSD95, we analyzed the number of active synapses in live neurons using SypHy (Fig. 3g). The reviewer is correct that the VAMP2 data presented in Fig 1I and Fig 4 is part of the same dataset and we have clarified this in the figure legend. In Fig 1I only the total number of VAMP2 puncta is plotted as a marker for synapse number, while in Fig 4 we assess VAMP2 as potential SNX4 sorting cargo (Ma et al., 2017). Because of these different aims, we prefer to keep the figures separate. The analysis of VAMP2 intensity along the distance of the soma is a Sholl analysis (Fig. 4d), represents the average VAMP2 intensity over distance from the soma of 35-41 neurons per group. In contrast to a line scan of a single neurite, this average profile lacks the peaks of individual synapses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents recordings would strengthen the synaptic characterization and complement the electrophysiological recordings shown in Figure 2. Analyzing frequency and amplitude parameters would complement the data on the number of synaptic connections defined by the pre and postsynaptic colocalization puncta as suggested above and may support the data shown in Figure 3 g that suggests a decreased number of active synapses in SNX4-KO cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree that the characterization of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents would strengthen the synaptic characterization and complement the other electrophysiological data. Therefore, we have now added additional experiments showing the mEPSCs (Fig. 2k-m, page 4) in SNX4 cKO neurons versus control. This data shows that the amplitude and frequency of spontaneous miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) were not affected upon SNX4 depletion, consistent with a normal first evoked EPSC and RRP estimate. Furthermore, these data suggest that it is unlikely that the observed increase in neurotransmission is due to post-synaptic effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Recordings on the first evoked response shown in Figure 2 b and quantified in Figures c and d suggest that SNX4 overexpression per se exerts some effect on the Amplitude and the Charge of the first evoked response. This is also evident in the supplementary Figure 2 with lower frequency trains. An additional experimental group, namely control+SNX4 is needed for the correct interpretation of the observed phenotype. The possibility that SNX4 per se exerts an effect on evoked transmission could be discussed in terms of putative mechanisms and interactions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their suggestion and agree that an additional experimental group (control + SNX4) would strengthen interpretation of the observed phenotype. We have now added a new experimental condition with overexpression of SNX4 on a control background (Supplementary Fig. 3, page 20). This data shows that the amplitude and charge of the first evoked response were not affected in control + SNX4 neurons compared to control, and no differences were detected in the response to the 40 Hz stimulation train (Supplementary Fig. 3a-e). Together, these data suggest that SNX4 overexpression in itself does not affect the neurotransmission protocols studied in SNX4 cKO experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) To correctly interpret the SyPhy experiments and exclude an effect of SNX silencing on SV recycling, it is suggested to repeat the experiments shown in Figure 3 in the absence and in the presence of bafilomycin. Indeed, the quantifications shown in Figure 3 d and f do not represent &quot;release fraction&quot; as stated (lines 139/140) but they rather refer to an average difference between release fraction and recovered fraction. With the use of bafilomycin, the comparison of the deltaFmax/deltaFNH4Cl with and without bafilomycin would enable the release fraction to be correctly evaluated and compared.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion and agree on the importance of considering the impact of SV recycling when evaluating the released fraction. We agree that the presence of bafilomycin is critical to isolate the released component during stimulation. We have now rephrased this conclusion. To assess synaptic recycling in these assays, bafilomycin in not critically required and we show by multiple independent experiments, including SypHy and FM64 dye assays, that SV recycling is either not affected or the effect is too small to be detected by these methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) In the ultrastructural analysis, additional quantifications are needed to exclude the accumulation of endosome-like structures. It is not clear if, in the evaluation of total SV number (Figure 5e), the authors counted all vesicles or vesicles &lt; 50nm. This has to be explained and additional quantification of # of SV &lt; 50nm and # SV &gt; 50nm is informative, taking into account the endosomal nature of SNX4. Indeed, although the average size of SV is not changed (fig. 5 d), the density of &quot;bigger vesicle&quot; may result from endosomal-like structure accumulation. An additional suggested quantification is on vesicle # SV &gt; 80nm as previously reported in the cited references dealing with endosomal proteins and presynaptic morphology.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree that the characterization of vesicle size is important and that it was not clearly stated which vesicles were included in the total number of SV (Fig. 5e). We have now added this to the figure description. We have also added a histogram that contains the vesicle numbers of different bin sizes for SNX4 cKO synapses and control synapses (Supplementary Fig. 4, page 21) including # SVs &gt; 80nm. (Whilst it seems that there are more “bigger” vesicles in the KO, further analysis revealed that this is mostly driven by one experiment and this effect is not consistent.)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Due to the high scientific interest in presynaptic autophagy for SV recycling and degradation, and the paucity of experimental work assessing the proteins involved, an initial evaluation of the neuronal autophagy process (by western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry) for the characterization of the model will better support the paragraph in the discussion (lines 314-322) and contribute to future work in the field. Although very rare, autophagosomes quantification at presynaptic sites can also be performed from the already acquired images. A double membrane structure with the material inside is evident in the representative control image presented!</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion and agree that presynaptic autophagy is an interesting potential mechanism that would elaborate our current working model. To address the reviewers’ suggestion, we added multiple independent experiments to investigate basal autophagy markers such as ATG5 using western blot analysis, characterization of p62 levels using immunohistochemistry and performed additional morphometric analysis on the electron microscopy data (Supplementary Fig. 5). In SNX4 cKO neurons, there was no significant difference in P62 puncta numbers or P62 somatic intensity under basal conditions or after blocking autophagic P62 degradation by bafilomycin treatment, suggesting that autophagic flux remains normal. Also, no changes in total ATG5 protein levels were observed and ultrastructural analysis revealed no differences in the total number of autophagosomes. Collectively, these data indicate that SNX4 depletion does not impact the basal autophagic flux, ATG5 protein levels, or the number of autophagosomes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor points:</p><p>(1) Dorrbaun et al. 2018 is missing from the reference list.

The average EPSCs charge of the first evoked was 89, 122 and 57 pC for control, KO and rescued neurons respectfully. The average charge of the first pulse of 40Hz train was 41,58 and 32 pC for control, KO and rescued neurons respectfully, which is roughly 50% of the naïve response of the same cells. These trains were recorded after 2 or 3 other stimulation paradigms, which can have affected the total charge released in the 40Hz train. That said, the proportional difference between groups is high comparable, with a 37% increased average charge released in SNX4 cKO compared to control in the naïve response and 41% increased response in the first response of the 40 Hz train, and rescued cells show a 53% reduction in average released charge compared to control in the naïve response compared to a 44% reduction in the first response of the 40 Hz train.

Therefore, we have now added additional experiments showing the mEPSCs (Fig. 2k-m) in SNX4 cKO neurons versus control. This data shows that the amplitude and frequency of spontaneous miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) were not affected upon SNX4 depletion, suggesting that it is unlikely that the observed increase in neurotransmission is due to post-synaptic effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The increased number of docked vesicles observed in EM and the increased slope (vesicle recruitment, Figure 2h) are not consistent with each other.

However, we think that the increase in docked vesicles might contribute to an enhanced SV recruitment (see discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Figure 3: Vesicle cycling was monitored in only a limited condition.

At least, the authors mention the possibility that they have missed some &quot;positive&quot; conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the reviewer’s comment that vesicle recycling is complex with several parallel pathways involved. While we did not study individual endocytosis pathways, we used different assays covering various recycling pathways. The SypHy assay (Fig. 3c &amp; f) combined with the 100 AP stimulation paradigm at room temperature predominantly addresses clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Additionally, the FM-64 dye assay at 37 degrees Celsius covers ultrafast endocytosis pathways as well as bulk endocytosis routes. Since neither assay showed major effects, we decided not to pursue further experiments focusing on different endocytosis pathways.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Major points:</p><p>(1) Since all of the work here is culture-focussed, the in vivo phenotype is not as relevant, however the in vitro properties are. The incomplete Cre-dependent removal of SNX4 is concerning (especially axonal SNX4 levels identified via immunofluorescence), however, the main concern is that there was no profiling of the other molecular changes within these cultures. This is important, since there may be considerable alterations in the expression of a number of presynaptic proteins which may explain the observed phenotypes. Ideally, these cultures could have been profiled in an unbiased manner via mass spectrometry to identify potential changes in the presynaptic proteome, or at the very least the levels of key fusion molecules would have been assessed via Western blotting.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their suggestion and agree that mass spectrometry would strengthen the interpretation of the observed phenotype. However, due to contractual constraints, we are unable to pursue a mass spectrometry follow-up experiment. We agree that characterizing key fusion molecules is of potential interest. Therefore, based on literature, we selected a likely candidate, VAMP2, which did not show any alterations in expression levels when knocking out SNX4. Given the previously described role of SNX4 in the degradation pathway, one would expect increased degradation of key fusion molecules if they are recycled by SNX4. Other literature indicates that reduced levels of key fusion molecules, such as synaptotagmin or SNAP-25 (Broadie et al., 1994; Washbourne et al., 2001) , do not mimic our phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The experiments reported in Figure 2, in particular those in 2c and 2d, suggest that overexpression of SNX4 has a dominant-negative effect on neurotransmitter release. This is strongly supported by the supplementary data during a stimulus train (particularly the start point of the 5 Hz train in Supplementary Figure 2). Therefore, the perceived rescue of EPSC charge in Figure 2f, 2g may be a result of SNX4 inhibiting neurotransmitter release. A determination of the impact of SNX4 overexpression (and level of overexpression) in WT neurons is essential to show that this is a bonefide rescue, rather than a direct inhibition by SNX4 overexpression.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their suggestion and agree that an additional experimental group (control + SNX4) would strengthen interpretation of the observed phenotype. We have now added a new experiment with an extra experimental condition with overexpression of SNX4 on a control background (Supplementary Fig. 3 page 21). This data shows that the amplitude and charge of the first evoked response were not affected in control + SNX4 neurons compared to control, and no differences were detected in the response to the 40 Hz stimulation train (Supplementary Fig. 3a-e). Together, these data suggest that SNX4 overexpression in itself does not affect the neurotransmission protocols studied in SNX4 cKO experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The experiments in Figure 3 clearly reveal a lack of effect of SNX4 depletion on synaptic vesicle endocytosis. However, the assumption that synaptic vesicle recycling is unaffected is a <italic>little premature</italic>. The fact that the second evoked SypHy peak is significantly larger than the first (Figures 3c-e) suggests that more vesicles may be recycling in KO neurons. Furthermore, the FM dye experiments do not aid interpretation, since there may be insufficient time (10 min) for new vesicles to be generated from endosomal intermediates experiments. Therefore, to confirm an absence of effect on recycling, the authors could either (1) perform the same experiment as 3c, but with 4 stimulation trains (to drive the system harder to reveal any phenotype) or (2) repeat the FM dye experiment but increase the time between loading and unloading to 30 min.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the reviewers' comment that vesicle recycling is an important component to consider and is complex with several parallel pathways involved. We conducted multiple independent experiments covering the most significant recycling pathways. The SypHy assay (Fig. 3c &amp; f) combined with the 100 AP stimulation paradigm at room temperature predominantly addresses clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Additionally, the FM-64 dye assay at 37 degrees Celsius covers ultrafast endocytosis pathways as well as bulk endocytosis routes. To further challenge the system and reveal recycling phenotypes, we included a second 100 AP stimulation in our SypHy assay. While only the increase of the second SypHy peak is significant, the absolute numbers do not differ much from the first peak (0,17 for control and 0,21 for KO second peak and 0,19 for control and 0,22 for KO first peak, Supplementary table1). We nevertheless do not see any effects on recycling after the second peak (mean decay time is 27 for control and 26 for KO Supplementary Table 1). A single 100 AP 40 Hz train depletes all the synchronous release (not shown) and most of the evoked charge (see Fig 2f), hence two of these trains with one minute recovery is already a very demanding protocol. Although increasing the time between loading and unloading to 30 minutes might uncover other recycling components, it has been shown that ultrafast endocytosis occurs within 30 seconds (Watanabe et al., 2013), suggesting that 10 minutes should provide enough time for synaptic vesicle recycling. This is also evident from the fact that we can significantly destain synapses loaded with FM dye by electrical stimulation (Fig 3j), indicating that synaptic vesicle recycling took place. Since neither assay showed major effects, we concluded that under these circumstances, synaptic recycling is not significantly affected. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that recycling deficits in SNX4 cKO neurons could be detected in other paradigms,</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) There is no obvious effect on VAMP2 levels or location in SNX4 KO neurons (Figure 4). However, when one considers that SNX4 is proposed to have a role in VAMP2 trafficking, it is surprising that an experiment examining the live trafficking of VAMP2-SypHy was not performed. This would have revealed activity-dependent alterations that would have been missed by simply measuring VAMP2 expression and localization, and potentially provided a molecular explanation for the enhanced neurotransmitter release during a stimulus train.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion and agree that it could be a valuable experiment However, overexpressing a VAMP2-pHluorin construct might obscure potential phenotypes related to VAMP2 trafficking. SNX4 is expected to be involved in VAMP2 recycling, even with activity-dependent changes. Mis-sorted VAMP2 would accumulate in acidic vesicles, which could be masked by the VAMP2-pHluorin construct. Similarly, mis-sorting of other SNX4 cargo, such as the transferrin receptor, has been identified through lysosomal degradation, as shown by Western blot analysis of expression levels of the endogenous protein. We did not detect any differences in endogenous levels of VAMP2 within 21 days of SNX4 deletion (Fig 4), indicating that SNX4-dependent endosome sorting is not essential for VAMP2 recycling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The morphological data in Figure 5 report a series of small changes in docked vesicles and active zone length. In many cases, significance is obtained due to synapses being used as the experimental n, and thus inflating the statistical power. When one considers that no significant effect was observed on evoked release (apart from during a stimulus train), it suggests that the number of docked vesicles does not alter release probability in this system (which the authors point out). Instead, they suggest that an increased supply of vesicles is responsible, via increased recruitment to RRP/releasable pool (but not via increased recycling). If this is the case, it should have been reflected as an increase in the evoked SypHy response in Fig 2c,d (which is borderline significant). What may help is to determine the morphological landscape immediately after a stimulus strain, since this is the only condition where enhanced release is observed, and thus provide a morphological correlate to the physiological data.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the reviewer’s suggestion that an ultrastructural characterization immediately after a stimulus train would be informative. Unfortunately, contract constraints prevent us from performing this experiment. For our ultrastructural morphological data, we treated synapses as individual experimental <italic>n</italic> since it is not possible to determine whether synapses in a micronetwork on one sapphire originate from the same neuron. We used 18 independent sapphires from 3 independent pups to ensure the technical and biological replication of our data and measuring independent neurons. We fully agree with the reviewers comment to be careful with ‘inflating the statistical power’ due to potential nesting effects when using synapses as experimental n. To mitigate the potential nesting effect of analyzing multiple synapses per neuron, the intracluster correlation (ICC) is calculated per variable and per nesting effect. If ICC was close to 0.1, indicating that a considerable portion of the total variance can be attributed to e.g. synapse or sapphire, multilevel analysis was performed to accommodate nested data (Aarts et al., 2014).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor points</p><p>(1) When a new mouse model is generated, it is usually accompanied by a thorough characterization of its properties.

Why is there such a disparity when there is no difference in response to single pulses (Figures 2b-d) or presynaptic plasticity (Figure 2e)?</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewer’s concern. We excluded an outlier (3x SD) in the KO dataset that drove the initial far higher EPSC charge in the graph (was already excluded for the statistics, Supplementary table 1). The average charge of the first pulse of 40Hz train is 41 pC and for KO neurons 58 pC, which did not differ significantly. These trains of Fig. 2f were recorded after 2 or 3 other stimulation paradigms, which can have affected the total charge released in the 40Hz train. That said, the proportional difference between groups is high comparable between Fig 2b-d and 2f, with a 37% increased average charge released in SNX4 cKO compared to control in the naïve response (Fig. 2d) and 41% increased response in the first response of the 40 Hz train (Fig. 2f), and rescued cells show a 53% reduction in average released charge compared to control in the naïve response compared to a 44% reduction in the first response of the 40 Hz train.
