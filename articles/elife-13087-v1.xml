Activation-induced deaminase (AID) can drive lymphomagenesis by generating off-target DNA breaks at loci that harbor highly active enhancers and display convergent transcription. The first active transcriptional profiles from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients acquired here reveal striking similarity at structural variation (SV) sites. Specific transcriptional features, namely convergent transcription and Pol2 stalling, were detected at breakpoints. The overlap was most prominent at SV with recognition motifs for the recombination activating genes (RAG). We present signal feature analysis to detect vulnerable regions and quantified from human cells how convergent transcription contributes to R-loop generation and RNA polymerase stalling. Wide stalling regions were characterized by high DNAse hypersensitivity and unusually broad H3K4me3 signal. Based on 1382 pre-B-ALL patients, the ETV6-RUNX1 fusion positive patients had over ten-fold elevation in RAG1 while high expression of AID marked pre-B-ALL lacking common cytogenetic changes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13087.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13087.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13087.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Some of the most common cancers found in children are called precursor leukemias, which may start to develop before birth. Cancerous cells often contain alterations to the genetic information in their DNA. In precursor leukemias, the most common genetic changes involve deleting, adding or rearranging segments of the DNA sequence.</p><p>Several researchers have sequenced the entire DNA of childhood leukemia cells, with the result that almost all of the genetic alterations linked to these conditions have been catalogued. These efforts have shown that certain DNA regions are particularly affected by mutations, but no one knows why errors occur so frequently in these regions.</p><p>Recent evidence also suggests that transcription – the process of producing useful molecules from a stretch of DNA – can play a role in generating genetic alterations. Heinäniemi et al. have now used a technique called global run-on sequencing to measure the extent of transcription in many different types of leukemia cells. This revealed that in the error-prone DNA regions, two processes – called convergent transcription and transcriptional stalling – interfere with transcription. Both processes temporarily leave the normally double-stranded DNA unzipped as two single strands and free of nucleosomes, which makes DNA more vulnerable to breaking. This would explain how pieces of DNA might be lost, added, or moved to cause the genetic errors that lead to leukemia.</p><p>Further investigation revealed that two protein complexes called RAG and AID, which rearrange segments of DNA in immune cells, are likely to cause the errors in the vulnerable DNA regions. Different amounts of RAG and AID were present in different subtypes of leukemia cells, and these amounts also varied with the risk classification of the disease. Further studies are now needed to investigate the exact roles of these protein complexes. This could eventually help scientists devise strategies to protect the DNA of people with leukemia from these errors, which could reduce the risk of the cancer reoccurring.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold>

1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mori et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Maia et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bateman et al., 2015</xref>), while the onset of overt disease requires additional genetic alterations. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of ETV6-RUNX1 (also known as TEL-AML1) positive acute leukemias suggested that the secondary lesions are predominantly caused by off-target activity of the RAG complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Papaemmanuil et al., 2014</xref>). In a similar fashion, the expression of the AID complex in more mature B cells is implicated in genomic instability and development of lymphomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Meng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Qian et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Robbiani et al. 2015</xref>). To date, WGS in leukemia have been reported from several pre-B-ALL subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Holmfeld et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Paulsson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>), resulting in a comprehensive characterization of the underlying genetic alterations. Therefore, the research focus on leukemia genetics is moving into characterization of the mechanisms by which these lesions occur and the consequences of the resulting clonal heterogeneity.</p><p>Antigen receptor genes are assembled from discrete gene segments by RAG-mediated V(D)J recombination at sites of recombination signal sequences (RSS) during early lymphocyte development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gellert 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schatz and Swanson, 2011</xref>). Cells incorporate multiple strategies to control the action of the RAG complex to appropriate genomic loci: the expression of <italic>RAG1</italic> and <italic>RAG2</italic> is limited to precursor stages of lymphocytes, the activity of the complex is attenuated during S-phase of cell cycle, and RAG cleavage is directed towards RSS pair containing sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schatz and Swanson, 2011</xref>). The engagement of RAG2 is further limited by the histone modification H3K4me3, which is typically found at transcription start sites (TSS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Matthews et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Teng et al., 2015</xref>). However, RSS and RSS-like motifs are found only at around 7–40% of breakpoints at SV (genomic imbalance, translocation or inversion) sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Papaemmanuil et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, the RSS motifs and H3K4me3 occur frequently in the genome suggesting that additional features, possibly even additional complexes including AID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Swaminathan et al., 2015</xref>), are relevant for the genetic instability underlying leukemia SV.</p><p>In lymphomas, AID off-target effects localize to intragenic super-enhancer (SE) and promoter areas characterized by transcription from both strands, i.e. convergent transcription (convT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Meng et al., 2014</xref>). Notably, VH gene segment recombination by RAG at the IgH locus coincides with sense- and antisense transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bolland et al., 2004</xref>), which could be relevant also at off-target sites. Secondly, stalled polymerases, which are found at exons, R-loops and actively paused at TSS regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jonkers and Lis, 2015</xref>), expose single stranded DNA, recruiting AID via Spt5 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pavri et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, the polymerase complex displaces nucleosomes completely or partially (the H2A/H2B moiety), which in vitro promotes cleavage by RAGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bevington and Boyes, 2013</xref>). Despite these intriguing findings, the relevance of transcription-coupled processes has not been systematically characterized, and the clinical relevance of RAG and AID expression in the different leukemia subtypes remains unclear. RNA polymerases engaged into primary transcription across the genome can be measured using Global-Run-On sequencing (GRO-seq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kaikkonen et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, this method is ideally suited to distinguish features of transcription at SV sites, including convT and RNA polymerase stalling. To this end, we acquired the first patient profiles of nascent transcriptional activity in leukemic blasts representing seven cytogenetic subgroups and performed integrative analysis of various genome-wide profiles and patient transcriptomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Integrative analysis of transcription and genomic instability in leukemic cells</title><p>Transcriptional activity from ALL cells representing seven different pre-B-ALL cytogenetic subtypes was assayed using GRO-seq (both primary patient and cell line samples, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> and Materials and methods), and jointly analyzed with WGS data from the ETV6-RUNX1 (51 cases; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Papaemmanuil et al., 2014</xref>), high hyperdiploid (HeH, 16 cases; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Paulsson et al., 2015</xref>), hypodiploid (20 cases; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Holmfeldt et al., 2013</xref>) and MLL-rearranged (22 cases at diagnosis and 2 relapses; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersson et al., 2015</xref>) subtypes of precursor B-ALL.

However, we noticed that the recurrent breakpoints often lied several kb downstream of TSS, as highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and D</xref> (see inserts), and coincided with simultaneous transcription on both strands, ie. convT spanning a minimum of 100 bp. In closer examination of the signal data from leukemia SV hotspots, many of these regions likely correspond to transcription from intragenic enhancers that generate enhancer RNAs (eRNA) that are typically a few kb in size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kaikkonen et al. 2013</xref>). In agreement, a significant enrichment of breakpoints in enhancers overlapping with convT was observed (hypergeometric test P=0.00012 for intergenic and P=4.6e-08 for all enhancers identified based on eRNA signal, see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>).

We hypothesized that they represent RNA polymerase II (Pol2) stalling events. Previous analyses of Pol2 stalling have focused on promoter proximal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adelman and Lis, 2012</xref>). To examine such events genome-wide and across gene bodies, we developed a general analysis approach that identifies change points within gene regions and reports those with high elevation in the signal level (see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref> for the identified regions) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Killick et al., 2012</xref>).

This enrichment of breakpoints to convT and Pol2 stalling regions was significant across a wide range of transcriptional activity (refer to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Co-occurrence of breakpoints within a 1-kb window was used to distinguish non-recurrent (one breakpoint) and recurrent (more than one breakpoint) events (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). Breakpoint recurrence was found to increase the overlap with both Pol2 stalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>)and convT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). The mean overlap observed in 1000-fold random sampling (grey bars) confirmed the specificity of the overlap (note that Pol2 stalling is analyzed from intragenic regions only).

We hypothesized that locally depleted nucleosomes around the Pol2 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bevington and Boyes, 2013</xref>) may enhance access to RSS/RSS-like sequences. To this end, we retrieved DNAse hypersensitivity data from ENCODE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">The ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012</xref>; see Materials and methods). DNAse-seq signal peaks were significantly wider when overlapping with Pol2 stalling sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). A 876 bp (95% CI, 855–896) increase was observed in B-lymphoblastoid cells and 412 bp (95% CI, 395–429) in ES cells (Wilcoxon rank sum test P&lt;2.2e-16 in both cell types, see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 3—source data 2</xref>). This was reproducibly observed using peaks located within gene TSS, body or end regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We selected TSS regions with RSS motifs for closer examination and found that Pol2 stalling sites at these TSS were significantly wider than at other TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), with a difference of 259 bp (95% CI, 79–475 bp, Wilcoxon rank sum test P=0.0024). Thus, wide Pol2 stalling increases the likelihood of RSS motif occurrence in accessible chromatin. The width of stalling did not correlate positively (Pearson’s correlation −0.11; 95% CI, −0.09 to −0.13) with the transcription level of the corresponding gene, indicating that stalling events, and not just active transcription, are important. We further analyzed the top 5% of widest Pol2 stalling regions by comparing them to widest peaks from DNAse hypersensitivity and ChIP for histone marks (see Materials and methods).

Precursor leukemias are unique in that they often harbor SV and have relatively few mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Roberts and Mullighan, 2015</xref>). Recently, a functional role of transcription in genomic instability has begun to emerge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hatchi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sollier et al., 2014</xref>). The maturing lymphoid cells are vulnerable to off-target effects downstream of RAG and AID activity that is required for immune gene rearrangement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Meng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Qian et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Papaemmanuil et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Swaminathan et al., 2015</xref>). The present study represents a systematic investigation of SVs detected in acute pre-B-cell leukemia using WGS in the context of global transcriptional activity in leukemic cells. We identified specific transcriptional features, namely convergence of transcription and Pol2 stalling, as key factors underlying secondary genetic lesions frequently seen in precursor B leukemias.</p><p>Pol2 stalling and convT strongly associate with recurrent breakpoint sites across the genome and at gene loci implicated in leukemia such as <italic>CDKN2A</italic> and <italic>PAX5</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sulong et al., 2009</xref>). While protein-coding secondary hits required in disease progression have been recognized for some time, our integrative analysis identified several putative long non-coding RNAs and eRNAs, which merit further investigation. Earlier work has linked eRNAs generated from intragenic superenhancers with AID-mediated instability in lymphomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Meng et al., 2014</xref>), proposing that convT leads to arrested transcription, in agreement with experimental evidence from yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Prescott and Proudfoot, 2002</xref>). Similarly, it has been shown that Pol2 stalling and R-loops expose ssDNA for AID targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huang et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pavri et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alt et al., 2013</xref>). We show for the first time that leukemia breakpoints similarly display significant enrichment to enhancers overlapping convT. We further demonstrate a link between convT and elevated R-loop levels and Pol2 stalling on a genome-wide level, with evidence from normal and leukemic human cells. These mechanisms of transcription-coupled genetic instability, earlier implicated in lymphomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pavri et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Meng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pefanis et al., 2014</xref>) and breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hatchi et al., 2015</xref>), therefore have relevance in multiple different cancer types.</p><p>Breakpoints carrying RSS-like recognition motifs for RAG1 showed high overlap with the vulnerable regions as defined by convT and Pol2 stalling. Therefore, we propose that also RAG1 access to its target sites is related to the fidelity of elongation. Previous studies investigating motif recognition and genome-wide binding profiles of RAGs have shed light on the mechanisms how this complex is recruited to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bevington and Boyes, 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Teng et al., 2015</xref>); however these studies have been carried out using normal cells or mouse models that limit their integration with patient WGS data. The chromatin mark H3K4me3 typically found at active promoters serves as a docking site for RAG2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Matthews et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Teng et al., 2015</xref>). RAG-mediated cleavage further requires recognition of RSS motifs by RAG1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schatz and Swanson, 2011</xref>). Our results revealed that TSS that carry breakpoints with an RSS motif differ from unaffected TSS by the presence of unusually wide Pol2 stalling. We show that Pol2 stalling sites, in general, have increased DNA accessibility. Further, the top 5% of widest stalling regions are characterized by unusually broad DNAse hypersensitive regions and H3K4me3 signal. Unique regulation of Pol2 pausing and elongation has been recognized to be related to broad H3K4me3 domains across a wide variety of cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benayoun et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Scheidegger and Nechaev, 2016</xref>). Together, these properties of Pol2 stalling sites may favor both the recognition and cleavage by the RAG complex.</p><p>In this study, we developed a genome-wide approach to capture Pol2 stalling events across gene bodies using change points analysis. This extends previous approaches to detect promoter-proximal pausing events (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adelman and Lis, 2012</xref>) to analysis of slowing down of Pol2 within the full transcribed region. The feasibility of our approach was confirmed by high overlap of detected regions with RLFS rich regions that represent known structural obstacles to the progression of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Skourti-Stathaki et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Skourti-Stathaki et al., 2014b</xref>). Furthermore, analysis of Pol2 stalling from Pol2 ChIP-seq profiles acquired in pre-B-ALL cells had high agreement with the GRO-seq profiles. The slowing of Pol2 upon transition from initiation to elongation, measured by the Pol2 Ser5 phosphorylation, occurs at AID hypermutation sites within the IgH-V region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2014a</xref>). We show that this type of Pol2 stalling had high overlap with leukemia breakpoints.</p><p>While RAG has a well-established role in pre-B cells, expression of AID represents a recently discovered threat for lymphoid precursor genome integrity. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Swaminathan et al., 2015</xref>) showed that infection-triggered attenuation of IL-7 receptor signaling led to strong AID expression, thus exposing pre-leukemic cells to additional off-targeting events. Moreover, a negative effect on patient survival and increased relapse frequency were observed in high <italic>AICDA</italic> expressing leukemia patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Swaminathan et al., 2015</xref>). We found that high expression of <italic>RAG1/2</italic> or <italic>AICDA</italic> is markedly distinct between different subtypes of pre-B-ALL at the leukemia state. Prevalent <italic>AICDA</italic> expression was a distinguishing feature of high risk pre-B-ALL cases, in line with the previous data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Swaminathan et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, the molecular profiles of patients belonging to the cytogenetic subtype designated as 'other', had high similarity, placing them in close proximity on the t-SNE map. This genetically heterogeneous category of rare cytogenetic types had a distinct elevation in <italic>AICDA</italic> expression. Further investigation of the WGS profiles focusing on this patient category may shed light on whether <italic>AICDA</italic> expression could serve as a putative underlying factor that may spur the diversity of DNA lesions in these patients. Similarly, the over ten-fold higher <italic>RAG1</italic> expression could also be relevant for the prevalent development of leukemia carrying the ETV6-RUNX1 initiating fusion. The <italic>RAG</italic> locus is under complex regulation of local chromatin looping by SATB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hao et al., 2015</xref>) that controls silencing and activating regulatory elements and was shown to directly control the elevated <italic>RAG1</italic> expression in mice. The enhancer activity in patient blast cells, as captured here in the nascent transcriptomes, will help understanding the regulation of such key loci in detail.</p><p>As more data on SV becomes available across cancers, further efforts should be made to elucidate the contribution of different complexes in transcription-coupled genomic instability and to develop strategies for dampening their levels and activity. Translation of these measures into clinical practice could impact treatment efficacy by decreasing clonal heterogeneity and relapse risk.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>GRO-seq samples</title><p>Primary bone marrow or blood samples from pediatric precursor B-ALL patients that represented different cytogenetic subtypes were used for GRO-seq assay (refer to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> for cytogenetic and blast count data). The study was approved by the Regional Ethics Committee in Pirkanmaa, Tampere, Finland (#R13109). The study was conducted according to the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki, and a written informed consent was received by the patient and/or guardians. In addition, three ALL cell lines (REH, Kopn-8 and Nalm-6) representing different genetic subtypes (ETV6-RUNX1 fusion, MLL rearrangement and 'other') were included to complement the dataset. REH (ACC-20), Nalm6 (ACC-128), and Kopn8 (ACC-552) cell lines were obtained from the Leibniz-Institut DSMZ-Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH (Germany). Mycoplasma status was defined negative by PCR (PCR Mycoplasma Test Kit I/C, PromoCell GmbH, Germany) for all cells. The cell lines were authenticated by PCR of known fusion genes: ETV6-RUNX1 in REH, MLL-MLLT1 in Kopn8, and the lack of recurrent fusions in Nalm6. In addition, the generated genome-wide results can be used in verification of cell line specific markers. We reasoned that a collection of samples that represent both primary blasts and cell lines of different cytogenetics types (and genetic complexity) would be ideal to capture the patterns of transcriptional activity in the lymphoid lineage and leukemic cells. Furthermore, 4–8 replicates were collected from a subset of samples to ensure reproducibility of the results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). In cell culture studies, same cell lines with similar conditions are defined as biological replicates, as nuclei were extracted from temporally independent experiments. For nuclei extractions in co-culture experiments, same cell lines with different culture conditions but with same time points were processed simultaneously. For example, total of eight extractions from REH cells were performed ('Sample name' column), in six slightly different culture conditions ('Cell culture type' and 'Time point (h)' columns), and with two replicate samples collected for two conditions in independent experiments ('Biological replicate' column). There were no technical replicates in the sense that multiple nuclei extractions would have been made from the same biological replicate. Patient samples (N = 7) collected represent different cytogenetic subtypes and were used as additional confirmation at individual gene loci: for most subtypes N = 1, except hyperdiploid N = 2; ETV6-RUNX1 is represented also by the REH cell line; and replicate samples were generated for Patient 1 that correspond to cultured and freshly isolated cells.

For ChIP, 40 million cells were crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde for 10–15 mins. The reactions were quenched by adding glycine to a final concentration of 125 mM, and the cells were centrifuged and washed twice with ice-cold PBS. For ChIP 5 or 10 million cells were used (Pol2 or H3K4me3, respectively). Nuclei were extracted by washing cell pellet twice with 1 ml of MNase buffer (10 mM Tris ph 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5% IGEPAL CA-630 [Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany], 1x protease inhibitor cocktail [PIC, Roche, Basel, Switzerland], 1 mM PMSF [Thermofisher, Carlsbad, CA, USA]).

Different amounts of MNase (0.5–20 U; #88216, Thermofisher, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was added to the nuclei in 10 µl volume and incubated at 37°C for 10 mins. To stop the reaction, 100 µl of 2x Lysis buffer was added to the reaction (1% SDS, 40 mM EDTA, 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.1) and samples were sonicated using Bioruptor (Diagenode) for 5 cycles (30 s - 30 s) to break the nuclei.

Antibodies against Ser2P (cat# ab5095, RRID:AB_304749) and Ser5P (cat# ab5131, RRID:AB_449369) were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA, USA).

Immunoprecipitated chromatin was eluted twice with 100 µl elution buffer (TE, 1% SDS). The NaCl concentration was adjusted to 300 mM with 5 M NaCl and crosslinks were reversed overnight at 65°C. The samples were sequentially incubated at 37°C for 2 h each with 0.33 mg/ml RNase A and 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K (both from Thermofisher, Carlsbad, CA, USA).

Specifically, the quality of raw sequencing reads was confirmed using the FastQC tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/">http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/</ext-link>) and subsequently bases with poor quality scores were trimmed (requiring a minimum 97% of all bases in one read to have a min phred quality score of 10) using the FastX toolkit (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/">http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/</ext-link>). Samples sequenced on multiple lanes were pooled after quality control. Read stacks were collapsed from ChIP-seq files using fastx (collapse). The Bowtie software (bowtie-0.12.9v0.1.x) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Langmead et al., 2009</xref>) was used for aligning the GRO-seq, ChIP-seq and DRIP-seq reads to the human genome (version hg19). Up to two mismatches and up to three locations were accepted and the best alignment was reported for each read. For the GRO-seq reads this step was preceded by removing reads mapping to rRNA regions (AbundantSequences as annotated by iGenomes) and discarding reads overlapping with so-called blacklisted regions that represent unusual low or high mappability as defined by ENCODE, ribosomal and small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) loci from ENCODE and further manually curated for the human genome (bed file with sequences is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD12-data">Supplementary file 6</xref>).</p><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>HiC</title><p>Reads from paired-end sequencing were separately filtered and aligned to the genome using bowtie. The reads were checked for MboI restriction sites before doing the alignments and the sequences after GATC sites were trimmed out to improve mappability. The HOMER v4.3 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://homer.salk.edu/homer">http://homer.salk.edu/homer</ext-link>) software was used in further processing of HiC-data. Paired-end reads were connected and read pairs with exact same ends were only considered once and read pairs were removed if they were separated by less than 1.5× the estimated sequencing insert length to remove likely continuous genomic fragments or re-ligation events. Paired-end reads originating from regions of unusually high tag density were left out by removing reads from 10 kb regions that contain more than five times the average number of reads. Background model for normalization of HiC-data was generated with 50 kb resolution. The topological domains were identified using the HOMER command’ findHiCDomains.pl’ using a resolution of 50 kb. This analysis is based on a statistic referred to as the ‘directionality index’, which describes the tendency of a given position to interact with either the chromatin upstream or downstream from its current position.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-2"><title>GRO-seq</title><p>Combined tagDirectories from GRO-seq samples were made by pooling the sequencing data for each cell and sample type with fragment length set to 75. The findPeaks.pl program in the The HOMER v4.3 software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://homer.salk.edu/homer">http://homer.salk.edu/homer</ext-link>) was used to identify <italic>de novo</italic> transcripts from GRO-seq data using pooled sequencing reads per sample type. Deeply sequenced REH, Nalm6 and lymphoblastoid cells were used to define signal features in B-cell lineage and separate analysis was carried out for ES cells (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

The gene annotations from Refseq and UCSC known gene tables were retrieved using the UCSC Table Browser (hg19, GRCh37 Genome Reference Consortium Human Reference 37 (GCA_000001405.1)). Unique transcript coordinates were used in analysis, that is, any transcripts sharing the same start and end coordinate were considered together. The TSS regions were defined as +/- 1 kb regions around the annotated start coordinate. Only transcripts mapping to canonical chromosomes were kept, also those on chrM were removed.</p><sec id="s4-5-1"><title>Enhancers</title><p>Super-enhancer coordinates from CD19+, CD20+ and HSC cells were obtained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hnisz et al., 2013</xref>) and merged for visualization of tracks. De novo enhancer detection was performed from the deeply sequenced REH, Nalm6 and lymphoblastoid cells based on the transcript identification result. Transcripts with length &lt;15 kb and the characteristic bidirectionality or co-localization with enhancer locations defined using DNAse and chromatin marker data were used to distinguish eRNAs (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref> for data).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Analysis of SV in context of chromosome subregions</title><p>TADs reflect the three dimensional structure of chromatin, forming natural boundaries that divide the chromosomes into sub-regions. To identify TADs with highest frequency of breakpoints, HiC-data analysis was performed using HOMER 4.3. As our goal is to generate a natural division of the genome into sub-regions that are relevant in context of transcriptional regulation, this approach is superior to arbitrarily assigning sub-regions based on fixed windows. The pre-B-ALL breakpoints and annotation data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Holmfeldt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Papaemmanuil et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Paulsson et al., 2015</xref>) were analyzed in context of TADs. Specifically, TADs were overlapped with subtype-specific breakpoints (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref> presents TADs sorted based on the count of breakpoints). Subsequently, TADs with breakpoints were divided into quartiles based on breakpoint frequency per bp to analyze enrichment of feature overlap that exceeds the genomic background level. To obtain the total transcribed area width within each TAD, the TAD coordinates were overlapped with the detected GRO-seq transcripts (bedtools intersect -wao). The combined SV data represents in total 1680 breakpoints and is the most comprehensive collection of pre-B-ALL SV that we are aware of.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Chromatin segmentation data</title><p>BroadChromHMM chromatin segmentations were obtained from GM12878 and H1 ES cells including the following segment types: 1_Active_Promoter, 2_Weak_Promoter, 3_Poised_Promoter, 4_Strong_Enhancer, 5_Strong_Enhancer, 6_Weak_Enhancer, 7_Weak_Enhancer, 8_Insulator, 9_Txn_Transition, 10_Txn_Elongation, 11_Weak_Txn, 12_Repressed&quot;, 13_Heterochrom/lo, 14_Repetitive/CNV, 15_Repetitive/CNV. The sizes of the segments of each type were used to calculate the total span from the genome. Each segment type was then overlapped with a combined bed file specifying convT and Pol2 stalling regions. Overlapping and non-overlapping pieces were returned and analyzed separately (bedtools intersect, followed by bedtools subtract with the overlapping pieces given as parameter b).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Distinguishing breakpoints based on RSS-like motifs or recurrence</title><p>Two types of breakpoints were distinguished based on RSS motif annotation to result in the following region assignment: regions containing a consensus RSS/heptamer sequence motif were used to categorize co-localized breakpoints as putative RSS-dependent breakpoints (R-breakp: 447 in total, 335 in the ETV6-RUNX1 subtype), while regions devoid of recognition sequence were used to classify RSS-independent lesions (NR-breakp: 938 in total, 416 in the ETV6-RUNX1 subtype). Regions harboring unresolved breakpoints were left out from majority of analysis performed (285 regions harboring 295 breakpoints in the ETV6-RUNX1 subtype that were mainly isolated and non-recurrent). The RSS assignment for other breakpoints was obtained in the following way: the resolved breakpoints were extended to both sides by 10 bp, resulting in a 21 bp region. The MEME analysis in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Papaemmanuil et al. 2014</xref> for 708 resolved breakpoints from ETV6-RUNX1 patients was replicated and comparable sequence logos to that reported previously were obtained and used to annotate RSS status. A p-value cut-off of 0.003 was chosen for the MEME motif scanning based on FIMO analysis of the ETV6-RUNX1 data.</p><p>To evaluate recurrence, the breakpoint ends at 1 kb distance were stitched together to form regions (each with at least one breakpoint, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>), annotating the number of breakpoints inside (BEDTools mergeBed –d 1000 –n). Overlap of breakpoint regions with RLFS, TSS, convT and Pol2 stalling regions were obtained using BEDTools with 1 kb window. The overlap frequencies were compared to random sampling of similarly sized genomic regions. Further comparisons were performed separating recurrent (&gt;1 breakpoint per stitched region) and non-recurrent regions, and with increasing the cut-off for the number of breakpoint events per stitched region. The same was repeated for breakpoints within genes binned into four categories based on their transcription level. The transcript regions were quantified using data from REH, Nalm6, and lymphoblastoid cells, and normalized by RPKM. The maximum expression value was to divide transcripts into quartiles based on the expression level.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Signal feature analysis</title><p>The visual examination of SV sites served as the first step to define transcriptional features of potential relevance. This motivated the analysis of regions with overlapping transcription from both strands (convT) and local elevations in the signal (Pol2 stalling), with detailed definitions given below. For genome-wide analysis of signal feature overlap with SV, feature tracks from several samples were combined. This approach was deemed most appropriate to address the dynamic nature of transcriptional activity and to avoid missing regions that due to high recurrence of SV may be deleted in subset of leukemic cells studied.</p><sec id="s4-9-1"><title>ConvT</title><p>ConvT regions were identified as transcripts that overlap on opposite strands by at least 100 bp (as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Meng et al., 2014</xref>). Subsequently, a combined bed track was created for the leukemic and lymphoblastoid samples using bedTools mergeBed command (-d 0). The data from ES cells (GSE41009) served as an independent control. The level of convT was quantified using the HOMER program analyzeRNA.pl from both strands separately and normalized by region size. The minimum value obtained per region (comparing + and - strands) was assigned as convT level.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-2"><title>Pol2 stalling</title><p>Change-point detection is the mathematical problem of finding abrupt changes in a signal, typically applied in context of time series (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Killick et al., 2012</xref>). Both approximate and exact methods exist for estimating the point at which the statistical properties of a sequence of observations change. The analysis of changepoints in the signal mean was carried out using functions implemented in the R package ‘changepoint’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Killick and Eckley, 2014</xref>). An exact method with favorable computational cost was recently introduced in context of time-series data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Killick et al., 2012</xref>). This method called PELT was selected to detect the changepoints from scaled (zero mean, equal variance) signal profiles calculated at 50-bp resolution (generated bedGraph files are available under the GEO accession GSE67540). The analysis was performed separately for each gene, using Bayesian Information Criterion as a penalty term with the changepoint counted as a parameter (function cpt.mean with parameters penalty = 'BIC1', method ='PELT'). The input dataset representing primary transcription activity at gene loci was generated by overlapping the GRO-seq signal file strand-specifically with transcript coordinates from UCSC and Refseq (see genomic regions used). The analysis only considered regions with annotation match (in minimum 5% of identified transcript covered by annotation; a minimum of 50% overlap with the identified transcript; annotated and detected starts do not differ more than 10 kb). In order to define Pol2 stalling sites, the signal level between changepoints were compared to the median across the whole gene, and intervals above 90% quantile were reported as stalled. For ChIP-seq, this cut-off was relaxed to 80% due to higher background signal. Notice also that there is no strand information based on ChIP-seq. The analysis was carried out separately for each of the deeply sequenced (REH, Nalm6 and lymphoblastoid) GRO-seq datasets and ChIP-seq replicates and subsequently merged to one bed file specifying stalled region coordinates (bedTools merge –d 100). The ES GRO-seq dataset GSE41009 was processed similarly and used as an independent control. To study whether there was a relationship between the stalled region size overlapping TSS regions and R-breakp frequency, the following intersects were calculated using BEDTools (intersectBed -wa | uniq): (i) overlap of Pol2 stalling sites and TSS regions harboring R-breakp and (ii) overlap of Pol2 stalling sites and TSS regions not harboring R- or NR-breakp. Subsequently, the sizes of Pol2 stalling sites in each coordinate file were calculated and the Wilcoxon rank sum test used for evaluating statistical significance for the difference in Pol2 stalling width. Secondly, top 5% widest Pol2 stalling sites were identified and compared to top 5% widest peaks from ChIP-seq and DNAse-seq profiles (see below).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-3"><title>Signal comparison at gene regions</title><p>The HOMER command annotatePeaks.pl was used to create a transcriptional profile of active genes (RPKM &gt; 0.5) in ES, lymphoblastoid and REH cells by scaling the histogram to each region (i.e 0–100%) using a bin size of 100. RLFS motif density was calculated across genes with the BEDtools coverage tool. A density plot representing RLFS frequency across gene regions was then obtained as above.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>DRIP-seq and RLFS motif data for R-loop detection</title><p>Data from replicate DRIP-seq experiments with two different restriction enzyme digestions (GSE45530) were used in the analysis. Log2 signal levels were quantified using HOMER at TSS regions. Statistical significance was estimated separately for the two different restriction enzyme digestions. RLFS motif search was performed using the software QmRLFS-finder that predicts R-loop forming sequences based on structural models of known sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jenjaroenpun et al., 2015</xref>). The fasta input file was generated by extracting DNA sequences based on the hg19 genome version.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>DNAse-seq data and additional ChIP-seq data to characterize wide Pol2 stalling events</title><p>The DNAse-seq peaks were first overlapped with the Pol2 stalling regions detected based on the GRO-seq signal. Only peaks with a score above 15 were considered. The width of the overlapping peaks was then compared to the width of peaks with no overlap using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Next, top 5% widest peaks were obtained from the DNAse-seq and ChIP-seq data (refer to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). The overlap with 5% widest Pol2 stalling regions was subsequently evaluated using the BEDTools fisher tool.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Transcriptome data</title><p>Gene expression data from pre-B-ALL studies was combined from microarray datasets retrieved from the NCBI GEO database as part of a data collection representing both healthy and malignant samples hybridized to hgu133Plus2 genome-wide microarrays (in preparation for submission). In total, 1382 pre-B-ALL samples were included. Probe-level quality control was performed to exclude samples with very high difference in data location or distribution as measured by median and interquartile range of raw probe intensities. Samples that passed this filtering were processed using the RMA probe summarization algorithm with probe mapping to Entrez Gene IDs (from BrainArray version 18.0.0, ENTREZG), followed by bias correction using the R package ‘bias’. The Barnes-Hut-SNE algorithm (computationally faster approximation of t-SNE) implementation from the R package ‘Rtsne’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Krijthe, 2015</xref>) was used to discover near-optimal representation of sample distances in two dimensions (using parameter values perplexity 30 and theta 0.5) using 15% genes with highest variance. The t-SNE method belongs to dimensionality reduction methods that include also traditional methods such as Principal Component Analysis. The main objective of the method is to accurately place highly similar samples (here based on the high-dimensional gene expression profile) to close proximities in lower dimensions. The result can be visualized in two-dimensions as a scatter plot that allows observing sample groups based on the molecular profiles. According to our experience, this method provides better separation between sample groups compared to more traditional methods for large heterogeneous sample collections. To identify whether a given gene was expressed or unexpressed in a sample, a Gaussian finite mixture model (testing equal and variable variance models, best fit chosen by BIC) was fitted by expectation-maximization algorithm to the probe signals (R package ‘mclust’, version 4.3, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fraley and Raftery, 2002</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Statistical tests</title><p>Statistical significance was estimated using several tests to ensure reliability, including tests that rely on assumptions about data distributions and empirical tests that rely on randomization of data points.

This test was used to assess the statistical significance of observing breakpoint events overlapping a transcriptional feature (Pol2 stalling or convT). Success in population was defined using 1 kb windows across the genome. The windows overlapping the studied feature was divided by the total number of 1 kb windows analyzed. E.g. in the Pol2 stalling analysis, the total number of windows overlapping Pol2 stalling regions divided by this number of 1 kb windows within gene coordinates (included to the input for the change point analysis), define probability of success.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13-2"><title>Hypergeometric test</title><p>Test for independent random trials with binary (success/failure) outcome, without replacement. This test was used to assess the statistical significance of observing greater than or equal overlap frequency between breakpoints and an annotated set of genomic regions. E.g. to test for enrichment of breakpoints inside convT-positive enhancers, convT-positive enhancers with breakpoints define sample success; all enhancers with breakpoints population success; and sample taken is all convT-positive enhancers (from the population of all enhancers). The related Fisher’s test (implemented in BEDTools fisher) was used to obtain similar statistics with odds ratios.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13-3"><title>Wilcoxon rank sum test (Mann-Whitney test)</title><p>A nonparametric two-sided Wilcox test was performed to estimate whether two samples (continuous values, unknown distribution) come from the same population (R function wilcox.test).

The sampling was performed 1000-fold within the same genomic context as used in the analysis. To estimate the significance of overlap between stitched breakpoint regions with e.g. convT regions, the stitched regions were allocated random genomic coordinates, thus preserving the size distribution and breakpoint event frequencies within stitched regions. The observed random region overlap was used as the empirical p-value estimate. Further, the z-test was used to evaluate whether there was evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the observed feature overlap value would belong to the empirical distribution obtained.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Ville Hautamäki for comments on signal analysis methods and the EMBL Gene Core sequencing team for the sequencing service provided.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>A series of recent studies demonstrated that genetic diversification during adaptive immune responses of B cells comes with an increased risk of malignant transformation, i.e. when AID, RAG1 and RAG2 target non-immunoglobulin genes. Based on integrative analyses of transcriptional activity (GRO-seq) and genetic lesions (whole genome sequencing), Lohi and colleagues propose a novel scenario to explain how AID and RAG1/RAG2 can be aberrantly targeted to Non-Ig sites and thereby cause genetic lesions that drive malignant transformation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The scenario in Figure 6 is potentially interesting but goes far beyond what is supported by the actual data presented in the study. The Discussion section dilutes the main findings by additional speculation. A more detailed discussion of their actual data (instead of what could be gleaned from hypothetical future experiments) would be helpful. There is a lot of speculation on the Results section and in particular around findings that build up to this mechanism and it is not clear how the data/analysis supports these observations.</p><p>2) The manuscript is of potential interest to a broader audience but mainly written for expert readers in computational biology. To make this work accessible to a wider group of scientists that are potentially interested in the topic, it would seem to be necessary to explain the rationale for the use of certain methods and techniques in some meaningful detail. For instance, the use of t-SNE blots (as for CyTOF) to correlate AID, RAG1 and RAG2 expression with cytogenetic subtypes is of interest, but not discussed what exactly can be seen in the diagrams and why this method was chosen.</p><p>3) Expression of AID and RAG1/RAG2 &quot;markedly distinct between pre-B ALL subtypes&quot;: The measurements were performed in fully established ALL clones. The interpretation that different expression levels of AID and RAG1/RAG2 point to a different role of these enzymes in different cytogenetic subtypes is likely incorrect. As in B cell lymphoma, AID and RAG1/RAG2 act together in a multi-step process of clonal evolution <italic>towards</italic> full transformation. In the fully established leukemia, secondary genetic events and consequences of oncogenic signaling may alter expression levels and obscure the role of AID and RAG1/RAG2 in these leukemia subsets. In addition, the significance of AID and RAG1/RAG2 expression only measured at the mRNA level is unclear. Western blot analyses should be performed if authors feel strongly about documenting different expression levels.</p><p>4) Do the proposed transcriptional features of instability at SV-sites coincide with cryptic RSS or minimal RAG1/RAG2 substrates? This would add to mechanistic plausibility of their scenario.</p><p>5) For the TAD Analysis: Would TAD definition change if a lymphoid origin cell lines or tissue types were used? The authors divide TADS in quartiles on the basis of number of breakpoints within TADs and study how this correlates with% study of convT at these loci. The size range and density of the TADs can vary greatly (T2). The authors should ensure that TAD size does not confound this analysis.</p><p>6) Correlation of 'transcriptional features' such as prevalence of POL2 stalling, DNA sequences that are susceptible to R-LOOP formation and also convergent transcription, with regions that are frequently rearranged in ALL, and in regions with high prevalence of RSS.</p><p>7) Whilst there is a notable enrichment against other active promoters for example the 'width' of the 'stalling' region, although what this really represents, as defined from GRO-seq data, is the high density of active RNA polymerases, so is it possible that these represent regions of active transcription.</p><p>8) With previous reports showing enrichment of genomic rearrangements at active promoters and enhancers it is not clear whether the observations here are a consequence of transcriptional activity in these regions or an enriched mechanism underpinning the regions that are frequently targeted. The authors should present a global analysis – see statistical review section.</p><p>9) A major limitation of the analysis here is that there are not overlapping datasets from the same samples. As the authors have access to direct primary patient cells and cell lines representative of B-ALL their interpretations of the data would significantly benefit from performing RNAseq, POL2 chip, and potentially MNase-seq to support their observations (Pol2 stalling and convergent transcription).</p><p>10) Overall there is a clear narrative issue, the dataset is complex and the analysis is not clear nor comprehensive – making it rather hard for the reviewer and in time a reader to comprehensively evaluate the analytical approaches used, as well as, the evaluate the interpretation of the findings, which often render conclusions as facts by citing other papers rather than being supported by the data in itself. It would be very helpful if the authors included a supplemental figure containing a flow chart describing what datasets where put together and which subsets of data were used for which analysis.</p><p>11) Results should be interpreted on the basis of their analysis. Conclusions that account or include findings from the literature should be placed in the Discussion section.</p><p>12) It would be useful if the authors performed a global analysis- accounting for chromatin segmentation in ALL and considering these features. It would be very interesting to show specifically how the parameters they consider (TAD domains, RNA pol stalling, conv T) correlate with promoters/ active transcription first and then evaluate if these metrics show significant deviations (enrichment) in the areas most widely affected by genomic rearrangement in ALL and how do these differ between frequent breakpoints and rare breakpoints?</p><p>13) Perhaps incorporating metrics that include expression of genes in those regions in B-ALL might strengthen this analysis and provide additional insights into the proposed mechanism. Whilst it may be really difficult to obtain such additional RNA seq data – the authors could consider using gene expression metrics from prior SNP array studies of distinct ALL subtypes.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13087.060</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The scenario in Figure 6 is potentially interesting but goes far beyond what is supported by the actual data presented in the study.

The interpretation that different expression levels of AID and RAG1/RAG2 point to a different role of these enzymes in different cytogenetic subtypes is likely incorrect.

Western blot analyses should be performed if authors feel strongly about documenting different expression levels.</italic></p><p>The reviewer raises an interesting point. The clinical relevance of comparing RNA expression in samples from fully established leukemia (i.e. diagnostic samples) between subtypes, has been addressed and supported with patient data in the earlier work by Swaminathan et. al 2015 Nat Immunol. Specifically, in their Results section Swaminathan et al. write “We correlated AICDA mRNA expression in patients at diagnosis with overall and relapse-free survival. […] Notably, higher-than-median AICDA expression was strongly indicative of poor overall patient survival(P = 0.026; Supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, left [shown using The ECOG E2993 trial that included 215 patients: 106 bone marrow samples and 109 peripheral blood samples]). Likewise, higher-than-median RAG1 mRNA abundance was indicative of shorter relapse-free and overall survival of patients with ALL (Supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, center and right). In a comparison of AICDA mRNA expression in matched sample pairs at diagnosis and relapse, for most patients, AICDA mRNA abundance was increased at relapse (Supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> [shown using 49 patients relapsed after successful initial therapy from COG P9906 trial]). These findings suggested that AICDA expression at diagnosis can be used to predict the outcome of patients with ALL.”</p><p>As these results convincingly show the relevance of mRNA level of RAG and AICDA in clinical context, we did not include the same analysis to this manuscript. Further confirmation on protein level would be important for further elucidating their functional role at the overt disease step, however such study is beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><p>Here, we provide a first comparison of AID and RAG expression across the cytogenetic subtypes of pre-B-ALL and in context of unsupervised clustering of molecular profiles. Our result shows that specific pre-B-ALL cytogenetic subtypes differ in the prevalence of high RAG or high AICDA mRNA expression that has not been studied before. In particular, the finding that high AICDA expression is prevalent in the subtype designated “other” by the cytogenetic profile is novel. Moreover, we also observed that samples belonging to the high risk subtype often had high AICDA expression, providing further confirmation to conclusions presented in the earlier study regarding clinical relevance.</p><p>We have clarified the distinction between the analysis SV sites in context of transcriptional features, and the differences in RAG and AID expression between the subtypes, by placing the expression profile analysis at the end of the manuscript (paragraph starting “To elucidate the potential for RAG and AID mediated genetic instability in leukemia blasts, we compared the expression of the genes RAG1, RAG2 and AICDA across a transcriptome data set”).</p><p><italic>4) Do the proposed transcriptional features of instability at SV-sites coincide with cryptic RSS or minimal RAG1/RAG2 substrates? This would add to mechanistic plausibility of their scenario.</italic></p><p>The distinction between R-breakp and NR-breakp (no RSS or minimal motif match) was perhaps not explicit from our previous Methods description. We have modified the text with a more detailed explanation on how the RSS status was assigned. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> in the previous version compared the overlap of the transcriptional features separately for R-breakp and NR-breakp sites in using the ETV6-RUNX1 data on SV (WGS dataset from Papaemmanuil et al. 2014). These data are now presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> (no RSS vs. RSS/cryptic RSS, respectively, see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref> showing TAD analysis stratified by RSS status), to make the distinction more clear. Further, we extended the analysis by performing the RSS motif search for all breakpoint data used, based on hexameric motifs identified by Papaemmanuil et al. We have included the description in the Methods text and the results were included to Tables <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>.</p><p><italic>5) For the TAD Analysis: Would TAD definition change if a lymphoid origin cell lines or tissue types were used? The authors divide TADS in quartiles on the basis of number of breakpoints within TADs and study how this correlates with% study of convT at these loci. The size range and density of the TADs can vary greatly (T2). The authors should ensure that TAD size does not confound this analysis.</italic></p><p>There appears to be a misunderstanding regarding the division of TADs into quartiles. This division was done based on the number of breakp per bp, i.e. considering the TAD size as indicated in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> legend “The percentage of TAD spanned by convT in pre-B/B-lymphoid cells is summarized as boxplots from TADs divided into quartiles based on number of breakpoints per bp”. The example TADs shown represent TADs with highest absolute number of breakpoints. We apologize for the possible confusion and have clarified this in the text and figure legend.</p><p>To have better consistency across data sources, we repeated the TAD analysis using HiC data from deeply sequenced B-lymphoblastoid cells that recently became available and substituted these results to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> (and relevant supplementary results). The results remained essentially the same, typically slight changes in coordinates occurred at TAD boundaries. Compared to the previous, 65% of B-lineage TADs were similar by size using a strict 95% identity cut-off. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 1</xref> shows the TAD regions from chr1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) as an example: results from pooled data across cell types is shown above and B-lineage data below (the TAD with several breakpoints is the 3rd from left).<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13087.036</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13087.036">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13087.036</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-13087-resp-fig1-v1"/></fig></p><p><italic>6) Correlation of 'transcriptional features' such as prevalence of POL2 stalling, DNA sequences that are susceptible to R-LOOP formation and also convergent transcription, with regions that are frequently rearranged in ALL, and in regions with high prevalence of RSS.</italic></p><p>The referee suggests a valid approach that is very similar to what we have carried out based on enrichment metrics. As the data is essentially discrete (presence/absence of feature or breakpoint counts), we carried out statistical analysis using binomial and hypergeometric tests. In parallel, empirical estimation of random overlap frequency served as an additional confirmation.</p><p>Analysis that stratifies breakpoint sites based on the recurrence (frequent rearrangements in ALL) was presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> for the ETV6-RUNX1 subtype (now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 3 and 4</xref>). Specifically, breakpoints were binned into hotspots using a 1 kb distance. We added new data to confirm that similar results were obtained by considering all WGS datasets included to our study (included to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>). This analysis reveals whether higher overlap with transcriptional features can be found at highly recurrent SV sites. Following the suggestion from the reviewer, we extended the analysis of breakpoint hotspots with analysis of R-loop forming sequences (refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4E</xref>). The RLFS sequence motif alone did not display a strong enrichment trend for recurrent sites. However, we found that convT can contribute to R-loop generation based on DRIP-seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), and that convT overlap was increased at recurrent breakpoints. Although the experimental evidence for R-loops used in our analysis comes from non-B-lineage cells (ES cells), the biochemical mechanism for recruitment of AID or similar complexes binding to R-loops is unlikely to be cell-specific. Overall, our results are consistent with the mechanism proposed for convT/Pol2 stalling mediated AID recruitment in lymphomas (Pavri et al. 2010, Meng et al. 2014, Wang et al. 2014), and we have included experimental and sequence-level motif data to support a mechanistic link between genetic instability and convT and Pol2 stalling. The new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> address the difference between overlap of SV sites carrying RSS-motifs and those lacking them, respectively.</p><p><italic>7) Whilst there is a notable enrichment against other active promoters for example the 'width' of the 'stalling' region, although what this really represents, as defined from GRO-seq data, is the high density of active RNA polymerases, so is it possible that these represent regions of active transcription.</italic></p><p>We thank the referee for raising this important question. A transcript that would have uniform signal in GRO-seq from its TSS to TTS would correspond to a genomic region where the Pol2 elongation rate is uniform. However, this is rarely observed (reviewed in Jonkers and Lis, Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology, 16, 167–177, 2015). A Pol2 stalling region corresponds to elevated signal within an actively transcribed region. As described in the review by Jonkers and Lis, Pol2 has been documented to slow down e.g. at exons (to facilitate splicing), R-loops (difficult structurally to transcribe) and is actively paused at TSS regions (regulated by phosphorylation, this type of pausing typically occurs within the first 50-200 bp). Each of these events are visible as a signal increase in GRO-seq. Our changepoint analysis assigns a relative increase in the signal (cut-off at highest 90%) within a transcribed region as a Pol2 stalling site, which corresponds to local slowing of Pol2. Notice that the signal data is scaled and analyzed separately for different gene regions.</p><p>One important control that we are observing real stalling events is presented in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> (previously in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>): the detected Pol2 stalling events overlap RLFS motifs more often than expected by random. RLFS contribute to the stalling event itself due to slow progression at R-loops. We also show data (now in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) that the presence of RLFS is visible as statistically significant elevation of GRO-seq signal. As additional confirmation, these results were reproduced using B-lineage and ES data (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>As additional experimental data that could assist in interpreting the GRO-seq signal profile, we performed Pol2 ChIP-seq using antibodies against the Ser2 and Ser5 phosphorylated forms. Ser5 phosphorylation is present before the Pol2 is released to active elongation (Zhou et al. 2012). Using a similar analysis of the signal profile to detect Pol2 stalling from the ChIP-seq profile, we found highest overlap of RSS-motif containing SV sites with the Ser5 form, typically considered as the paused/stalled Pol2. However, also locally elevated Ser2 phosphorylated Pol2 has been found to be relevant for genomic instability (Hatchi et al. 2015): in this case the stalling typically occurs at gene ends. We have included new references to literature in the Introduction, Methods and Discussion to assist in interpretation of the signal profiles presented.</p><p>The width of Pol2 stalling was analyzed since displaced nucleosomes in vicinity of Pol2 could enhance access to RSS sites and thereby RAG cleavage events. To support this conclusions, we performed additional analysis (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) to characterize more in detail the stalling regions. DNA accessibility, based on DNAse-seq peaks, was increased at Pol2 stalling sites (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Specifically, we compared peaks from different gene regions, by dividing them based on overlap with Pol2 stalling. Consistently, the peak width and intensity was higher for the peaks overlapping Pol2 stalling. We carried out the analysis with both B-lineage and ES cell data, to support our rationale that the general properties of the Pol2 stalling sites are cell-type-independent (see also comment (9)).</p><p>As an additional control, we correlated the width of Pol2 stalling at the TSS region and the expression level (rpkm within the gene body). There was weak negative correlation, indicating that the vulnerability of TSS with wide stalling is not simply due to higher expression level.</p><p><italic>8) With previous reports showing enrichment of genomic rearrangements at active promoters and enhancers it is not clear whether the observations here are a consequence of transcriptional activity in these regions or an enriched mechanism underpinning the regions that are frequently targeted. The authors should present a global analysis – see statistical review section.</italic></p><p>It appears that a similar concern is raised here as in (7): whether high transcription activity alone explains the overlap. We addressed this question in two ways:</p><p>In the TAD analysis, we performed an additional control where we used the ENCODE chromatin segmentation for defining active promoters and enhancers. Subsequently, we overlapped these regions with convT/Pol2 stalling to obtain a measure for the base pair span i) with convT/Pol2 stalling overlap and ii) without overlap. Next, the% of TADs spanned by each feature type was compared between breakpoint frequency quartiles. There was a consistent increasing trend (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>) for the convT/Pol2 stalling overlapping parts of active promoter and enhancer regions, thus pinpointing the most vulnerable regions.</p><p>We analyzed breakpoint hotspot regions that localize to annotated gene regions. The genes were binned by the transcriptional level to control for the effect of transcriptional activity. Subsequently, the significance of overlap with the transcriptional features was evaluated for the different bins. The result was consistent across a wide range of expression levels and this new data has been included to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>.</p><p>The new analysis results support the conclusion that convT/Pol2 stalling are enriched at regions that are frequently targeted.</p><p><italic>9) A major limitation of the analysis here is that there are not overlapping datasets from the same samples. As the authors have access to direct primary patient cells and cell lines representative of B-ALL their interpretations of the data would significantly benefit from performing RNAseq, POL2 chip, and potentially MNase-seq to support their observations (Pol2 stalling and convergent transcription).</italic></p><p>We have carefully considered this comment and added new experimental validation and supporting data from pre-B-ALL and B-lineage cells. However, we would like to stress that the Pol2 transcription process itself should not fundamentally differ between leukemic and non-leukemic cells. Characteristic and reproducible transcriptional features at specific genomic regions can be identified by comparing samples of different origin. Here, we have identified where Pol2 stalling and convT occurs from pre-B-ALL patient and cell line material that represent several different subtypes, from normal B-lymphoid cells and ES cells. We then related the features detected from B-lineage cells to SV event frequency in pre-B-ALL patients on a genome-wide level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>), while utilizing the ES and B-lineage data jointly to discern what properties of convT and Pol2 stalling regions may leave the DNA vulnerable to SV.</p><p>Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we performed additional Pol2 ChIP-seq data to support the detection of Pol2 stalling events. We also considered MNase-seq but obtaining high enough sequence depth was deemed unfeasible. As an alternative, we tested a ChIP protocol that involves MNase digestion. The signal profile obtained therefore reflects Pol2 enrichment on the background of nucleosome positions. We focused here on the overall signal profile across gene regions (Pol2 stalling detection based on change points) but we make the data available for further analysis that also models the nucleosome positioning. RNA-seq was not included as the signal does not reflect active ongoing transcription (mainly mature RNAs are measured) and is additionally influenced by RNA stability, which would complicate the analysis.</p><p>We have also extended the results evaluating the properties of regions with Pol2 stalling with more data from pre-B-ALL and B-lineage cells (included to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). To address DNA access, we utilized the ENCODE DNAse-seq profiles. Acquiring complementary data from primary ALL cells would represent a significant investment and according to our experience, primary patient material is not available at sufficient amounts to allow performing each assay.</p><p><italic>10) Overall there is a clear narrative issue, the dataset is complex and the analysis is not clear nor comprehensive – making it rather hard for the reviewer and in time a reader to comprehensively evaluate the analytical approaches used, as well as, the evaluate the interpretation of the findings, which often render conclusions as facts by citing other papers rather than being supported by the data in itself. It would be very helpful if the authors included a supplemental figure containing a flow chart describing what datasets where put together and which subsets of data were used for which analysis.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestions how to improve the manuscript. We have reorganized the manuscript and modified <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> to highlight the main datasets and added a new supplementary figure to illustrate the data integration approach more in detail (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). To clarify the interpretations, we have made a more clear separation between the Results and Discussion sections.</p><p><italic>11) Results should be interpreted on the basis of their analysis. Conclusions that account or include findings from the literature should be placed in the Discussion section.</italic></p><p>We have re-organized the Results and Discussion text to address this.</p><p><italic>12) It would be useful if the authors performed a global analysis- accounting for chromatin segmentation in ALL and considering these features. It would be very interesting to show specifically how the parameters they consider (TAD domains, RNA pol stalling, conv T) correlate with promoters/ active transcription first and then evaluate if these metrics show significant deviations (enrichment) in the areas most widely affected by genomic rearrangement in ALL and how do these differ between frequent breakpoints and rare breakpoints?</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggested use of chromatin segmentation data and inclusion of additional results to further support the relevance of transcriptional activity. We added a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) that compares the expression median level of genes within TADs (using the pre-B-ALL transcriptome data) between TADs binned by breakpoint frequency.</p><p>Next, we utilized the chromatin segmentation generated by the ENCODE consortium that is based on a large collection of ChIP-seq data from B-lymphoblastoid cells (unfortunately a similar segmentation is not available directly from ALL cells). Similar as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, we compared their span within TADs sorted by breakpoint frequency (included in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). These analyses confirmed that TADs with high number of breakpoints have more overlap with chromatin segments representing active transcription (including active promoters), supporting a transcription-coupled mechanism for the observed genetic instability.</p><p>Subsequently, we analyzed whether the convT/Pol2 stalling had relevance as a specific feature within active promoters and enhancers defined by the chromatin segmentation. These results are presented as an additional figure supplement to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>). The presence of convT/Pol2 stalling was an important determinant for the promoter and enhancer enrichment within TADs that contain most breakpoints.</p><p>We deemed these two approaches appropriate to address first the relevance of transcription and then to distinguish the specific contribution of convT/Pol2 stalling. Correlating convT/Pol2 stalling with active transcription is not meaningful as, by definition, these transcriptional features occur within areas of active transcription. We correlated the width of Pol2 stalling at the TSS region with the expression level of the transcript. Comparison of frequent and rare breakpoints is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3E, F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4D and E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>.</p><p><italic>13) Perhaps incorporating metrics that include expression of genes in those regions in B-ALL might strengthen this analysis and provide additional insights into the proposed mechanism. Whilst it may be really difficult to obtain such additional RNA seq data – the authors could consider using gene expression metrics from prior SNP array studies of distinct ALL subtypes.</italic> </p><p>Adding expression metrics from pre-B-ALL is an excellent suggestion. By “those regions” we understand the reviewer refers to TADs and chromatin segmentation data. We analyzed expression within TADs by calculating the median and maximum expression level in pre-B-ALL cells for the co-localized genes. To this end, we utilized the 1382 patient transcriptomes available in our integrated dataset across pre-B-ALL studies (these expression metrics are included in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). As a second measure, we used the total GRO-seq read count per TAD. A new figure has been added to show how the activity of transcription increases in the TADs with highest breakpoint frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), supporting a transcription-coupled mechanism. We have further provided a new control that shows the% of transcribed region spanned by convT/Pol2 stalling (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). This result confirmed that the enrichments we see are not just a reflection of total transcriptional activity. We also binned genes by their transcription level for the analysis of recurrent breakpoints, similarly to control for the effect of transcription (new <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>).</p><p>The new analysis results support the conclusion that convT/Pol2 stalling are enriched properties of regions that are frequently targeted.</p></body></sub-article></article>
