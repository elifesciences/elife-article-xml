gene encoding the A20 protein. Diagnosis of HA20 is challenging due to its heterogeneous clinical presentation and the lack of pathognomonic symptoms. While the pathogenic effect of <italic>TNFAIP3</italic> truncating variations is clearly established, that of missense variations is difficult to determine. Herein, we identified a novel <italic>TNFAIP3</italic> variation, p.(Leu236Pro), located in the A20 ovarian tumor (OTU) domain and demonstrated its pathogenicity. In the patients’ primary cells, we observed reduced A20 levels. Protein destabilization was predicted in silico for A20_Leu236Pro and enhanced proteasomal degradation was confirmed in vitro through a flow cytometry-based functional assay. By applying this approach to the study of another missense variant, A20_Leu275Pro, for which no functional characterization has been performed to date, we showed that this variant also undergoes enhanced proteasomal degradation. Moreover, we showed a disrupted ability of A20_Leu236Pro to inhibit the NF-κB pathway and to deubiquitinate its substrate TRAF6. Structural modeling revealed that two residues involved in OTU pathogenic missense variations (i.e. Glu192Lys and Cys243Tyr) establish common interactions with Leu236. Interpretation of newly identified missense variations is challenging, requiring, as illustrated here, functional demonstration of their pathogenicity. Together with functional studies, in silico structure analysis is a valuable approach that allowed us (i) to provide a mechanistic explanation for the haploinsufficiency resulting from missense variations and (ii) to unveil a region within the OTU domain critical for A20 function.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>A20 haploinsufficiency</kwd><kwd>A20</kwd><kwd>TNFAIP3</kwd><kwd>missense variation</kwd><kwd>pathogenic significance</kwd><kwd>proteasomal degradation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>00552404</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Louvrier</surname><given-names>Camille</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-17-CE17-0021-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Amselem</surname><given-names>Serge</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>779295</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Amselem</surname><given-names>Serge</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Sorbonne Université</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Émergence PhenomAID</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Giurgea</surname><given-names>Irina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Enhanced proteasomal degradation of TNFAIP3 proteins carrying missense variations is one of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying HA20.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The zinc finger (ZnF) protein A20 is a ubiquitin-editing enzyme encoded by the <italic>TNFAIP3</italic> (<italic>tumor necrosis factor a-induced protein 3</italic>) gene that contains an amino-terminal ovarian tumor (OTU) domain followed by seven ZnF domains. Due to its E3 ligase activity (ZnF4), its deubiquitinase function (OTU) and its ubiquitin-binding domain (ZnF7), A20 regulates the fate of several substrates such as RIPK1 (receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1), NEMO (NF-kappa-B essential modulator), and TRAF6 (TNF receptor-associated factor 6), all converging to the canonical NF-κB pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boone et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">De et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Tokunaga et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Wertz et al., 2004</xref>). Owing to these various functions, A20 plays a pivotal role in the regulation of inflammation and immunity by inhibiting the canonical NF-κB signaling pathway and by preventing cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lork et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Martens and van Loo, 2020</xref>). Abnormal expression or function of A20 therefore contributes to the onset of several autoimmune or inflammatory disorders such as Crohn’s disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes mellitus, psoriasis, and atherosclerosis as shown by genome-wide association studies (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Malynn and Ma, 2019</xref>). Furthermore, germline variations in <italic>TNFAIP3</italic> lead to an autoinflammatory disease of autosomal dominant inheritance referred to as A20 haploinsufficiency (HA20; MIM#616744), where insufficient suppression of NF-κB activity is observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>). HA20 is a Behçet-like autoinflammatory syndrome of early onset associated with variable clinical signs. The hallmark features of HA20 are recurrent fever, painful oral, genital and/or gastrointestinal ulcers with diarrhea, arthralgia, or polyarthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aeschlimann and Laxer, 2019</xref>). Since the first description of HA20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>), more than 25 <italic>TNFAIP3</italic> truncating variations have been reported (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Yu et al., 2020</xref>) whereas the pathogenic significance has been confirmed for only a part of the 12 reported missense variations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aslani et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Jiang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kadowaki et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mulhern et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Niwano et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Shigemura et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Tian et al., 2022</xref>). Indeed, a body of genetic and experimental evidence is necessary to determine non-ambiguously the deleterious character of missense variations.</p><p>In this study, we report a non-previously described <italic>TNFAIP3</italic> missense variation, c.707T&gt;C, p.(Leu236Pro), identified in three patients from the same family. We provide a phenotypic description of all affected patients, as well as cytokine and A20 level quantification in patient-derived samples. Furthermore, we assessed the pathogenicity of this variant, as well as that of previously reported <italic>TNFAIP3</italic> missense variations, through in vitro molecular and cellular assays. Notably, by studying the location and the intra-molecular amino acid interactions of Leu236 with the other amino acids involved in pathogenic <italic>TNFAIP3</italic> missense variations, we identified a critical region within the OTU domain of A20 where the pathogenic <italic>TNFAIP3</italic> missense variations are in close proximity and where the affected residues share common amino acid interactions on the 3D protein structure.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Clinical features of HA20 patients</title><p>Proband II.2, a 13-year-old female patient born to a consanguineous union (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), first experienced autoinflammatory symptoms when she was 15 months of age. She presented with recurrent episodes of fever as well as oral ulcers occurring once every 2 weeks. She suffered from abdominal pain and diarrhea during childhood. She presented with asymmetric arthralgia of large joints and persistent folliculitis. Genital ulcers were very rare. Her sister (individual II.1) was 15 years of age. Her first symptoms, which appeared at the age of 5, included recurrent episodes of fever, persistent oral ulcers, and rare genital ulcers. She also suffered from abdominal pain and diarrhea during childhood. Her skin lesions were acne and folliculitis. Their father (individual I.1) was 38 years of age. His first symptoms, which appeared at the age of 15, included episodes of fever, oral, and genital ulcers occurring once every 2 weeks. He suffered from abdominal pain with diarrhea twice per year and colonic ulcerations were detected at colonoscopy. He also presented with myalgia and arthralgia of the knees or ankles. His skin lesions included folliculitis. He suffered from episcleritis and uveitis at two occasions. Individuals II.1 and II.2 show significant improvement of their symptoms upon colchicine treatment. Individual I.1 received colchicine treatment and then tapered courses of oral corticosteroids and azathioprine, leading to a satisfactory long-term control of the disease.

It revealed a non-previously reported heterozygous variation c.707T&gt;C, p.(Leu236Pro) in the <italic>TNFAIP3</italic> gene. Noteworthy, in this patient born to a consanguineous union, no mutation was found in the following genes known to be involved in autosomal recessive autoinflammatory diseases: <italic>ADA2, IL10, IL10RA, IL10RB, IL1RN, IL36RN, IL6ST, LACC1, LPIN2, MEFV, MVK, NLRP1, OTULIN,</italic> and <italic>TRNT1</italic>. Sanger sequencing confirmed the <italic>TNFAIP3</italic> c.707T&gt;C, p.(Leu236Pro) variation in the proband and identified this variation in the related affected individuals (I.1 and II.1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). According to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines to assess the pathogenicity of sequencing variations, the c.707T&gt;C, p.(Leu236Pro) variation is of uncertain significance.

assessed the expression and stability of the A20_Leu236Pro protein in HEK293T cells transiently expressing A20_WT or A20_Leu236Pro. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, the steady-state protein amounts of A20_Leu236Pro were only 47.6% of that of the WT protein (0.54 for A20_WT vs 0.26 for A20_Leu236Pro). To determine if this difference resulted from protein instability, we compared the half-life of each protein upon inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide in HEK293T cells. Quantification of protein amounts at different time points showed that the half-life of A20_Leu236Pro was 2.8 hr, whereas the A20_WT protein was still highly expressed even after 24 hr of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This substantial reduction of the protein half-life shows that A20_Leu236Pro is less stable than its WT counterpart. To test whether this reduced stability was associated with abnormal protein degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), we inhibited the proteasome-dependent degradation with the peptide-aldehyde inhibitor MG132 in HEK293T cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, substantial accumulation of A20_Leu236Pro was observed upon inhibition of the proteasome up to 91.3% of the WT protein levels (2.52 for A20_WT vs 2.30 for A20_Leu236Pro). This strongly suggests that the difference of the amounts of WT and Leu236Pro A20 proteins in non-treated cells results from enhanced UPS-dependent degradation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Decreased inhibition of NF-κB activity by the A20_Leu236Pro protein</title><p>Given the role of A20 in the regulation of the NF-κB activity, we assessed the impact of the p.(Leu236Pro) variation on the ability of A20 to inhibit the canonical NF-κB pathway. To this end, we transiently transfected HEK293T cells with an empty vector, A20_WT or A20_Leu236Pro encoding plasmids along with NF-κB reporter vector and Renilla vector for normalization, and then quantified the luminescence signal upon TNFα treatment (10 ng/mL, 5 hr). Compared to an empty vector, A20_WT exhibited up to eightfold decrease of the NF-κB activity in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). A20_Leu236Pro failed to suppress TNFα-induced NF-κB activity up to the levels of the WT counterpart: at 25 ng, A20_Leu236Pro decreased the NF-κB activity only by two folds compared to the empty vector. Moreover, despite doubling the doses of A20_Leu236Pro (50 ng), the level of NF-κB inhibition observed upon A20_WT expression was not reached (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Decreased deubiquitination activity of the A20_Leu236Pro protein</title><p>To investigate whether the A20_Leu236Pro still retained its deubiquitinase (DUB) function, we co-expressed A20_WT or A20_Leu236Pro with K63-linked ubiquitin and the A20 target TRAF6, then evaluated the ubiquitination state of TRAF6. This co-immunoprecipitation experiment revealed an increased intensity of the high molecular weight ubiquitin aggregate smear of TRAF6 in the presence of A20_Leu236Pro compared to the WT condition, thus indicating an altered DUB activity of A20_Leu236Pro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Review of all previously reported <italic>TNFAIP3</italic> missense variations</title><p>To better assess the impact of the localization of <italic>TNFAIP3</italic> missense variations on A20 protein function, we reviewed all missense variations reported to date that are shared with the scientific community as original articles or conference abstracts, including the variation herein identified (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).

To date, no functional study has been carried out for the A20_Leu275Pro variant, but since it is a de novo variation, absent from gnomAD, with a high CADD score (31) and involving a highly conserved residue across species, it meets ACMG criteria for pathogenicity. The remaining missense variations located in the OTU domain, p.(Asn102Ser), p.(Thr129Met), and p.(Ile310Thr), cannot be classified as pathogenic according to ACMG criteria. In fact, the p.(Asn102Ser) variation has an allele frequency in the general population gnomAD database of 3482/281824 (0.01236), which is incompatible with the rare occurrence of HA20; we therefore classified this variation as non-pathogenic despite the potential localization of Asn102 residue within a pocket in the active site of A20 that is important for its DUB activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Komander and Barford, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lin et al., 2008</xref>). The p.(Thr129Met) variation can be considered as a variation of uncertain significance as the Thr129 residue is only partially conserved and no functional assays support its pathogenic significance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aslani et al., 2022</xref>). As for the p.(Ile310Thr) variation, it was qualified by the authors of uncertain significance due to the lack of evolutionary conservation of the affected amino acid together with the absence of functional alteration of the variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kadowaki et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>Among the six <italic>TNFAIP3</italic> missense variations located outside the OTU domain, only the p.(Thr602Ser) variation can be considered as pathogenic according to ACMG criteria. The variations p.(Val377Met), p.(Met476Ile), and p.(Ala547Thr) are considered of uncertain significance as no in vitro functional test was performed to assess their pathogenicity. The allele frequency of p.(Thr647Pro) in gnomAD is 511/282864 and the individuals carrying this variation lack HA20 hallmark clinical features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mulhern et al., 2019</xref>), we therefore considered it as likely benign (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). As for the p.(Gln709Arg) variation, it is considered as likely benign by the authors due to the lack of evolutionary conservation of Gln709 and the absence of protein function alteration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kadowaki et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Functional validation of in silico protein destabilization prediction of different A20 missense variants</title><p>In order to test whether <italic>TNFAIP3</italic> missense variations other than the p.(Leu236Pro) variant exhibit enhanced proteasomal degradation, we sought to quantify the levels of several recombinant A20 variant proteins, upon MG132-induced proteasome inhibition. For this purpose, we took advantage of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) tag present in the <italic>TNFAIP3</italic> constructs to sort the cells by flow cytometry and quantify the intensity of the GFP signal in cells treated with MG132 or DMSO as negative control. For this analysis, in addition to A20_WT and A20_Leu236Pro, we included the likely pathogenic p.(Leu275Pro) variant, described in Aslani et al. because the in silico PremPS tool predicted a high destabilizing effect of the variation (ΔΔG=1.80 kcal/mol – <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>) and Leu275Pro protein expression has not been assessed to date. As positive control, we used the construct coding for the A20_Leu277* truncated protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>) which should be recognized by the protein quality control as a misfolded protein. We also chose to include the p.(Asn102Ser) variant, previously suggested to lead to HA20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2020a</xref>), while keeping in mind that it is frequent in the control populations (allele frequency of 0.01236 if considering all populations and of 0.06389 in the Latino population according with gnomAD) and has a low destabilizing predicted effect (ΔΔG=0.78 kcal/mol – <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). As negative control, we chose the polymorphic variant p.(Phe127Cys) (allele frequency = 0.0617 in gnomAD). Fluorescence intensity increased for A20_Leu236Pro, A20_Leu275Pro and the positive control A20_Leu277*, indicating that like Leu236Pro, the Leu275Pro variant exhibits enhanced proteasomal degradation (curve shifted to the right in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> upper panel and increased fluorescence intensity in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> lower panel). This observation is specific to pathogenic variants as no fluorescence intensity shift was observed for the non-pathogenic p.(Phe127Cys) variant nor for the p.(Asn102Ser) variant in the presence of MG132. This latter result, which demonstrates the absence of enhanced proteosomal degradation of the A20_Asn102Ser protein, confirms the classification of this variant as non-pathogenic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Flow cytometry quantification of green fluorescent protein (GFP) intensity in protein extracts from HEK293T cells expressing GFP-tagged A20_WT or A20 variants treated with DMSO or MG132 (20 μM – 5 hr).</title><p>Representative fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) profiles (counts versus FLH-1 – CyflowCube 6) are shown and the mean fluorescence values from A20 samples ± SEM are represented in the histograms (n=3).

To address this hypothesis, we first used the PremPS prediction tool to model the interactions established by each of these residues within the WT protein and to predict the impact of each variation on these interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B, C and D</xref>). Additionally, we sought to identify overlapping interaction alterations between these four variations. This analysis revealed common interactions between Leu236, Glu192, and Cys243, but not with Leu275. We therefore focused the amino acid interactions analysis on residues Glu192, Leu236, and Cys243 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–G</xref>). In A20_WT, Leu236 establishes several hydrogen and/or polar bonds as well as hydrophobic interactions with the surrounding residues; some of these interactions are altered in A20_Leu236Pro, for example, interactions with Phe197, Asn201, and Tyr306 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Modified interactions are also observed in A20_Glu192Lys where Lys192 establishes additional interactions with Leu171 and Met174 compared to Glu192 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) and particularly in A20_Cys243Tyr where the phenol group of Tyr243 induces substantial change of amino acid interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Furthermore, when comparing the alterations of amino acid interactions caused by both p.(Leu236Pro) and p.(Glu192Lys), we observe that more robust interactions exist between Pro236 and the cycle of Phe197 as compared to the Leu236 in the WT counterpart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and E</xref>); these altered interactions could impact those established between Phe197 and surrounding residues, notably in the region 194–196 that are close to and interact with Glu192 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5E and F</xref>). As for the comparison of the disruptions induced by p.(Leu236Pro) and p.(Cys243Tyr), we first observe that the interactions with residues Asn201 and Tyr306 are lost in A20_Leu236Pro as compared to A20_WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and E</xref>) and that interestingly, both Asn201 and Tyr306 do not interact with the WT Cys243 but with variant Tyr243 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). Similarly, Trp238 that interacts with Leu236 or Pro236 can establish interactions with Tyr243 but not the WT Cys243 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B, D and E</xref>). Lastly, since the amino acid in position 235 is a proline, the p.(Leu236Pro) variation results in two consecutive proline residues, which is uncommonly encountered in proteins compared to singlet prolines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Morgan and Rubenstein, 2013</xref>) and could hinder proper interactions in this region. For instance, the proper interaction established between Cys243 and Pro235 could be altered by the presence of a proline residue in position 236 as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Localization and interactions of amino acids involved in A20 variants.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Amino acids Leu236 (red), Glu192 (orange), and Cys243 (purple) are placed on the crystal structure of the ovarian tumor (OTU) domain of A20 using the 3zjd crystal available of PDB and PyMol software.

The non-ambiguous pathogenic significance of <italic>TNFAIP3</italic> variations is necessary for the confirmation of HA20 diagnosis and adaptation of the clinical care. While in the case of <italic>TNFAIP3</italic> nonsense or frameshift variations the deleterious impact is most often established, the pathogenic effect of missense variations is difficult to determine.</p><p>Herein, we studied a family in which three patients had a disease phenotype compatible with the diagnosis of HA20 and in whom we identified a novel <italic>TNFAIP3</italic> missense variation, the c.707T&gt;C, p.(Leu236Pro) variation. In the current work, we provide solid proof for the pathogenicity of this variation through an in-depth study relying on the analysis of the clinical and biological features of the patients, the intrafamilial segregation of the variation with the disease, the absence of occurrence of the identified variation in the general population, the conservation of the affected residue, and most importantly, on the functional evaluation of the variant through a combination of different assays: expression and stability of the variant protein, study of its ability to inhibit the NF-κB pathway and of its deubiquitination activity. By assessing, through dedicated in silico and in vitro assays, the pathogenicity of other missense variations located in the OTU domain of A20 and that fulfill the same criteria, we identified a critical region in the OTU domain in which residues involved in pathogenic missense variations establish common interactions.</p><p>The clinical features and the cytokine profile of the patients presented in our study are in line with those exhibited by previously reported HA20 patients. Indeed, elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the plasma and supernatants of LPS-stimulated PBMCs of the patients presented in our study resemble that of previously reported patients harboring <italic>TNFAIP3</italic> pathogenic truncating variations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Rajamäki et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>). Accordingly, the patients reported herein exhibit typical HA20 phenotypic features: early-onset, recurrent fever, articular symptoms, recurrent oral, genital and/or gastrointestinal manifestations. Nevertheless, HA20 clinical manifestations can vary considerably among patients even among those who carry the same variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aeschlimann and Laxer, 2019</xref>). Depending on disease severity, colchicine treatment, corticosteroids, or cytokine antagonists can be required for HA20 treatment. Colchicine treatment was satisfactory for the control of the symptoms of individuals II.1 and II.2, suggesting a less severe disease presentation, whereas corticosteroids and azathioprine were required for individual I.1. The difference in disease severity observed in these patients cannot be attributed to the missense nature of the variation. In fact, other HA20 patients carrying pathogenic missense variations were shown to be resistant to colchicine and required steroid therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kadowaki et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Shigemura et al., 2016</xref>). Disease management of the patients reported in our study did not require cytokine antagonists. Nevertheless, in light of the elevated IL6 levels in PBMCs supernatant prior to LPS stimulation, the use of IL6 antagonist for the control of the patients’ symptoms could be of therapeutic interest in case the patients develop resistance to their current treatments, as previously reported for the treatment of two HA20 patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lawless et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Further findings supporting the pathogenic significance of the p.(Leu236Pro) variation include enhanced UPS-dependent degradation of the A20_Leu236Pro protein, which is most likely responsible for the HA20 observed in the patients’ PBMCs. We show that this abnormally enhanced degradation is also observed for another missense variant (p.(Leu275Pro), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aslani et al., 2022</xref>) for which functional assays have not been reported yet. Interestingly, the in silico tools predicted high destabilizing effects for both A20_Leu236Pro and A20_Leu275Pro. Altogether, the flow cytometry-based functional assay, in combination with the in silico approach, identifies enhanced recognition by the protein quality control machinery and thus increased degradation as one of the mechanisms explaining the pathogenicity of TNFAIP3 missense variants. Our study thus provides a valuable approach that can be used for assessing newly identified missense variations.</p><p>Moreover, our experiments indicate that, in addition to reduced levels of the variant protein, the function of A20_Leu236Pro is altered. Indeed, in an attempt to bypass the decreased protein expression in vitro, we doubled the amounts of mutant A20 plasmid used for transfection in the NF-κB luciferase assay. Although this allowed for an increased inhibition of the canonical NF-κB pathway, the inhibitory function of A20_Leu236Pro was not restored up to the levels of the WT protein. Interestingly, such functional deregulation has also been observed for the pathogenic p.(Cys243Tyr) and p.(Glu192Lys) variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kadowaki et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Shigemura et al., 2016</xref>): a 10-fold protein expression increase was required to compensate the loss-of-function of the p.(Cys243Tyr) variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Shigemura et al., 2016</xref>). As for the p.(Glu192Lys) variant, it does not exhibit reduced expression compared to the WT protein but it loses the ability to sufficiently inhibit the NF-κB pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kadowaki et al., 2021</xref>), in line with its location at the putative ubiquitin-binding site of A20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lin et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The consequences on the native structure of A20 of the three pathogenic missense variations of the OTU domain (p.(Leu236Pro), p.(Glu192Lys), and p.(Cys243Tyr)) converge. Although Glu192 and Cys243 are distant, Leu236 bridges the interactions between the two regions they belong to on the tertiary structure of A20. Moreover, p.(Leu236Pro) and p.(Cys243Tyr) have common consequences on interactions established by surrounding amino acids such as Asn201, Pro235, Trp238, and Tyr306, suggesting a putative importance of these residues for proper protein expression and/or function.</p><p>The OTU domain of A20 harbors the active site essential for the DUB activity of A20, which encompasses the catalytic Cys103, His256, and a third residue for which Asp70 or Thr97 are possible candidates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Komander and Barford, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lin et al., 2008</xref>). Study of the crystal structure of the A20 OTU domain shows that the ubiquitin-binding site of A20 may require the surface formed by α-helices (α4, α7, and α8) and β sheets (β2, β3, β4, and β5) and the loops between them; Glu192 is among the surface residues identified in the ubiquitin-binding region, whereas Leu236 and Cys243 are in the loop between β3 and β4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lin et al., 2008</xref>). Ubiquitin binding requires interactions between hydrophobic residues of ubiquitin and hydrophobic A20 amino acid, making Leu236 a very suitable candidate for surface amino acids in the ubiquitin-binding domain. Overall, the HA20-causing missense variations in the OTU domain, which alter the proper function and/or expression of the protein, are located in a critical region outside the DUB active site but close to the ubiquitin-binding domain.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In the present study, we analyzed a family with three patients presenting with a phenotype reminiscent of HA20 in whom we identified the p.(Leu236Pro) missense variation in the <italic>TNFAIP3</italic> gene that segregates with the disease. We provide evidence from patient-derived samples for the HA20, as well as cellular evidence for the increased proteasomal degradation and the loss-of-function effect induced by this variation. By studying the pathogenic missense <italic>TNFAIP3</italic> variations located in the OTU domain of the protein, we shed the light on a non-previously identified pathogenic missense variation-containing region. Our data can help in the interpretation of <italic>TNFAIP3</italic> missense variations and, in turn, in providing an adapted clinical care for the patients.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Affected and healthy individuals</title><p>Clinical features were collected through a standardized form.

functional significance of missense variants in the TNFAIP3 gene encoding A20. Haploinsufficiency of A20 (HA20) is a dominantly inherited disease resulting from monoallelic loss-of-function mutations, while the contribution of novel/rare missense variations is unclear, and they are classified as variants of unknown significance (VUS). The authors developed a new flow cytometry functional assay that other laboratories can adapt to evaluate the pathogenicity of A20 VUSs.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81280.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Aksentijevich</surname><given-names>Ivona</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00baak391</institution-id><institution>National Human Genome Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Schwartz</surname><given-names>Daniella</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01an3r305</institution-id><institution>University of Pittsburgh</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.07.29.502017">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.29.502017v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Carla Rothlin as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Daniella Schwartz (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The three reviewers and the guest reviewing editor agreed that the authors need to do additional experiments to support their conclusions on the effect of the novel p.L236P and other HA20-associated missense variants on protein function:</p><p>1. The authors should demonstrate using in vitro Ub-binding experiments in transfected cells that the mutant L236P protein fails to bind Ub proteins. Alternatively, the DUB activity of the mutant protein could be tested both in vitro and in the patient's primary cells.</p><p>2.

In order to test whether TNFAIP3 missense variations other than the p.(Leu236Pro) variant exhibit enhanced proteasomal degradation, we sought to quantify the levels of several A20 proteins, each protein carrying different reported missense variations upon MG132-induced proteasome inhibition in HEK293T cells. For this purpose, we took advantage of the GFP tag present in the TNFAIP3 constructs to sort the cells by flow cytometry and quantify the intensity of the GFP fluorescent signal in cells treated with MG132 or DMSO as negative control. For this analysis, in addition to A20_WT and A20_Leu236Pro, we included the likely pathogenic Leu275Pro variant, described in Aslani et al. (Aslani et al., 2022) because the in silico PremPS tool predicted a high destabilizing effect of the variation (ΔΔG = 1.80 kcal mol-1 – Table 2) and Leu275Pro protein expression has not been assessed to date. As a positive control for the experiment, we used the construct coding for A20_Leu277* truncated protein (Zhou et al., 2016) which should be recognized by the protein quality control as a misfolded protein. We also chose to include the p.(Asn102Ser) variant, previously suggested to lead to HA20 (Yu Chen et al., 2020). This variant is, however, frequent in the control populations (allele frequency of 0.01236 if considering all populations and of 0.06389 in the Latino population according with gnomAD) and has a low destabilizing predicted effect (ΔΔG = 0.78 kcal mol-1 – Table 2). As a negative control, we chose the polymorphic variant p.(Phe127Cys) (allele frequency = 0.0617 in gnomAD). Fluorescence intensity increased for A20_Leu236Pro, A20_Leu275Pro and the positive control A20_Leu277*, indicating that like A20_Leu236Pro, the A20_Leu275Pro variant exhibits enhanced proteasomal degradation (curve shifted to the right in Figure 4 upper panel and increased fluorescence intensity in Figure 4 lower panel). This observation is specific to pathogenic variants as no fluorescence intensity shift was observed for the non-pathogenic A20_Phe127Cys variant nor for the A20_Asn102Ser variant. Indeed, these results demonstrated the absence of enhanced proteosomal degradation of the A20_Asn102Ser protein allowing to classify this variant as non-pathogenic (Figure 4).</p><p>These results have now been added to Results section (lines 217 to 240).

Together, these results called for further investigation of the stability and the degradation of the mutant protein. Therefore, we assessed the stability of the protein by determining its half-life upon protein synthesis inhibition with cycloheximide and we evaluated its degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system upon proteasome inhibition with MG132. Overall, these experiments converge towards the targeting of the mutant protein to degradation by the protein quality control system due to its inability to achieve the native state. We hope reviewer #1 finds them convincing as we were unfortunately not able to conduct direct proteins folding assays as they require biophysical expertise or radiolabeling experiments that we do not have access to in our facilities.</p><p>As requested for other OTU domain mutants, we have now included the stability prediction for all OTU-domain variants (Table 2) as well as proteasome-degradation assessing for 3 other OTU-domain variants.

Indeed, proteins that are unable to achieve the native state – due to a missense variation for instance – are recognized as misfolded and subsequently targeted to degradation. This protein quality control system is composed of molecular chaperones and the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS). For proteins transiting through the endoplasmic reticulum (like A20), several chaperones recognize misfolded proteins and help their retention in the endoplasmic reticulum, allowing only correctly folded proteins to reach the cytosol. Misfolded proteins are instead ubiquitinated by E3 ligases and targeted to degradation by the proteasome.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

This functional assay, in combination with a dedicated in silico approach, identifies the enhanced recognition of the mutated proteins by the protein quality control machinery and thus the increased degradation as one of the mechanisms explaining the pathogenicity of TNFAIP3 missense variants.
