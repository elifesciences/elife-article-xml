identify the neural circuit mechanisms that underlie persistent activity and contribute to long-lasting changes in behavior. Here, we show that a subset of Doublesex+ pC1 neurons in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> female brain, called pC1d/e, can drive minutes-long changes in female behavior in the presence of males. Using automated reconstruction of a volume electron microscopic (EM) image of the female brain, we map all inputs and outputs to both pC1d and pC1e. This reveals strong recurrent connectivity between, in particular, pC1d/e neurons and a specific subset of Fruitless+ neurons called aIPg. We additionally find that pC1d/e activation drives long-lasting persistent neural activity in brain areas and cells overlapping with the pC1d/e neural network, including both Doublesex+ and Fruitless+ neurons. Our work thus links minutes-long persistent changes in behavior with persistent neural activity and recurrent circuit architecture in the female brain.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Long-term mental states such as arousal and mood variations rely on persistent changes in the activity of certain neural circuits which have been difficult to identify. For instance, in male fruit flies, the activation of a particular circuit containing ‘P1 neurons’ can escalate aggressive and mating behaviors. However, less is known about the neural networks that underlie arousal in female flies. A group of female-specific, ‘pC1 neurons’ similar to P1 neurons could play this role, but it was unclear whether it could drive lasting changes in female fly behavior.</p><p>To investigate this question, Deutsch et al. stimulated or shut down pC1 circuits in female flies, and then recorded the insects’ interactions with male flies. Stimulation was accomplished using optogenetics, a technique which allows researchers to precisely control the activity of specially modified light-sensitive neurons.</p><p>Silencing pC1 neurons in female flies diminished their interest in male partners and their suitor’s courtship songs. Activating these neural circuits made the females more receptive to males; it also triggered long-lasting aggressive behaviors not typically observed in virgin females, such as shoving and chasing.</p><p>Deutsch et al. then identified the brain cells that pC1 neurons connect to, discovering that these neurons are part of an interconnected circuit also formed of aIPg neurons – a population of fly brain cells that shows sex differences and is linked to female aggression. The brains of females were then imaged as pC1 neurons were switched on, revealing a persistent activity which outlasted the activation in circuits containing both pC1 and aIPg neurons. Thus, these results link neural circuit architecture to long lasting changes in neural activity, and ultimately, in behavior. Future experiments can build on these results to determine how this circuit is activated during natural social interactions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>internal state</kwd><kwd>neural circuits</kwd><kwd>courtship</kwd><kwd>social interaction</kwd><kwd>connectomics</kwd><kwd>neural imaging</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RF1 MH117815-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murthy</surname><given-names>Mala</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS104899</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murthy</surname><given-names>Mala</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Faculty Scholar</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murthy</surname><given-names>Mala</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A set of sexually dimorphic neurons in female flies is part of a recurrent neural network and drives minutes-long persistent neural activity and persistent social behaviors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Social behaviors are known to be affected by persistent internal states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Berridge, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lorenz and Leyhausen, 1973</xref>). These states correspond with levels of arousal or drive, and can impact whether and how individuals interact, with consequences for mating decisions and reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chen and Hong, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kennedy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Stowers and Liberles, 2016</xref>). The neural mechanisms underlying arousal states remain largely unknown.</p><p>In male flies, a small population of male-specific neurons (P1) that express the sex-specific transcription factors Fruitless and Doublesex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Auer and Benton, 2016</xref>), drive both male-aggression and male-mating behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hoopfer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Koganezawa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">von Philipsborn et al., 2011</xref>). Brief optogenetic activation of P1 neurons drives both persistent song production in solitary males and persistent aggression upon introduction of another male, both over minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bath et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hoopfer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Inagaki et al., 2014</xref>). While P1 activation is sufficient for eliciting the persistent behavioral phenotypes, other groups of neurons, such as pCd (also called pC3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rideout et al., 2010</xref>]), are involved in maintaining the persistent state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jung et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>) - these neurons are not synaptically coupled to P1, and the circuit architecture that mediates persistence remains unresolved. P1 neurons also receive dopaminergic input that affects mating drive over longer timescales of hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting neuromodulation is also important for persistent changes in behavior driven by P1. Work on P1 in flies bears some similarity to work in mice. In male mice, optogenetic activation of SF1 (steroidogenic factor 1) expressing neurons in the dorsomedial part of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHdm<sup>SF1</sup>) drive multiple defensive behaviors that outlast the stimulation by up to 1 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kunwar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, activity of VMHdm<sup>SF1</sup> neurons can persist for over a minute following the presentation of a fear stimulus. Computational modeling work suggests a mix of recurrent circuitry and neuromodulation underlie the persistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kennedy et al., 2020</xref>), but this has not yet been tested.</p><p>We know little about the persistence of social behaviors in females across taxa. P1 neurons are a subset of the larger Doublesex+ pC1 neural subset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kimura et al., 2008</xref>). While <italic>Drosophila</italic> females lack P1 neurons, they have Doublesex+ pC1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rideout et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Robinett et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>), including a subset that are female-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wu et al., 2019</xref>). Activation of pC1 neurons affects receptivity toward males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wang et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>), drives chasing of males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rezával et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wu et al., 2019</xref>), and aggressive behaviors toward females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Palavicino-Maggio et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schretter et al., 2020</xref>). These data suggest that female pC1 neurons can drive an arousal state, similar to male P1 neurons, but whether female pC1 neurons can drive <italic>persistent</italic> changes in behavior and <italic>persistent</italic> neural activity, has not yet been investigated. Importantly, a complete electron microscopic volume is currently available for the entire adult female brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>), making it possible to link brain activity to complete wiring diagrams in females. Direct measurements of synaptic connectivity can determine whether recurrent neural networks, known to be important for persistent neural activity lasting for seconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aksay et al., 2007</xref>), also underlie minutes-long persistent activity and changes in behavior, as has been recently proposed for male mice and flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jung et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kennedy et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Here, we show that pC1 activation drives persistent changes in female behavior for minutes following stimulus offset, and we identify the subset of pC1 neurons (called pC1d/e [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wang et al., 2020a</xref>]; also referred to as pC1-Alpha [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wu et al., 2019</xref>]) that affects the persistent aggressive and male-like behaviors. A companion study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schretter et al., 2020</xref> demonstrates that pC1d, but not pC1e, drives female aggressive behaviors. By leveraging the automated segmentation of an electron microscopic volume of the female brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Dorkenwald et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>), we map all inputs and outputs of both pC1d and pC1e and find a strong recurrent neural network with Fruitless+ aIPg neurons. Using pan-neuronal calcium imaging, we find that pC1d/e activation can elicit persistent activity for minutes among multiple cell types. The persistent activity is present in Doublesex+ and Fruitless+ neurons, including pC1 neurons themselves. We thus link minutes-long persistent neural activity and behavior with reciprocal connectivity in the female brain.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Female pC1 activation persistently modulates both female receptivity and song responses</title><p>To investigate the neural basis of a persistent internal state in the female brain, we focused on pC1 neurons, one of eight Doublesex-expressing cell types in the central brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kimura et al., 2015</xref>). We used an intersection between two driver lines (Dsx-GAL4 and R71G01-LexA, hereafter referred to as pC1-Int; see Fly genotype table for list of genotypes used in this study), to label pC1 neurons, as done previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rezával et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>) – prior work shows this line labels, per hemisphere, ~6 neurons, all of which project to the lateral junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). We tracked male and female body parts (head and thorax) in addition to recording all sounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>; see Materials and methods for details on song segmentation and tracking of flies on a non-homogenous background).

We activated pC1-Int in a solitary virgin female for 5 min, followed by a variable delay period, after which a virgin male was introduced to examine female behaviors in the context of courtship (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) - there was no optogenetic activation following the first 5 min. The activity of stimulated neurons should decay during the variable delay period (d0 (0 min delay), d3 (3 min delay), or d6 (6 min delay)) – below, we test this explicitly with neural imaging, and also examine shorter activation periods. This paradigm therefore allowed us to examine the effects of differing levels of persistent activity on behavior.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>pC1-Int activation has a persistent effect on female receptivity and responses to male courtship song.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Dsx+ neurons in the female central brain.

Control flies shared the same genotype but were not fed ATR. We found that activation of pC1-Int neurons induces a persistent effect on female receptivity and responses to male song, but that this effect diminishes with a delay period between neural activation and introduction of a male. pC1-Int-activated females copulated significantly faster than controls in the d0 condition, with reduced copulations following a delay between optogenetic activation and introduction of a male (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).

Five of the clusters describe behaviors that are the same or reduced following pC1-Int activation (clusters 1 and 3, male chasing female, and 5–7, increased male-female distance). Two clusters, however, describe behaviors that occur with higher probability following pC1-Int activation (clusters 2 and 4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Cluster 2 is characterized by small fmAngle and small mfAngle (indicating that the male and female are facing each other), decreased male-female distance, and large fmFV (indicating that the female is close to the male and moving in his direction).

This analysis confirmed that the amount of female shoving and chasing was greatest in the d3 condition relative to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), in addition to revealing that the duration of female chasing and shoving bouts was longer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). In many cases females transitioned directly between shoving and chasing, and the conditioned probability (transition probability, given that a transition occurred) for shoving →chasing was more than double at the d3 condition compared to the d0 and d6 conditions. By examining shoving and chasing probabilities over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), following the introduction of a male (t = 0), we found that both behaviors persisted for as long as 30 min in the d3 condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), but not in the d0 and d6 conditions, suggesting a complex interaction between neural activity in the female brain at the time of introduction of the male and feedback or social cues. While the percent of time females spent shoving or chasing in the first two minutes after the male was introduced was similar in the d0 and d3 conditions (19.7/21.3% for shoving, 2.8/3.1% for chasing), shoving and chasing probabilities rose over time in the d3, but not in the d0 condition. In the d6 condition, shoving probability was comparable to the probability in the d0-d3 conditions in the first two minutes (15%), but decayed to control level after 6 min. The transition into ‘chasing’ from ‘shoving’ or from ‘other’ (no shoving and no chasing) epochs also peaked at d3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). In all cases, we only examined female behaviors prior to copulation. We also activated another Dsx+ cell type, pCd1, which is part of a circuit that drives persistent behavior in the male brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jung et al., 2020</xref>), but observed neither shoving nor chasing following 5 min of pCd1 activation in females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). This suggests that the persistent behavioral effects we observe are specific to pC1 activation.</p><p>Manual inspection of the videos identified several additional behaviors produced by females following pC1-Int activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). These include ‘female approaching’, ‘circling’, ‘head-butting’, and ‘female wing extension’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A–D</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Videos 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">3</xref>).

Our automated behavioral classifier did not find these behaviors because we only tracked the head and thorax of each fly, which did not provide enough information to automatically identify these behaviors, or to keep accurate track of identities during behaviors in which the male and female often overlap (e.g., during ‘circling’).</p><media id="video3" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-59502-video3.mp4"><label>Video 3.</label><caption><title>Multiple example behaviors: female approaching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>), shoving and circling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>), female headbutting and female mounting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C</xref>).</title><p>Following female approaching in this example, there is a short epoch of circling.

In the female headbutting example, the female extends two wings while headbutting the male, followed by a male jump.

Circling and headbutting examples are from pC1-Int (d0) condition, and female approaching/mounting from pC1-Int (d3) condition.</p></caption></media><p>In sum, we found that for minutes following pC1-Int activation, females produced a variety of behaviors directed at the male. Some of these appear aggressive, such as shoving and head-butting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nilsen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Palavicino-Maggio et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schretter et al., 2020</xref>), while others resemble male courtship behaviors, such as chasing and unilateral wing extension (albeit without song). These behaviors typically peaked in the d3 condition, where they remained high after male introduction. In contrast, the effect on female receptivity and female responses to male song, were both strongest in the d0 condition, ruling out the possibility that the effect on female receptivity is an indirect consequence of modified male courtship behavior in response to changes in female behaviors. Below we identify the pC1 cell types that drive persistent shoving and chasing, determine that they are part of a recurrent neural network using a new EM connectomic resource, and demonstrate that they can drive persistent neural activity on timescales similar to behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>pC1 cell types</title><p>We propose three possible circuit configurations to explain our behavioral results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In the first configuration, the same set of pC1 neurons activate different downstream circuits, each one controlling a different behavior. The differences in the temporal dynamics arise downstream of pC1. In the second configuration, three non-overlapping subsets of pC1 neurons control the different behaviors. In the third configuration, one pC1 subset controls female receptivity (that peaks at d0), and another set controls chasing and shoving (both peaking at d3). The second and third models assume some functional heterogeneity in the pC1 population. To evaluate these circuit models, we examined the behavioral consequences of activating distinct subsets of pC1 neurons. To define pC1 cell types, we used automated reconstruction of neurons in an EM volume of a female brain (FAFB; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>); neuron segmentation and reconstruction were accomplished using a novel platform for visualization and proofreading called FlyWire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Dorkenwald et al., 2020</xref>).

In the hemibrain v1.1, we found additional cells that match (morphologically) neurons we term aIPg-a and aIPg-c – these neurons are called SMP555/556 and SMP558, respectively.</p><p>Finally, in FlyWire, we found that pC1d forms connections with other Dsx+ cells, including direct connections with pMN1 (DNp13) and pMN2 (vpoDN) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>), other pC1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>), and pC2-like cells with similar morphology to Fru+ pIP5 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">Video 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

ROIs from response types 1–4 per animal were registered to an in vivo intersex atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pacheco et al., 2021</xref>) to generate probability density maps across animals per brain voxel (each voxel is 0.75 × 0.75 × 1 µm<sup>3</sup>). Activity maps are maximum-projected along the anterior-posterior axis, and overlaid onto the brain template, color coded by the fraction of flies showing activity at each voxel (ranging from 30% to 100%). We considered a voxel to consistently have a particular response type if active in over 30% of flies.

Activation of pC1d/e neurons (in line pC1-A) drove persistent activity (response type 2) in more than 30% of the imaged flies, and in 24.7 times more voxels than in controls, and 6.8 times more voxels compared with pC1-S activation. Making use of neuropil segmentation of an in vivo brain atlas to which all ROIs were registered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pacheco et al., 2021</xref>), we evaluated the distribution of pC1d/e-elicited activity by brain neuropil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ito et al., 2014</xref>). Persistent activity (response type 2) was clustered in the posterior-dorsal portion of the brain spanning the Superior Medial, Lateral and Intermediate Protocerebrum (SMP, SLP, SIP), the Anterior Optic Tubercle (AOTU), and the Inferior and Superior Clamp (ICL and SCL; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>); these brain regions contain a large number of projections from sexually dimorphic neurons expressing either Doublesex or Fruitless (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rideout et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yu et al., 2010</xref>). We found that 61% (4717/7759) of all the presynaptic terminals and 85% (3283/3848) of all the postsynaptic terminals for the group of 11 aIPg1-3 (all share the aIPg-b morphology) cells in hemibrain v1.1 are in these six areas, with the SMP, SIP, and AOTU being the most dominant input and output regions for the aIPg1-3 cells.</p><p>Our behavioral results indicated that female brain state must differ between the d0, d3, and d6 conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–C</xref>) – we therefore quantified neural activity at these specific time points (0, 3 min, and 6 min) following optogenetic activation. In the neuropils with highest activity, we found that responses were highest immediately following stimulation (t = 0) and decayed significantly by t = 3 min, and further still by t = 6 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>In order to measure the overlap of pC1-elicited activity with Dsx+ neurons, we generated anatomical labels for the lateral protocerebral complex (LPC), a diffuse brain area to which all Dsx+ neurons send their projections, and also for all major groups of Dsx+ somas (pC1, pC2l, pCd1, and pCd2) within the in vivo brain atlas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>, see Materials and methods). We found that ROIs with persistent activity (response type 2) overlap with the LPC, in addition to the regions occupied by pC1 somas, and to a lesser extent with regions occupied by pC2, pCd1, and pCd2 somas, suggesting that Dsx+ pC1 neurons carry persistent activity. We also looked for overlap between ROIs with persistent activity and the projections of individual aIPg neurons, all registered into the same reference brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>; see Materials and methods). While persistent activity (response type 2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D–E</xref>) spans only 4.3% of the central brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>; see Materials and methods), we found response type 2 activity in 20.14% (union of the overlap) of the voxels that include aIPg-a/b/c example cell (one of each type) from FlyWire (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). In addition, activity driven by 5 min of activation was not aberrant. DF/F values following 5 min optogenetic activation (data from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) fell within the distribution of DF/F values observed in separate experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pacheco et al., 2021</xref>) in which activity was driven by auditory stimuli rather than optogenetic activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>We also examined persistent activity following a shorter activation period of 2 min, and found ROIs with persistent activity (response Type 2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I–J</xref>).

We found persistent activity in two group of cells, denoted as ‘Group 1’ and ‘Group 2’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>, bottom), that often lasted over a minute following activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D–E</xref>) – ROIs drawn manually for individual cells within each group. By comparing the location of Fru+ cell bodies with persistent activity with the position of single Fru+ cells and to the location of pC1/pC2/aIPg cells in FlyWire (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). We conclude that Group 2 includes pC1 neurons, while Group 1 likely includes pC2/pIP5 neurons and possibly also aIP-g cells. The persistent activity is most likely not in Dsx+/Fru+ pC2 neurons given our observations that Dsx+ pC2 cells do not show persistent activity following pC1d/e activation, but could be in pIP-e (also called pIP5 in the hemibrain). This is consistent with our analysis in FlyWire, showing that pIP5 is both pre- and post-synaptic to pC1d.</p><p>In sum, our pan-neuronal imaging reveals that female brain state is different at 0 and 3 min following activation, providing an explanation for the differences in behaviors produced following introduction of a male at these different delays. In addition, by clustering response types, we were able to map pC1d/e-driven persistent neural activity to brain regions containing both Dsx+ neurons and Fru+ aIPg neurons, and with follow-up experiments showed that several Dsx+ pC1 neurons as well as Fru+ putative pC1 and aIPg cells contain persistent neural activity. This is consistent with the recurrent circuit architecture we found using EM reconstruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We find that pC1 neurons drive a persistent internal state in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> female brain that modulates multiple behaviors over timescales of minutes (receptivity, responses to male courtship song, aggressive behaviors, and male-like courtship behaviors [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>]). The behavioral effects we observe may be similar to the effects of ‘emotion states’ observed in other animals, such as mice, fish, and primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson and Adolphs, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kunwar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Posner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Russell, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Woods et al., 2014</xref>). In general, effects on behavior of such emotion states are thought to scale with levels of persistent neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hoopfer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). We found that neural activity decays during a delay period following stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>) and that behavioral effects of activation were also different following different delays. Specifically, we found that the highest levels of pC1 activation enhance receptivity but have an opposing effect on responses to male song (speeding females up instead of slowing them down). Slightly lower levels of pC1 activation (following a delay) bias females toward aggression and male-like behaviors. These effects on behavior may not naturally co-occur, but our optogenetic activation paradigm uncovers the scalable relationship between activation of different pC1 subtypes, their individual levels of activity, and distinct behavioral programs.</p><p>Our study also provides new insight into the neural mechanisms that contribute to changes in state on timescales of minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). We used pan-neuronal imaging with registration to map responses that continue following pC1 optogenetic activation (previously, this technique had only been used to map sensory activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pacheco et al., 2021</xref>] and spontaneous activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mann et al., 2017</xref>]). We found that activation of pC1d/e neurons drives robust persistent neural activity throughout the posterior dorsal regions of the central brain (known to contain the processes of sexually dimorphic neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cachero et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kimura et al., 2015</xref>], and overlapping with the Fru+ aIP-g neurons we identified as reciprocally connected with pC1d/e), lasting for minutes following activation. This is consistent with our behavioral observations - females still show elevated shoving and chasing even following a 6-min delay between optogenetic activation and the introduction of a male fly. Importantly, whether or not pC1 neurons themselves carry persistent neural activity has been debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Inagaki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jung et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we find that in females, Dsx+ pC1 neurons, as well as multiple Fru+ neurons, including putative pC1 and aIPg cells, do indeed carry persistent neural activity in response to our activation protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>pC1 neurons drive both aggression and receptivity in <italic>Drosophila</italic> females</title><p>We used unsupervised methods to identify the most prominent behaviors (beyond receptivity and responses to courtship song) produced <italic>following</italic> activation of pC1 neurons in virgin females - these include behaviors that resemble male courtship (female chasing the male) and aggression (female shoving the male) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Both behaviors are not typically observed in mature virgin females interacting with a male; this suggests that sensory cues from the virgin male do not inhibit these aberrant behaviors, but rather may enhance the persistent effects of pC1 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), most likely via visual inputs to aIPg neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schretter et al., 2020</xref>). pC1 neurons also drive aggressive behaviors toward females during stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Palavicino-Maggio et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schretter et al., 2020</xref>), but whether the quality of aggression generated toward males versus females is similar remains to be determined. As one of our manually scored behaviors, ‘female approaching’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>), begins from a distance greater than four body lengths from the male fly (a distance at which it may be difficult to discern male from female [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Borst, 2009</xref>]) and often ends with shoving or circling (see <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>), we hypothesize that pC1 activation most likely drives persistent behaviors toward another fly, and not specifically a male or female fly, consistent with (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schretter et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>What is the role of female aggression? Female aggression, whether toward males or females, has been previously reported across model systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Huhman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Stockley and Bro-Jørgensen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Woodley et al., 2000</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, female-female fights over food source are strongly stimulated by the receipt of sperm at mating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bath et al., 2017</xref>), and include both patterns that are common with male aggression (such as shoving and fencing) and female-only patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nilsen et al., 2004</xref>). Female-male aggression was reported in the context of rejecting behavior in mated, immature, or older females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Cook and Connolly, 1973</xref>). The behavioral changes in our study do not mimic those in a mated female, as we also observe that pC1 activation drives enhanced receptivity. Although we have not confirmed which pC1 cell types control receptivity, our work reveals a separation: pC1d/e neurons are sufficient to drive persistent shoving/chasing, but do not have a persistent effect on female receptivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>), while separate pC1 neurons that control receptivity modulate the pathways that control chasing and aggression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–I</xref>). Recent work reveals that pC1a neurons are modulated by the sex peptide receptor pathway, such that following mating (when sex peptide is transferred), pC1a neurons are inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wang et al., 2020b</xref>). Because we find that pC1a provides direct input to pC1d and pC1e neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, Table 1; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schretter et al., 2020</xref>), we speculate that pC1a provides this receptivity information. Interestingly, work in male flies suggests a separation in pC1 subsets that control courtship versus aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Koganezawa et al., 2016</xref>), with reciprocal inhibitory influences between persistent courtship and aggression, following pC1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hoopfer et al., 2015</xref>). Although the phenotypes are sex-specific (male singing vs female receptivity; male tussling vs female shoving), and the pC1 subsets driving these behaviors are sex-specific (P1 in males, pC1d/e in females), this suggests some common architecture. Ultimately, comparing the connectomes of male and female brains, combined with functional studies, should elucidate both similarities and differences.</p><p>Because courtship interactions unfold over many minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Coen et al., 2014</xref>), we postulate that the changes in brain state we observed following pC1d/e activation may occur naturally as females receive continual drive to pC1 neurons. Our connectomic analyses reveal inputs to pC1d/e neurons from AVLP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). The AVLP contains multiple auditory cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baker et al., 2020</xref>) - this is consistent with our patch clamp recordings of pC1d/e neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), showing auditory activity, and also with prior work on auditory responses in female, but not in male pC1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Deutsch et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, during natural courtship interactions, male song should drive pC1d/e neurons – in combination with other inputs, this may shift behaviors from receptive ones toward chasing and shoving.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Recurrent circuitry and persistent neural activity</title><p>FlyWire enabled a systematic search for all the synaptic partners of a single pC1d and pC1e cell. Using manual and automatic synapse detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Buhmann et al., 2019</xref>), we found that pC1d is reciprocally connected with aIPg-b and aIPg-c cells and that aIPg-b and aIPg-c cells are also interconnected – pC1e also shows reciprocal connectivity with aIPg-b neurons. We also identified pC1d and aIPg-c cells in a separate EM volume of an adult female brain, the hemibrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Scheffer et al., 2020</xref>), and found similar results (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schretter et al., 2020</xref> for a thorough analysis of the pC1d connectome in the hemibrain). Because FlyWire is based on the FAFB dataset of the entire adult female brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>), our search for synaptic partners of pC1d and pC1e could completely cover both hemispheres, showing that, for example, pC1d is reciprocally connected to itself in the contralateral hemisphere, and is presynaptic to some contralateral aIPg cells. Comparisons between connectivity diagrams in the two female EM volumes of FAFB (segmented in FlyWire) and the hemibrain will continue to be of value for future studies.</p><p>Synaptically recurrent neural networks have been proposed to contribute to persistent neural activity lasting for seconds, and to underlie processes like accumulation of evidence and working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aksay et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barak and Tsodyks, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Major and Tank, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mante et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Seung, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wang, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zylberberg and Strowbridge, 2017</xref>). For example, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, recurrent excitatory loops in the ellipsoid body of the central complex contribute to stabilization of a heading navigation signal over timescales of seconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Turner-Evans et al., 2020</xref>). Internal states underlying social behaviors, however, persist on much longer timescales of minutes to hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chen and Hong, 2018</xref>). Neuromodulation, via hormones or peptides, is thought to support longer timescales of persistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adolphs and Anderson, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bargmann, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Marder, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zelikowsky et al., 2018</xref>). Our work now links a strongly recurrent neural network (pC1d/e to aIPg) to both minutes-long persistent neural activity and minutes-long changes in behavior. Work from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schretter et al., 2020</xref> demonstrates that pC1d, pC1e, and aIPg neurons are all cholinergic, suggesting these neurons make up an excitatory neural network. While our study found persistent changes in behavior following pC1d/e activation, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schretter et al., 2020</xref> study did not – this discrepancy could arise from a number of methodological reasons, including differences in the optogenetic activator, timescale of activation, or in behavioral protocols. Nonetheless, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schretter et al., 2020</xref> demonstrate that aIPg-b activation drives persistent female aggression following activation, and that increasing stimulation of aIPg-b, increases the amount of persistent aggression. This is consistent with a model in which strong activation of pC1d/e neurons recruits aIPg-b neurons (via their excitatory interconnections) to drive, at least, persistent shoving.</p><p>Work in male flies has proposed a recurrent circuit motif including pCd neurons that contributes to persistent aggressive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jung et al., 2020</xref>) or even longer term changes in mating drive (driven by male-specific P1 neurons, but without mapping the synaptic connections). Our studies of pCd, revealed that, in females, it does not contribute to the persistent arousal state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), nor is it persistently active following pC1d/e activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). In males, activating P1 neurons for 5 s was enough to induce some persistent activity in pCd cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jung et al., 2020</xref>). We did not measure neural responses to pC1d/e stimulation shorter than 2 min, and so whether shorter activation periods drive some persistent neural activity in females remains open. While pC1d/e neurons are female-specific, aIPg neurons are present in both males and females – it will be interesting to determine what role the aIPg neurons play in male brains and whether they represent a shared component of persistence in the two sexes.</p><p>Finally, it is important to point out that recent EM connectomic work in <italic>Drosophila</italic> using FAFB (via manual tracing) has revealed a number of recurrent or reciprocal circuits throughout the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dolan et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sayin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Turner-Evans et al., 2020</xref>). Half of the outputs of pC1d are the aIPg neurons, and many of these neurons (several aIPg-b and aIPg-c cells) are strong inputs. Our identification of a recurrent circuit motif containing pC1d links it to the persistent neural activity and changes in behavior we observe following activation, especially in Fru+ somas. This is an important first step toward determining how recurrent neural networks contribute to such long timescales of persistence.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">NM91</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Coen et al., 2014</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td>A gift from <break/>Peter Andolfatto</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Dsx-Gal4 (III)</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rideout et al., 2010</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td>A gift from <break/>Stephen Goodwin</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Dsx-LexA::P65 (III)</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhou et al., 2015</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td>A gift from <break/>Bruce Baker</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>UAS-2xEGFP (II)</td><td/><td>BDSC: 6874;

Control flies were raised on regular fly food after eclosion. Both experimental and control female flies used for optogenetic experiments, were reared post-eclosion in dark blue acrylic boxes (acrylic available from McMaster-Carr, #8505K92).</p><p>The full details on genotypes for the flies used in this study and their source are in Key resources table and in Fly genotype table.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Behavioral experiments</title><p>All behavioral experiments were carried out using a behavioral chamber (diameter ~25 mm) tiled with 16 microphones (NR23158, Knowles Electronics; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">3</xref>), and connected to a custom amplifier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arthur et al., 2013</xref>). Audio signals were recorded at 10 KHz, and the fly song was segmented as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arthur et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Coen et al., 2014</xref>). A point gray camera (FL3-U3-13Y3M; 1280 × 960) was used to record fly behavior from a top view (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, S1A) at 60 frames per second using custom written software in Python and saved as compressed videos (H.264). Virgin females (see Fly genotype table for genotype used in each experiment) and wild-type NM91 virgin males (both males and females were 3–7 days old) were used for all behavioral experiments. For inactivation experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), a male and a female were introduced into the behavioral chamber simultaneously. For activation experiments, a female was positioned in the behavioral chamber, and red light (a ring of 6 LEDs, 627 nm, LuxeonStar) was then delivered at 1.1 mw/mm<sup>2</sup> (±5% across the chamber) at 100 Hz (50% duty cycle) for 5 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) or for 2 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>). Following stimulus offset, a male was introduced with either no delay (d0), or after a 3 or 6 min delay (d3, d6). We collected data from the time the male was introduced (t = 0) until 30 min or when the flies copulated, whichever came first. We chose to use ReachR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Inagaki et al., 2014</xref>) for activation experiments rather than using the more sensitive red shifted channelrhodopsin csChrimson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Klapoetke et al., 2014</xref>) to minimize optogenetic activation due to background light. The percent of flies that copulated as a function of time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>) was calculated from the time the male was introduced (t = 0) and until t = 30 min.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Tracking centroids and headings</title><p>Each video frame was analyzed by first finding the fly centroid, then detecting the location of the thorax and head which formed the heading vector for each fly. Having microphones at the chamber bottom results in a highly inhomogeneous background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) posing a major challenge for accurate tracking.</p><p>The centroid was found in one of two ways that yielded similar results. In the first method, the inhomogeneous background of the video was found by taking the median across all frames. Because the animals move throughout the video, finding the median pixel usually does not contain any pixels containing an animal’s body. However, as animals occasionally sit for long periods, they can become part of the background. To avoid this, we divided the video into 10 shorter videos of equal length and found the median 'frame' (median set of pixel values) for each sub-video. We then created a median frame by computing the median across these medians. Each video frame then had this background subtracted to identify pixels that were potentially part of each fly. These pixels were smoothed by a series of operations using the OpenCV Python package and then thresholded. Using OpenCV, we identified all contours surrounding collections of pixels and any smaller or larger than some predefined threshold (less than half the size of a typical ‘fly’ or more than twice its size) were discarded. The remaining pixels were then clustered via k-means. The number of clusters were iteratively increased until the compactness of each cluster reached some threshold. The least-compact clusters were discarded, and the remaining pixels were clustered again with k-means with k = 2 to identify the two clusters corresponding to the animals. These clusters were then fit with an ellipse to identify the centroid of each animal. In the second method, we trained a deep convolutional network to detect all instances of individual body parts (head, thorax) within each frame using a modified version of LEAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pereira et al., 2019</xref>, or SLEAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pereira et al., 2020</xref>] <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sleap.ai/">https://sleap.ai/</ext-link>; 544 labeled frames were used for training; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1Ai-ii</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Using the same software and neural network architecture, a separate network was then trained to group these detections together with the correct animals by inferring part affinity fields (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1Aiii</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cao et al., 2017</xref>). This enabled estimation of the vector that represents fly heading for both flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1Aiv</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Linear classification of single frames</title><p>Seventeen parameters were extracted for each frame based on the tracking of male and female centroid and heading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), describing either the female movements (fFV – female forward velocity; fLS – female lateral speed; fFA/fLA – female forward/lateral acceleration; fRS – female rotational speed), male movements (similar to female movements – mFV/mLS/mFA/mLA/mRS), or male-female interaction (mfDist – male-female distance; fmAngle – female heading relative to the female-male axis, mfAngle – male heading relative to male-female axis; fmFV or fmLS – female speed in the male direction or in the perpendicular axis; mfFV or mfLS – male speed in the female direction or perpendicular). Using 17 parameters for each frame, we trained binary support vector machine (SVM) linear classifiers to find the parameters (dimensions) that best separate the groups. We first trained classifiers that separate between frames that belong to experimental flies (class 1, pC1-Int activated, either one condition - d0/d3/d6 or all groups together, d0-d6), and controls (class 2). We trained 90 classifiers, randomly choosing a set of 3000 frames from each class (‘training set’; non-overlapping - the same frame was never used in two classifiers; increasing the number of frames beyond 3000 did not increase performance). We used the MATLAB R2019b procedure <italic>fitcsvm</italic> (MathWorks, Natick, MA), with a linear kernel. We then used a separate set of 30,000 frames per class for each classifier (‘validation set; the same frame was never used twice, either between classifiers or between sets) to test the performance of each classifier (fraction of frames correctly classified). We then choose the 30 best-performing classifiers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> for control vs d0-d6). We used a third set of frames for each classifier (30,000 frames/class, again – with no overlap with other sets) to measure the performance of each classifier. The MATLAB function <italic>predict</italic> was used to find the SVM-predicted class for each frame in the validation or train set. Performance was calculated as the percent of frames correctly classified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). For each weight (out of the 17; control vs d0-d6), we looked at the distribution coming from the 30 independent classifiers, and tested whether the mean was significantly different than zero (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>We used a two-sample t-test to measure the probability that the mean weight associated with each parameter is different from zero (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We found 8 out of the 17 parameters to be highly significant (*p&lt;0.0001).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Clustering behaviors based on single frames</title><p>The eight most significant parameters found by the SVM classifier (see previous section) were used for classification. We took the same number of frames from each group (control/d0/d3/d6) - 357,997 frames (99.4 min) per group, corresponding to the number of frames in the smallest group (d6). We repeated the clustering 30 times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, black dots), each time selecting 99.4 min of data from each one of the other groups (d0, d3, d6, control) randomly (with replacements – the same frame could be used in multiple repeats), therefore having &gt;1.4 million frames for clustering on each repeat. The sets are not independent (overlapping frames between repeats) and no statistical test was performed over the repeats. After z-scoring each parameter (over all the frames in a given repeat), k-means clustering was performed (using MATLAB function <italic>kmeans</italic>), allowing 20 clusters and a maximum of 500 iterations (other parameters set to default). We found that the first seven largest clusters (cluster size being the number of frames in the cluster) capture 90.4% of the frames, averaged over repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, inset). To match clusters between repeats (for each cluster number in repeat 1, find the corresponding cluster number in repeats 2–30), we used the smallest distance between clusters, by calculating the mean square error over the weights (the variability in weight size across repeats is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Machine-learning-based classification of behavioral epochs</title><p>The Janelia Automatic Animal Behavior Annotator (JAABA; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jaaba.sourceforge.net/">http://jaaba.sourceforge.net/</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kabra et al., 2013</xref>) was used to detect epochs of ‘female shoving’ and ‘female chasing’. Two independent classifiers (‘shoving classifier’, ‘chasing classifier’) were trained, one for each behavior. We used the automatic segmentations to find examples for shoving and chasing epochs, used as a first step in training each classifier. We then added example epochs (positive and negative examples are used for each classifier), in an iterative manner (using examples where the classifiers made wrong predictions). Altogether we used 24,222 frames (6.7 min) to train the ‘shoving classifier’, and 11,941 frames (3.3 min) for the ‘chasing classifier’.</p><p>The classifiers were based on the 17 parameters defined above (denoted as ‘per-frame’ features), as well as on ‘window features’ (‘mean’, ‘min’, ‘max’, ‘change’, ‘std’, ‘diff_neighbor_mean’, ‘diff_neighbor_min’, ‘diff_neighbor_max’, ‘zscore_neighbors’ with a window radius of 10 and default ‘windows parameters’), therefore taking into account longer timescales for classification, rather than the single frames we used for SVM classification and k-means clustering (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref> for comparison). We cross validated each classifier before applying the classification on all the data, using the cross-validation procedure available in JAABA package (with default parameters). A total of 94.2% of the frames annotated by the user as shoving were correctly classified as shoving, while 92.8% of the frames annotated as no-shoving were classified as no-shoving. For the ‘chasing classifier’, we got 96% and 90.8% success in classifying chasing and no-chasing. The trained shoving classifier was used to annotate each frame as belonging or not belonging to ‘female shoving’ epoch, and the trained chasing classifier was used independently to classify each frame as belonging or not-belonging to a ‘female chasing’ epoch. The same classifiers were used for all experimental conditions (5 min or 2 min activation duration, d0/d3/d6 delay conditions).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Manual tracking annotation of behaviors</title><p>We annotated a subset of the data manually (pC1-Int, d0-d6), to confirm our automatic behavior detection, as well as in search for more rare events, or events that are not captured due to tracking issues. Three behaviors were annotated by two observers: female shoving, female chasing and circling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A–C</xref>). The two observers annotated different sets of movies, while a small subset (n = 5 movies) were annotated by the two observers and we confirmed that both detected three behaviors (shoving, chasing, circling) similarly. Female circling was not detected by our automated procedures for two reasons. First, during circling male and female bodies often overlap, causing large errors in heading detection. Second, these events are relatively sparse. One observer also detected three other rare behaviors: head butting, female mounting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>) and wing extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3D–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA) procedures, and corrected for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni correction when appropriate. The details on the statistical test used are listed under the Results section and the Figure legends. Black lines between two groups indicate a statistically significant difference between the groups after multiple comparison correction, while a red line indicates that the difference is statistically significant only when multiple comparisons test is not used. To test for significant differences in copulation rate, we used Cox’s proportional hazards regression model, using the MATLAB procedure <italic>coxphfit</italic>. ‘Censoring’ was used to account for the fact that some flies copulated within the 30 min time window (after which the experiment was terminated), while others did not. The correlation between female velocity and male song (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,G</xref>) was done as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Clemens et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, female absolute speed and male song were averaged over 1 min windows. In each window, we calculated the mean value of female (absolute) speed, bout amount (the total amount of song in the window), bout number (the number of song bouts in the window), and bout duration (the mean bout duration in the window). Then, for each condition, we calculated the correlation between female speed and male song by pooling all windows for a given group together. The MATLAB procedure <italic>corr</italic> was used to calculate the Pearson correlation, and one way analysis of covariance (ANOCOVA) was used to compare the slopes (x,y being the male song and the female speed) between groups using aoctool (MATLAB). The 30 SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifiers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>) were trained using non-overlapping sets of frames and are therefore considered independent. One-sample t-test was used to calculate a test decision for the null hypothesis that the 30 weight values (for a given parameter) come from a normal distribution with a mean of zero (and unknown variance). For each parameter, -log(P) is shown, and a vertical dashed indicates p&lt;10<sup>−4</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Immunostaining</title><p>Flies were dissected in S2 insect medium (Sigma #S0146).

After eight washed (20 min each) in PBT, brains were placed on a slide (Fisher Scientific #12-550-15), between two zero numbered coverslips used as spacers (Fisher Scientific 12-540B) and under a coverslip (Fisher Scientific #12-542B), and Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) was applied. Nail polish was used to seal around the center coverslip edges, and brains were stored in dark at 4°C overnight to harden, before imaging. See Key Resources Table for the list of antibodies used in this study. Imaging was done using a Leica confocal microscope (TCS SP8 X). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> was modified from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Deutsch et al., 2019</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Identification and proofreading of neurons in FlyWire</title><p>Neurons in a complete EM volume of an adult female brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>) were automatically reconstructed in FlyWire (flywire.ai, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Dorkenwald et al., 2020</xref>]). Within FlyWire, we first searched for reconstructed segments that match the morphology of known pC1 cells. We used anatomical landmarks to find the bundle that projects dorsally from pC1 cells bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, red arrow). We then looked at two cross-sections of this bundle in each hemisphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) and scanned systematically all the segments that pass through this bundle. Based on known morphology of female pC1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Deutsch et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kimura et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>), we defined cells as pC1 when they crossed through the pC1 bundle, and also projected to the lateral junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Similarly, pC2l cells were found by looking through the pC2l bundle (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Deutsch et al., 2019</xref>; we refer to these cells as pC2 below). The aIPg cells were first found by searching for neurons synaptically connected to pC1d (see below), and other aIPg cells were found by systematically exploring a cross section within the aIPg bundle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). pMN1 and pMN2 were found when mapping the pC1d synaptic partners, and then named pMN1 and pMN2 based on their morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Deutsch et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kimura et al., 2015</xref>). pC1 and aIPg cells were sorted manually into subtypes based on morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>Proofreading of a neuron was performed using the tools available in FlyWire (flywire.ai, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Dorkenwald et al., 2020</xref>]). In short, this process has two parts: (1) removing (‘splitting’) parts that do not belong to the cell (‘mergers’), such as parts of glia or parts of other neurons (for example, when detecting two cell bodies in one segment), and (2) adding missing parts (‘merging’). We had an average of 5.4 splits and 10.7 merges per neuron, and proofreading a single cell took 43 min on average (we measured the proofreading time for a subset of the cells we proofread). Proofreading was complete when no additional obvious mergers were found, and we couldn’t identify missing parts at the edge of any processes. In some cases, the known morphology of the cell (e.g. pMN1 or pMN2) or the existence of other cells with similar morphology (in the same or the other hemisphere) were used to verify that no major processes were missing. Sorting cells into types was done manually, based on their morphology. pC1 was divided into five subtypes, and aIPg were divided into three subtypes.</p><p>Assigning names to known neurons we found in the EM volume was done solely based on morphology. It is possible, that in some cases (e.g. for pC1, pC2, or aIPg cells), some of the neurons we found are not actually Dsx+ or Fru+ cells. Additional work is needed to compare LM based and EM based morphologies, and to classify cell types based both on morphology and connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Scheffer et al., 2020</xref>). Finding cell types in hemibrain version 1.1 with shared morphology was done for the major inputs and outputs of pC1d/e manually.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Mapping synaptic inputs and outputs in FlyWire</title><p>We mapped all the direct inputs and outputs of a single pC1d neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) by manually detecting pre- and postsynaptic partners for this cell. After proofreading the cell (see details above), we looked systematically, branch by branch, for synaptic partners based on previously defined criteria. For a contact to be defined as a chemical synapse, it had to meet three conditions: (1) the presence of a synaptic cleft between the pre- and postsynaptic cells, (2) presynaptic active zone with vesicles near the contact point, and (3) one of two (or both) must exist: a presynaptic T-bar adjacent to the cleft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fouquet et al., 2009</xref>) at the presynaptic terminal or a postsynaptic density (PSD, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Ziff, 1997</xref>]). In flies, PSDs are variable, and are often unclear or absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Prokop and Meinertzhagen, 2006</xref>). Typically, we observed T-bars rather than PSDs, as a T-bar is easier to identify. Our criteria was slightly more conservative than the one used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>, possibly leading to less false positives (wrongly assigned synapses), and more false negatives (missing synapses). On top of using a conservative criterion, synapses were missed for several other reasons, including missed detections by the manual observers (see comparison to automatic detection below) and signal to noise issues in the dataset. Once a synapse was detected, we then looked for the post-synaptic partner. Around 10% of the inputs to pC1d and about 60% of the outputs were short segments (‘twigs’), that we could not connect to backbones in order to identify or proofread the connected neuron. The twigs were not restricted to a specific part of the pC1d cell, and we therefore believe that they do not impose a bias on the distribution of pC1d connections, though it is possible that specific output types (e.g. cells with thinner processes) are less likely to be detected.</p><p>Following the detection of pC1d synaptic partners, we mapped the inputs and outputs to pC1d in three steps. First, we manually proofread the input and output segments. Second, we eliminated cells that connect to pC1d with less than three synapses, to reduce the number of potential false positives, and to focus on stronger connections. We ended up having 78 input and 52 output cells. Third, we sorted cells manually into cell types based on morphology. Some cells were classified based on known morphology from light microscopy (pMN1, pMN2, pC1, pC2, aIPg). In order to look for connections between pC1 and pC2 cells (the largest sets of Dsx+ neurons) in an unbiased way (not focusing on specific types or individual pC1 or pC2), we first identified and proofread pC1 and pC2 cells. Synaptic connections between individual cells of pC1 or pC2 type were detected by manually inspecting the volume plane by plane. Once a pair of segments that came within proximity of one another was detected, we zoomed and looked for synaptic connections based on the criteria defined above.</p><p>We also used automatic detection of synapses in FAFB. FlyWire provides a mapping of the publicly available, automatically detected synapses from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Buhmann et al., 2019</xref>.</p><p>We estimated the reliability of synapse detection by manually testing all the synapsis between pC1d (presynaptic) and two different output cells (a single aIPg-b and a single pC2-like). We found 61.7% (71/115) of the tested synapses to be true positives according to our criteria, 24.3% (28/115) redundant (two coordinates for the same synapse) and 13.9% false positives. By looking at pairwise distances between presynaptic coordinates, and using a minimum threshold of 150 nm, we were able to remove 27/28 of the redundant synapses, while eliminating only three true synapses, thus ending up having 85% (98/115) true positives. We therefore used this threshold whenever using the Buhmann detector. We detected all the inputs and outputs of a single pC1d (FlyWire coordinates 145817, 41367, 5139) and a single pC1e (FlyWire coordinates 142741, 44980, 4908) cells. Cells were included in the count only if they followed the following two criteria: (1) Connected to the inspected pC1d or pC1e with six synapses or more and (2) is part of a cell type (based on morphology, using manual classification) that includes at least one cell with strong connection (defined as 15 synapses or more) with pC1d or pC1e. Only synapses that belong to these cells were counted (see Table 1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Finding the best match in the single-clone dataset FlyCircuit for a given EM segment was done in two steps. First, an. swc file was generated for a given segment (using the automatically segmented cells rather than the proofread ones for technical reasons). Second, we performed an NBLAST search (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Costa et al., 2016</xref>) either online (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nblast.virtualflybrain.org:8080/NBLAST_on-the-fly/">http://nblast.virtualflybrain.org:8080/NBLAST_on-the-fly/</ext-link>) or using ‘natverse’, an R package for neuroanatomical data analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bates et al., 2020</xref>). For visualization purposes, we first created mesh files (.obj) for proofread neurons, and then used either Meshlab (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.meshlab.net/">http://www.meshlab.net/</ext-link>) to create images, or Blender (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.blender.org/">https://www.blender.org/</ext-link>) to create movies (see support/FAQ in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://flywire.ai/">https://flywire.ai/</ext-link> for instructions on creating. swc and. obj files).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>In vivo calcium imaging</title><p>We imaged brain activity following pC1 optogenetic activation (though the microscope objective) under a two-photon custom made microscope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pacheco et al., 2021</xref>) in females, using the calcium indicator GCaMP6s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). Both GCaMP6s and the structural marker tdTomato (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shaner et al., 2004</xref>) were expressed pan-neuronally in blind flies (NorpA[36] mutant) using the nsyb enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bussell et al., 2014</xref>). For pC1 activation, we used the same temporal pattern as the one used in the behavioral experiments: 5 or 2 min of light on, at 100 Hz and 50% duty cycle. Imaging started 5 min before stimulus onset, where baseline activity was measured, and lasted 9.5 min after stimulus offset for whole-brain imaging and 30 min after stimulus offset for <italic>doublesex</italic> imaging. While the red shifted channelrhodopsin ReachR was used for behavior experiments to minimize optogenetic activation by background light, we used Chrimson for two-photon imaging for two reasons. First, to minimize the amount of bleed-through from the optogenetic activation light to the green photomultiplier tube (PMT). For this reason we also choose a longer wavelength of 700 nm (M700L4, Thorlabs, Newton, NJ with a band pass filter FF01-708/75-25, Semrock, Rochester, NY) that is well separated from the range of light that cross the green PMT entrance filter (Semrock FF01-593/40-25). Second, we wanted to minimize the amount of light needed for neuronal activation by using a more sensitive effector, to reduce the amount of heat accumulating in the brain during imaging (on top of the heating caused by the two-photon laser, whose power was limited to 15 mW). We are aware of possible differences in pC1 activation level between the behavioral and imaging experiments. Based on existing literature, we tried to choose an activation level for the imaging experiments that will roughly match the activation induced during behavior. In order to match the activation level between the behavioral experiments (ReachR, 627 nm light, intact fly) and the imaging experiments (csChrimson, 700 nm light, cuticle removed above the fly brain) we used data from existing literature. By comparing the amount of light needed for driving proboscis extension reflex (PER) in 100% of adult flies in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Inagaki et al., 2014</xref> (ReachR, 1.1 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>, 627 nm) to the level of light used to saturate PER score in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Klapoetke et al., 2014</xref> (CsChrimson, 0.07 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>, 720 nm), taking into account the different duty cycles used in the two studies and given the penetration rate through the cuticle (Based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Inagaki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, around 6% of the light penetrates at 627 nm), we choose a light intensity of 0.013 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>.</p><p>A volume of ~307 × 307 × 200 µm<sup>3</sup> from the dorsal part of the central brain was scanned at 0.1 Hz (1.4 × 1.2 × 2 µm<sup>3</sup> voxel size), covering a complete dorsal quadrant (full anterior-posterior axis of the central brain) which represents about 58.02 ± 3.97% of the whole hemisphere (mean ± SD, n = 28 animals). Volumetric data was processed as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pacheco et al., 2021</xref>. In brief, tdTomato signal was used to motion-correct volumetric time-series of GCaMP6s signal in XYZ axis (using the NoRMCorre algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pnevmatikakis and Giovannucci, 2017</xref>]). Volumes were spatially resampled to have isotropic XY voxel size of 1.2 × 1.2 × 2 µm<sup>3</sup> (bilinear interpolation on X and Y axes), and temporally resampled to correct for different slice timing across planes of the same volume, and to align timestamps of volumes relative to the start of the optogenetic stimulation (linear interpolation). Next, the GCaMP6s signal was 3D-ROI segmented using the Constrained Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (CNMF) algorithm to obtain temporal traces and spatial footprints per segmented ROI as implemented in CaImAn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Giovannucci et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pacheco et al., 2021</xref>). In this algorithm, each ROI is defined as a contiguous set of pixels within the field of view that are correlated in time, these ROIs are initialized around locations with maximum variance across time. Spatially overlapping ROIs with correlated activity are merged (correlation coefficient &gt;0.9); therefore, ROIs could have different sizes. Code to perform these processing steps are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/murthylab/FlyCaImAn">https://github.com/murthylab/FlyCaImAn</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pacheco et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, to further remove residual motion artifacts from the GCaMP6s signal, in particular slow drift over tens of minutes, we performed independent component analysis (ICA) on the tdtomato (F<sub>tdtomato</sub>) and GCaMP6s (F<sub>GCAMP</sub>) signal for each ROI independently, similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Scholz et al., 2018</xref>. To remove opto-related artifact bleeding through the red channel, F<sub>tdtomato</sub> was linearly interpolated from 20 s before stimulus onset to 20 after stimulus offset (to ignore opto-related artifact bleeding through the red channel) and random noise (from normal distribution centered at 0) added to interpolated timepoints. F<sub>tdtomato</sub> was then smoothed (moving average with a window of 50 s), and ICA was used (rica function implemented in MATLAB) to extract background and signal components from F<sub>tdtomato</sub> and F<sub>GCAMP</sub>. Independent component highly correlated to F<sub>tdtomato</sub> (absolute correlation coefficient &gt;0.9) was considered the background component (ICA<sub>Background</sub>(F<sub>tdtomato,</sub> F<sub>GCAMP</sub>)), whereas the other component considered the signal component (ICA<sub>Signal</sub>(F<sub>tdtomato,</sub> F<sub>GCAMP</sub>)). Sign of ICA<sub>Signal</sub>(F<sub>tdtomato,</sub> F<sub>GCAMP</sub>) was corrected using the sign of the correlation between ICA<sub>Signal</sub>(F<sub>tdtomato,</sub> F<sub>GCAMP</sub>) and F<sub>GCAMP</sub>. For ROIs extracted from pan-neuronal data, we report calcium signals as ICA<sub>Signal</sub>(F<sub>tdtomato,</sub> F<sub>GCAMP</sub>) as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>.</p><p>We defined responsive ROIs as ROIs with a mean activity during optogenetic stimulation (Ft1) higher than 3σ<sub>o</sub> (σ<sub>o</sub> - standard deviation of activity during baseline). We then split ROIs into transiently and persistently active units using the mean activity after optogenetic stimulation (Ft2, from stimulus offset to 5 min after stimulus offset), transient ROIs had Ft2 ≤ 3σ<sub>o</sub>, while persistent ROIs had Ft2 &gt; 3σ<sub>o</sub>. To evaluate the diversity of these coarse activity types, we hierarchically clustered transient and persistent responses (we evaluated the number of clusters these response types split into using the consensus across Calinski-Harabasz, Silhouette, Gap, and Davies-Bouldin criteria), obtaining two clusters of transient responses and two clusters of persistent responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–D</xref>).</p><p>For recordings of Dsx+ cell types, we imaged pC1, pC2, pCd1, and pCd2 cells (1–2 groups at a time), located in the dorsal side of the central brain, at a speed of 0.5–0.25 Hz (0.5 × 0.5 × 1 µm<sup>3</sup> - 2.5 × 2.5 × 1 µm<sup>3</sup> voxel size). Similarly, for recordings of Fru+ cell types we imaged Fru+ cells (both within the same field of view), located in the dorsal side of the central brain, at a speed of 0.5 Hz (1.2 × 1.2 × 2 µm<sup>3</sup> voxel size). Volumetric time-series of GCaMP6s signal was motion-corrected in the XYZ axes using the NoRMCorre algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pnevmatikakis and Giovannucci, 2017</xref>), and temporally resampled to correct for different slice timing across planes of the same volume, and to align timestamps of volumes relative to the start of the optogenetic stimulation (linear interpolation).

Raw data were further analyzed using MATLAB (Mathworks). To construct the IPI, sine frequency, and intensity tuning curves, we calculated the integral voltage in response to each stimulus, after subtracting the baseline voltage.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Laura Colgin as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Michael M Yartsev (Reviewer #1); Marta A Moita (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The full reviews are appended below, and we look forward to receiving a revised manuscript and response to reviewers that addresses the points raised by the reviewers. The most serious concerns, raised by multiple revisions, are synthesized and highlighted under &quot;Essential Revisions,&quot; below.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional substantive revisions are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>In addition, we are aware of a related bioRxiv preprint by Schretter et al. and we encourage you to refer to that paper in your revision and/or rebuttal where it may be appropriate to strengthen support for the claims.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The most serious concerns related to the accuracy of the cell-type identification. This concern comprises the bulk of the feedback from reviewer 2, and related points were raised by reviewer 3 (Methodological points 1, 3).</p><p>2) Physiological relevance of optogenetically-induced behaviors, particularly in light of the extremely long duration stimulation (5min). This issue was raised by both reviewer 2 (last point) and reviewer 3 (Conceptual point 2). The long stimulation protocol should be directly addressed in the manuscript. Ideally, shorter stimulation times would be included, but at an absolute minimum the limitations need to be recognized. The Anderson lab showed that a 7.5 s stimulation of P1 neurons (the male analogues of pC1) could produce a persistent activity in a downstream population. If Deutsch et al. tried shorter times and they didn't work, this should be discussed. There were related issues about how naturalistic the elicited behaviors were. This point was raised by both reviewer 1 (point 4) and reviewer 3 (Conceptual point 1).</p><p>3) Need for additional quantification and statistics was a general concern, highlighted specifically by reviewers 1 and 3 (see reviewer 1, points 2 and 5; reviewer 3 Methodological points 2 and 4).</p><p>The remainder of the concerns, such as justification or toning down of 'emotional state' (reviewer 3 Conceptual point 3), precision of driver lines, and the completeness of the EM reconstruction of upstream and downstream connectivity, can likely be dealt with through textual revisions adjusting the strength/justification of the claims.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Deutsch and colleagues present an intriguing account for the potential role of persistent neural activity in the female <italic>Drosophila</italic> during social interaction. As a bat researcher I am very jealous by the impressive arsenal employed by the group of researchers ranging from precise behavioral measurement, to carefully anatomical delineation, optical stimulation and through large-scale imaging approaches. Using these, the authors identify an important subset of neurons in the female <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain that are participating in long-term (minutes) changes in female behavior. This work will serve as a cornerstone for continued study of social behavior and communication and beyond. I congratulate the authors on this spectacular body of work.</p><p>Substantive comments: My comments primarily aim towards suggestions for clarifications.</p><p>1) What behavioral changes, if any, could be driven by the male song played back to the female but without the male actually being present?</p><p>2) The authors state that &quot;the weights of 8 out of 17 parameters were significantly different from zero&quot;. To ease the reader, it might be helpful for the author to elaborate how significance was corrected for multiple comparisons and false-discovery rate (FDR)?</p><p>3) The authors describe an intriguing clustering of distinct behaviors emerging from stimulation. I wonder if the authors can extend their analysis into behavioral sequences? It particular, if such sequences can be described it would be intriguing to know the relationships between their prevalence and delay of stimulation.</p><p>4) Further, it would be interesting to know how the behavioral sequences following stimulation compare to those exhibited around copulation independent of stimulation? Basically how &quot;natural are those sequences&quot;? For example, the author could do something like a reverse analysis and set time 'zero' as the time of copulation (or any other major behavioral event to be consider the 'end-point') and then work backwards looking at the sequences of behavioral events that led to the 'end-point'. How similar are the behaviors leading to the 'end-point' behavior under the two conditions? Are they similar and if so, for how long? Perhaps the correlation between the sequence following stimulation and that not following stimulation decays (or increases) as a function of time? Given the wealth of knowledge from this group about the social behavior of flies I think the readers would appreciate seeing a comparison to the behavior following stimulation.</p><p>5) In the imaging experiments (Figure 6) the authors note that they clustered ROIs based on response patterns (Figure 6D). How were those clustered? Was it done by eye? If so, perhaps it would be possible to either validate this clustering using a machine-learning or statistical classification approach or alternatively demonstrate the robustness/reproducibility of the responses within a given cluster? Similarly, for the ROI's exhibiting sustained activity on the minutes scale. It would be helpful to get a sense of this variability in a quantitative manner.</p><p>6) Did the authors play male song (and other sounds) to the female during the head-fixed imaging experiments? I realize this is a highly unnatural state for the female but it would still be interesting to know if/how auditory stimulation modulated the responses.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>There is a great deal to like about this study, but I do have a significant concern about the classification of pC1 neurons that I feel must be clarified before making any firm recommendation. In addition I think that setting a lower limit on the duration of optogenetic stimulation required to induce persistent activity would be helpful.</p><p>The authors claim there are 5 pC1 cells / brain hemisphere and 7 types in all. Does this mean that some cells are so different from left to right that they form different cell types? Although there are reports of left-right differences in the fly literature, this situation seems unusual. Another explanation is that some cells have been incompletely or incorrectly reconstructed from EM data. The amazing recent advances in <italic>Drosophila</italic> EM connectomics, including the impressive flywire.ai resource presented in this study, means that we are in a somewhat unusual situation in which the exact same pC1 neurons central to this paper have been independently reconstructed from the same brain by two groups (this study; Wang F. et al., 2020, senior author Barry Dickson). Although Deutsch et al. note:</p><p>“Because our results are based on automated segmentation followed by manual</p><p>proofreading (in 3D), they may differ from results of manual tracing in 2D, even though we have used the same underlying EM dataset.”</p><p>If there are large differences in the morphology of reconstructed neurons, then presumably someone is right or wrong. After reviewing the morphologies in these two manuscripts, we believe that the neuron called pC1-Alpha-s in this manuscript is the contralateral homologue of the neuron called pC1e in this manuscript. This neuron does not have a ventromedial branch as presented in Figure 3; but a ventromedial branch is present in the manually traced version of what appears to be exactly the same neuron in Wang F. et al., 2020 – Figure 3D. Based on this comparison we conclude that:</p><p>pC1-Alpha-l = pC1d; pC1-Alpha-s = pC1e (Wang F. et al., 2020 nomenclature listed second)</p><p>pC1-Med = pC1c; one cell type according to Wang F. et al. – this does not appear to us to affect any of the results in this manuscript.</p><p>The presence or absence of this ventromedial branch is significant because the authors use it as a diagnostic feature when determining which EM cell types are present in their genetic driver lines. While describing their driver lines, the authors note:</p><p>“pC1-A has a medial projection (red arrow), similar to pC1-Alpha-l neurons found in EM (C); the medial projection was found in 7/7 imaged pC1-A female brains, in both hemispheres. This projection was not found in pC1-S imaged female brains (8/8 brains) – neurons labeled in pC1-S resemble pC1-e neurons found in EM (C).”</p><p>If we accept that pC1e and pC1-Alpha-s are indeed the same cell type, then &quot;pC1-A line&quot; most likely contains pC1d and pC1e (since it contains 2 cells per hemisphere). This is also consistent with multi color Flp out data present in Schretter et al., 2020, Supplementary Figure 5E. Furthermore in contrast to the conclusion of Deutsch et al., since it lacks the ventromedial branch, the &quot;pC1-S line&quot; most likely contains something other than pC1e (in Figure 3D it looks like there are both strong and weakly expressing cells and that it might contain all 3 of the remaining pC1 neurons).</p><p>This also implies that the behavioral phenotype observed with pC1-A line could be due to either pC1d or pC1e and therefore there is no reason to focus connectivity analyses only on pC1d and not pC1e. And the behavioral experiments done with the pC1-S line might likely reflect the functions of other pC1 types (a, b, c), but not pC1e.</p><p>To resolve these issues, further tracing of the neuron currently called pC1e is necessary ideally by comparing it with the published skeleton of pC1e from Wang F. et al., 2020, and/or the Janelia &quot;hemibrain&quot; dataset which now seems to have pC1a-e annotated. Without this, the data presented in Figure 4 is very hard to interpret. An MCFO experiment with both pC1-A and pC1-S could clarify what subtypes (and other neurons in the case of pC1-S) they label, or cite the relevant data for pC1-A from Schretter et al., 2020. In addition the synaptic tracing should probably include both pC1d and pC1e.</p><p>As a final note on the subject of EM data, when searching the hemibrain data (neuprint.janelia.org) for pC1 neurons in the course of this review, we noticed that the pC1d neuron in that dataset (which is presumably missing part of its contralateral branch) has 4369 upstream connections and 8945 downstream connections. Furthermore the preprint accompanying that dataset said that they estimate that on average only about a quarter of upstream connections are identified so the true number might be 15-20,000 upstream connections for a single pC1d neurons. In several places Deutsch et al. refer to about 400 pre and postsynaptic sites for their traced pC1-Alpha e.g.:</p><p>“After proofreading the pC1-Alpha cell and its input and output cells, and excluding weak connections (using 3 synapses as a threshold, see Materials and methods), we counted 417 presynaptic and 421 postsynaptic sites (Figure 5B, Video 4, and Table 2).”</p><p>I think these numbers must refer to presynaptic or postsynaptic partner neurons rather than synaptic sites as otherwise the difference in numbers is too huge. It would be very helpful if the authors could clarify their terminology and/or these differences in synapse numbers. It seems that everyone in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> circuits field will soon need to know how to critically assess EM data.</p><p>To help future readers, we would also suggest that the authors use the convention of presenting brain/neuron images in consistent anterior (frontal) rather than posterior views. Furthermore since Wang F. et al., 2020, have already reported pC1 cell types using a complete analysis of the same EM data with accompanying LM work, we would recommend against introducing a different nomenclature.</p><p>Another aspect of the paper that raised questions was the length of the stimulation required to evoke persistent neural activity. Do the authors have data about the effects of shorter stimulation? Was there a specific rationale for choosing 5 minutes? In a very similar circuit in male flies, Jung et al., 2019, use 7.5s of P1 stimulation to create minutes long sustained activity in pCd. It is unclear whether 5 minutes of constant excitation can happen in vivo as opposed to experimental manipulations like optogenetic activation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This study addresses the important, poorly understood and poorly defined topic of animals' internal states. This is a timely study that constitutes a technical tour the force that opens new avenues to explore how lasting behavioral states are instantiated and how these might relate to sustained brain states. This study, however, falls short of demonstrating the relationship between the artificially induced brain and behavioral states with natural, endogenous ones, as well as establishing a causal link between the recurrent connectivity, the persistent activity and the behavioral states. I have a few concerns, both at the conceptual and methodological levels.</p><p>Conceptual concerns:</p><p>Although the authors show that artificial stimulation of a specific set of neurons impacts female receptivity, aggressive behaviors, and neuronal activity in a lasting manner, caution in the interpretation of the reported findings is warranted. I believe a discussion that more openly addresses the short comings of their study is important.</p><p>1) The authors devote a section of the Discussion to the finding that activating pC1-int leads to an increase in receptivity while at the same time it triggers aggressive behaviors. They mention in this regard that within pC1 neuronal type there appears to be segregation of neurons that drive courtship behaviors and aggression. Still, alternative explanations, that question the induction of a receptivity state are possible, even if flies end up mating more. Stimulation of pC1-int neurons induces behaviors that normally do not occur in a receptive female. It could be, for example, that a stimulated female is not more receptive, but by displaying aggressive behaviors towards the male, the later becomes aroused and more efficient at mating. The authors should show how activation of the female affects courtship behaviors of the male, including but not exclusively regarding song.</p><p>2) The authors use a single form of neuronal stimulation: pulsed light at 100Hz for 5 minutes. It is unclear what kind of neuronal activity it induces during stimulation and how this neuronal activity compares to endogenous activity states in general, and during social interactions in particular. This is especially true in the light of a previous study (Zhou et al., 2014) showing transient activity of pC1 neurons to male song and pheromone (this may be different in a female interacting with a male during courtship). It would have been ideal to at least try different activation patterns, namely shorter stimulation protocols. It may be difficult for the authors to add further experiments with different activation protocols. Therefore, the authors should address this in the Discussion.</p><p>3) The authors mention in the Discussion that their observations may be in line with an 'emotional state', as they find lasting states that they claim to be scalable, as they report different decay functions of persistent activity across different brain regions. Although the authors do induce a persistent activity state, evidence for scalability is at best weak. Furthermore, there are multiple features of emotional states, such as somatic responses to the external triggers, that are not addressed in this study. Given that the only robust feature they find is lasting neuronal activity and behaviors, I believe the authors should avoid such claims.</p><p>Methodological concerns:</p><p>1) For the TNT experiments, Figure 1, the authors use the same control for TNT expression in pC1-int and pCd1 neurons. However, according to the table of genotypes used in this study, it seems that TNT is inserted in different chromosomes for the two experimental lines (2nd chromosome for pC1-int line and 3rd chromosome for pCd1 line). Importantly the control has the TNT insertion in the 3rd chromosome and is thus different from the main line of this study, the pC1-int line. It is also not clear to me if the control corresponds to an empty lex-A line or a parental control. The authors should clarify the controls used and if indeed the control does not have the same insertion sites as the mains experimental line. In this case the experiment should be repeated with the appropriate control, as it is our experience in the lab that these issues are often determinant in the experiment's outcome.</p><p>2) Figure 4F shows the probability density distributions of fraction of time spent shoving or chasing, for different experimental lines and different times points. They conclude from these plots that differences in behavior across experimental lines depend on the time point looked at. This is potentially an interesting finding, but I could not find the statistical comparisons that sustain such claim.</p><p>3) The authors claim that the neuronal subtype aIP-g-b is the most interconnected for cells that are also reciprocally connected with pC1-alpha. However, Figure 5H seems to show that cells of the aIP-g-c subtype show a similar pattern. It is unclear why the authors are singling out aIP-g-b neurons and how would it be relevant to the claims in the manuscript.</p><p>4) Figure 6G shows the activity levels in different brain regions at the 3 tested time points (0,3 and 6 minutes after stimulation). They use this information to say that different brain regions show different decay functions. Again, I could not find the statistical analysis that would be required to make such a claim. This is important as it is one of the pieces of evidence used to suggest that pC1 activation may lead to an emotion-like internal state. It is also not clear to me how different decay functions in different brain regions reflect scalability. To my knowledge scalability typically reflects effects of intensity on output, such as the well-established case of fear studies in rodents where stronger shocks leads to more freezing, or higher levels of corticosterone among other scalable outputs (whether these states correspond to fear is still a matter of debate).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.59502.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The most serious concerns related to the accuracy of the cell-type identification.

By performing additional analyses in FlyWire, we have now found a pair of cells (1 per hemisphere) for each one of the pC1 subtypes (pC1a-e) and revised the figures and text accordingly – see revised Figure 3.</p><p>2) We now state in the manuscript that the line pC1-A includes both pC1d and pC1e cells, citing Schretter et al., 2020 – this is the same as their line pC1dSS3.</p><p>3) Since the pC1-A line includes <italic>both</italic> pC1d and pC1e, we have now added connectome information for pC1e (see new Figure 6—figure supplement 1).</p><p>4) By communicating with Katie Schretter and Gerry Rubin, we have now compared the classification of aIPg cells in our work (in FlyWire) with their work (in the hemibrain). We make clear now in the manuscript the correspondence between aIPg cell types in the two studies.</p><p>5) We used the hemibrain nomenclature for naming cells we found in FlyWire, wherever a clear match was found based on morphology , to allow easier comparisons between the connectivity diagrams of the two manuscripts (see new Figure 6 and Figure 6—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Physiological relevance of optogenetically-induced behaviors, particularly in light of the extremely long duration stimulation (5min). This issue was raised by both reviewer 2 (last point) and reviewer 3 (Conceptual point 2). The long stimulation protocol should be directly addressed in the manuscript.

This point was raised by both reviewer 1 (point 4) and reviewer 3 (Conceptual point 1).</p></disp-quote><p>We have now collected new data to address this concern. We activated pC1d/e cells (using the pC1-A split GAL4 line) for shorter durations of 2 minutes or 30 seconds in solitary females, and measured the effect on female behavior following introduction of a male, as before. Females showed a significant level of persistent shoving and chasing (aggressive and male-like behaviors) following 2 minute activation (Figure 4J), but only very few flies showed persistent shoving or chasing following 30 second activation. We have also included data on 5 minute activation of other Dsx+ cell types, such as pCd neurons and pC1 neurons other than pC1d and pC1e (labeled in the pC1-S split GAL4 line), and show that we do not see persistent effects on female behavior with a male (Figure 2—figure supplement 2A) or significant persistent brain activity (Figure 6E; Figure 6—figure supplement 1) following activation of these neurons – this suggests that the persistent changes in behavior we observe are not a consequence of 5 minute activation of any Dsx+ cell type, but are specific to pC1d/e. We also have added new data from pan-neuronal calcium imaging following the shorter 2 minute activation of pC1d/e neurons. We observed clear persistent activity (see new Figure 7), although its distribution was sparser compared to 5-minute activation. We also recorded GCaMP responses in Dsx+ neurons and Fru+ neurons (new Figure 8). Persistent responses were found only in specific subpopulations (e.g., in Dsx+ pC1 neurons, or Fru+ putative aIPg neurons), demonstrating that persistent responses are found only in specific cell types. Finally, we performed patch clamp recordings from pC1d/e neurons in virgin females and found auditory responses to courtship song elements (new Figure 4—figure supplement 1). This suggests that pC1d/e neurons would be activated during courtship as females listen to male song – males sing 100s of song bouts during a typical courtship session (see Coen et al., 2014), but whether this activation can induce a persistent state on its own or in combination with other cues, remains to be determined.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Need for additional quantification and statistics was a general concern, highlighted specifically by reviewers 1 and 3 (see reviewer 1, points 2 and 5; reviewer 3 Methodological points 2 and 4).</p></disp-quote><p>We have made the modifications requested by the reviewers (see specific responses below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The remainder of the concerns, such as justification or toning down of 'emotional state' (reviewer 3 Conceptual point 3), precision of driver lines, and the completeness of the EM reconstruction of upstream and downstream connectivity, can likely be dealt with through textual revisions adjusting the strength/justification of the claims.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made the revisions requested by the reviewers (see specific responses below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The manuscript by Deutsch and colleagues present an intriguing account for the potential role of persistent neural activity in the female <italic>Drosophila</italic> during social interaction.

This is an interesting question about the specific sensory stimuli that affect female behavior <italic>following</italic> pC1 activation, or once the persistent internal state is induced. While we have not yet dissected which sensory responses change and how, we did examine the persistent effect of pC1-Int activation on female responses to pulse song in a playback assay. Preliminarily, we found that female responses to song were different during the 5min optogenetic activation of pC1 neurons versus the 5min in between stimuli – however, we would need to perform additional experiments to interpret these results and compare them to our results during natural behavior, and so we have not included them in the revision. We should point out though that the companion study from Schretter et al. show that aIPg neurons, the neurons recurrently connected with pC1d/e, receive a large number of visual inputs and that aggressive behaviors driven by aIPg-b neurons are different in light versus dark. This suggests that the internal state changes driven by pC1d/e affect visual responses via aIPg neurons, and we now state this explicitly in the Discussion: “‘female approaching’ (Figure 2—figure supplement 3A), begins from a distance greater than 4 body lengths from the male fly (a distance at which it may be difficult to discern male from female [Borst, 2009]) and often ends with shoving or circling (see Video 3), we hypothesize that pC1 activation most likely drives persistent behaviors towards another fly, and not specifically a male or female fly, consistent with (Schretter et al., 2020).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors state that &quot;the weights of 8 out of 17 parameters were significantly different from zero&quot;.

This is now plotted in Figure 2—figure supplement 2C. This analysis reveals the probability of transitioning between states, and how this changes with different delays following pC1 activation. As evident from the new figure, the transition probability from shoving to chasing more than doubles in the d3 condition compared to the d0 and d6 conditions. The result is summarized in the manuscript: “In many cases females transitioned directly between shoving and chasing, and the conditioned probability (transition probability, given that a transition occurred) for shoving chasing was more than double at the d3 condition compared to the d0 and d6 conditions.”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Further, it would be interesting to know how the behavioral sequences following stimulation compare to those exhibited around copulation independent of stimulation? Basically how &quot;natural are those sequences&quot;? For example, the author could do something like a reverse analysis and set time 'zero' as the time of copulation (or any other major behavioral event to be consider the 'end-point') and then work backwards looking at the sequences of behavioral events that led to the 'end-point'. How similar are the behaviors leading to the 'end-point' behavior under the two conditions? Are they similar and if so, for how long? Perhaps the correlation between the sequence following stimulation and that not following stimulation decays (or increases) as a function of time? Given the wealth of knowledge from this group about the social behavior of flies I think the readers would appreciate seeing a comparison to the behavior following stimulation.</p></disp-quote><p>Virgin female shoving or chasing behaviors directed towards a courting male are rare (see Figure 2F, first panel). Mated females are known to show aggressive behaviors such as shoving/fencing (see e.g., Cook and Connolly, 1973), but we did not examine mated females in our experiments. Females also show these aggressive behaviors during female-female fights over food sources (e.g., Nilsen et al., 2004). We have now added text in the Discussion to make this point clearer: “In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, female-female fights over food source are strongly stimulated by the receipt of sperm at mating (Bath et al., 2017), and include both patterns that are common with male aggression (such as shoving and fencing) and female-only patterns (Nilsen et al., 2004). Female-male aggression was reported in the context of rejecting behavior in mated, immature, or older females (Cook and Connolly, 1973).”</p><p>It will be interesting to examine, as a future direction, how the arousal state we uncover here is triggered under more natural conditions. We found that the highest levels of pC1 activation enhance receptivity but have an opposing effect on responses to male song (speeding females up instead of slowing them down). Slightly lower levels of pC1 activation (following a delay) bias females toward aggression and male-like behaviors. These effects on behavior may not naturally co-occur, but our optogenetic activation paradigm uncovers the scaleable relationship between activation of different pC1 subtypes, their individual levels of activity, and distinct behavioral programs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In the imaging experiments (Figure 6) the authors note that they clustered ROIs based on response patterns (Figure 6D). How were those clustered? Was it done by eye? If so, perhaps it would be possible to either validate this clustering using a machine-learning or statistical classification approach or alternatively demonstrate the robustness/reproducibility of the responses within a given cluster? Similarly, for the ROI's exhibiting sustained activity on the minutes scale.

The number of clusters was determined using the consensus across Calinski-Harabasz, Silhouette, Gap, and Davies-Bouldin criteria. We have now added a description in the Materials and methods: “the GCaMP6s signal was 3D-ROI segmented using the Constrained Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (CNMF) algorithm to obtain temporal traces and spatial footprints per segmented ROI as implemented in CaImAn (Giovannucci et al., 2019; Pacheco et al., 2019).

I realize this is a highly unnatural state for the female but it would still be interesting to know if/how auditory stimulation modulated the responses.</p></disp-quote><p>While we did not examine how pC1 activation changes neural responses to courtship song, a recent study did examine this (Wang K. et al., 2020) – they found that pC1a subtype activation enhances auditory responses of Dsx+ descending neurons that drive vaginal plate opening, such that listening to the male pulse song, if pC1a neurons are active, causes her to ‘become receptive’ by opening the vaginal plate. In our study, we focused on pC1d/e neurons, and we do not yet know how activity of these neurons might alter auditory activity. However, Schretter et al., 2020, have examined visual inputs to aIPg neurons and finds they are numerous. This suggests that pC1d/e activation affects visuomotor transformations via aIPg neurons, and we now mention this in the Discussion. In the behavior, we suspect that it is visual cues from the male that drive her aggressive and male-like chasing behaviors. pC1a neurons may be the subtype that cause enhanced receptivity, but it is curious that we find this co-occurs with speeding up to male song (a rejection behavior) versus slowing down. Future work will have to examine the complex interplay between male acoustic cues, male visual cues, and female responses to the male as her internal state changes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>There is a great deal to like about this study, but I do have a significant concern about the classification of pC1 neurons that I feel must be clarified before making any firm recommendation. In addition I think that setting a lower limit on the duration of optogenetic stimulation required to induce persistent activity would be helpful.</p><p>The authors claim there are 5 pC1 cells / brain hemisphere and 7 types in all. Does this mean that some cells are so different from left to right that they form different cell types? Although there are reports of left-right differences in the fly literature, this situation seems unusual. Another explanation is that some cells have been incompletely or incorrectly reconstructed from EM data. The amazing recent advances in <italic>Drosophila</italic> EM connectomics, including the impressive flywire.ai resource presented in this study, means that we are in a somewhat unusual situation in which the exact same pC1 neurons central to this paper have been independently reconstructed from the same brain by two groups (this study; Wang F. et al., 2020, senior author Barry Dickson). Although Deutsch et al. note:</p><p>“Because our results are based on automated segmentation followed by manual</p><p>proofreading (in 3D), they may differ from results of manual tracing in 2D, even though we have used the same underlying EM dataset.”</p><p>If there are large differences in the morphology of reconstructed neurons, then presumably someone is right or wrong. After reviewing the morphologies in these two manuscripts, we believe that the neuron called pC1-Alpha-s in this manuscript is the contralateral homologue of the neuron called pC1e in this manuscript. This neuron does not have a ventromedial branch as presented in Figure 3; but a ventromedial branch is present in the manually traced version of what appears to be exactly the same neuron in Wang F. et al., 2020 – Figure 3D. Based on this comparison we conclude that:</p><p>pC1-Alpha-l = pC1d; pC1-Alpha-s = pC1e (Wang F. et al., 2020 nomenclature listed second)</p><p>pC1-Med = pC1c; one cell type according to Wang F. et al. – this does not appear to us to affect any of the results in this manuscript.</p><p>The presence or absence of this ventromedial branch is significant because the authors use it as a diagnostic feature when determining which EM cell types are present in their genetic driver lines. While describing their driver lines, the authors note:</p><p>“pC1-A has a medial projection (red arrow), similar to pC1-Alpha-l neurons found in EM (C); the medial projection was found in 7/7 imaged pC1-A female brains, in both hemispheres. This projection was not found in pC1-S imaged female brains (8/8 brains) – neurons labeled in pC1-S resemble pC1-e neurons found in EM (C).”</p></disp-quote><p>From additional proofreading of neurons in FlyWire, we have come to the same conclusion as the reviewer about the pC1d and pC1e cell types. We have identified 2 cells (one in each hemisphere) for the other three pC1 cell types identified in Wang F. et al., 2020 – so for pC1a-e we have 10 cell types in total. We have now updated Figure 3 accordingly and have used the pC1 names from Wang F. et al., 2020 in our study.</p><p>We do point out, however, that a small branch is missing in one of the pC1e cells, which made us previously differentiate between pC1e (Wang F. et al., 2020) and what we had called pC1-Alpha-s (we looked carefully for it in the EM dataset), but we agree that both cells look similar otherwise. For pC1c – there is some variability between the cells in the two hemispheres, as we mention in the figure legend, but we agree that these two cells are morphologically similar enough to be classified as the same cell type.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If we accept that pC1e and pC1-Alpha-s are indeed the same cell type, then &quot;pC1-A line&quot; most likely contains pC1d and pC1e (since it contains 2 cells per hemisphere). This is also consistent with multi color Flp out data present in Schretter et al., 2020, Supplementary Figure 5E.</p></disp-quote><p>Our pC1-A line is the same as the pC1dSS3 line from Schretter et al., 2020. According to Schretter et al., this line contains one pC1d and one pC1e cell in each hemibrain. We now cite Schretter et al., 2020 in our manuscript when we first describe the split GAL4 line: “The pC1-A line (same as pC1dSS3 (Schretter et al., 2020)) includes two cells per hemisphere, one pC1d and one pC1e cell.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore in contrast to the conclusion of Deutsch et al., since it lacks the ventromedial branch, the &quot;pC1-S line&quot; most likely contains something other than pC1e (in Figure 3D it looks like there are both strong and weakly expressing cells and that it might contain all 3 of the remaining pC1 neurons).</p></disp-quote><p>We again agree with the reviewer here, and have now made it clear in the main text and in the Figure 3 legend, that the pC1-S split line likely contains a mix of pC1a-c cells. pC1c is less likely as pC1-S doesn’t contain the medial pC1c projection – we couldn’t find it after looking at the N=7 female brains we imaged for this line. We now mention this in the text: “The medial projection that is unique to the pC1c subtype was missing in all the 8 pC1-S flies we imaged, therefore it is likely that pC1-S includes only pC1a and/or pC1b cells.”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This also implies that the behavioral phenotype observed with pC1-A line could be due to either pC1d or pC1e and therefore there is no reason to focus connectivity analyses only on pC1d and not pC1e. And the behavioral experiments done with the pC1-S line might likely reflect the functions of other pC1 types (a, b, c), but not pC1e.</p><p>To resolve these issues, further tracing of the neuron currently called pC1e is necessary ideally by comparing it with the published skeleton of pC1e from Wang F. et al., 2020, and/or the Janelia &quot;hemibrain&quot; dataset which now seems to have pC1a-e annotated. Without this, the data presented in Figure 4 is very hard to interpret.</p><p>The results presented in Schretter et al., 2020, implicate pC1d not pC1e in aggressive phenotypes driven by neural activation – these results are based on split GAL4 lines specific for pC1d or pC1e. We now cite this work on this point in our manuscript “The pC1-A line (same as pC1dSS3 (Schretter et al., 2020)) includes two cells per hemisphere, one pC1d and one pC1e cell. Schretter et al., 2020 have demonstrated that optogenetic activation of genetic lines that contain pC1d, but not pC1e, drive female aggressive behaviors, such as those we refer to here as ‘shoving”. However, since the behavioral experiments presented in our study differ from those in Schretter et al., especially with regard to induction of a persistent state, we acknowledge that a possible contribution of pC1e could not be ruled out (as we now state, see e.g., the section under “Activation of pC1d/e neurons drives persistent neural activity”), and we have therefore added connectivity analysis for pC1e, as suggested by the reviewer (new Figure 6—figure supplement 1).</p><p>An MCFO experiment with both pC1-A and pC1-S could clarify what subtypes (and other neurons in the case of pC1-S) they label, or cite the relevant data for pC1-A from Schretter et al., 2020. In addition the synaptic tracing should probably include both pC1d and pC1e.</p></disp-quote><p>We now cite Schretter et al., 2020, for the fact that pC1-A (their pC1SS3) contains both pC1d and pC1e, “A companion study (Schretter et al., 2020) demonstrates that while pC1-A (their pC1dSS3) labels both pC1d and pC1e, only pC1d drives female aggressive behaviors”. Our confocal imaging shows that pC1-S does not contain the pC1d/e medial branches (Figure 6C-D) – given that these images also do not show the medial branches of pC1c cell types, we conclude that this line most likely labels pC1a-b cell types. We make this clearer in the text (Results).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As a final note on the subject of EM data, when searching the hemibrain data (neuprint.janelia.org) for pC1 neurons in the course of this review, we noticed that the pC1d neuron in that dataset (which is presumably missing part of its contralateral branch) has 4369 upstream connections and 8945 downstream connections. Furthermore the preprint accompanying that dataset said that they estimate that on average only about a quarter of upstream connections are identified so the true number might be 15-20,000 upstream connections for a single pC1d neurons. In several places Deutsch et al. refer to about 400 pre and postsynaptic sites for their traced pC1-Alpha e.g.:</p><p>“After proofreading the pC1-Alpha cell and its input and output cells, and excluding weak connections (using 3 synapses as a threshold, see Materials and methods), we counted 417 presynaptic and 421 postsynaptic sites (Figure 5B, Video 4, and Table 2).”</p><p>I think these numbers must refer to presynaptic or postsynaptic partner neurons rather than synaptic sites as otherwise the difference in numbers is too huge. It would be very helpful if the authors could clarify their terminology and/or these differences in synapse numbers. It seems that everyone in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> circuits field will soon need to know how to critically assess EM data.</p></disp-quote><p>Our manual identification of synapses for pC1d (formerly pC1-Alpha) in FlyWire revealed 417 and 421 pre/postsynaptic sites, after using a threshold for only including neurons with a minimum number of synapses (3) with pC1d, as described in the manuscript. We also used automated synapse detection using Buhmann et al., 2019 synapses and found 4522 and 10916 presynaptic and postsynaptic synaptic sites to pC1d, numbers not very different from the numbers mentioned in the hemibrain. After using the thresholds described in better detail now in the revised manuscript: “We re-evaluated synaptic partners using automatic detection, and focused on cells with strong connections with pC1d using two criteria: (1) minimum of 6 synapses, (2) the cell belongs to a cell type (based on morphology) with at least one cell with 15 synapses or more with pC1d.”, We found 5255 and 2474 presynaptic and postsynaptic sites for the same pC1d cell (see Table 1). We have now added the list of input and output cells to pC1d and pC1e in Table 1, as well as publicly accessible links to these cells (Table 1, last tab). The method we used for manual detection of synapses was unbiased but not exhaustive. Still, both the automatic and manual methods led to identification of aIPg as the major output cell type of pC1d, with some aIPg cells showing strong recurrent connectivity with pC1d.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To help future readers, we would also suggest that the authors use the convention of presenting brain/neuron images in consistent anterior (frontal) rather than posterior views. Furthermore since Wang F. et al., 2020, have already reported pC1 cell types using a complete analysis of the same EM data with accompanying LM work, we would recommend against introducing a different nomenclature.</p></disp-quote><p>After further proofreading, we have now modified the pC1 nomenclature to be consistent with Wang F. et al., 2020. We also made an effort to find morphologically similar cells in the hemibrain for aIPg and for pC1d/pC1e input and output cells. Whenever possible, we use the hemibrain nomenclature. We summarize the comparison in Table 1, in Figures 6 and in Figure 6—figure supplement 1. However, it is important to remember that the naming in the hemibrain is based on both morphology and connectivity, while we sorted cells into types in FlyWire based on morphology alone. We added anterior views in the relevant figures and used the same view for hemibrain and FlyWire where we compare the two. In some cases, we kept the posterior view, as it is consistent with the view used for two-photon imaging, and as our neurons of interest (pC1, aIPg) are all located in the posterior part of the brain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another aspect of the paper that raised questions was the length of the stimulation required to evoke persistent neural activity. Do the authors have data about the effects of shorter stimulation? Was there a specific rationale for choosing 5 minutes? In a very similar circuit in male flies, Jung et al., 2019, use 7.5s of P1 stimulation to create minutes long sustained activity in pCd. It is unclear whether 5 minutes of constant excitation can happen in vivo as opposed to experimental manipulations like optogenetic activation.</p></disp-quote><p>In Jung et al., 2020, a shorter stimulation (3 pulses, 5s each, with 25ms inter-pulse interval) was used to drive persistent neural activity lasting minutes. While that stimulation was overall shorter in duration, it lasted 1.5 minutes in total. In our case, we used stronger activation (5 minute duration), but inserted up to a 6 minute delay between activation and introduction of a male (to assay behavior). To address the reviewer concerns, we have now added new data – 2 minute and 30 second stimulus duration conditions for the behavioral experiments and found significant shoving and chasing following 2 minutes activation, but very little following 30 second activation (now consistent with Schretter et al. – that study does not observe persistent effects on behavior following 30sec of pC1d activation). We also measured pan-neuronal responses to 2 minute activation of pC1d/e cells and found persistent activity, albeit reduced when compared with 5 min activation. Taken together, this suggests that shorter activation of pC1d/e (2 min) still drives persistent changes in behavior and persistent neural activity – we hypothesize this arises by recruiting aIPg neurons and we mention this in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This study addresses the important, poorly understood and poorly defined topic of animals' internal states. This is a timely study that constitutes a technical tour the force that opens new avenues to explore how lasting behavioral states are instantiated and how these might relate to sustained brain states. This study, however, falls short of demonstrating the relationship between the artificially induced brain and behavioral states with natural, endogenous ones, as well as establishing a causal link between the recurrent connectivity, the persistent activity and the behavioral states. I have a few concerns, both at the conceptual and methodological levels.</p><p>Conceptual concerns:</p><p>Although the authors show that artificial stimulation of a specific set of neurons impacts female receptivity, aggressive behaviors, and neuronal activity in a lasting manner, caution in the interpretation of the reported findings is warranted. I believe a discussion that more openly addresses the short comings of their study is important.</p><p>1) The authors devote a section of the Discussion to the finding that activating pC1-int leads to an increase in receptivity while at the same time it triggers aggressive behaviors. They mention in this regard that within pC1 neuronal type there appears to be segregation of neurons that drive courtship behaviors and aggression. Still, alternative explanations, that question the induction of a receptivity state are possible, even if flies end up mating more. Stimulation of pC1-int neurons induces behaviors that normally do not occur in a receptive female. It could be, for example, that a stimulated female is not more receptive, but by displaying aggressive behaviors towards the male, the later becomes aroused and more efficient at mating. The authors should show how activation of the female affects courtship behaviors of the male, including but not exclusively regarding song.</p></disp-quote><p>The effect of pC1-Int activation on female receptivity peaks at the d0 condition (following 5 min activation), while the effect on female aggression peaks at the d3 condition (following 5 min activation and a 3min delay), suggesting that the change in mating probability following pC1-Int activation is not simply an indirect effect of changes in male courtship behavior (in response to aggressive females) – we now make this clearer in the text: “These behaviors typically peaked in the d3 condition, where they remained high after male introduction. In contrast, the effect on female receptivity and female responses to male song, were both strongest in the d0 condition, ruling out the possibility that the effect on female receptivity is an indirect consequence of modified male courtship behavior in response to changes in female behaviors.”. Moreover, in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 we show that male song patterns are largely similar in the d0 condition and the control, indicating that in this condition – when there is also a significant effect of pC1-Int activation on female receptivity, male singing (which drives vaginal plate opening in females – see Wang F. et al., 2020b, does not change. While our assay afforded us the opportunity to record song information (using microphones), we did not examine other male behaviors (such as copulation behaviors, which would have required different camera positions). Lastly, activating pC1-A (only pC1d/e neurons) drives female shoving and chasing, without a significant effect on mating probability. We modified the text to make this point clearer: “Activation of either line pC1-A or pC1-S did not affect female receptivity (Figure 4A, D), but activation of pC1-A drove persistent shoving and chasing (Figure 4B-C), while activation of pC1-S did not (Figure 4E).”), and have now modified the text of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors use a single form of neuronal stimulation: pulsed light at 100Hz for 5 minutes. It is unclear what kind of neuronal activity it induces during stimulation and how this neuronal activity compares to endogenous activity states in general, and during social interactions in particular.</p></disp-quote><p>Our experiments involving neural imaging (current Figures 7 and 8) involved imaging <italic>both</italic> during the 5 min of activation and after. We analyze pan-neuronal DF/F levels over the 5min of pC1d/e activation and compare this to a recent study of pan-neuronal responses to auditory stimuli (Pacheco et al., 2019). We find that the DF/F values following activation fall within the distribution of DF/F values in response to sensory stimuli – this suggests that activity levels over 5min activation are not aberrant (new Figure 7—figure supplement 1C). We also have behavioral data following 5min activation of pCd1 neurons and pC1a-b neurons (labeled in line pC1-S) – see Figure 4E and new Figure 2—figure supplement 2A – the results show that the persistent behavioral phenotypes we observe are specific to pC1d/e activation (in lines pC1-Int and pC1-A). Second we included behavioral data on 2min and 30sec activation (of the pC1-A line) and find that persistent effects on behavior are still observed following 2min activation (new Figure 4J). Finally we imaged neural activity following 2min activation of pC1d/e neurons and show that we still observe ROIs with persistent activity (new Figures 7I-J), although this activity is sparser.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This is especially true in the light of a previous study (Zhou et al., 2014) showing transient activity of pC1 neurons to male song and pheromone (this may be different in a female interacting with a male during courtship). It would have been ideal to at least try different activation patterns, namely shorter stimulation protocols. It may be difficult for the authors to add further experiments with different activation protocols. Therefore, the authors should address this in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response above. To determine how pC1d/e neurons might be naturally triggered, we have now included patch clamp recordings from these neurons in virgin females, and find auditory responses to courtship song features (new Figure 4—figure supplement 1). This suggests that pC1d/e neurons would be activated during courtship as females listen to male song – males sing 100s of song bouts during a typical courtship session (see Coen et al., 2014), but whether this activation can induce a persistent state on its own or in combination with other cues, remains to be determined.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors mention in the Discussion that their observations may be in line with an 'emotional state', as they find lasting states that they claim to be scalable, as they report different decay functions of persistent activity across different brain regions. Although the authors do induce a persistent activity state, evidence for scalability is at best weak. Furthermore, there are multiple features of emotional states, such as somatic responses to the external triggers, that are not addressed in this study. Given that the only robust feature they find is lasting neuronal activity and behaviors, I believe the authors should avoid such claims.</p></disp-quote><p>There are two lines of evidence that link pC1 activity to a scaleable effect on behavior: 1) We found that the highest levels of pC1 activation drive receptivity but have an opposing effect on responses to male song (speeding females up instead of slowing them down). Slightly lower levels of pC1 activation (following a delay) bias females toward aggression and male-like behaviors (see Figures 1F-G and 2D-F) 2) We have now tested a shorter pC1-A activation of 2 minutes for both the behavior and neural imaging, and find persistent, but reduced, effects on behavior (new Figure 4J) and neural activity (new Figure 7J). We now simply state that our results are “similar to” emotion states observed in other systems: “These data suggest that female pC1 neurons can drive an arousal state, similar to male P1 neurons, but whether female pC1 neurons can drive <italic>persistent</italic> changes in behavior and <italic>persistent</italic> neural activity, has not yet been investigated.”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Methodological concerns:</p><p>1) For the TNT experiments, Figure 1, the authors use the same control for TNT expression in pC1-int and pCd1 neurons. However, according to the table of genotypes used in this study, it seems that TNT is inserted in different chromosomes for the two experimental lines (2nd chromosome for pC1-int line and 3rd chromosome for pCd1 line). Importantly the control has the TNT insertion in the 3rd chromosome and is thus different from the main line of this study, the pC1-int line. It is also not clear to me if the control corresponds to an empty lex-A line or a parental control. The authors should clarify the controls used and if indeed the control does not have the same insertion sites as the mains experimental line. In this case the experiment should be repeated with the appropriate control, as it is our experience in the lab that these issues are often determinant in the experiment's outcome.</p></disp-quote><p>The genotype mentioned for the pC1-Int TNT inactivation in Table 1 was incorrect and we have now fixed this error. The same parent strain was used for making the pC1-Int and pC1d1 – TNT flies, and in both – as in the control – the TNT is on the 3rd chromosome, and the LexAop – on the 2nd.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 4F shows the probability density distributions of fraction of time spent shoving or chasing, for different experimental lines and different times points. They conclude from these plots that differences in behavior across experimental lines depend on the time point looked at. This is potentially an interesting finding, but I could not find the statistical comparisons that sustain such claim.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added the statistics and stated explicitly which differences are significantly different and which ones are not in the figure legend. We modified the main text accordingly:</p><p>“We found that levels of female chasing are increased with pC1-A activation (relative to pC1-Int) at d3. The levels of shoving are slightly decreased at d0, but this effect was not statistically significant.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors claim that the neuronal subtype aIP-g-b is the most interconnected for cells that are also reciprocally connected with pC1-alpha. However, Figure 5H seems to show that cells of the aIP-g-c subtype show a similar pattern. It is unclear why the authors are singling out aIP-g-b neurons and how would it be relevant to the claims in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We assume the reviewer was referring to the sentence “the most interconnected aIP-g-b cells being the ones that are reciprocally connected to pC1-Alpha”. What we meant here was not that aIP-g-b cells are more interconnected than aIP-g-a or aIP-g-c cells, but rather that out of the group of all aIP-g-b cells, the specific aIP-g-b cells that are reciprocally connected to pC1-Alpha-l (now pC1d; these cells are indicated with a red line in Figure 5G) are also interconnected with other aIPg-b cells. We modified the text (“Some cells from the aIPg-b,c groups are also interconnected (Figure 5G). Interestingly, the most interconnected cells within the aIPg-b group were also the ones that are reciprocally connected to pC1d”) to clear up the confusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 6G shows the activity levels in different brain regions at the 3 tested time points (0,3 and 6 minutes after stimulation). They use this information to say that different brain regions show different decay functions. Again, I could not find the statistical analysis that would be required to make such a claim.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included statistical analysis in new Figure 7—figure supplement 1B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This is important as it is one of the pieces of evidence used to suggest that pC1 activation may lead to an emotion-like internal state. It is also not clear to me how different decay functions in different brain regions reflect scalability. To my knowledge scalability typically reflects effects of intensity on output, such as the well-established case of fear studies in rodents where stronger shocks leads to more freezing, or higher levels of corticosterone among other scalable outputs (whether these states correspond to fear is still a matter of debate).</p></disp-quote><p>We have also now included new data from shorter activations of pC1d/e neurons in line pC1-A – new Figures 4J and 7I-J. We test both effects on behavior (Figure 4J) and on persistent neural activity (Figure 7I-J). In both cases, we observe persistent behavior and neural activity with 2 minute (versus 5 minute) activation, but the amount of behavior or neural activity is reduced. This also supports our claim of scalability. However, we have now adjusted our wording on this point in the Discussion, to tone down our claims: “In general, effects on behavior of such emotion states are thought to scale with levels of persistent neural activity (Hoopfer et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2014). […] These effects on behavior may not naturally co-occur, but our optogenetic activation paradigm uncovers the scalable relationship between activation of different pC1 subtypes, their individual levels of activity, and distinct behavioral programs. ”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
