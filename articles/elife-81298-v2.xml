physiologically but its mechanistic basis remains incompletely understood. An important site of opioid action in vivo is the presynaptic terminal, where opioids inhibit transmitter release. This response characteristically resists desensitization over minutes yet becomes gradually tolerant over hours, and how this is possible remains unknown. Here, we delineate a cellular mechanism underlying this longer-term form of opioid tolerance in cultured rat medium spiny neurons. Our results support a model in which presynaptic tolerance is mediated by a gradual depletion of cognate receptors from the axon surface through iterative rounds of receptor endocytosis and recycling. For the μ-opioid receptor (MOR), we show that the agonist-induced endocytic process which initiates iterative receptor cycling requires GRK2/3-mediated phosphorylation of the receptor’s cytoplasmic tail, and that partial or biased agonist drugs with reduced ability to drive phosphorylation-dependent endocytosis in terminals produce correspondingly less presynaptic tolerance. We then show that the δ-opioid receptor (DOR) conforms to the same general paradigm except that presynaptic endocytosis of DOR, in contrast to MOR, does not require phosphorylation of the receptor’s cytoplasmic tail. Further, we show that DOR recycles less efficiently than MOR in axons and, consistent with this, that DOR tolerance develops more strongly. Together, these results delineate a cellular basis for the development of presynaptic tolerance to opioids and describe a methodology useful for investigating presynaptic neuromodulation more broadly.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>GPCR</kwd><kwd>opioid</kwd><kwd>endocytosis</kwd><kwd>axon</kwd><kwd>neuron</kwd><kwd>tolerance</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DA012864</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>von Zastrow</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DA010711</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>von Zastrow</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Quantitative imaging of neurons reveals how opioid agonists produce long-term functional tolerance at presynaptic terminals through rapid internalization of receptors from the axonal surface.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The development of physiological tolerance to opioid agonists provides a fascinating example of neurobehavioral plasticity initiated through the activation of specific G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). It is also clinically significant because tolerance limits the therapeutic utility of opioid drugs. While opioid agonists are highly effective in the acute management of pain, maintaining analgesic efficacy under conditions of prolonged or repeated administration tends to require escalating doses. Tolerance develops to other physiological effects of opioids as well, such as the suppression of central ventilatory drive underlying the clinical phenomenon of opioid-induced respiratory depression (OIRD), but typically over a longer period of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Athanasos et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hayhurst and Durieux, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Paronis and Woods, 1997</xref>). This kinetic ‘mismatch’ in the development of tolerance to various opioid-induced effects narrows the therapeutic window for analgesia and is arguably a root cause of the present epidemic of opioid drug-related deaths. Therefore, an important goal of fundamental research is to more fully understand how opioids produce physiological adaptations which develop at widely different rates.</p><p>Part of the answer undoubtedly lies in the complexity of in vivo opioid physiology. Opioids are well known to impact neural function at multiple levels, from molecular mechanisms that occur in discrete receptor-expressing neurons to adaptations which propagate through synaptic networks and neural circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cahill et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Corder et al., 2018</xref>). Even for mechanisms resolved in individual cells, however, it has long been recognized that adaptations can develop at different rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chavkin and Goldstein, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Law et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sharma et al., 1975</xref>). Accordingly, one plausible approach toward elucidating kinetic differences among opioid-induced neuroadaptations is to focus on mechanisms that occur in individual neurons but produce physiological effects spanning a range of timescales.</p><p>Agonist-induced phosphorylation of receptors is one such mechanism. In particular, phosphorylation of the μ-type opioid receptor (MOP-R or MOR) cytoplasmic tail by GPCR kinases (GRKs) mediates desensitization of MOR-mediated control of potassium channels, a response determining the postsynaptic excitability of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arttamangkul et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Williams et al., 2013</xref>). This desensitization process characteristically develops over minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blanchet and Lüscher, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harris and Williams, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lowe and Bailey, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Williams et al., 2013</xref>), consistent with the time course of MOR phosphorylation and subsequent phosphorylation-dependent endocytosis of MOR in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arttamangkul et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Just et al., 2013</xref>). However, phosphorylation of the MOR tail, and on the same Ser/Thr residues required for rapid desensitization, has been clearly shown to attenuate physiological opioid actions after chronic as well as acute administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kliewer et al., 2019</xref>). Might there be an additional cellular locus at which phosphorylation of the MOR tail drives the development of opioid tolerance over a longer time period?</p><p>A possible locus is the presynaptic terminal, where a key physiological action of opioids is to inhibit vesicular neurotransmitter release. Presynaptic inhibition is characteristically resistant to desensitization when assessed over minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blanchet and Lüscher, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fyfe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jullié et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lowe and Bailey, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pennock et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rhim et al., 1993</xref>) but has been shown to develop tolerance after prolonged opioid exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fyfe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lowe and Bailey, 2015</xref>). Nevertheless, MOR was recently shown to undergo phosphorylation-dependent endocytosis in presynaptic terminals within minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jullié et al., 2020</xref>). Together, these observations suggest the possibility that phosphorylation of the MOR cytoplasmic tail, despite not producing a rapid desensitization of opioid signaling at the presynapse, drives the development of this slower form of presynaptic opioid tolerance.</p><p>Here, we describe an experimental approach to explicitly test this hypothesis. We delineate a primary culture system enabling the direct measurement of presynaptic tolerance and show that phosphorylation of the MOR cytoplasmic tail is indeed required for this adaptation. We propose a simple cellular mechanism, based on iterative receptor recycling, that is sufficient to explain how rapid phosphorylation of MOR produces presynaptic tolerance over an extended time scale. We then show that a similar model applies to the development of tolerance to presynaptic inhibition by the homologous δ-type opioid receptor (DOP-R or DOR) except that, remarkably, DOR endocytosis in axons does not require phosphorylation of the receptor cytoplasmic tail. Our results provide fundamental insight into the question of how opioid-induced neuroadaptations develop over distinct timescales and contribute a methodology that we anticipate will facilitate the study of presynaptic neuromodulation more generally.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Presynaptic tolerance to opioids is associated with a loss of surface opioid receptors in the axon</title><p>We assayed opioid-induced presynaptic inhibition by adapting a widely used pHluorin-based unquenching assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sankaranarayanan et al., 2000</xref>) to monitor opioid effects on presynaptic activity in cultured neurons. In this assay, neurons were expressing opioid receptors together with VAMP2-SEP, imaged using a widefield microscope, and were electrically stimulated to induce synaptic vesicle exocytosis. The super-ecliptic pHluorin (SEP) is a pH sensitive GFP whose fluorescence increases as the synaptic vesicle protein VAMP2-SEP relocalizes from acidic synaptic vesicles to the terminal plasma membrane. This fluorescence increase provides a readout for presynaptic activity, which is typically lower when neurons are perfused with agonist for opioid receptors, reflecting opioid mediated presynaptic inhibition. The basic hardware configuration is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. Details of a lab-built apparatus and an automated data analysis pipeline, including specific code modules, are included in Appendix 1. In the adult striatum, a large fraction of medium spiny neurons express MOR or DOR endogenously. However, in our primary neuron cultures, only a small proportion of neurons express opioid receptors endogenously, as assessed functionally and by immunocytochemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jullié et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, co-expression of recombinant receptors together with the synaptic vesicle exocytosis reporter is necessary to detect presynaptic inhibition using the aggregate readout. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> shows an example of a recording from the analysis and illustrates how the degree of presynaptic inhibition was defined. We believe this simple assay offers a number of advantages for mechanistic interrogation, relative to more complex models that offer advantages for relating presynaptic inhibition to physiology. First, optical measurement of presynaptic activity provides a direct and reliable readout of the degree of inhibition that is independent of compounded postsynaptic effects. Second, the cultured neuron system is highly amenable to genetic and pharmacological manipulations. Third, the hardware and analysis pipeline are simple and largely open-source, facilitating rapid and economical deployment.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Loss of MOR mediated presynaptic inhibition under chronic activation conditions is paralleled by a reduction in surface receptor number in axons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the experimental setup, with highlighted open-source hardware used for electrical stimulation in synchronicity with image acquisition (zapomatic) and perfusion of solution onto cultured primary cultured neurons (3D printed insert) transfected with opioid receptors and VAMP2-SEP. The enlarged diagram depicts the biological process of electrically stimulated synaptic vesicle recycling (1) monitored with widefield fluorescence microscopy. Exocytosis of VAMP2-SEP containing synaptic vesicles causes (2) an increase in fluorescence intensity (green), which returns to baseline after recapture of VAMP2-SEP by endocytosis (3) and quenching of the fluorescence (gray). Active opioid receptors (red) inhibit exocytosis of synaptic vesicles (4). (<bold>B</bold>) Description of the experiment design and automated analysis pipeline. For measurement of acute inhibition, neurons are directly placed in imaging solution on the imaging system. For measurement of inhibition after chronic treatment, neurons are pre-treated with agonist for 18 hr (unless specified otherwise). A first time lapse (120 frames, 1 Hz) is acquired in control imaging solution (black box, black curve) and neurons are electrically stimulated at 10 Hz for 10 s 1 min into the time lapse. One minute after perfusion of a solution containing DAMGO 10 μM (open red box), a second time lapse is acquired (red box, red curve) with the same electrical stimulation and imaging paradigm, and for the last 20 frames the solution is exchanged for ammonium chloride (NH<sub>4</sub>Cl). A differential image NH<sub>4</sub>Cl – baseline is used to automatically detect putative synapses, representative images are shown. Signal is quantified over multiple tens of putative synapses and used to validate real synapses. Normalized data are pooled for the same condition. For each acquisition, we obtain curves as depicted after normalization by the maximum amplitude of the control condition (n=508 synapses for this acquisition). Note the difference in maximal amplitude in the presence of DAMGO compared to control, which reflects inhibition of synaptic vesicle exocytosis by opioid receptors. Scale bar is 10 μm.

We compared inhibition of the electrically-evoked pHluorin response observed in opioid-naïve neurons (we define this as the acute condition) to that observed in neurons pre-exposed to DAMGO for 18 hr (we define this as the chronic condition). Significant inhibition was observed in both conditions (unpaired t-test compared to control, acute p&lt;1 e<sup>–5</sup>, chronic p&lt;1 e<sup>–5</sup>), but the degree of inhibition was reduced in the chronic condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, unpaired t-test p&lt;1 e<sup>–5</sup>). These results indicate that prolonged agonist exposure promotes tolerance to presynaptic inhibition by opioids. We further assessed this by concentration-response analysis, verifying decreased efficacy of presynaptic inhibition and also revealing a decrease in potency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, EC50 acute 1.13 nM, EC50 after induction of tolerance 33.85 nM).</p><p>Presynaptic inhibition by opioids is well known to be resistant to rapid desensitization processes which attenuate signaling typically over several minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blanchet and Lüscher, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fyfe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jullié et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lowe and Bailey, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pennock et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rhim et al., 1993</xref>), suggesting that presynaptic tolerance represents a distinct regulatory process. In addition, after the induction of opioid tolerance in vivo, presynaptic inhibition remains resistant to rapid desensitization while desensitization of the postsynaptic response is enhanced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arttamangkul et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fyfe et al., 2010</xref>). In our in vitro system, we did not detect any evidence for desensitization of the DAMGO response over a 10-min interval of sequential stimulation after the induction of tolerance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, left. Mean inhibition at 2 min 36.98 ± 2.80%, mean inhibition at 12 min 37.44 ± 3.34%, paired t-test, p=0.87). Rather, time course analysis revealed that tolerance develops gradually over multiple hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). This extended time course is reminiscent of the process of receptor downregulation, described previously in other systems and associated with a depletion of the total receptor reserve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chavkin and Goldstein, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Christie, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Law et al., 1984</xref>). Supporting the hypothesis that presynaptic tolerance involves a similar process, we found that reducing receptor reserve using the irreversible antagonist β-Chlornaltrexamine (β-CNA) accelerated the development of presynaptic tolerance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, unpaired t-test, p=0.075, 0.002, 0.047 for acute, 2 and 4 hr, respectively). This effect was quite sensitive, with significant acceleration evident even under alkylation conditions that have only a small impact on the maximal opioid response and which produce no detectable rapid desensitization of the response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, right, mean inhibition at 2 min 65.79 ± 3.41%, mean inhibition at 12 min 62.23 ± 3.39%, paired t-test, p=0.35). To directly test if long-term agonist exposure induces a depletion of surface receptors in axons, we imaged SEP-tagged MOR and quantified the fluorescence over thousands of synapses over multiple microscopic fields (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). This analysis revealed that prolonged DAMGO exposure indeed reduces the presynaptic surface MOR pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, MOR no DAMGO mean normalized fluorescence 1.60, 95% confidence interval 1.54–1.66, MOR +DAMGO 18 hours mean normalized fluorescence 1.17, 95% CI 1.08–1.27, two samples Kolmogorov-Smirnov test p&lt;1e<sup>–5</sup>).

We were unable to detect significant rapid internalization of MOR in axons, measured after 30 min of morphine exposure, using our endosomal recruitment assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, repeated measure ANOVA p=0.36). However, significant functional tolerance was detected after prolonged (18 hr) morphine exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, unpaired t-test, acute compared to morphine +DMSO p=0.0018). Morphine induced presynaptic tolerance to a reduced degree relative to DAMGO, but it remained dependent on GRK2/3-mediated phosphorylation because it was blocked by Cmpd101 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, unpaired t-test, morphine +DMSO compared to morphine +Cmpd101 p=0.0016). Accordingly, and despite morphine not producing detectable rapid internalization in axons, we asked whether chronic exposure to morphine is also associated with a phosphorylation-dependent reduction of the overall density of MOR on the axon surface. To test this, we imaged SEP-MOR at synapses after chronic treatment with morphine +Cmpd101 or morphine +DMSO. We found that morphine +DMSO vehicle significantly reduced the amount of receptors at the surface of axons (morphine +DMSO mean normalized fluorescence 1.01, 95% CI 0.96–1.06, compared to DMSO only, two samples Kolmogorov-Smirnov test p&lt;1e<sup>–5</sup>), but this effect was not as pronounced as when neurons were treated with DAMGO +DMSO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, two samples Kolmogorov-Smirnov test p&lt;1e<sup>–5</sup>).

However, DOR trafficking in axons has not been studied previously, and it is not known if longer-term tolerance develops to DOR-mediated presynaptic inhibition. We found that, similar to MOR, surface labeled DOR is diffusely distributed in axons of striatal neurons and does not detectably accumulate at synapses marked with syp-mCh under basal conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, baseline). After stimulation of DOR with the peptide agonist [D-Ala<sup>2</sup>, D-Leu<sup>5</sup>]-Enkephalin (DADLE), there was a redistribution of surface receptors in punctate structures that colocalized with the retromer marker VPS29-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4—video 1</xref>.

This motivated us to ask if presynaptic tolerance elicited by chronic agonist exposure is receptor-specific or if chronic activation of one receptor type promotes the development of tolerance at the other. Neurons co-expressing MOR and DOR were probed in our optical assay after chronic treatment with either the MOR-selective full agonist DAMGO or the DOR-selective full agonist [D-Pen<sup>2,5</sup>]-Enkephalin (DPDPE).

Together, these results indicate that both DOR and MOR mediate presynaptic inhibition when co-expressed at the same terminals and that both responses develop significant tolerance after chronic agonist exposure. However, tolerance to each opioid response is induced in a homologous manner, indicating that its development is receptor-specific.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Differences in the degree of presynaptic tolerance between receptor types correlate with differences in surface receptor depletion and recycling rate</title><p>As our results establish a link between the development of presynaptic tolerance and a reduction in the surface pool of opioid receptors, we anticipated from the above results that loss of surface receptors occurs to a greater degree for DOR than MOR. To test this, we imaged surface DOR fluorescence using a N-terminally SEP-tagged construct. We found that 18 hr of incubation with DADLE led to reduction in the number of surface receptors, indicating that DOR tolerance is paralleled by a reduction of the receptor pool in axons (DOR no DADLE mean normalized fluorescence 1.43, 95% CI 1.38–1.48, compared to DOR +18 hr DADLE mean normalized fluorescence 0.32, 95% CI 0.31–0.34, two samples Kolmogorov-Smirnov test p&lt;1e<sup>–5</sup>). Also, the loss of receptor induced by chronic treatment was much more pronounced than for SEP-MOR, in agreement with our measurements of presynaptic inhibition after induction of tolerance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, MOR +DAMGO compared to DOR +DADLE, two samples Kolmogorov-Smirnov test p&lt;1e<sup>–5</sup>). Enhanced down-regulation of surface DOR relative to MOR has been observed previously in non-neural models, and it results from a reduced efficiency of DOR to enter the recycling pathway compared to MOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tanowitz and von Zastrow, 2003</xref>). To test if this is the case in axons, we co-expressed syp-mCh together with SEP-tagged receptors and exposed neurons to agonist for 20 min, a time sufficient to strongly drive receptors into the endocytic pathway. We then imaged axons at an acquisition rate sufficiently high (10 Hz) to resolve individual receptor-containing vesicular fusion events mediating receptor recycling to the axon surface; these appear as bursts of fluorescence due to rapid SEP dequenching upon exposure to the neutral extracellular milieu (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Such insertion events were detected for both SEP-DOR and SEP-MOR, with no significant difference in amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, unpaired t-test, p=0.93). While recycling events were rare for both receptors in neurons not pretreated with agonist, their frequency was significantly higher after agonist treatment consistent with ligand-induced trafficking and recycling (unpaired t-test, MOR p=0.00023, DOR p=0.0015). More importantly, we found that after agonist treatment, the frequency of SEP-DOR surface insertion events was about half of what was observed for SEP-MOR (unpaired t-test, p=0.0231). Together, these data suggest that, while both MOR and DOR undergo robust ligand-dependent endocytosis in axons, DOR recycles less efficiently than MOR. We propose that, when iterated over the course of 18 hr of agonist treatment, this produces a difference in the degree of progressive receptor depletion from the axon surface which underlies the observed difference in magnitude of functional tolerance development.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>DOR is less efficiently recycled to the plasma membrane compared to MOR.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Eighteen hr of incubation with DADLE 10 μm (n=2934 synapses) induces a marked loss of surface SEP-DOR in axons compared to the untreated control (n=3,376 synapses).

Specifically, while MOR internalization, surface receptor loss, and tolerance clearly require phosphorylation of the receptor’s cytoplasmic tail, this was not the case for DOR. First, the degree of DADLE-induced DOR tolerance observed in the presence of Cmpd101 was indistinguishable from the DMSO vehicle control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, unpaired t-test, p=0.71). We also observed rapid internalization of DOR in the presence of Cmpd101 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, Cmpd101 compared to DMSO vehicle, repeated measure ANOVA, p=0.70). These results indicate that DOR tolerance and internalization do not require GRK2/3 activity, in contrast to MOR. Second, mutating all Ser and Thr residues in the DOR C-terminal tail (DOR S/T to A) did not prevent the development of presynaptic tolerance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, unpaired t-test, p=0.00036). We also observed significant rapid internalization of DOR S/T to A, as indicated by the mutant receptor undergoing DADLE-induced accumulation at retromer marked endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video1">Figure 6—video 1</xref>, repeated measure ANOVA, <italic>P</italic>=0.0335). These results indicate that DOR tolerance and internalization do not require phosphorylation of the receptor’s cytoplasmic tail, in contrast to MOR. Third, assay of surface receptor fluorescence indicated that the S/T to A mutation does not prevent DADLE-induced reduction of the surface pool of SEP-DOR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, DOR S/T to A no DADLE mean normalized fluorescence 1.30, 95% CI 1.27–1.32, compared to DOR S/T to A+18 hr DADLE mean normalized fluorescence 0.45, 95% CI 0.44–0.46, two samples Kolmogorov-Smirnov test p&lt;1e<sup>–5</sup>).

To confirm this result, we used a different assay that leverages the properties of SEP. Ammonium chloride (NH<sub>4</sub>Cl) can titrate acidic intracellular compartments and reveal SEP fluorescence from internal receptors. In neurons expressing SEP-DOR S/T to A, and in basal conditions, application of NH<sub>4</sub>Cl induced a modest fluorescence increase (Δ1, mean = 7.39 ± 0.75%), suggesting that SEP-DOR S/T to A mostly resides at the surface of the axon. After 30 min of DADLE bath application, NH<sub>4</sub>Cl application led to a significantly larger fluorescence increase (Δ2, mean = 16.45 ± 2.27%, paired t-test p=0.0017), indicating that a proportion of mutant receptors had relocalized from the surface to internal acidic organelles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F and G</xref>). These results independently confirm that phosphorylation of the DOR tail is not essential for endocytosis in axons.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The present results establish that GRK-mediated phosphorylation of the MOR cytoplasmic tail drives a form of cellular opioid tolerance at the presynaptic terminal which develops over a significantly longer period of time than the previously elucidated process of rapid desensitization of postsynaptic MOR signaling. Our results support a simple cellular mechanism sufficient to explain the slower kinetics of presynaptic tolerance development, based on an iterative endocytic trafficking cycle that mediates progressive depletion of receptors from the axon surface in the presence of chronic agonist exposure. Accordingly, the present results provide new insight into the cellular and molecular basis for differences in the timescales over which functionally relevant neuroadaptations to opioids develop.</p><p>Presynaptic tolerance develops gradually because it represents an integrated effect of repetitive rounds of endocytosis and recycling, in which a limited fraction of internalized receptors are not reinserted in each cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, large arrow). The key event initiating this iterative trafficking cycle is agonist-induced endocytosis of the receptor and, for MOR, this requires phosphorylation of the receptor’s cytoplasmic tail. Supporting this conclusion, blocking MOR phosphorylation in multiple ways also prevents the gradual depletion of surface receptors and the development of functional presynaptic tolerance. Further, agonists which do not drive MOR endocytosis robustly produce less (morphine) or no (PZM21, TRV130) measureable presynaptic tolerance. The idea that tolerance develops as a consequence of gradual depletion of the total receptor pool on the axon surface is also consistent with our finding that β-CNA, a distinct manipulation which reduces total receptor reserve, dramatically accelerates the development of opioid-induced presynaptic tolerance. Thus, the present model is supported at multiple levels and is sufficient to explain the extended time course over which presynaptic opioid tolerance develops.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Proposed model of opioid receptor signaling and trafficking in axons.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-81298-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p>A limitation of the present study is that it relies on the expression of recombinant opioid receptors in cultured neurons. We previously showed that our experimental system can detect presynaptic inhibition mediated through endogenous opioid receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jullié et al., 2020</xref>). However, in the embryonic striatal cultures used for the present study, only a small proportion of neurons express opioid receptors and this dilutes the degree of endogenous inhibition when analyzed at the population level. We therefore used electroporation to co-express receptors with the VAMP2-SEP reporter. In a previous study, we showed that this method yields levels of recombinant receptor expression within the range of endogenous receptor expression observed across individual neurons in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jullié et al., 2020</xref>). However, these levels can vary considerably, both between neurons and brain regions. Our concentration-response analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) suggests that the present model system has higher opioid sensitivity than slice preparations in which presynaptic inhibition by endogenous receptors was previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fyfe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pennock and Hentges, 2011</xref>). Accordingly, caution is advised in comparing across systems. Nevertheless, the present results suggest that endocytic trafficking is capable of producing substantial presynaptic tolerance even at receptor expression levels that exceed endogenous (which one might expect to mask tolerance due to elevated receptor reserve). The relevance of presynaptic endocytic trafficking to the development of physiological tolerance in vivo also remains to be determined. Interestingly, we note that biased agonism at MOR has been reported to produce less antinociceptive tolerance in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altarifi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Singleton et al., 2021</xref>), and that a measure of postsynaptic cellular tolerance appears to require phosphorylation of the MOR cytoplasmic tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arttamangkul et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>A cellular basis for the ability of presynaptic inhibition by MOR to resist rapid desensitization was proposed previously, grounded in two distinguishing properties of MOR cell biology in axons. First, endocytosis of receptors occurs almost exclusively in synaptic specializations that are sparsely distributed along the extended axon shaft. Second, opioid receptors are laterally mobile over the entire axon surface, with receptors present at synapses able to exchange with the adjacent extrasynaptic pool within seconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jullié et al., 2020</xref>). Accordingly, receptors present on the axon surface, but outside of synapses, are able to diffuse into synapses at a faster rate than receptors undergo agonist-induced endocytic capture and inactivation within synapses. The extrasynaptic membrane thus provides an expansive ‘lateral reserve’ of receptors that, through lateral diffusion, enables opioid signaling at terminals to be maintained even at low overall surface receptor density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, small arrows). The present results extend this general concept to DOR and suggest that presynaptic tolerance develops in a distinct manner – for both MOR and DOR – through a progressive reduction in the ‘total reserve’ of receptors present on the axon surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, large arrow). By elaborating the classical concept of receptor reserve into two components, it becomes possible to simply explain how presynaptic inhibition mediated by opioid receptors is able to resist rapid desensitization (maintained by the lateral reserve) while developing significant tolerance over a longer time period (due to reduction of the total reserve).</p><p>Our proposed model for the development of presynaptic tolerance is reminiscent of a general paradigm of GPCR downregulation that was pioneered through the study of DOR in non-neural cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Law et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Williams et al., 2013</xref>). Our results are consistent with this model, including the present demonstration that DOR recycles less efficiently than MOR in axons and develops presynaptic tolerance more robustly. A key point of divergence is that, for DOR, none of the events associated with the development of tolerance at the presynapse – beginning with endocytosis of the receptor – requires phosphorylation of the receptor tail. Agonist-induced phosphorylation of the DOR tail has been clearly demonstrated, and many studies support its importance for mediating DOR endocytosis and/or downregulation in other cellular contexts (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mann et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Whistler et al., 2001</xref>). However, we also note that there is evidence indicating that phosphorylation is not absolutely required for DOR endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Murray et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Qiu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>). Important future directions include determining how this difference in the cellular regulation of MOR and DOR is mediated, and if phosphorylation-independent endocytosis of DOR is specific to neurons or the presynaptic compartment.</p><p>In sum, our results inform the fundamental question of how opioids produce neuroadaptive effects that span a wide range of timescales, and they delineate a cellular mechanism mediating the development of presynaptic tolerance to opioids. The present results are limited to two opioid receptor types. However, we note that MOR and DOR belong to the largest GPCR subclass (family A), and that presynaptic inhibition mediated by the A1 adenosine receptor (another family A GPCR) resists rapid desensitization yet develops tolerance gradually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wetherington and Lambert, 2002</xref>). Thus we anticipate that the present study, in addition to providing specific insight into the neurobiology of opioids, delineates a framework and methodology useful for investigating presynaptic neuromodulation through GPCRs more generally.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Primary rat striatal neuron cultures</title><p>All procedures were performed according to the National Institutes of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the University of California San Francisco Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol number AN185688).

To monitor stability of the recording in SSF-MOR expressing neurons (‘control’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), the second acquisition was started 1 min after the end of the first one and was in HBS only.

To monitor tolerance, neurons were subject to the same protocol except that they were pretreated with DAMGO 10 μM directly in the cell culture medium for 18 hr in the incubator before imaging. Because our perfusion system allows for only 3 different solutions, we generated the concentration-response curves using only two concentrations of DAMGO per acquisition. After the baseline acquisition in control solution, a first concentration of DAMGO was perfused for 1 min and through the second acquisition. Solution was shifted to a higher concentration of DAMGO for 1 min before starting the third acquisition, and ammonium chloride solution added for the last 20 frames.

One frame was acquired in the red channel, and the green channel was imaged at 10 Hz in stream mode for 5 min.</p><p>For imaging of surface fluorescence from SEP-tagged opioid receptors, neurons nucleofected with SEP-tagged opioid receptor and syp-mCh were washed three times with HBS and mounted onto the microscope stage in HBS. 30–40 random regions of interest were selected per dish in the syp-mCh channel only (experimenter was blinded to the green channel), and one image acquired in the green and red channel for each region. When neurons were chronically treated, cells were incubated for 18 hr with agonist at a concentration of 10 μM in the culture medium in the incubator, the rest of the protocol was the same. If Cmpd101 or DMSO vehicle were present, Cmpd101 30 μM or DMSO vehicle were added to the culture medium for 10 min before agonist 10 μM was added for 18 hr, rest of the protocol was the same. Experiments were performed on the same culture in parallel for the conditions that are presented on the same graphs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Image analysis</title><p>Image analysis was performed on unprocessed 16 bits TIFF images using custom written scripts in MATLAB (Mathworks, R2019b). Scripts are provided on an open repository at the following address: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6954811">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6954811</ext-link>. See extended methods for details of the procedures.</p><p>For the quantification of presynaptic activity, putative synapses were detected using an automated image classifier on an average baseline (defined as 6 frames before stimulation) subtracted ammonium chloride average image (defined as 5 last frames of the last acquisition). Fluorescence was quantified in a 5 pixels radius circle around each synapse, baseline fluorescence for each acquisition subtracted and normalized to the fluorescence in ammonium chloride. Synapses were validated if no pixel was saturated and the amplitude of the response during the first acquisition (in HBS only) was five times greater than the standard deviation of the baseline. For each condition and each acquisition, fluorescence from validated synapses were averaged across conditions and displayed in the inset curves (± standard error of the mean). To calculate the degree of inhibition, only acquisitions that had more than 50 validated synapses were considered and their fluorescence averaged across each acquisition. The ratio of the amplitude (defined as the maximum value of the 5 frames after stimulation) over the amplitude of the first acquisition was used to define the degree of inhibition. Normalized concentration-response curves were generated by calculating the mean inhibition for each data point, subtracting the average inhibition observed in control solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and normalizing by the average acute inhibition in 10 μM DAMGO.</p><p>For the quantification of SEP tagged opioid receptors and syp-mCh fluorescence at synapses, synapses in focus were identified based on syp-mCh signal and manually picked, only exceptions were synapses that were over glial background autofluorescence or overlapping with somato-dendritic SEP signal. For each synapse, background subtracted average fluorescence within a 3 pixels radius was calculated for both channels. Values for each synapse and channel were normalized by the median fluorescence of the ‘no-agonist’ condition of the same experimental day and data pooled between experiments.</p><p>To quantify receptor recruitment at retromer marked endosomes, a mask of VPS29-GFP endosomes was generated for each frame of the time lapse. To do so, regions of interest were manually selected on the image and refined by thresholding a maximal temporal projection of the receptor channel. Endosomes within this region were defined by a VPS29-GFP fluorescence value above a threshold set manually and objects larger than 5 pixels. For each region, background subtracted receptor fluorescence was calculated for each segmented endosomes for all frames. Average receptor fluorescence was calculated at all segmented endosomes of the same region, for the ‘no agonist’, baseline bin value. Receptor fluorescence at each endosome was normalized by this baseline value and averaged across all regions for 5 min intervals as indicated in the figures. Binned values were averaged across acquisitions for the same condition.</p><p>To quantify the frequency and fluorescence of single insertion events, bursts of fluorescence were manually selected on the image series. Fluorescence was quantified in a 2.2 pixels radius circle and the average baseline fluorescence of the 10 preceding frames was subtracted. Amplitude of fluorescence events is defined as the maximal fluorescence in the 10 frames following the detection. Fluorescence curves were averaged for all events of the same conditions. Frequency of events were normalized for each acquisition by the number of syp-mCh marked synapses in the field of view.</p><p>To quantify SEP-DOR S/T to A endocytosis using ammonium chloride unquenching, the four images were manually aligned to the first image to compensate for drift over the acquisition and lines drawn on axons identified based on syp-mCh signal. Background subtracted average fluorescence from a 3-pixel wide linescan was calculated for all images and normalized to the fluorescence value of the first image for each acquisition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Data presentation and statistics</title><p>Quantifications of data are presented as either mean ± standard error of the mean, cumulative frequency curves, paired measurements or box and whisker plots (4 quartiles with inclusive median, outliers are not displayed, average is marked as a ‘X’). Graphs were generated with Excel (Microsoft office, 2016). Look up tables used can be found in the extended method section. All experiments were performed on at least independent neuronal cultures and sample size indicated in the figure legends. When performing two tailed Student’s t-test the software used was Excel, two samples Kolmogorov-Smirnov test were performed with MATLAB. 95% confidence intervals were estimated by calculation of the mean over 50,000 random bootstraps using MATLAB. Fitting of the concentration-response curves and repeated measure ANOVA were performed using Prism 9 (GraphPad). For receptor enrichment at endosomes, we excluded cells with an enrichment value &gt;3 fold from the statistical analysis because such high enrichment values result from very low baseline and thus introduce excessive variability in the ∆F/F calculation. 3 cells in total were excluded in this manner, for the conditions DOR +agonist (#3318) compared to vehicle (p-value 0.0763 if included), MOR +agonist (#2782) compared to vehicle (p-value 0.0071 if included), DOR +DMSO (#3120) compared to DOR +Cmpd101 (p-value 0.48 if included), and are highlighted in the accompanying figure dataset.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Software</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All procedures were performed according to the National Institutes of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the University of California San Francisco Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol number AN185688).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-81298-mdarchecklist1-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>Supplementary files Figure 1- 6 contain the numerical data used to generate the figures.

printed on a uPrint plus (Stratasys) from AMS plastic, the.stl file necessary for this part is provided. We recommend the use of black material for the insert to minimize artifacts of fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2A</xref>). A rubber O-ring (15 mm internal diameter, 1 mm thickness) is installed at the bottom of the insert, these are standard and can be found at any hardware store (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2B</xref>). After 3D printing of the part and extensive washing with water (typically a day in &gt;500 ml water with multiple replacement of the water, to wash out any residual plastic and alkaline solution), stimulation wires were set up on the insert. We recovered platinum wires (2x1.5 cm) from a broken electrophoresis device (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2C</xref>) and soldered to about 5 cm standard electrical hookup wire (2 per insert, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2D and E</xref>). The wire is inserted into a cut 10 ul pipet tip such that the platinum wires protrude from the tip opening while the solder and attached hookup wire stay inside. We then cut another 10 ul pipet tip and inserted it in the one containing the electrical wire, to squeeze it and secure the wire in place (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2F and G</xref>). The platinum wire is bent 90 degrees from the cut pipet tip and inserted into the appropriate semi-open cylinder, with repeat for other electrode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2H1</xref>). Using small tweezers, shape the platinum wire so it follows the bottom of the insert and secure the end into the appropriate hole in the insert (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2K and L</xref>). The stimulation wires are separated by 1 cm once set up.

The pinout shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref> is for an Arduino Mega2560 but any Arduino board should work. We use a 30 V regulated ‘wall wart’ DC power supply to drive the stimulator output and adjust output manually using a 1 kΩ potentiometer as a voltage divider; any buffered constant voltage source that supplies ~30 V at up to ~50 mA should do. The electrical wires of the insert are connected to the zapomatic output using a BNC cable terminated with alligator test clips (see Appendix 1-figure 5G). The voltage and current levels used here are not dangerous but caution is advised to avoid damage in the event of a wiring fault. Individuals lacking skill in electrical construction may want to consult an experienced colleague; the end user is solely responsible for assuring safety to individuals and equipment, and for addressing any issues regarding local electrical code compliance.</p><fig id="app1fig3" position="float"><label>Appendix 1—figure 3.</label><caption><title>circuit diagram of the zapomatic.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-81298-app1-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><p>The provided Arduino code “Dam100AP” is uploaded as firmware to the Arduino. The board receives a TTL high signal from the camera trigger output and counts the number of frames. Once a user-defined frame number is reached (here 59), the zapomatic fires electrical pulses through the BNC connect at a user-defined pulse/frequency/duration (here 100x1ms pulses at 10 Hz). The intensity of electrical stimulation is adjusted using the potentiometer, measured with an oscilloscope connected in parallel from the stimulator BNC output to achieve a stimulus field intensity of 10–12 V/cm. The zapomatic counter resets after the firing sequence, and the zapomatic will fire again any time it reaches the count threshold (just once with our acquisition setting). A manual button on the device can be pushed to trigger firing manually. A LED indicates when the device is firing (same frequency/duration).</p><p>Care may be required to appropriately ground the stimulator circuit, depending on your stage setup or associated equipment; the opto-isolated output stage is amenable to flexible grounding. Placing an LED in series with the stimulator output can be convenient. If the LED appears dim when firing, this suggests insufficient current flow in the circuit. Poor current flow can occur due to a poor mechanical connection at the electrodes, such as failure at a solder joint or oxidation on the electrode; check connections and interfaces for proper conductivity.</p><p>Frame count is programmed to reset to 0 after 10 s in the absence of a TTL camera pulse.</p><p>If counting frames directly from the camera’s TTL output, for consistency we recommend disconnecting the zapomatic input or turning off its firing switch until ready to start acquisition.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s9-3"><title>Setting up the insert</title><p>The perfusion is based on gravity flow from up to 3 different solution sources, each line consisting of an assembly of (from top to bottom): syringe (containing the solution), a 0.45 μm filter, a manual valve, tubing, and ending with a 10 ul pipet tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">Appendix 1—figure 4</xref>). A separate vacuum line to remove solution need to be setup and attached to tubing ending with a 10 ul tip. We used two 30 ml syringes filled up with ~35 ml of solution. One contained control imaging solution (HEPES buffered saline solution (HBS) adjusted to pH 7.4 containing, in mM: NaCL 120, KCl 2, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 2, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 2, Glucose 5, HEPES 10 and osmolarity was adjusted to 270 mOsm), the other HBS +drug (typically DAMGO or DADLE at 10 μM). Syringes are placed vertically so the filter is at about the height of the stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">Appendix 1—figure 4H</xref>). When setting up, use the syringe piston to suction the air trapped in the filter (valve closed), load the whole line with solution, and remove any air bubble. When opening the manual valve solution flows from the end of the line by gravity, adjust the differential in heights between the top of the solution in the syringe and the insert to adjust the flow. In this setting the perfusion runs at about 1.5 ml per minute and we readjust the volume between acquisitions.

The dish is brought to the microscope from incubator (37 °C 5% CO2) and media inside the dish removed as extensively as possible while not approaching the suction close to the glass part to prevent drying of the live cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">Appendix 1—figure 5D</xref>). The plastic part of the dish is further dried using a rolled kimwipe (important to make a good seal), and the insert pressed onto the dish. Do not release the pressure until the end of installation. Setup the perfusion lines in the appropriate entries and open the valve for the vehicle solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">Appendix 1—figure 5E</xref>). Wait for it to flow above the platinum wires and place the vacuum line in the appropriate hole. The insert is designed for strong suction such as a vacuum pump connected to a waste container. Suction should be steady and volume inside the insert constant, weak suction can result in changes in volume of solution inside the insert which cause focus issues. This insert left a dead volume of 300 ml inside the imaging dish. Once the perfusion and vacuum lines are setup, place the rubber to secure the dish and place the dish holder on the stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">Appendix 1—figure 5F</xref>), and use the alligator test clips to connect the electrodes to the zapomatic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">Appendix 1—figure 5G</xref>). If using a different dish holder, we recommend you clamp the insert on the dish to prevent movement. The acquisition is ready to start, make sure the solution lines are never empty. At the end of the acquisition, remove the solution and vacuum lines from the insert, place the ruber bands on the blocks away from the insert, and pop the dish out of the holder by pressing the dish holder on something into the objective opening. Gently take the insert out of the dish being extra careful to not displace the electrodes and use scalpel or any flat blade to remove the grease from the insert (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">Appendix 1—figure 5I</xref>), finish cleaning the bottom of the insert with a kimwipe. After each day of acquisitions, the perfusion lines are abundantly rinsed with distilled water (typically &gt;150 ml per line) with the insert and vacuum line in place in the last imaged dish. Using the plunger all lines are emptied from remaining water (pump air into the filter/tubing, remove syringe from the line, load air into the syringe, couple to line, push the plunger. Repeat a few times).</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s9-4"><title>Microscope and acquisition software</title><p>Imaging of presynaptic activity in striatal neurons that were nucleofected opioid receptors together with VAMP2-SEP was performed on a Nikon TE-2000 inverted microscope, objective was a S Fluor 40x1.30 NA objective, an Andor iXon EM +EMCCD camera and a Bioptechs objective warmer.

A confusion matrix is displayed once the classifier is trained, and classifier is automatically saved in the current directory, “HogFFTclass.mat”.</p><p>Classifier will analyze all provided acquisitions, this mode does not run on parallel processing and is slow. To detect synapses, a sliding window operates with a 1.5*boxsize (parameter divwind, 1.5 is default) step and generates an image that is filtered for signal intensity (uniformly high signal or nearby “negative value” that indicate movement are excluded, line 273) and classified as synapse or not synapse. If classifier found a synapse, it will operate a 2D gaussian fit to center the localization of the synapse. Parameters of the gaussian fit are found on lines 287–289 and will need to be adjusted depending on your acquisition setting (typically create an average projection of your “synapse” sample and extract parameter from this). Script will then remove double detections (&lt;tooclose, 3 pixels is default).</p><p>For each movie it will generate a “MLsynHFA.txt” synapse coordinate file in the Folder X.Y of each acquisition.

You will to rename the files or change the code accordingly (lines 92–94). Enter “zap100Poolstdev” in the command window (“zap100Pool3stdev” if 3 movies).

I will expand here considering the 2 acquisitions and a note can be found for 3 acquisitions paradigm at the end. Code needs “numinputdlg” script to run a prompt for parameters, alternatively delete lines 50–59 and input parameters manually in lines 41–47. While a number of parameters are embedded in the code for the sake a more friendly user interface, I will provide line numbers for these.</p><p>Code will analyze each acquisition, normalize and pool the data for the whole condition, and normalize again. Details of the operations are found below:</p><p>For each acquisition, code will generate a.xlsx file containing multiple tabs</p><p>First tab contains the parameters, the defaults are:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>First stimulation: default 59, in our setting, marks the beginning of the stimulation</p></list-item><list-item><p>Size of the synapse: default 5, radius in pixels around synapse coordinates in which the fluorescence measurement is done</p></list-item><list-item><p>baseline: default 6, number of frames before stimulation to define fluorescence baseline</p></list-item><list-item><p>Amplitude: default 5, number of frames to define the amplitude of fluorescence increase after stimulation</p></list-item><list-item><p>Stimulation: default is 10, length of stimulation in frames.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Frames in NH4Cl: default 5, to define fluorescence in NH4Cl.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Threshold Amplitude: default 5, to select only responsive synapses.</p></list-item></list><p>How these numbers are used for quantification is explained below.</p><p>For each coordinates, the script will calculate raw fluorescence values (average fluorescence in a circle of radius “Size of synapse”) and subtract the average fluorescence in the user defined background region. This appears in two tabs with “_raw” added at the end of the movie file name.</p><p>The script then normalizes the fluorescence values for each synapse. To do so it defines the baseline fluorescence as the median fluorescence value between the frames “first stimulation – baseline” and “first stimulation”. Baseline fluorescence value is subtracted from raw values. Script will calculate the average raw fluorescence of the last 5 frames of the NH4 application, and this value is used to divide the baseline subtracted raw fluorescence values, for the two movies. This appears in two tabs with “_NH4norm” at the end, normalized fluorescence over fluorescence in NH4.</p><p>In these tabs there are two extra columns at the very end that are labelled “amplitude” and “STAMP”. These values are only used for classifying synapses as responsive. Amplitude is the average of _NH4norm fluorescence between the frames (First stim +Stim) and (First stim +Stim + Amplitude), with the 20% highest and 20% lowest values excluded (line 247) to minimize noise. “STAMP” corresponds to this amplitude value divided by the standard deviation of the baseline _NH4norm fluorescence between the frames “first stimulation – baseline” and “first stimulation”.</p><p>Based on these calculations, a number of synapses are excluded.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Synapses that have values above the NH4 average value before NH4 is applied (20 frames, line 215).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Synapses that contain 1 or more saturated pixel (value &gt;16,300 based on 14 bits, line 215) during the last NH4 frames.</p></list-item></list><p>These two categories of synapses will appear in the tab “_removed” of the excel file with a value 1 for “saturation”.</p><p>-Synapses for which STAMP &lt;Threshold for the first acquisition, this is to remove structures detected as synapses that do not respond to the stimulation (low signal to noise). This will appear in the tab “_removed” of the excel file with a value 1 for “amplitude”.</p><p>The two remaining tabs are labeled “_final” for each movie and contain the quantifications only for the synapse that passed these exclusion criteria.</p><p>For each condition, the script will pool data from this single-acquisition analysis and perform another normalization for the whole condition folder, the results are found in a “_std_Pool.xlsx” file.</p><p>All quantifications for synapses that have been validated are pooled into two tabs, one for each movie (1<sup>st</sup> Stim, 2<sup>Nd</sup> Stim), with the name of the corresponding acquisition file in the first column. Last column represents the amplitude of the response as defined previously. Average curves +/-SEM presented in the manuscript were obtained from this dataset.</p><p>For each acquisition/movie, an average of fluorescence and amplitude for validated synapses is calculated, this appears in the tabs “1<sup>st</sup> cell, 2<sup>nd</sup> cell”, as well as the number of validated synapses for each acquisition “n”. Reminder, the average amplitude here is not what was used for final quantification, we choose to quantify the amplitude of the average fluorescence - not the average of the amplitudes, to improve signal to noise. This is explained below.</p><p>For each acquisition, we therefore obtain two normalized over NH4 fluorescence curves for validated synapses (1<sup>st</sup> movie baseline, 2<sup>nd</sup> movie +drug, usually). We here define the amplitude of the average as the maximum fluorescence value between the frames (First stim +Stim) and (First stim +Stim + Amplitude), that is calculated for each movie. This appears into the “final” tab of the excel file under “Max Amp”, for each movie (1<sup>st</sup> STIM, 2<sup>Nd</sup> STIM). Average fluorescence curves for each movie are normalized to the Max Amp value of the first (control) acquisition and displayed into this “final” tab, as well as averages and SEM value for the whole condition. To define the degree of inhibition in the present manuscript, we only considered acquisitions with at least 50 validated synapses and used the ratio such that the percentage of inhibition is given by:</p><p>100*(1-(Max Amp(2<sup>nd</sup> movie) / Max Amp (1<sup>st</sup> movie, control))).</p><p>In the 3 movies/acquisition paradigm, we used “<bold>zap100Pool3stdev</bold>”, with folder containing 1 baseline movie “1_1.tif”, 1 drug movie “1_2.tif”, 1 drug movie +NH4 at the end “1_3.tif”, 1 synapse.txt coordinate file “ZAP”.

The authors specifically examine how the inhibition of transmitter release is changed following prolonged exposure to saturating concentrations of agonists and they showed convincingly that there is a depletion of plasma membrane-associated receptors and suggest that the decline in receptors at the plasma membrane underlies presynaptic tolerance. This work addresses a long-standing question about how tolerance develops at the presynaptic level and indicates that the location of receptors is critically important in the development of tolerance. This work is fundamental and a game changer in the understanding of tolerance at the cellular level.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81298.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Shen</surname><given-names>Kang</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00f54p054</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Stanford University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Williams</surname><given-names>John T</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/009avj582</institution-id><institution>Oregon Health and Science University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Banghart</surname><given-names>Matthew Ryan</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/0168r3w48</institution-id><institution>University of California, San Diego</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Ingram</surname><given-names>Susan L</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02hh7en24</institution-id><institution>University of Colorado Denver</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.06.15.496340">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.15.496340v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

We performed the experiment suggested by reviewer 1, including concentration ranging from 0.1nM to 10uM. The resulting concentration-response curves show a reduction in potency and to a lesser degree in efficacy after chronic DAMGO treatment. We think this is consistent with our hypothesis that presynaptic tolerance is driven by depletion of the total axonal receptor reserve.

We have indeed attempted to do this but, in striatal cultures prepared from the embryonic rat brain, we find that opioid receptors are endogenously expressed only in a small fraction of neurons – on the order of several percent. This is far from what is observed in the adult brain or acute slice preparations.</p><p>We deliberately use an electroporation method which results in recombinant expression levels lower than typically achieved using lipid-mediated transfection or viral transduction. In a previous study we assessed, using an anti-MOR antibody, the expression level of recombinant MOR achieved using our method in cultured striatal neurons to that of endogenous receptors in primary neurons prepared from several brain regions (striatum, hippocampus, habenula; Jullié et al., Neuron 2020, figure S1, cited in the manuscript). Our results suggested that electroporation yields levels similar to endogenous levels in cultured habenula neurons. Admittedly, this is a brain region in which a large number of neurons express MOR at a high level. Although we think this likely exceeds endogenous for some brain regions, we are confident that the expression levels are within the (wide) physiological range. We are also confident that our assay system can detect presynaptic inhibition mediated by endogenous MOR. We have verified this in habenula cultures at the overall population level (where this is possible due to a larger proportion of neurons expressing endogenous MOR). Based on our results with recombinant receptors, tolerance for MOR is associated with a ~30% reduction in the degree of MOR mediated presynaptic inhibition. The signal for presynaptic MOR inhibition, and its reduction after induction of tolerance, is therefore diluted to levels that make it experimentally challenging to distinguish from noise, even in habenula cultures. Accordingly, we view the present experimental model as one that is well suited for mechanistic investigation of presynaptic tolerance, but not one that necessarily replicates physiology.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the level of opioid receptor expression likely would impact the magnitude and/or kinetics of tolerance development. According to our model, and general pharmacological principles, we would expect overexpression to reduce the amount or rate of tolerance development. This is supported by our data indicating that reducing receptor reserve increases measured tolerance. Thus, if anything, overexpression of receptors would be expected to mask tolerance rather than accentuate it. Nevertheless, we detect profound tolerance, as is further supported by the new concentration-response data added to the revised manuscript. Thus we are confident that our experimental system models presynaptic tolerance and enables mechanistic investigation of this process, but we make no claim as to how the rate or magnitude of tolerance development measured in our cultured neuron system might relate to tolerance measured in a truly physiological system. In the revised manuscript we have attempted to be more clear about this important distinction, and we appreciate the Reviewer pointing it out.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) Figure legend 1A(3) mentions that opioid receptors inhibit Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry and subsequent exocytosis. In many presynaptic terminals, there is no evidence for opioid receptor inhibition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels playing a role, in fact, it is often suggested that there is a direct role for βγ subunits.

Alternatively, maybe remove this statement from the figure legend describing the diagram.</p></disp-quote><p>In the current study, the change in fluorescence is thought to result from calcium dependent exocytosis of synaptic vesicles containing the VAMP2-SEP reporter. In a previous study (Jullié et al., Neuron 2020, Figure S4 D) we confirmed in a similar experimental system that extracellular calcium was required for this increase in fluorescence. As the Reviewer points out, using a reporter of Ca<sup>2+</sup> instead of synaptic vesicle exocytosis would be one way to evaluate the contribution of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry blockade by opioid receptors on the inhibition of synaptic vesicle release. We note in this regard that a recent study did show opioid-mediated inhibition of calcium entry in terminals (He and al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2021, cited in the manuscript). Nevertheless, we agree that opioid receptors may inhibit synaptic transmission by more than one mechanism and that our data do not evaluate this. We thank the Reviewer for pointing this out, but note that our basic conclusions do not rely on a particular mechanism. Accordingly, in the revised manuscript, we have modified our diagram to simply remove the explicit depiction of calcium in an effort to avoid any over-interpretation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should comment on whether the dynamic range and resolution of the fluorescence detection of endocytosis could capture endogenous opioid receptor signaling.</p></disp-quote><p>The dynamic range of our system is indeed sufficient to detect presynaptic inhibition by endogenous receptors (Jullié et al., Neuron 2020 cited in the manuscript). However, as explained in response to Reviewer 2, the proportion of neurons that express endogenous opioid receptors in our embryonic striatal culture preparations is (surprisingly) low. This reduces the sensitivity of our system for endogenous receptor effects based on aggregate measurements. We added a paragraph in the revised version of the manuscript addressing these limitations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In the time course studies, p values are given on the right axis but appear to be generated from t-tests at each time point. Are these repeated measures on the same cultures with pictures taken at different agonists' times?

We also agree that the multiple statistics included needlessly cluttered the previous presentation. As the Reviewer suggested, we performed repeated measure ANOVA tests for all corresponding experiments. This analysis supports our conclusion for all but one condition, DOR + DADLE compared to DOR + vehicle, which is our strongest phenotype for agonist induced receptor internalization. The returned p-value is 0.0763, slightly above the significance threshold. We attribute this to one particular cell in the dataset (#3318) which exhibits an unusually high recruitment phenotype (&gt;3 fold, ~2 folds the average measured recruitment). We recognize that the method employed for this quantification (based on calculation of fluorescence ratio) is subject to considerable cell to cell variability, in particular for cells that exhibit a very low baseline fluorescence over which quantification of the enrichment degree appears out of the normal range. This is the case upon review of primary measurements for this particular cell. The net effect is to add error despite the high enrichment value being fully consistent with our claim (agonist-induced accumulation of receptors in endosomes). For consistency, we decided to exclude from the statistical analysis all cells that exhibit such high (&gt;3-fold) enrichment values. This results in exclusion of 3 cells in total and no more than any one condition. We explicitly explain this choice in the method section. The cells excluded by this criterion are DOR + agonist (#3318) compared to vehicle (p-value 0.0763 if included), MOR + agonist (#2782) compared to vehicle (p-value 0.0071 if included), DOR + DMSO (#3120) compared to DOR + Cmpd101 (p-value 0.48 if included). Accordingly, we believe that our exclusion is experimentally justified. It is also experimentally conservative in the case of the DOR + agonist condition (same trend as explained above) and, for the two other exclusions, there is no impact whatsoever.</p></body></sub-article></article>
