drive cochlear fluid circulation. The hypothesis was tested by delivering the neurotoxin, kainic acid, to the intact round window of young gerbil cochleae while monitoring auditory responses in the cochlear nucleus. Sounds presented at a modest level significantly expedited kainic acid delivery. When outer-hair-cell motility was suppressed by salicylate, the facilitation effect was compromised. A low-frequency tone was more effective than broadband noise, especially for drug delivery to apical locations. Computational model simulations provided the physical basis for our observation, which incorporated solute diffusion, fluid advection, fluid–structure interaction, and outer-hair-cell motility. Active outer hair cells deformed the organ of Corti like a peristaltic tube to generate apically streaming flows along the tunnel of Corti and basally streaming flows along the scala tympani. Our measurements and simulations coherently suggest that active outer hair cells in the tail region of cochlear traveling waves drive cochlear fluid circulation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>gerbil</kwd><kwd>cochlea</kwd><kwd>outer hair cell</kwd><kwd>drug delivery</kwd><kwd>organ of Corti</kwd><kwd>kainic acid</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DC020150</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nam</surname><given-names>Jong-Hoon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Inner-ear drug delivery experiments show that the fluids in the cochlea circulate due to the peristaltic action of motile auditory receptor cells.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The inner-ear labyrinth is filled with two lymphatic fluids, the perilymph and endolymph. An electrochemical potential difference between the two lymphatic fluids drives hair-cell mechano-transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fettiplace and Kim, 2014</xref>). Although the inner-ear fluid system is connected to the cerebrospinal fluid of the brain through the cochlear and vestibular aqueducts and to the vascular system across the blood–labyrinth barrier, inner-ear fluid is virtually isolated from other body-fluid systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Salt et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ohyama et al., 1988</xref>). Consequently, intervening in hearing health by delivering substances to the inner-ear fluid through the systemic circulation is challenging. The maintenance of inner-ear fluid composition is achieved locally by the secretion and absorption of ions and molecules through inner-ear epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wangemann and Marcus, 2017</xref>). As inner-ear fluid homeostasis is maintained locally, longitudinal electro-chemical gradients, including the endocochlear potential, may vary along the cochlear length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schulte and Schmiedt, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sadanaga and Morimitsu, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hirose and Liberman, 2003</xref>).</p><p>The inner-ear fluid has been reported to be stationary, unlike other lymphatic fluids in the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Salt and Hirose, 2018a</xref>). Thus, it is considered that substance transport in the inner-ear fluid is governed by diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Salt and Plontke, 2005</xref>). Diffusion is an effective mechanism for a substance to travel along sub-micrometer distances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Berg, 1993</xref>). For instance, considering the diffusion speed of small molecules in water, it takes microseconds for neurotransmitters to diffuse across a 20 nm synaptic gap. In contrast, diffusion is inefficient for travel on the centimeter scale. It takes days for a drug applied at the round window to travel 30 mm to the apical end of the human cochlea. In practice, the substance would not reach the apex because it would be resorbed before traveling this distance. Studies on inner-ear drug delivery confirm this principle of physics: longitudinal mass transport along the inner-ear labyrinth is challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Salt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lukashkin et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The two membranous openings of the inner ear, the oval and round windows, are sites for noninvasive local delivery of substances into the inner ear. Intratympanic injections of antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs have been attempted to manage inner-ear disorders despite limited efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lavigne et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Salt and Plontke, 2018b</xref>). Releasing a substance at the end of a long, closed tube forms a steep gradient of concentration. Consequently, the substance does not reach distant regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Salt and Hirose, 2018a</xref>), whereas, in the vicinity of drug release, the concentration is much higher than desired. One remedy is to inject fluid by making two perforations in the inner ear—one for intruding and the other for extruding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Borkholder et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tandon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Talaei et al., 2019</xref>). Such an invasive approach is often associated with the injection of a substantial fluid volume, larger than the entire perilymph in the inner ear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Szeto et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The tube-shaped organ of Corti (OoC) is lined with motile outer hair cells that are activated systematically with a large phase velocity (greater than a few m/s) toward the apex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Olson et al., 2012</xref>). A previous study suggests that outer-hair-cell motility can cause oscillatory fluid motion along the triangular fluid channel within the OoC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Karavitaki and Mountain, 2007</xref>). Recent measurements of OoC vibrations provide a possible explanation for how this longitudinal fluid flow is generated: outer hair cells operate like an area motor by deforming the OoC cross-sectional area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jabeen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Guinan, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lin et al., 2024</xref>). Outer hair cells boost the OoC vibrations over the entire span of the traveling waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cooper et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">He et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fallah et al., 2019</xref>). In theory, peristaltic deformation of the OoC could induce non-oscillatory streaming along the tunnel of Corti (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shokrian et al., 2020</xref>). This peristaltic motion of the OoC has not been explored experimentally.</p><p>We hypothesized that outer hair cells agitated by sounds could induce advection of the cochlear fluids. To test this hypothesis, the transport of a neurotoxin along the scala tympani was measured. Kainic acid irreversibly damages afferent synapses with inner hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sun et al., 2001</xref>). Importantly, kainic acid does not affect the hair cells, unlike other popular substances used for inner-ear drug-delivery experiments, such as streptomycin and salicylate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Salt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lukashkin et al., 2020</xref>). Kainic acid (10 mM) was administered at the round-window niche in young gerbils. Multichannel electrodes were inserted into the anteroventral cochlear nucleus (AVCN) to monitor drug effect along the tonotopic axis. The relation between the drug’s effect time and location was obtained while controlling sound and activity of outer hair cells, two factors that have not been considered in previous drug-delivery studies. To provide theoretical support for experimental observations, computer models were used to simulate inner-ear drug delivery in three steps: the virtual cochlea simulated OoC vibrations due to sound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhou and Nam, 2019</xref>) the Navier–Stokes equation including a nonlinear convective term was solved to obtain the drift of the Corti and scala fluids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shokrian et al., 2020</xref>) and the diffusion-advection equation was solved to simulate the spatiotemporal change of kainic acid concentration in the cochlear fluids.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Outer-hair-cell motility and sound properties, such as frequency, level, and bandwidth, were the parameters that we hypothesized to affect drug delivery. Testing these quantities and their combinations requires an extensive series of experiments. In this study, we present a control case and four test cases to focus on two major questions: whether sounds and outer-hair-cell motility affect inner-ear drug delivery. The control experiment was the drug delivery in near silence (‘Silence’). The test cases included (1) broadband sounds (0.1–12 kHz, 60 or 75 dB sound pressure level [SPL]) presented during drug delivery (‘Sound’), (2) the same broadband sounds presented, but with salicylic acid administered before kainic acid application (‘post-SA’), or an 80 dB SPL pure-tone at either (3) 0.5 kHz (‘LF-tone’), or (4) 3–6 kHz (‘MF-tone’).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sounds affect inner-ear drug delivery</title><p>Before applying 10 mM kainic acid to the intact round window, the characteristic frequencies (CFs) of probing locations were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and D</xref>). Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) were measured before and after drug delivery to confirm no change in outer-hair-cell motility during the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and F</xref>). When pre- and post-delivery DPOAEs changed more than 5 dB at any frequency between 0.1 and 10 kHz, the results were excluded (four animals). In one set of experiments, over 90% of stimulus intervals were kept silent (approximately 55 s per minute, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). In the other experiments, broadband sounds at a modest level (0.1–12 kHz, 60–75 dB SPL) were played during over 90% of the stimulus intervals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>). Approximately 8% of time (4.6 s per minute) were used to acquire background neural activity and to measure responses to 30–40 dB SPL probe tones at three CFs. Under our experimental condition (4 µL of 10 mM kainic acid applied at the intact round window), neural responses were abolished after a few to several hundred minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and E</xref>). The effect time was defined as the latency following exposure at which the neural response dropped below 75% of its baseline value (t<sub>E</sub>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The drug effect was tonotopic, with higher CF locations being affected earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, the sound- and the silence-case response curves from similar CF locations (between 4.5 and 6.5 kHz) were averaged for comparison. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref> presents the drug delivery data as the effect time (t<sub>E</sub>) versus CF location. We acquired 34 data points from 13 gerbils for the sound protocol and 48 data points from 18 animals for the silence protocol.

If the sound effect on cochlear drug delivery depends on fluid agitation from outer-hair-cell motility, inhibiting the motility should produce effect times similar to the silent condition. To test this hypothesis, before delivering kainic acid, salicylic acid was administered intraperitoneally (200 mg/kg) to inhibit outer-hair-cell motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). DPOAEs were recorded before and after the salicylic acid application to confirm its effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and E</xref>). After salicylate injection, neural responses decayed for 20–30 min to reach a steady state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and F</xref>). Because the salicylate effect raised the hearing threshold, the probe-tone level was increased by 15–20 dB prior to kainic acid application (typically from 30 to 50 dB SPL; the discontinuity in the response curve near 70 min was due to this increase in the probe tone level). The red-dashed vertical lines of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and F</xref> indicate the timing of kainic acid application. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and G</xref> present only the kainic acid application responses (the time span after the dashed vertical lines in panels B and E). Note that 75 dB SPL broadband sounds were played in the post-SA protocol. The two examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–G</xref> also demonstrate the variance of the salicylate effect. In one case, DPOAEs decreased by &lt;10 dB (re: 40 dB stimulation) and the neural responses to 30 dB SPL sound decreased by 40% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In the other case, DPOAEs decreased by approximately 20 dB, and the neural responses to 30 dB SPL sound decreased to the noise floor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). For the post-SA protocol, we acquired 24 data points from eight animals. The post-kainate response decay of salicylate-treated ears followed the trend of the silence case despite use of the sound protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>).

Like the silence versus sound protocols comparison, the statistical difference was from the mid-CF locations, not from low-CF locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>).

Vibrations along the cochlear partition propagate with decaying phase velocity toward the apex, before stalling shortly after reaching the sound’s CF location. The advective flow of the cochlear fluid is shaped by the vibration frequency and amplitude and by the phase velocity of traveling waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lighthill, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shokrian et al., 2020</xref>). To test the hypothesis that the type of sound stimulus impacts the effectiveness of drug delivery, especially in low-frequency regions, pure-tones at 80 dB SPL were played during inner-ear drug delivery, instead of broadband noise. In choosing the frequency of the pure tone, we considered the nature of cochlear traveling waves, guided by fluid-dynamics simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhou and Nam, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shokrian et al., 2020</xref>). The frequency of 0.5 kHz was chosen close to the low bound of the gerbil’s audible frequency range. The mid-frequency was selected from between 3 and 6 kHz to match the CF location of one of the electrode probes. High frequencies were not tested because they would not affect drug delivery to the apex of the cochlea (i.e., the traveling waves stop near the CF location.) If the sound facilitation were most prominent near the peak of traveling waves, the low-frequency tone would be inefficient in facilitating drug delivery to high- to mid-CF locations. Whereas, if the phase velocity were crucial for fluid agitation, the low-frequency sound should be advantageous because of its long tail region with high phase velocity. If the traveling wave pattern set the cochlear fluid flow, the sound-facilitation effect could stall at one location, similar to the traveling waves.</p><p>With the pure-tone protocol, 45 data points were acquired from 15 gerbils. In two example cases, the effect time at low-CF locations (CFs near 2 kHz) was 15 min for the case of the 0.5 kHz tone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and 100 min for the 3.5 kHz tone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In the mid-CF locations, the effect time did not differ for different tone frequencies: the effect time ranged between 8 and 12 min for CF locations between 5.9 and 6.3 kHz (red curves of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). In some cases, especially toward the low-CF locations, the response curve had bimodal decay patterns (e.g., the cyan curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), resulting in a broader distribution in the effect time. The overall plots of effect time versus location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>) show that most data points are below the trend line of the control (silence) case. That is, the pure-tone stimulation facilitated the delivery throughout the cochlea. According to the statistical analysis of effect time differences between the silence and the pure-tone protocols (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), low-frequency tones facilitated the drug delivery for both low- (p&lt;0.001) and mid-CF locations (p=0.011).

Although the mean effect time of the 75 dB SPL data was smaller than for 60 dB SPL in the mid-CF region, supporting the sound-facilitation hypothesis, a larger sample number will be required to confirm the effect of sound level. The sound effect disappeared after inhibiting outer-hair-cell motility with salicylate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>).

Our computer model is distinguished from most cochlear mechanics models in three aspects. First, it incorporates the interactions between the Corti fluid and OoC structures. Second, the nonlinear advection term in the Navier–Stokes equation was not neglected. Finally, both diffusion and fluid advection were considered. Our simulated results support the hypothesis that the cross-sectional area change of the OoC performs like a peristaltic pump (i.e., active outer hair cells are the fluid pumps) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shokrian et al., 2020</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> shows half of the cochlear fluid space—the scala tympani and the OoC fluid spaces (omitting the scala media and scala vestibuli). We simulated two cases: in the silence case, the drug delivery was purely governed by diffusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In the LF-tone case, both diffusive and advective mass transports contributed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–D</xref>). For the LF-tone case, a 1 kHz tone at 80 dB SPL sound was played continuously. The contours in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref> represent the concentration of the substance at 30 min after the onset of delivery. As expected from Fick’s law and the log-scale plots of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, the gradient over distance decays logarithmically. That is, contour lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> have similar spacings in the log scale. However, such a logarithmic gradient was apparently disturbed between the 0.1 and 0.01 mM contour lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>. The contour line is stretched toward the right (red double-headed arrow) in the top Corti fluid layer and to the left (blue arrow) in the bottom scala fluid layer. This stretched contour line was due to the advective flow. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>, the contour lines represent the streamlines (i.e., particles would drift along the contour lines).

The maximum streaming velocity is as substantial as a few mm/s. Our simulation shows that active outer hair cells generate a strong stream toward the apex along the tunnel of Corti. The displaced fluid in the apex flows toward the base along the bottom of the scala tympani. The strong advection takes place in the tail of the traveling wave, over a few mm.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Active outer hair cells drive fluid flow.</title><p>Inner-ear drug delivery was simulated using a computational model.

Sound-facilitated drug delivery was compromised when outer-hair-cell motility was inhibited. Low-frequency tones were more effective than broadband noise in delivering substances to the apex of the cochlea. These results not only highlight new strategies for improving drug delivery throughout the cochlear spiral, but reveal a new function of outer hair cells, beyond sound amplification.</p><p>Neural responses near CF are amplified, showing enhanced tuning. In contrast, outer hair cells boost the vibrations in the OoC non-selectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cooper et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">He et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fallah et al., 2019</xref>). To reconcile the nonselective input (untuned OoC vibrations) and the selective output (tuned neural signals), previous studies suggest that outer hair cells accumulate their power along cochlear traveling waves, referred to as global amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zagadou and Mountain, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">He et al., 2022</xref>). However, experimental evidence is incongruent with the global amplification theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fisher et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Versteegh and van der Heijden, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dewey et al., 2019</xref>). According to the two-tone suppression experiment of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dewey et al., 2019</xref>, the suppression of outer hair cells far basal from the CF location does not affect the response at the CF location. Available evidence shows that the amplification due to outer-hair-cell action occurs between a location one half-octave basal to the peak and the peak location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dong and Olson, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fallah et al., 2019</xref>). The present study provides new insights into the nonselective outer hair cell action.</p><p>Broadband action of outer hair cells helps cochlear-fluid circulation. Our pure-tone experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) show that the region of sound-facilitated drug delivery spanned regions far basal to the CF location of a given sound frequency. Such sound facilitation disappeared when outer-hair-cell motility was suppressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), which implied that active outer hair cells are the stirrers in the cochlea that drive lymphatic-fluid circulation. From an evolutionary perspective, mammals stretched their hearing organ to encode broader bandwidth with good frequency resolution. The longer cochlea might have entailed a challenge: maintaining the freshness of the stationary lymph along a long and narrow tube is nontrivial. For instance, a local failure in homeostasis could cascade along the cochlea, making the system vulnerable to disturbance or trauma. The OoC in the basal cochlea suffers from a maintenance burden: a greater influx of potassium (greater MET current) and a smaller clearance surface. We hypothesize that the longitudinal circulation of lymphatic fluid serves as a protective mechanism for the fluid homeostasis of the mammalian cochlea. One potential implication is that an acoustically rich environment could be beneficial in maintaining healthy hearing as well as recovering from damaged hearing.</p><p>Our study complements existing studies regarding cochlear fluid homeostasis and differs from previous studies in several ways. The intrastrial fluids (extracellular fluids in the stria vascularis) have been more thoroughly investigated because the three layers in the stria vascularis (marginal, intermediate, and basal cells) maintain the endocochlear potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wangemann, 2006</xref>). Equilibrium in the Corti fluid has been sparsely investigated because its electrochemical gradient is modest compared to that of the intrastrial fluids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Johnstone et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zidanic and Brownell, 1990</xref>). Local electrochemical balance in the cochlear fluids has been considered within a radial section (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Quraishi and Raphael, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Patuzzi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nin et al., 2012</xref>). Our study is focused on the longitudinal (global) equilibrium along the cochlear coil and did not consider the equilibrium across the stria vascularis cell layers. To examine whether the longitudinal fluid flow driven by outer hair cells is strong enough to affect cochlear fluid homeostasis, future studies should measure the K<sup>+</sup> equilibrium and recycling along the length of the Corti fluid under sound and silence conditions.</p><p>The nature of the streaming pattern supports the feasibility of targeted inner-ear drug delivery. Two characteristics implicated in the pure-tone experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) became apparent in the model simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>): the advection caused by active outer hair cells created a ‘fast track’ and a ‘stalling point’ for mass transport. For instance, the span between locations 5.5 and 9 mm is the fast track of mass transport (the arrows of concentration contours in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and the clockwise advective flow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In this fast track, the distance between contour lines is much larger than the other regions or the pure diffusion case. The contour line in the fast track (black curve, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) is stretched toward the apex in and near the Corti fluid and toward the base at the bottom of the scala tympani, indicating longitudinal fluid circulation. In contrast to the fast-track region, there was a stalling point where the transport stopped. The stacking contours near 10 mm in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> are caused by the countering circulation loops at 9 mm in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>. Taking advantage of these ‘fast tracks’ and ‘stalling points’, one could design a sequence of sounds to deliver a substance from the round window to a targeted location in the cochlea.</p><p>Further work is needed before our findings can be used to address practical problems. Although we showed that low-frequency tone is superior to a high-frequency tone or a broadband sound in facilitating inner-ear drug delivery, we have not identified the optimal delivery scheme. While the gerbil cochlea is a better model to study longitudinal mass transport compared to the shorter mouse cochlea (12 mm versus 6 mm), substantial extrapolation is inevitable to predict drug delivery in the 34-mm-long human cochlea out of the present results. Extensive experiments would be needed to examine different SPLs at different frequencies and their combinations in a longer cochlea. Guidance from reliable theoretical models will help to design more efficient experiments and to interpret measured data more rigorously. Our present computer model incorporated the nonlinearity in advection-diffusion dynamics but did not implement the compressive nonlinearity of the sensitive cochlea. To analyze cochlear mass transport under stimulation by complex sounds, a model must address a long list of physical and physiological problems: deformable OoC, Corti fluid dynamics, nonlinear hair cell mechano-transduction, outer-hair-cell motility, permeable basilar membrane, nonlinear fluid dynamics including advection, diffusion solved simultaneously with advection, and the electrochemical equilibrium across the OoC. Our present model includes the essential components of these, but some are extensively simplified (e.g., outer-hair-cell motility, basilar membrane permeability), and some are absent (e.g., hair-cell nonlinearity, electrochemical equilibrium). Fortunately, there are other theoretical models that represent these aspects of cochlear physics and physiology that are lacking in our present study.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental approach</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Animal preparation</title><p>Sixty-four Mongolian gerbils (<italic>Meriones unguiculatus,</italic> 25 males and 39 females, Charles River Laboratories) of 2–3 months of age were used in the study.

After experiments, it was confirmed that the solution was still contained in the round window niche.

After 48 noise pips, one 1.1 s silent pause and three CF tone pips followed (a total of 51 pips and a pause make a 57.2 s sequence). The CF tone pips were presented at the level of 35 dB SPL to monitor neural responses. The silence pause was to monitor spontaneous neural responses. The sequence was repeated until neural signals at the lowest CF site were completely abolished. The neural responses presented in this study are the ‘driven responses’ obtained by subtracting the spontaneous responses from the responses to the 35 dB CF tones.

Different assumptions were used in each stage to represent the relevant physics appropriately and to make the computational analyses affordable. First, OoC vibration due to sound stimulation was estimated by solving fluid–structure interactions between scala fluids, the Corti fluid (extracellular fluid in the OoC) and the OoC. The active feedback from outer-hair-cell motility was incorporated into OoC mechanics. Second, the drift velocity of the fluids in the OoC and the scala tympani in response to OoC vibrations was computed. Drift velocity originates from the nonlinear convective term in the governing equations for the incompressible flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shokrian et al., 2020</xref>). The spatial resolution required to evaluate the drift velocity made this stage computationally costly. Unlike the first stage, the advective component of fluid motion was incorporated. The OoC vibrations obtained at the first stage were given as kinematic boundary conditions in this second stage. The fluid motion within the OoC, as well as in the scala tympani, was computed. Third, the spatiotemporal pattern of substance concentration due to advection and diffusion was obtained. The drift velocity field obtained in the second stage was the input for this third stage. The first and second stages were simulated using custom-written MATLAB programs, while the third stage was solved using commercially available software (COMSOL multiphysics).</p><sec id="s4-2-1"><title>OoC vibrations</title><p>The OoC complex structures were discretized into 3-D finite elements reflecting anatomical details. For instance, each hair bundle, hair cell, Deiters cell, or pillar cell was represented by a fully deformable beam. The tectorial and basilar membranes were presented by a meshwork of beams. Their mechanical properties were determined either by using known values or by comparing them with existing mechanical measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nam and Fettiplace, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Marnell et al., 2018</xref>). Mechano-transduction kinetics of hair bundle and outer-hair-cell electromotility were incorporated with the OoC finite-element model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nam and Fettiplace, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nam, 2014</xref>). The scala-fluid domain was discretized into linear quadrilateral elements. The scala-fluid pressure was determined by two vibrating boundaries—one is the oval window, and the other is the OoC complex. In turn, the OoC structures vibrate due to differential pressure across the OoC.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2"><title>Drift velocity of fluids</title><p>From the round window to the inner hair cell, kainic acid molecules travel (drift) across two fluid spaces separated by the basilar membrane: (1) the Corti fluid and (2) the scala-tympani fluid. The Corti fluid includes the fluid in the tunnel of Corti, Nuel’s space, gaps between outer hair cells, and the outer tunnel. These sub-spaces are interconnected to one another by a few micrometer gaps. For simplicity, the 3-D fluid spaces were reduced to 2-D after reducing the radial dimension. The top boundary of the 2-D Corti fluid was modeled as a deforming wall while the bottom surface shared with scala tympani was implemented as a permeable boundary representing the basilar membrane. The OoC deformation was represented by the relative motion between the top and bottom surfaces of the Corti fluid.

The second term in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref> representing advection renders this equation nonlinear. This term has been neglected in cochlear mechanics studies because it hardly contributes to forming the cochlear traveling waves. However, for the purpose of this work (to investigate cochlear mass transport due to advection), this term had to be incorporated despite the increased computational cost. The basilar membrane was considered to have finite permeability using Darcy’s law.

This time length was long enough to arrive at the periodic steady state. The mesh resolution for diffusion analysis was approximately 1 µm, resulting in about 225,000 first-order triangular elements.

The authors hypothesized that motile outer hair cells may facilitate cochlear fluid circulation. To test this hypothesis, they investigated the effects of acoustic stimuli and salicylate, an outer hair cell motility blocker, on kainic acid-induced changes in the cochlear nucleus activities. The results demonstrated that acoustic stimuli reduced the latency of the kainic acid effect, with low-frequency tones being more effective than broadband noise. Salicylate reduced the effect of acoustic stimuli on kainic acid-induced changes.

Cochlear outer hair cells have long been believed to be responsible for the exceptional sensitivity, sharp tuning, and huge dynamic range of mammalian hearing. However, recent observations of the broadband reticular lamina vibration contradict widely accepted view of frequency-specific cochlear amplification. Furthermore, there is currently no effective noninvasive method to deliver the drugs or genes to the cochlea, a crucial need for treating sensorineural hearing loss, one of the most common auditory disorders.

However, please include the key points from the responses to the comments (Introduction (3), (5) and Results 5) into the manuscript. While the explanations in the response letter are reasonable, the current descriptions in the manuscript may limit the reader's understanding. Expanding on these points in the Introduction, Results, or Discussion sections would enhance clarity and comprehensiveness.</p></disp-quote><p>Introduction (3): As inner-ear fluid homeostasis is maintained locally, longitudinal electro-chemical gradients, including the endocochlear potential, may vary along the cochlear length (Schulte and Schmiedt 1992; Sadanaga and Morimitsu 1995; Hirose and Liberman 2003).</p><p>Introduction (5): We do not want to distract the readers from the primary message by discussing different drug delivery methods into the inner ear.
