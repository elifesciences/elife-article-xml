Here, we show that Emx2 also regulates neuronal selection: afferent neurons innervate either Emx2-positive or negative HCs. In emx2 knockout and gain-of-function neuromasts, all HCs are unidirectional and the innervation patterns and physiological responses of the afferent neurons are dependent on the presence or absence of Emx2. Our results indicate that Emx2 mediates the directional selectivity of neuromasts by two distinct processes: regulating hair bundle orientation in HCs and selecting afferent neuronal targets.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hair bundle polarity</kwd><kwd>Vangl2</kwd><kwd>axonal guidance</kwd><kwd>afferent neuron</kwd><kwd>planar cell polarity</kwd><kwd>neuronal selection</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intramural Research Program Grant 1ZIADC000085-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kindt</surname><given-names>Katie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intramural Research Program Grant 1ZIADC000021</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Doris K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Emx2 mediates the directional selectivity of neuromasts by regulating hair bundle orientation in hair cells, and by selecting afferent neuronal targets.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The survival of any animal is dependent on accurate processing of environmental inputs via its sensory organs. Some aquatic animals have a specialized sensory organ or lateral line system that enables them to sense water pressure and the direction of water flow. The lateral line system is important for many survival behaviors such as prey detection, mating and predator avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Coombs and Conley, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Montgomery et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Engelmann et al., 2000</xref>). This sensory system is comprised of individual neuromasts distributed over the surface of the body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Each neuromast consists of a cluster of sensory HCs that sense the direction of water flow bi-directionally along either the anterior-posterior (A-P) or dorsal-ventral (D-V) axis of the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ghysen and Dambly-Chaudière, 2004</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35796.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Afferent neuronal innervation is correlated with Emx2 expression and hair bundle orientation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram of zebrafish neuromasts in the posterior lateral line showing HCs (magenta and yellow) in A-P (dark green) and D-V (light green) oriented neuromasts, which are innervated by neurons of the posterior lateral line ganglion (red).

First, specialized hair bundles that protrude from the top of the HCs are structured asymmetrically to enable directional sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Flock and Wersall, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">López-Schier et al., 2004</xref>). Each hair bundle is comprised of a staircase of actin-filled microvilli called stereocilia, located next to the kinocilium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Only deflections of the bundle towards its kinocilium open mechanotransduction channels on top of the stereocilia, which allow entry of positive ions and result in activation (depolarization) of the HC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shotwell et al., 1981</xref>). By contrast, deflections of the hair bundle in the opposite direction away from its kinocilium close mechanotransduction channels and result in inhibition (hyperpolarization). Thus, the two opposite orientations of the hair bundles within a neuromast provide its bi-directional sensitivity.</p><p>The second structural organization required to detect directional flow within neuromasts are the neurons of the lateral line ganglion. These neurons innervate neuromast HCs such that each neuron only innervates HCs that exhibit the same hair bundle orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nagiel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Faucherre et al., 2009</xref>). Although earlier results seem to be in conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nagiel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Faucherre et al., 2010</xref>), more recent work has consistently concluded that lateral line neurons select their HC targets independent of HC activity, based on studies in mutants that lack HC mechanotransduction or neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nagiel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pujol-Martí et al., 2014</xref>). These studies reduced the likelihood of an activity dependent model for innervation selection. However, the molecular mechanism(s) that determine how this directional selectivity is preserved at the level of neuronal innervation is not known.</p><p>Previous results have demonstrated that the orientation of hair bundles within neuromasts as well as vestibular maculae of the inner ear in both zebrafish and mice is controlled by the transcription factor, Emx2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>). In neuromasts, as each HC precursor divides to form two nascent HCs, Emx2 is only expressed in one of the two daughter cells. As a result, Emx2 is expressed in half of the HCs within a neuromast, and it functions to change the hair bundle orientation to approximately 180 degrees from the default state to generate a bi-directional hair bundle pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>). Due to the role of Emx2 in establishing directional selectivity at the HC level, we asked whether Emx2 is also involved in dictating this selectivity at the neuronal level. For our analyses, we examined the innervation pattern of single afferent neurons in both <italic>emx2</italic> knockout (ko) and gain of <italic>emx2</italic> function (gof, <italic>myo6b:emx2-mCherry</italic>) zebrafish mutants. Our results indicate that the expression of Emx2 in the HCs also enables afferent neurons to select their proper HC targets and preserve the directional selectivity of the neuromast. However, neuronal selectivity is not dependent on hair bundle orientation. In <italic>vangl2<sup>m209</sup></italic> mutants, in which hair bundles are randomly oriented, afferent neurons still segregate according to Emx2-positive and -negative HCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Directional selectivity of afferent neurons is correlated with Emx2 expression in HCs</title><p>In a wildtype neuromast, each afferent neuron only innervates HCs with apical hair bundles polarized in one of the two orientations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nagiel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Faucherre et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pujol-Martí et al., 2014</xref>). Emx2 is also expressed in HCs of just one orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>). Based on these results, we hypothesized that each afferent neuron should only innervate either Emx2 positive or negative HCs within a neuromast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we injected a <italic>neuroD:tdTomato</italic> plasmid into transgenic <italic>myo6b:actb1-GFP</italic> zebrafish embryos. This enabled us to visualize single afferent neurons labeled with tdTomato innervating a neuromast and the orientation of hair bundles labeled with Actb1-GFP. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> illustrates two such examples of wildtype neuromasts in the primary posterior lateral line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–J,K–R</xref>). These neuromasts contain HCs oriented along the anterior-posterior axis of the body. As previously demonstrated, in these neuromasts, Emx2 immunoreactivities are only detected in mature HCs with hair bundles oriented towards the posterior direction (A &gt; P, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,F–J,K,N–R</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>). Emx2 is also expressed in immature HCs that can be identified by weak GFP signals and/or incomplete bundle polarity establishment. Only one of the immature HCs within a pair expresses Emx2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–R</xref>, yellow arrow). Notably, we found that each single-labeled neuron either associated with all the Emx2-positive HCs in a neuromast (example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–J</xref>), or associated with all the Emx2-negative HCs in a neuromast (example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K–R</xref>). Based on the association of single afferent neurons with HCs that were either Emx2-positive or-negative, we hypothesized that Emx2, which is required for establishing the hair bundle orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>), may also be involved in regulating the pattern of neuronal innervation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Neuronal innervation patterns are altered in <italic>emx2</italic> mutants</title><p>To test the above hypothesis, we investigated the neuronal innervation pattern in neuromasts of loss and gain of <italic>emx2</italic> function zebrafish. We first generated wildtype and <italic>emx2</italic> mutant fish in an HGn39D transgenic background, in which all afferent neurons innervating each neuromast are GFP-positive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nagayoshi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Faucherre et al., 2009</xref>). We then injected these embryos with <italic>neuroD:tdTomato</italic> to label individual afferent neurons. This enabled us to examine the innervation pattern of single neurons in the context of the entire afferent processes beneath each neuromast. In wildtype neuromasts, fibers of a single-labeled <italic>neuroD:tdTomato</italic>-positive neuron only overlapped with a subset of the HGn39D-GFP-positive afferents and ramified approximately one half of the neuromast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>). By contrast, <italic>emx2</italic> ko neuromasts, in which all HCs are oriented towards the anterior direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,I</xref>, P &gt; A), showed an altered neuronal branching pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–H,J–L</xref>). The majority of the single neurons in <italic>emx2</italic> ko neuromasts showed a broader distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), when compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>). Despite these broader distributions, there were always some GFP-positive nerve endings that did not overlap with tdTomato signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–H</xref>, circles). Additionally, a smaller proportion of single fibers overlapped with less than half of the GFP-positive nerve endings in <italic>emx2</italic> ko neuromasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J–L</xref>), when compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>). We quantified the average percentage of overlap between tdTomato- and GFP-positive areas and found that in wildtype fish, the overlap by a single neuron is consistently around 50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2U</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). In contrast, single neurons in <italic>emx2</italic> ko clearly segregated into two populations and showed either dramatically more (70%) or less (20%) overlap than the wildtype neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2U</xref>, p=0.0016 for <italic>emx2</italic> ko major, p=0.0012 for <italic>emx2</italic> ko minor). Based on these measurements, we named the two populations major and minor axons, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2U</xref>). Similar major (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2N–P,U</xref>, p=0.0006) and minor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2R–T,U</xref>, p=0.0005) branching patterns were observed for <italic>emx2</italic> gof neuromasts, in which all HCs are oriented in the A &gt; P direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M,Q</xref>). The altered branching pattern of a single afferent neuron in both <italic>emx2</italic> ko and gof mutants suggests that in addition to establishing hair bundle orientation, Emx2 also regulates the pattern of neuronal innervation.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35796.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The branching pattern of a single afferent neuron in <italic>emx2</italic> mutant neuromasts is altered.</title><p>(<bold>A–D</bold>) A wildtype neuromast showing the seven A &gt; P and eight P &gt; A (red asterisks) HCs.

In <italic>emx2</italic> ko and gof neuromasts, in which all HCs have uni-directionally oriented bundles, we found that one population of afferent neurons can innervate more than half of the total number of HCs. These results suggest that these neurons have the capacity to innervate additional HCs of similar orientation based upon their availability. Nevertheless, our results also suggest that there is an upper limit to this capacity since a single neuron was unable to innervate all the HCs within a ko or gof <italic>emx2</italic> mutant neuromast. Coincidently, we also observed a smaller portion of single neurons innervating less than half of the total number of HCs in the <italic>emx2</italic> mutant neuromasts (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>What determines whether a neuron forms a major versus a minor innervation pattern in the mutant neuromasts? At least two models are consistent with our observations. We refer to these models as ‘exclusive’ and ‘inclusive’ based on the role of Emx2 in determining neuronal selectivity. In the exclusive model, the transcriptional activity downstream of Emx2 in HCs is sufficient to direct afferent innervation and determine the directional selectivity of each neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). In this model, there are no other cues within neuromasts or among the lateral line ganglion neurons that influence this decision, at least not initially. However, interaxonal cross-inhibition could occur after the initial contact with HCs that refines or maintains the segregated pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Changeux and Danchin, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Deppmann et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mizumoto and Shen, 2013</xref>). In this scenario, major and minor afferents in <italic>emx2</italic> mutants could arise due to timing; axons arriving at the neuromast first may innervate many cells and become major afferents. In contrast, axon that arrive slightly later may find fewer available HCs to innervate and thus become minor afferents.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35796.024</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Models of the regulation of afferent innervation patterns in the zebrafish neuromast.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) An Emx2 exclusive model. The first neuron (black) that reaches a normal neuromast innervates an Emx2-positive HC (magenta) due to specific downstream effectors of Emx2, which then set up the neuron’s preference for similar HCs. As Emx2-positive HCs become occupied, a late arriving neuron (gray) starts to innervate the unoccupied Emx2-negative HCs (yellow). Subsequent cross-inhibition between the early and late neurons may help to maintain the segregated pattern of innervation. In <italic>emx2</italic> mutants, the first neuron (black) that reaches the neuromast becomes a major neuron. As HCs become occupied, a later arriving neuron (grey) finds fewer available HCs and becomes a minor neuron. (<bold>B</bold>) In the Emx2 inclusive model, two intrinsically different types of neurons innervate the neuromast. Due to their molecular determinants, an A &gt; P neuron (magenta) prefers A &gt; P HCs (magenta) and a P &gt; A neuron (yellow) prefers P &gt; A HCs (yellow), thus establishing the directional selectivity of neurons. In <italic>emx2</italic> ko neuromasts, a P &gt; A neuron (yellow) expands its innervation pattern due to the increase in P &gt; A HCs and becomes a major neuron, whereas an A &gt; P neuron finds fewer P &gt; A HCs and forms a few synapses with P &gt; A HCs (or not). By contrast, in <italic>emx2</italic> gof neuromasts, an A &gt; P neuron becomes a major fiber and a P &gt; A neuron forms a minor neuronal fiber.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-35796-fig9-v2"/></fig><p>In the inclusive model, Emx2, though important, is not the only factor regulating neuronal selectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). For example, both pre- and post-synaptic signaling may be important to determine neuronal selectivity. In this scenario, major and minor innervation patterns in the <italic>emx2</italic> mutants may arise from the fact that afferent neurons that innervate A &gt; P HCs (A &gt; P neurons) are molecularly distinct from those that innervate P &gt; A HCs (P &gt; A neurons). In support of this notion, neurons that innervate Emx2-positive and -negative HCs in the mammalian maculae of the inner ear are most likely different from each other because their central axons project to different regions of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Maklad et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, neurons that innervate Emx2-positive and negative HCs in the lateral line system may also be molecularly different, similar to the neurons of the mouse maculae. Additionally, ample evidence from other systems indicates that specific synapse formation often requires partnering between pre- and post-synaptic signaling molecules such as ephrin-eph, semaphorin-plexin and other adhesion molecules (for review see, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sanes and Yamagata, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Margeta and Shen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Williams et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yogev and Shen, 2014</xref>). The selective innervation pattern of the lateral line afferent neurons may be analogous to other pre- and postsynaptic neuronal pairing, requiring a match between the HCs (expressing downstream effectors of Emx2 or the lack thereof) and respective molecular determinants from the postsynaptic afferent neurons. Moreover, the described interactions of cellular processes between nascent HCs and afferent nerve terminals of a neuromast during synaptogenesis also provide some morphological evidence that there could be specific HC-neuron coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dow et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Under the above inclusive scenario, the P &gt; A neurons in the <italic>emx2</italic> ko neuromasts identify molecular cues from an expanded number of P &gt; A HCs and become major afferents, whereas the A &gt; P neurons are unable to identify their molecular cues, since A &gt; P HCs are absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Without a molecular target, these A &gt; P neurons either form only a few synapses with P &gt; A HCs or fail to form any synapses at all and become minor afferents. Likewise, in the <italic>emx2</italic> gof neuromasts, the A &gt; P neurons expand their innervation pattern to accommodate the increase in A &gt; P HCs and become major afferents, while the P &gt; A neurons in the <italic>emx2</italic> mutant form minor innervation patterns. Previous axotomy studies showed that when all axons innervating a single neuromast were severed except one, the single remaining neuron was able to expand its innervation to HCs of the opposite orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pujol-Martí et al., 2014</xref>). As a result of this expanded innervation, the remaining neuron responded to hair bundle deflections from two directions instead of one. If we assume that there are indeed two types of neurons innervating a given neuromast, then the axotomy data taken together with our data on <italic>emx2</italic> mutants suggest that other permissive factor(s) in addition to Emx2 instruct synapse formation and can expand innervations beyond their intended targets. Nevertheless, the inclusive model is not limited to molecular differences between neurons and could include other determinants from HCs and/or supporting cells. Furthermore, under either the inclusive or exclusive model, we postulate that the main source of Emx2 for neuronal selectivity resides in the HCs because we cannot detect measurable <italic>emx2</italic> mRNA or protein in the lateral line ganglion using in situ hybridization or immunostaining.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Neurons of <italic>emx2</italic> mutant neuromasts showed predicted directional selectivity</title><p>Despite the altered innervation pattern observed in the <italic>emx2</italic> mutant neuromasts, our calcium imaging and extracellular neuronal recording results indicate that these neurons respond in the predicted manner according to the orientation of the HCs that they innervate; neurons of the <italic>emx2</italic> ko neuromasts only respond to stimulation in the P &gt; A direction because only P &gt; A HCs are present. Likewise, neurons of <italic>emx2</italic> gof neuromasts only respond to hair bundle stimulation in the A &gt; P direction.</p><p>Despite the increase in the amplitude of post-synaptic calcium signals within the entire afferent terminal in <italic>emx2</italic> mutant compared to controls, this increase did not translate into more evoked spikes at the level of a single afferent neuron, even though some of the neurons innervated more HCs than normal. What could account for these seemingly paradoxical results? It is possible that the increase in calcium signaling is not sufficient to elicit a change in spike number at the cell body level. It is also possible that due to the variability in our electrophysiology data, it may not be possible to resolve an overall increase in spike number in <italic>emx2</italic> mutant neurons. For example, the average number of spikes recorded from a single wildtype neuron shows a large range from 1 to 21 spikes (averages for 10 repeated 500 ms stimuli). It is not clear whether these differences represent a heterogenous population of neurons with different receptive fields. For example, if a single neuron innervates multiple neuromasts (large receptive field) it may only show a few spikes when only one of its neuromasts is stimulated, whereas a neuron that innervates only one neuromast (small receptive field) may respond with a large number of spikes when that neuromast is stimulated. Without the ability to further delineate the diverse types of neurons in wildtype and compare them directly to their counterparts in <italic>emx2</italic> mutants, it is not possible to determine whether the increase in post-synaptic calcium affected evoked spike numbers in the neuronal cell body. Furthermore, while our anatomical and physiological results indicate that afferent neurons in the <italic>emx2</italic> mutants are responding in a predicted manner, our results cannot distinguish functional differences between major versus minor afferents.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Neuronal selectivity is independent of hair bundle orientation</title><p>The observed changes in neuronal innervation patterns in the <italic>emx2</italic> mutants are consistent with the changes in hair bundle orientation, suggesting that the transcriptional activity of Emx2 mediates both hair bundle orientation and selectivity of neuronal innervation.

In addition, the expression of Emx2 guides neuronal patterning and preserves the directional selectivity of the HCs. Thus, Emx2 regulates the two key components that confer directional selectivity in the peripheral lateral line system. Given the conserved role of Emx2 in mediating hair bundle orientation among mechanosensory organs of fish and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>), its role in regulating post-synaptic partner described here may apply to other neural systems where Emx2 is normally expressed such as the cortex and olfactory epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Cecchi and Boncinelli, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cecchi, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nédélec et al., 2004</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="bottom">Strains, reagent <break/>type or resource</th><th valign="bottom">Designation</th><th valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th valign="bottom">Identifiers</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="bottom">Strains</td><td valign="bottom"><italic>Tg(myo6b:actb1-GFP)<sup>vo8Tg</sup></italic></td><td valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kindt et al.

After larvae were anesthetized, they were then microinjected in the heart with 125 μM α-bungarotoxin (Tocris) to suppress muscle activity. After microinjection, larvae were then rinsed thoroughly to remove MS-222, and maintained in extracellular solution in mM: 130 NaCl, 2 KCl, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 10 HEPES, pH 7.3, 290 mOsm. To stimulate lateral-line HCs we used a pressure clamp (HSPC-1, ALA Scientific, New York) attached to a glass or waterjet micropipette (inner tip diameter ~30–50 μm) filled with extracellular solution. The waterjet was positioned (MP-265, Sutter Instruments) approximately 100 μm from a given neuromast. The waterjet was placed in focus in the plane of the kinocilial tips. Displacement (~5 μm) of the kinocilial tips was verified by measuring the distance moved during the displacement. To trigger the waterjet during recordings of lateral-line afferents (see below), the pressure clamp was driven by a voltage command delivered by the recording amplifier. For afferent calcium imaging experiments, the pressure clamp was driven by a voltage step command. This voltage command was generated in the Prairie View (Bruker Corporation) imaging software during calcium imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Electrophysiological recordings from lateral-line afferents</title><p>The method for recording postsynaptic action currents has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Olt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sheets et al., 2017</xref>). All recordings were performed in extracellular solution (see above), on afferent neurons innervating zebrafish primary neuromasts (L1–L4). For the extracellular recordings, borosilicate glass pipettes were pulled (P-97, Sutter Instruments) with a long taper to obtain resistances between 5 and 10 MΩ in extracellular solution. Signals were collected with a Multiclamp 700B, a Digidata 1550 data acquisition board, with pClamp10 software (Molecular Devices, LLC). Extracellular currents were acquired from lateral-line afferent neuron in the loose-patch configuration (seal resistances ranged from 20 to 80 MΩ in extracellular solution). Recordings were done in voltage-clamp mode, sampled at 50 μs/pt, and filtered at 1 kHz. To identify the neuromast innervating an afferent neuron, the fluid-jet was used to progressively stimulate primary neuromasts of the posterior lateral line until phase-locked spiking was detected.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Afferent calcium imaging</title><p>Calcium imaging experiments were performed in extracellular solution (see above). Afferent calcium measurements were made at postsynaptic sites directly beneath HCs using <italic>hsp70l:GCaMP6s-CAAX-SiLL1</italic> transgenic fish. Acquisitions were made on an upright Swept-field confocal system (Bruker Corporation) with a 60X 1.0 NA CFI water-immersion objective (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). The Swept-field microscope used a Rolera EM-C2 EMCCD camera (QImaging) controlled using Prairie view (Bruker Corporation). GCaMP6s-CAAX was excited using a 488 nm solid-state laser. To image calcium activity within the entire post-synaptic process simultaneously across the Z-axis, we used piezoelectric motor (PICMA P-882.11–888.11 series, PI instruments) attached to the objective. The piezo allowed rapid imaging in five planes along the Z-axis every 2 μm at a 50 Hz frame rate, enabling a 10 Hz volume rate. Our five plane Z-stacks were later projected into one plane for further image processing and quantification (see below). After functional calcium imaging, each larva was incubated in 3 µM FM 4–64 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in E3 for 30 s, followed by 3 E3 washes, to label HCs. Confocal images of afferent process and FM 4–64 labeled HCs were then acquired on an upright Nikon C2 laser-scanning confocal microscope using a 60X 1.0 NA water objective lens. Appropriate solid-state lasers were used to image and excite GCaMP6s and FM 4–64.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Functional signal analysis</title><p>Afferent electrophysiology recordings were analyzed with software written in Igor Pro (Wavemetrics) and were plotted with Igor Pro and Prism 7 (Graphpad). For afferent GCaMP6s-CAAX calcium measurements, the raw images were processed using a custom program in Matlab (MathWorks, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode1">Source code 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode3">3</xref>). For this analysis, we removed the first 10 images to reduce the effect of photobleaching. Then the raw images were registered to reduce movement artifacts by applying efficient subpixel image registration based on cross-correlation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). Then the spatial calcium signals were converted to heat maps as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, we first computed the baseline image (or reference image or F<sub>0</sub>) by averaging the images during the pre-stimulus period. Then the baseline image (F<sub>0</sub>) was subtracted from each image acquired to generate images that represent the relative change in fluorescent signal, ∆F-F<sub>0</sub> or ∆F. To visualize the fluorescence intensity changes during stimulation, ∆F signals during the stimulus period were averaged, scaled and encoded by color maps with red indicating an increase in signal intensity. The color maps were then superimposed onto the F<sub>0</sub> baseline grayscale image, in order to visualize the spatial fluorescence intensity changes in the afferent processes during stimulation.</p><p>To quantify changes in afferent calcium signals we analyzed the registered images in ImageJ. To quantify the signals in an entire afferent process innervating a neuromast, we applied an inclusive threshold to capture all the pixels within the process. The same threshold was applied to all wildtype and <italic>emx2</italic> mutant processes. Each threshold was used to generate a ROI to compute mean intensity changes (∆F/F<sub>0</sub>) within the entire process throughout the acquisition. To quantify afferent calcium signals per HC, circular ROIs with a diameter of ~3 μm (12 pixels with 268 nm per pixel) were placed on the afferent process beneath each HC within a neuromast. After creating these ROIs, we then computed and plotted the mean intensity changes (∆F/F<sub>0</sub>) within each ROI during the acquisition period. Quantification of ∆F/F<sub>0</sub> magnitudes was performed using scripts written in Matlab (The Mathworks) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hilliard et al., 2005</xref>). The signal magnitude was defined as the peak value of intensity change upon stimulation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Image processing</title><p>To quantify the colocalization between RibeyeB and nerve endings, the number of RibeyeB puncta that were contacted by a single-labeled neuron per HC were counted. To further quantify this, a Mander’s colocalization analysis between RibeyeB and tdTomato-positive nerve endings was conducted by first placing 6.5 μm<sup>2</sup> ROIs beneath each HC innervated by a single labeled-afferent neuron and the area of overlap was measured. These measurements were made on selected 1µm optical sections centered on the ribbons to avoid overlap with the tdTomato-positive nerve fiber in different planes. Then, the Mander's coefficient was calculated using ImageJ. These values were averaged to determine the amount of overlap per neuromast. To quantify the number of RibeyeB and Maguk puncta, we used ImageJ to z-project all planes containing synapses. Then, we used ImageJ to apply the same background subtraction and threshold to each immunostain. After this processing we counted the total number of puncta, as well as complete and incomplete synapses by eye. For these counts, images were scored blinded. For RibeyeB and Maguk colocalization, we calculated the Mander’s coefficient to determine the amount of Maguk label that colocalized with Ribeye label, due to the high background in Maguk immunostain.</p><p>For our figures, images were processed and adjusted for brightness and contrast with ImageJ.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen a Senior/Reviewing Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous. The reviewers all think very highly of the manuscript and request relatively minor revisions, detailed below.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, Ji et al. present evidence that innervation of zebrafish lateral line hair cells is controlled by Emx2. Through a combination of gain and loss of function approaches, imaging and in vivo physiology, the authors demonstrate that manipulating Emx2 expression alters innervation pattern dependent on directional polarity. Analysis of altered Emx2 in conjunction with the planar cell polarity regulator Vangl2 demonstrate that innervation can be uncoupled from the regulation of bundle polarity. This is an interesting and significant study that provides new insights into mechanisms of circuit assembly and highlights a novel and likely conserved role of the transcription factor Emx2 in generating target identity and/or target-derived signals during hair cell synapse formation.</p><p>Minor points:</p><p>1) Figure 3.</p><p>(L1-L3) Please indicate how many hair cells were contacted by minor afferents, as was done for (H1-H3).</p><p>(T1-T2) Please indicate how many hair cells were contacted by minor afferents, as was done for (P1-P3).</p><p>2) Subsection “Both major and minor afferent nerve endings are associated with presynaptic specializations in <italic>emx2</italic> mutants” and Figure 4. It is not clear what is meant by &quot;incomplete synapses&quot; or whether non-overlapping punctae were increased in <italic>emx2</italic> mutants. Quantification of the overlap between RibeyeB and tdTomato-labeled afferent fiber would be informative.</p><p>3) Figure 5 and related text. To help separately evaluate of pre- and post- synaptic specializations, it would be informative to calculate the fractional overlap between RibeyeB and Maguk using Manders' Colocalization Coefficients (Dunn et al., 2011). Moreover, were total numbers of ribeye and Maguk punctae per neuromast changed in <italic>emx2</italic> lof and gof mutants?</p><p>4) Figure 8Q-X. For better clarity, the five Emx2+ve hair cells should be circled <italic>and</italic> numbered (T, U), and the corresponding afferent contact should be indicated by arrowheads <italic>and</italic> the matching number (V, W, X).</p><p>5) In some figures (Figures 1, 4, 5, 8), white arrows are used both to indicate hair bundle orientation, and to point at a specific hair cell, which was a bit confusing.

We have clarified this point in the subsection “Exclusive or inclusive role of Emx2 in neuronal selectivity”.</p><p>Since our experimental design focused on the innervation pattern of a single-labeled afferent neuron within a neuromast, we cannot directly address the total number of neurons per neuromast in either wildtype or <italic>emx2</italic> mutants. Similar single-neuron labeling results suggest that there are four neurons per neuromast, two neurons for hair cells of each orientation (Pujol-Marti et al., 2014). However, results of retrograde labeling using fluorescent dyes suggest that the total number of afferent neurons can be quite variable among neuromasts, between 4 to 6 neurons (Haehnel et al., 2012). Therefore, the total number of afferent neurons per neuromast in both wildtype and <italic>emx2</italic> mutants requires further experimental investigation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The authors provide detailed information about tests and sample number.
