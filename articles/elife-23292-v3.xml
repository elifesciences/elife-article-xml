For instance, light is the most potent environmental signal ensuring correct entrainment of endogenously generated circadian rhythms to the external 24 hr day. In mammals, light information encoded in the retina and received by the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), which harbor the master circadian pacemaker, can reset circadian rhythm phase of overt behaviors such as sleep and locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brainard and Hanifin, 2005</xref>). Apart from these circadian effects, light also directly impacts physiology, behavior, and cognition, including the well-known light suppression of the circadian hormone melatonin, as well as the maybe less well known light-induced increases in body temperature, cortisol, heart rate, alertness, performance, and mood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Badia et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cajochen et al., 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cajochen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Leproult et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lewy et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Scheer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stephenson et al., 2012</xref>). These activating effects of light are observed in diurnal species, like us, while in nocturnal species, like the mouse, light favors sleep and suppresses locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aschoff and von Goetz, 1988</xref>). In patients diagnosed with Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS), despite unimpaired vision, a number of symptoms strongly suggest that non-visual light perception is compromised. Whether these effects are direct or mediated through the circadian system is currently unknown. The aim of the current study was therefore to take advantage of an SMS mouse model to elucidate which of the pathways encoding light information were underlying some of the behavioral and physiological characteristics of the disease.</p><p>SMS is a multiple congenital anomalies/mental retardation disorder associated with a heterozygous interstitial deletion on chromosome 17p11.2 in &gt;95% of patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Edelman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Greenberg et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Smith et al., 1986</xref>), or rarely with point mutations in <italic>Retinoic acid induced 1</italic> (<italic>Rai1</italic>), a gene located within this deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Slager et al., 2003</xref>). Common phenotypic features include obesity, self-injurious, aggressive behavior, as well as distinct craniofacial and skeletal abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Edelman et al., 2007</xref>). Among the cardinal symptoms are sleep disturbances, including early sleep on- and offset, repeated and prolonged nocturnal awakening, as well as excessive daytime sleepiness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smith et al., 1998a</xref>). Sleep disturbances during the night are likely to contribute not only to daytime sleepiness, but also to temper tantrums, hyperactivity, and attention deficits during the day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Smith et al., 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Smith et al., 1998b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De Leersnyder et al., 2003</xref>). In conjunction with these sleep-wake disturbances, remarkably, the time course of melatonin levels shows an inverted rhythm in SMS patients, peaking during daytime and with low concentrations at night (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">De Leersnyder, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Potocki et al., 2000</xref>), lending further support to the notion of a circadian misalignment and/or impaired light perception.</p><p>Because patients with <italic>Rai1</italic> mutations display most of the SMS features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Edelman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Potocki et al., 2003</xref>), including the sleep/circadian phenotype, <italic>Rai1</italic> haplo-insufficiency is thought to be causal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smith et al., 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dubourg et al., 2014</xref>). A mouse model for SMS has been engineered and <italic>Rai1</italic> haplo-insufficient mice recapitulate some of the SMS features such as obesity and craniofacial phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bi et al., 2005</xref>). Although aspects of circadian rhythms of locomotor activity have been evaluated in these mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lacaria et al., 2013</xref>), a comprehensive analysis of the effects of light on sleep-wake behavior and locomotor activity is lacking. We therefore determined whether circadian rhythmicity, entrainment, or direct light effects contribute to the SMS phenotype, by recording locomotor and electro-encephalogram (EEG) activity to evaluate sleep and wakefulness under a number of lighting conditions. To gain insight into the pathways contributing to the extreme light-driven suppression of locomotor activity that we discovered, we evaluated the anatomical and functional integrity of the retina and the neuronal activation after a light pulse at the level of the SCN and the ventral subparaventricular zone (vSPVZ), which both play important roles in regulating active wake behaviors. Paradoxically, our study revealed that the acute and sustained hypersensitivity to light at the behavioral level was accompanied by a reduced response to light at the retinal and SCN levels. Only at the level of the vSPVZ was the behavioral hypersensitivity to light accompanied by an increased activating response to light.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The expression and timing of sleep are regulated by three main processes: circadian time keeping, sleep homeostasis, and the response to environmental light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cajochen et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dijk and Czeisler, 1995</xref>). Here, we addressed the proper functioning of all three processes in <italic>Rai1</italic> haploinsufficient mice. While probing the circadian timing system, we discovered that the suppression of locomotor activity by light was importantly increased in <italic>Rai1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice. Below we will present these findings first before presenting the circadian phenotypes we observed. Subsequently, by recording the electroencephalogram (EEG), we were able to extend the prominent ‘locomotor-activity-suppression-by-light’ phenotype to include EEG-defined active wake behavior and performed two experiments to discern whether these exacerbated direct effects of light concerned the acute or the sustained effects of light on behaviour and the EEG. EEG analyses was also used to verify whether altered sleep homeostasis; that is, differences in the compensatory response to sleep loss, contributed to the disease phenotype. We end by presenting anatomical data concerning retinal integrity and functional data on the acute, activating effects of light at the retinal, SCN, and vSPVZ levels.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Increased suppression of locomotor activity by light</title><p>We first asked whether <italic>Rai1</italic> plays a role in circadian clock function and entrainment by assessing patterns of spontaneous locomotor activity both under standard light-dark conditions (LD12:12) and constant dark (DD) conditions. Under LD12:12 conditions, mice of both genotypes were more active during the dark compared to the light period, reaching highest activity levels in the first 6 hr after dark onset (ZT12-18; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>), consistent with the mouse being a nocturnal species. Despite this overall similarity of the distribution of locomotor activity over the 24 day, we observed a number of striking differences between the two genotypes. Whereas during the light period <italic>Rai1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice displayed occasional activity bouts, especially immediately preceding dark onset and following light onset, activity in <italic>Rai1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice was restricted to the dark with an abrupt increase in activity immediately following dark onset and an equally abrupt suppression of activity after light onset, leaving the light period almost devoid of any activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,C</xref>). The number of movements during the light phase was reduced by 67% in <italic>Rai1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice, which is substantial considering that in the wild-type littermate controls locomotor activity reaches its lowest levels during this period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23292.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Marked suppression of locomotor activity by light in <italic>Rai1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative double-plotted actograms of one wild-type <italic>Rai1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> (top) and one <italic>Rai1+/-</italic> mouse (bottom panel), under 14 days of LD12:12 and 20 days of constant darkness (DD).

These lower overall activity levels could not, however, explain the extremely low activity levels observed during the light period in <italic>Rai1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice. Even after taking these overall genotype differences into account by expressing activity during the light as a percentage of each animal’s individual average 24 hr activity level, activity in <italic>Rai1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice remained greatly reduced compared to wild-type littermates (p=0.022, t-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).

In addition, no significant difference in the robustness of the circadian distribution of locomotor activity was observed during free-run (maximum values of the <italic>X<sup>2</sup></italic>-statistic; <italic>Rai1<sup>+/+</sup> vs. Rai1<sup>+/-</sup></italic>: 1458 ± 242 <italic>vs.</italic> 976 ± 84; p=0.086; t-test), while analyses of the day-to-day variability of activity onset under these conditions (i.e., individual <italic>r</italic>-values for the linear regression of activity onset under DD) suggest a more precise circadian timing of overt behaviors in <italic>Rai1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> compared to wild-type littermates (<italic>r</italic> = 0.96 ± 0.01 and 0.88 ± 0.03, respectively; p&lt;0.05; t-test; see Materials and methods for details). Also, the phase angle of entrainment, which quantifies the relationship between the endogenously generated circadian timing of activity and the timing of light exposure (see Materials and methods for details), differed between the two genotypes. While activity onset in wild-type mice under DD conditions occurred later than predicted by the mean activity onset under the preceding LD12:12 (−0.49 ± 0.17 hr; p&lt;0.005; paired t-test), <italic>Rai1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice exhibited a positive phase angle (+0.36 ± 0.14 hr; p&lt;0.05; paired t-test), which significantly differed from wild-type (p&lt;0.005; t-test). This relative advancement of activity onset in <italic>Rai1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice was accompanied by an abrupt, 2.5 hr ‘expansion’ of the active phase (alpha), while in <italic>Rai1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice alpha did not significantly change from that observed under LD12:12 (+18 min; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,E</xref>). The alpha expansion was already present on the first day under DD and was due to both an advance of activity onset (consistent with the positive phase angle of entrainment) and a delay of activity offset compared to the timing of these two events on the preceding day under LD12:12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These observations indicate that besides the altered light-suppression of activity (or ‘masking’ as it is referred to in the circadian literature), circadian entrainment by light is also affected in <italic>Rai1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice. Even at low intensity (i.e., 0.6 cds/m<sup>2</sup> <italic>vs.</italic> the habitual 6.6 cds/m<sup>2</sup>), light was still able to confine activity to the dark period of an LD12:12 light-dark cycle and alpha did not increase in <italic>Rai1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>To further investigate photic entrainment, we assessed the capacity of single, 1 hr light pulses in shifting the phase of activity onset under DD conditions. Light pulses were given at either CT16 or −22, when C57BL/6 mice show maximum phase delays and advances, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schwartz and Zimmerman, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Daan and Pittendrigh, 1976</xref>). Although both light pulses resulted in the expected change in activity onset of the free-running activity rhythm, the magnitude of the phase advance after light pulses administrated at CT22, was more than two times larger in <italic>Rai1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice than in wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Increased suppression by light of theta-dominated wakefulness but not of total time-spent-awake</title><p>Because one of the hallmarks of SMS is disturbed sleep, we next investigated the role of <italic>Rai1</italic> in sleep-wake regulation by recording EEG and EMG signals, concomitant with locomotor activity under various lighting conditions.</p><p>Time course analyses under LD12:12 revealed that <italic>Rai1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Rai1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice showed very similar distributions of sleep and wakefulness over the 24 h day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; see also Figure 6A) and for none of the three sleep-wake states (i.e., waking, NREM sleep, and REM sleep) did the 24 hr values significantly differ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Nonetheless, significant differences were observed between genotypes in the sleep-wake distribution. <italic>Rai1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice displayed more wakefulness (and less NREM sleep) immediately after dark onset and before light onset. Moreover, during the light period, time-spent-awake was slightly but significantly reduced compared to wild-type littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Even so, the lower overall activity levels as well as the near complete suppression of locomotor activity by light observed in <italic>Rai1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice, were not accompanied by similar changes in time-spent-awake. This dissociation resulted in a striking 15-fold reduction in locomotor activity when expressed per unit of time-spent-awake during the light period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Behavioral observation using video recordings confirmed that when <italic>Rai1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice were behaviorally awake during the light period they did not leave the nest or only very briefly to drink. Because overall activity levels, but not waking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), were reduced also in the dark period, activity expressed relative to time-spent-awake was also reduced during this period albeit to a much smaller degree (twofold; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

This contrast between light and dark could result from differences in the relative contribution of distinct waking behaviors to the overall waking spectra, specifically theta-dominated wakefulness (TDW; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Welsh et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vassalli and Franken, 2017</xref>]) which is considered an active state of wakefulness associated with exploratory behavior and locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buzsáki, 2002</xref>) (see Materials and methods for the quantification of TDW).

This indicates that the reduced contribution of TDW to total wakefulness in <italic>Rai1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice did not underlie this EEG difference. Moreover, the observed increase in the 2–3 Hz range of the EEG power density appeared strictly light driven and not a consequence of for example circadian time, because it was equally observed under LD1:1 conditions when light is presented at all circadian phases (see below and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The increase in delta activity in the waking EEG might suggest that when in non-TDW and exposed to light, <italic>Rai1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice are drowsier. Delta activity in the waking EEG did not only differ between genotypes but was generally higher in the 12 hr light period than in the dark period (2–5 Hz), irrespective of waking state (wakefulness, TDW, and non-TDW) and genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

Overall activity was reduced to one-fourth of the 24 hr levels under LD12:12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

This profound reduction in the activation of the SCN seems also at odds with the lack of a difference between the two genotypes in the ensuing phase delay of overt behavior after a light pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). However, at the level of the ventral subparaventricular zone (vSPVZ), a region immediately dorsal to the SCN, the opposite result was observed. The SPVZ extends dorsally of the SCN, from bregma −0.71 mm to bregma −0.83 mm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Paxinos and Franklin, 2013</xref>) and we focused on its ventral part (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>) because neuronal activity in this area was found to be in phase with locomotor activity rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Todd et al., 2012</xref>) and because stimulation of this area inhibits locomotor activity specifically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kramer et al., 2001</xref>).

The overall time-spent-awake and its diurnal distribution under standard LD12:12 conditions did not greatly differ between the two genotypes, underscoring that locomotor activity in the mouse can be a poor indicator of sleep-wake state.</p><p>Although overall wakefulness was little affected, the profound suppression by light of locomotor activity was accompanied by a number of changes in wake-related phenotypes indicating reduced alertness and attention while awake during the light in <italic>Rai1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice compared to their wild-type littermates.

The latter observation suggests that <italic>Rai1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice are less alert and more drowsy when awake in the light, and is consistent with reports of delta activity increasing progressively during prolonged waking periods in human and rat, which in human is paralleled by decrements in cognitive performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cajochen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Franken et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dijk et al., 1992</xref>). Also, the high beta/low gamma frequency band was more strongly activated by light in <italic>Rai1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice than in wild-type. This frequency range also increases progressively during prolonged waking in both human and mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cajochen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Grønli et al., 2016</xref>) and has been associated with behavioral arrest and slower movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zheng et al., 2015</xref>), as well as with the motor deficits accompanying Parkinson disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Weinberger et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mallet et al., 2008</xref>), suggesting that processes related to motor control are reflected in the waking EEG and might be relevant also for the light-induced suppression of locomotor activity in the SMS model.</p><p>Results from the LD12:12, LD1:1, and LL experiments also allowed us to differentiate between sustained and acute direct effects of light on sleep-wake state. In the context of the current set of experiments, we refer to acute effects as those light effects that can be observed immediately after light onset; that is, within the first hour, while sustained refers to effects of longer light exposures; that is, 12 hr and longer. Results from the LD12:12 and LL experiments revealed that genotype did not alter the effects of sustained light exposure on total time-spent-awake (and -asleep), whereas the LD1:1 experiment provided evidence that the acute suppressing effects of light on time-spent-wake time were stronger in <italic>Rai1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice, as was the case for locomotor activity and TDW. In contrast to the almost complete suppression of locomotor activity and TDW during LD1:1, the effect on total time-spent-awake was weaker and depended on circadian time, with highest levels of wakefulness attained (or lowest suppression by light) when light pulses were given during the subjective dark phase. This suggests that the sleep-wake switching by light competes with the alerting signal provided by the circadian system, as it is more difficult for light to acutely switch sleep-wake state than to rapidly alter the quality of one state (e.g. active vs. quiet wakefulness).</p><p>In addition, the LD1:1 protocol revealed a stronger induction of wakefulness during the 1-hr-dark pulses in <italic>Rai1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice compared to wild-type. Also this acute, wake-promoting effect of the absence of light varied with circadian time and was largest at the start of the subjective dark phase. In comparison with the temporary overshoot in wakefulness and activity at the same time under LD12:12, which could be interpreted as ‘rebound’ from the suppression in the preceding 12 hr of light, the LD1:1 results instead suggests a circadian mechanism that could relate to the longer circadian active period observed in <italic>Rai1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice under DD conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title><italic>Rai1</italic> haplo-insufficiency and circadian rhythm entrainment</title><p>In the present study, circadian organization of locomotor activity under DD was not largely impacted by <italic>Rai1</italic> haplo-insufficiency, and no differences in period length were observed. Our results contrast with those from one earlier study in which a 13 min shortening of the free-running period was reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lacaria et al., 2013</xref>). Despite this difference, both studies clearly demonstrate that circadian rhythm generation under DD is not compromised in <italic>Rai1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice. This is surprising given that <italic>Rai1</italic> haplo-insufficiency results in the transcriptional dysregulation of core clock genes such as <italic>Clock</italic>, <italic>Per2</italic>, <italic>Per3</italic>, <italic>Cry1</italic>, and <italic>Bmal1</italic> in SMS fibroblasts and in mouse hypothalamic tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Williams et al., 2012</xref>).

This expansion of alpha was due to both an earlier onset and a later cessation of activity compared to the timing of these two events under the preceding LD12:12 conditions. Given their hypersensitivity to light, the preferred (i.e. endogenously determined by the circadian system) earlier activity onset in <italic>Rai1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice seems thus ‘masked’ by light even of low intensity. Evidence of masking of activity onset in <italic>Rai1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice can also be deduced from the lack of transients during re-entrainment to LD12:12 after a period of DD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The second and related circadian phenotype observed in <italic>Rai1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice is the twofold larger phase advance. We did not construct a full ‘phase response curve’ (PRC) but assuming a still larger phase advance 2 hr later (i.e. at light onset under entrained conditions) might have contributed to the earlier preferred activity onset in <italic>Rai1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice and also to the compression of alpha under entrained, LD12:12 conditions (compared to DD). Alpha compression during re-entrainment is accompanied by memory impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ruby et al., 2015</xref>) and, assuming that in <italic>Rai1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice alpha is being compressed by 2.5 hr on a daily basis under LD12:12 conditions, might also have contributed to cognitive deficits reported for <italic>Rai1-</italic>compromised mice kept under these same lighting conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Huang et al., 2016</xref>). It is therefore of interest to verify whether memory deficits persist under LD regimens with shorter than 12 hr photoperiods better matching the longer endogenous active period observed in <italic>Rai1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Reconciling species differences and ‘input-output’ differences</title><p>The sleep-wake disturbances, including excessive daytime sleepiness and attention deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Smith et al., 1986</xref>), together with the inverted melatonin rhythm observed in SMS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">De Leersnyder, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Potocki et al., 2000</xref>), strongly suggest impaired non-visual light perception. The reduced response to light at the level of the retina and the SCN we report here for <italic>Rai1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice, supports this idea and indicates that already at the input level, processing of light information is altered by the loss of one <italic>Rai1</italic> allele. However, at the behavioral output level, the murine SMS model clearly differs from SMS patients because mice display a striking hypersensitivity to light with respect to active waking behaviors. These findings seem contradictory not only with regard to the human-mouse species difference, but also concerning the differences in the effects of light at the input level and its downstream behavioral consequences in our SMS mouse model. This contradiction might relate to the mechanisms that determine nocturnality versus diurnality which are thought to act downstream from the SCN.</p><p>Based on the neuroanatomical differences in the innervation of the vSPVZ by the SCN and the retina between nocturnal and diurnal rodents, Todd and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Todd et al., 2012</xref> proposed that in diurnal mammals light information reaches the vSPVZ predominantly through the SCN relay, which inhibits the vSPVZ and is thus alerting. If also true in humans, a weaker inhibition of the vSPVZ by the SCN might contribute to the lower levels of alertness and attention, as well as increased day-time sleepiness observed in SMS during the day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C,D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Elsea and Girirajan, 2008</xref>). In nocturnal species, light information encoded in the retina directly stimulates the vSPVZ via the retinohypothalamic tract (RHT) and, overcoming the simultaneous inhibition provided by the SCN, causes inactivity and sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Todd et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schwartz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Watts et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Colwell, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hermes et al., 2009</xref>) (summarized in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref> schematic). According to this scenario, the reduced activation of the SCN observed in our SMS mouse model might have led to a reduced inhibition of vSPVZ neurons, which, in turn, explains both the stronger induction of vSPVZ c-FOS immunoreactivity we observed, as well as the exacerbated suppression of locomotor activity by light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A,B</xref>). In the intact mouse, RAI1-dependend signaling thus seems to limit the light-induced activation of the vSPVZ thereby allowing animals to display activity during the light phase.</p><p>Much in the above scenario remains, however, to be demonstrated and species differences rather than the nocturnal versus diurnal niche differentiation might underlie the discrepancy in light-sensitivity between humans and mice lacking one <italic>Rai1</italic> allele. Moreover, a number of other signaling pathways are likely to be involved. Specifically, pathways regulating active waking behaviors might be good alternate candidates. TGFα (transforming growth factor α) activates vSPVZ neurons thereby suppressing locomotor activity without affecting overall time-spent-awake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kramer et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tournier et al., 2007</xref>), reminiscent of the profound and sustained effects of light in <italic>Rai1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice. Likewise, CLC (cardiotrophin-like cytokine) suppresses locomotor activity via CLC receptors on neurons localized in the periventricular region of the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kraves and Weitz, 2006</xref>). Both TGF-α and CLC are produced in the SCN in antiphase with the daily (circadian) changes in locomotor activity. Moreover, CLC production is stimulated by light. As was the case for <italic>Rai1</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice, suppression of locomotor activity by CLC is associated with normal waking behaviors although time-spent-awake and -asleep were not quantified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kraves and Weitz, 2006</xref>). Finally, other structures than the vSPVZ have been shown to relay the direct effects of light on behavior such as the intergeniculate leaflet and olivary pretectal nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gall et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>RAI1 is thought to be key to normal brain development and function due to its association with a number of neurobehavioral disorders which, besides SMS, include Potocki–Lupski syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Potocki et al., 2007</xref>), schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Joober et al., 1999</xref>), autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">van der Zwaag et al., 2009</xref>), Parkinson disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Do et al., 2011</xref>), and cerebellar ataxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hayes et al., 2000</xref>). RAI1 is a highly conserved transcriptional regulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carmona-Mora et al., 2010</xref>) with high neuronal expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Toulouse et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fragoso et al., 2015</xref>), and recent evidence shows that it acts as a positive transcriptional regulator by binding to active promotor and enhancer regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Huang et al., 2016</xref>). Among RAI1 target genes are <italic>Bdnf</italic> (<italic>brain-derived neurotrophic factor</italic>) and <italic>Htr2c</italic> (<italic>serotonin receptor 2c</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Huang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burns et al., 2010</xref>), both of which are implicated in hyperphagia leading to obesity, a phenotype accompanying SMS, concomitant with altered locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Huang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burns et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kernie et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nonogaki et al., 2003</xref>). Moreover, as its name indicates, <italic>Rai1</italic> expression is induced by retinoic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Imai et al., 1995</xref>). Because retinoic acid signaling is a major pathway involved in eye formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cvekl and Wang, 2009</xref>) and other developmental processes, and because RAI1 appears to help assemble and maintain neuronal circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Huang et al., 2016</xref>), the lack of one <italic>Rai1</italic> allele is likely to impact eye development and light signaling pathways, maybe through its target gene <italic>Bdnf</italic>, which is known to be important for retinal development and synaptic connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Grishanin et al., 2008</xref>). While we found no apparent structural differences in the retina, the ERG results did reveal a profound attenuation of the response to light pointing to altered retinal function. A more detailed examination of, for example, the morphology of synaptic terminals and expression levels of other photo-transduction proteins could therefore still yield new insights.</p><p>The SMS mouse model revealed that both circadian and direct light reception are affected. Our study thus brought new insights into the light-signaling pathways regulating behavior and suggests that <italic>Rai1</italic> is a key regulator in non-visual light perception. Whether these effects are developmental, acute or both, remains to be determined. Given our results, investigating the functional integrity of cells and pathways related to photoreception and light signaling in SMS patients is an obvious next step.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals and housing conditions</title><p>C57BL/6<italic>Tyrc−Brd</italic> mice heterozygous for the <italic>Rai1</italic> null mutation (<italic>Rai1<sup>+/-</sup></italic>) were generously provided by James R.

ClockLab (ActiMetrics, IL, USA) was used to record and analyze locomotor activity patterns and to schedule the light-dark regimens. Data were sampled at 5-min resolution, and period length (<italic>X2</italic>-periodogram) and onset of the main daily activity phase were extracted to calculate the duration of the active (alpha or α) and rest (rho or ρ) phase under DD conditions. <italic>Rai1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> (n = 11) and <italic>Rai1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice (n = 12; recorded in five separate experimental cohorts from a total of eight different litters) were studied for &gt;10 days under entrained conditions (LD12:12), followed by &gt;20 days of DD ‘free-running’ conditions, followed again by LD12:12 (&gt;10 days). The expected activity onset of the last day under LD was extrapolated back by linear regression of the DD activity onset times. The difference between the average activity onset under the preceding LD12:12 and this expected activity onset determined the phase angle of entrainment. As a measure of precision of activity onset under DD conditions, we compared the individual correlation coefficients (<italic>r</italic>) of the linear regression of activity onsets explained above to estimate the phase angle of entrainment between genotypes. The same number of observations contributed to each <italic>r</italic>-value, that is 16 circadian days. Correlation coefficients were Fisher's Z-transformed prior to statistical analysis. To estimate robustness of the circadian rhythm under DD, the individually obtained maximal amplitude of the <italic>X<sup>2</sup></italic>-statistic was compared between genotypes as this statistic indexes how much of the total variance in the locomotor activity signal can be attributed to the circadian rhythm. For this analysis, the number of cycles contributing to the analysis was identical for each individual (n = 10/genotype), that is 18.</p><p>Evaluation of the phase-shifting capacity of light was performed in a separate group of mice (<italic>Rai1<sup>+/+</sup></italic>: n = 5; <italic>Rai1<sup>+/-</sup></italic>: n = 4; one experimental cohort from a total of two litters). For this experiment, mice were exposed to a 1-hr-light pulse (6.6 cds/m<sup>2</sup>) at circadian times (CT)16 and −22 (with CT12 designating activity onset). Both light pulses occurred 4 days after the mice were released in DD. The phase shifts were calculated as the difference, in circadian hours, between the average activity onset over the 3 days prior to the light pulse and the average activity onset over the 10 days following the light pulse.

Four-second epochs scored as wakefulness in which the EEG was dominated by theta activity (EEG power in the 6.5–9.5 Hz range) were labeled as theta dominated wakefulness (TDW) using an algorithm with the following criteria: if the frequency bin showing highest power density (theta peak frequency or TPF) across the 3.5–15.0 Hz range was within the 6.5–12.0 Hz range, and the ratio of theta power in the ±1 Hz range surrounding the TPF over the total power across 3.5–45.0 Hz was above 0.228, then that epoch would score as TDW, if an additional set of three contextual criteria for that epoch were met: (1) the epoch immediately preceding a TDW epoch was scored as 'W' or 'TDW'; (2) the epoch immediately following a TDW epoch was not scored as NREM sleep; (3) isolated TDW epochs preceded and followed by 3 'W' epochs were excluded.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Louis J Ptáček (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Ying-Hui Fu (Reviewer #2) and Mark S Blumberg (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>SMS is a syndrome in which patients may manifest obesity, aggressive behavior and craniofacial and skeletal dysmorphisms. In addition, they have sleep phase advance and frequent nocturnal awakening and excessive daytime sleepiness. The manuscript by Diessler and colleagues describes study of a mouse model of SMS to better understand the sleep phenotype. The SMS mutations cause haploinsufficiency for <italic>Rai1</italic>. This paper provides a thorough and largely compelling assessment of the effects of <italic>Rai1</italic> haploinsufficiency on circadian and sleep biology, light sensitivity, and other related processes in adult mice. The authors should be commended on their thoroughness, although at times I felt that the core narrative was lost in the pursuit of too much text devoted to subsidiary issues. Where the paper is strongest and most convincing is in the assessments of sleep-wake behavior and electrophysiology, as well as the hyperresponsivity of the mice to light. Because humans with <italic>Rai1</italic> mutations exhibit circadian and light responses that are opposite to those of the mice (e.g., light increases activity in humans rather than suppressing it, as in the mice), the authors are led to consider the very interesting idea that species differences on the diurnal-nocturnal dimension accounts for the opposite effects. Building on recent work in nocturnal Norway rats and diurnal Nile grass rats, they provide data and a model to explain the human-mouse differences as related to how <italic>Rai1</italic> haploinsufficiency affects activity in the vSPVZ. This last finding highlights the need to attend to species differences when using mice to model human conditions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors report <italic>Rai1</italic> gene expression in retina and brain by sampling every 3 hours. How does this data compare with that in the public domain looking at global expression analysis in different tissues? Is <italic>Rai1</italic> expressed in SCN and/or vSPVZ, or surrounding areas?</p><p>2) Given the important observations re: changes in sensitivity to entrainment, it is surprising that the authors did not present full PRCs. This would be worthwhile if it could be done in a timely fashion.</p><p>3) The authors discuss the fact that the mouse model of SMS does not fully recapitulate the human phenotype, vis-à-vis behavioral outputs. This might, as they mention, represent differences between nocturnal and diurnal animals. Alternately, it may reflect differences in human vs. mouse physiology. The same conundrum has been noted in some of the mouse models of human FASP mutations.</p><p>4) The model which it seems the authors favor should be explicitly articulated. Under normal condition, <italic>Rai1</italic> protein seems to serve as inhibitor for vSPVZ (-0.7mm) activation by light. vSPVZ activation leads to &quot;suppression of activity in light&quot; based on results from previous reports. <italic>Rai1</italic>+/+ can inhibit this vSPVZ's suppression of behavior, so animals have some activities in light when in need. <italic>Rai1</italic> +/- has reduced inhibition of vSPVZ. This means these mice have higher vSPVZ activities, which further enhances suppression of movement in light, therefore have almost no activity in light.</p><p>5) There are a number of problems with the Fos data they present in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>. First, they claim to see a difference in Fos-positive cells between genotypes in the vSPVZ only at the section which is -.71 mm from bregma, yet the only representative Fos data they present (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>) is of the -.83 mm section (as stated in the figure legend). Second, they do not provide the scale bars in 10A or 10B, so it is hard to determine where the vSPVZ &quot;box&quot; as depicted in 10A would be in 10B. Third, it is very hard to see Fos in the area above the SCN in the images in 10B -- a higher magnification inset would help. Finally, many people who've studied the vSPVZ would say you need to show either VIP or AVP immuno to demonstrate you are actually outside the SCN and that you know how to differentiate the two structures (the vSPVZ is traditionally defined as either the area innervated by VIP fibers from the SCN or as the area dorsal to AVP neurons of the SCN &quot;shell&quot; and ventral to the AVP neurons of the PVN, or both).</p><p>6) Another issue with the Fos experiment concerns the sufficiency of the sample size: N = 3/genotype, as stated in the text. Given the inherent variability of Fos immunoreactivity, this is too small a sample size to feel confident that the results would replicate. And given that this finding is the basis for the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>, it seems reasonable to request that additional subjects be tested (and the findings presented more comprehensively; see previous paragraph) to ensure that this aspect of the study is reliable. The sample size in the Fos study is among the smallest of all the experiments.

How does this data compare with that in the public domain looking at global expression analysis in different tissues? Is Rai1 expressed in SCN and/or vSPVZ, or surrounding areas?</italic> </p><p><italic>Rai1</italic> is expressed throughout the brain (Toulouse et al., Genomics 2003; Bi et al., 2007; Fragoso et al., 2015; Huang et al., Neuron 2016) and we now have specified in the Results section that this expression is wide-spread and especially pronounced in olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, striatum, thalamus, hypothalamus, cerebellum, and brainstem. Public databases such as the Expression Atlas (www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/genes/), the Allan Brain Atlas (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mouse.brain-map.org">http://mouse.brain-map.org</ext-link>), and MGI’s gene expression database (GXD; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.informatics.jax.org/expression.shtml">http://www.informatics.jax.org/expression.shtml</ext-link>) confirm this. <italic>Rai1</italic> expression is also present in several peripheral tissues (liver, lung, digestive system), especially during development.</p><p>Although <italic>Rai1</italic> is expressed in the hypothalamus we are not aware of publications in which its expression dynamics was quantified specifically in the SCN. The <italic>CircaDB</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://circadb.hogeneschlab.org/">http://circadb.hogeneschlab.org/</ext-link>) database includes, however, a number of time-course transcriptome data sets, 5 of which concern the SCN. In 1 out of these 5, <italic>Rai1</italic> expression is deemed rhythmic but this result depend on the type of periodogram analyses chosen and does not survive a 5% false-discovery rate. In none of the other brain areas included in this database does <italic>Rai1</italic> expression vary over time thereby confirming the observations made in our study. In the Results section we now refer to the <italic>CircaDB</italic> database. Studies specifically focusing on the vSPVZ are not available to our knowledge.</p><p><italic>2) Given the important observations re: changes in sensitivity to entrainment, it is surprising that the authors did not present full PRCs. This would be worthwhile if it could be done in a timely fashion.</italic> </p><p>This was one of two additional experiments suggested by the reviewers. Even with the granted 1 month extension, 3 months is still tight to accomplish these types of experiments especially considering the low breeding yield of <italic>Rai1+/-</italic> mice. Because of this low breeding yield the data in the manuscript now took close to 4 years to collect. We estimate that performing both experiments would take close to a year, as we currently do not have sufficient mice of the right age, sex, and genotype, despite having considerably expanded the breeding of this line. Because a full PRC, to us, seems less pertinent to support the main claims made in the paper, requires more mice, and because the reviewers stated that it “would be worthwhile if it could be done in a timely fashion”, we used all suitable mice (7) to increase sample size for the second experiment instead (see point 6).</p><p><italic>3) The authors discuss the fact that the mouse model of SMS does not fully recapitulate the human phenotype, vis-à-vis behavioral outputs. This might, as they mention, represent differences between nocturnal and diurnal animals. Alternately, it may reflect differences in human vs. mouse physiology. The same conundrum has been noted in some of the mouse models of human FASP mutations.</italic> </p><p>Indeed. We now have specifically pointed out this possibility in the Discussion (see “Reconciling species differences…” paragraph).</p><p><italic>4) The model which it seems the authors favor should be explicitly articulated. Under normal condition, Rai1 protein seems to serve as inhibitor for vSPVZ (-0.7mm) activation by light. vSPVZ activation leads to &quot;suppression of activity in light&quot; based on results from previous reports. Rai1+/+ can inhibit this vSPVZ's suppression of behavior, so animals have some activities in light when in need. Rai1 +/- has reduced inhibition of vSPVZ. This means these mice have higher vSPVZ activities, which further enhances suppression of movement in light, therefore have almost no activity in light.</italic> </p><p>We have put in an effort to make the Discussion section concerned (see “Reconciling species differences…” paragraph) more straightforward and have more clearly formulated our ideas. Apart from an acute and active signaling role for <italic>RAI1</italic> as a transcriptional regulator, other scenarios could be envisioned such as one involving <italic>RAI1</italic> in establishing and maintaining the appropriate signaling circuitry. Such role has been demonstrated for <italic>RAI1</italic>’s role in another hypothalamic network involved in food intake (Huang et al., 2016). Our present data do not allow to favor either possibility (acute signaling <italic>versus</italic> establishing the correct neuronal circuitry) as stated in the Conclusion section.</p><p><italic>5) There are a number of problems with the Fos data they present in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>. First, they claim to see a difference in Fos-positive cells between genotypes in the vSPVZ only at the section which is -.71 mm from bregma, yet the only representative Fos data they present (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>) is of the -.83 mm section (as stated in the figure legend). Second, they do not provide the scale bars in 10A or 10B, so it is hard to determine where the vSPVZ &quot;box&quot; as depicted in 10A would be in 10B. Third, it is very hard to see Fos in the area above the SCN in the images in 10B -- a higher magnification inset would help. Finally, many people who've studied the vSPVZ would say you need to show either VIP or AVP immuno to demonstrate you are actually outside the SCN and that you know how to differentiate the two structures (the vSPVZ is traditionally defined as either the area innervated by VIP fibers from the SCN or as the area dorsal to AVP neurons of the SCN &quot;shell&quot; and ventral to the AVP neurons of the PVN, or both).</italic> </p><p>We redid this experiment (see point 6) and the figures. We have highlighted the scale bars and put in an effort to make the figures clearer. The genotype effect on c-FOS in the vSPVZ, although significant, is not immediately apparent by eye due to the relative sparsity of c-FOS positive cells (as compared to the SCN) and the somewhat larger variability.</p><p>We are, however, confident not to confuse c-FOS reactivity (red dots in all 4 panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Author response image 1</xref>) within the SCN with that quantified in the vSPVZ. First the compactness of the DAPI-stained SCN cell nuclei (left two panels) reliably delimits the extent of the SCN which we now confirmed by adding AVP staining in the new experiment (labelled green; right two panels; upper panels matching images of a <italic>Rai1+/-</italic> brain at bregma -0.83mm; lower panels of a <italic>Rai1+/+</italic> brain at -0.73mm). Although the quality of AVP staining could not be optimized, its expressing in the shell follows the DAPI-derived outline of the SCN. Moreover, it can be clearly seen that the c-FOS expression in the SCN is largely limited to its retinorecipient core located ventrally (devoid of AVP staining) precluding mixing-up c-FOS induced in the SCN with that of the sSPVZ. See also Schwartz et al., Neuroscience2000 and Abrahamson &amp; Moore Brain Res2001, and our comparable analysis performed in <italic>Opn4-/-</italic> mice (Tsai et al., PLoS Biol2009).<fig id="fig12" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23292.023</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23292.023">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23292.023</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-23292-resp-fig1-v3"/></fig></p><p>The new data confirmed our original claim that <italic>Rai1+/-</italic> mice have less cFOS reactivity in the SCN and more in the vSPVZ area upon light exposure. However, the claim concerning section-specificity of the genotype effect within the vSPVZ (the difference between the two sections referred to as -0.71mm and -0.83mm) does no longer hold; within the new subset values were significantly higher in the -0.83mm section and not, as we previously reported, limited to the -0.71mm section. Our techniques are apparently not sensitive enough to reliably distinguish between the two. In the new analyses we therefore pooled the number of cFOS+ cells in both sections within each animal and removed the claim of this specificity in the manuscript. For consistency we also pooled the results of the SCN which showed robust and significant decreases in both sections and in both experiments. As the two sections on which this analysis was based differ in SCN size we still show examples of both sections in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>.</p><p><italic>6) Another issue with the Fos experiment concerns the sufficiency of the sample size: N = 3/genotype, as stated in the text. Given the inherent variability of Fos immunoreactivity, this is too small a sample size to feel confident that the results would replicate. And given that this finding is the basis for the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>, it seems reasonable to request that additional subjects be tested (and the findings presented more comprehensively; see previous paragraph) to ensure that this aspect of the study is reliable. The sample size in the Fos study is among the smallest of all the experiments. In general, Ns range from 11-12 in the behavioral and electrophysiological experiments to Ns of 3-6 in some of the subsidiary experiments. The problem of small Ns is illustrated very clearly in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>, in which a finding with P = 0.04 is considered significant whereas two other findings with P = 0.06 is described like this: &quot;for none of the three sleep-wake states (i.e., waking, NREM sleep, and REM sleep) did the 24h values significantly differ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>).&quot; This is technically correct, but the sample size for these comparisons was only 4/genotype. Such small-N comparisons with borderline p values should be viewed with skepticism.</italic> </p><p>Indeed an n of 3 is small and the request for additional mice is very reasonable. As explained to the Editor upon receiving the reviews (see also point 2) we could include 7 additional mice (3 wt, 4 hets) that we successfully used for the c-FOS experiment, thereby raising the total n’s to 6 and 7, in <italic>Rai1+/+</italic> and <italic>Rai1+/-</italic> mice, respectively. These numbers are within range of what is current in these types of experiments (e.g., Todd, Gall, Weiner and Blumberg, 2012). By confirming the overall effects we first described (but not the section specificity; see main point 5), we now feel confident about the results and thank the reviewers for suggesting the additional experiment.</p><p>More generally, the number of mice used is always a compromise among many considerations such as having enough statistical power while being urged to reduce the number of animals by animal-use committees. The initial, larger experiments demonstrated that the genotype differences in the effects of light on locomotor activity and theta-dominated waking were large. We therefore thought it justifiable that for follow-up experiments, in which we were able to reproduce the initial observations, to use fewer mice. The main behavioral findings on which our manuscript is based are very robust and can be readily observed in each individual.</p></body></sub-article></article>
