settings. In hospitals, control efforts would benefit from accurate estimation of asymptomatic colonization and infection importation rates from the community. However, developing such estimates remains challenging due to limited observation of colonization and complicated transmission dynamics within hospitals and the community. Here, we develop an inference framework that can estimate these key quantities by combining statistical filtering techniques, an agent-based model, and real-world patient-to-patient contact networks, and use this framework to infer nosocomial transmission and infection importation over an outbreak spanning 6 years in 66 Swedish hospitals. In particular, we identify a small number of patients with disproportionately high risk of colonization. In retrospective control experiments, interventions targeted to these individuals yield a substantial improvement over heuristic strategies informed by number of contacts, length of stay and contact tracing.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40977.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Antibiotic-resistant bacteria like the Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) can live in people for many years without making them sick. During this time, the bacteria can spread to others who come in contact with the MRSA-infected person. The number of people with stealth MRSA infections living in the community has been increasing. As a result, hospitals may not only be dealing with MRSA infections that originated onsite, but also cases imported from the community. That makes tracking and controlling MRSA infections in hospitals difficult.</p><p>Now, Pei et al. show that computer modeling can help identify the role MRSA infections from the community play in hospital outbreaks and test ways to control them. In the experiments, data from an MRSA outbreak that occurred at 66 Swedish hospitals over 6 years were analyzed using statistical methods and computer modeling. This helped to identify patients who were likely colonized with MRSA within the hospital and those who had acquired it in the community. Next, Pei et al. used computer modeling to test what would have happened if these high-risk individuals had received interventions to prevent them from spreading MRSA in the hospital. This showed that targeting individuals at high-risk of a MRSA infection could reduce the spread of MRSA in the hospital.</p><p>The computer models developed by Pei et al. may help researchers, clinicians and public health officials working to control the spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria. The model can improve our understanding of how antibiotic resistant bacteria spread in healthcare facilities and may enable the development of more effective strategies to control these pathogens. Infection-control strategies created with this system must first be tested in isolated, real-world settings to verify they work before they can be deployed broadly.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic></kwd><kwd>antibiotic-resistant pathogens</kwd><kwd>antimicrobial-resistant bacteria</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM110748</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shaman</surname><given-names>Jeffrey L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000066</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ES009089</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shaman</surname><given-names>Jeffrey L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000070</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01EB022720</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Makse</surname><given-names>Hernán</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U54CA137788/U54CA132378</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Makse</surname><given-names>Hernán</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IIS-1515022</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Makse</surname><given-names>Hernán</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The asymptomatic colonization and importation of methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) in hospital settings can be inferred from observed cases using combined model-inference methods and used to inform improved interventions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Antimicrobial resistance is a global concern in healthcare systems due to its substantial morbidity and mortality burden and the lack of effective treatment options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">CDC, 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Magill et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">WHO, 2018</xref>). Among antibiotic-resistant agents, Methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) emerges as one of the most widespread and virulent pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grundmann et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Klevens et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Klein et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jarvis et al., 2012</xref>) and has been highlighted as a leading cause of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">CDC, 2013b</xref>). Initially confined to healthcare facilities, MRSA has since become increasingly prevalent in the broader population in both the United States and Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chambers, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Naimi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zetola et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hetem et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kouyos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tosas Auguet et al., 2016</xref>). This entwined transmission among hospitals and the community has obscured understanding of the dynamics and persistence of MRSA. Further, MRSA can colonize patients without symptoms for years, during which it can be transmitted stealthily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cooper et al., 2004a</xref>). These epidemiological features have greatly complicated its control and elimination.</p><p>The prevalence of MRSA has large variations across different countries. In Europe, a general north-south gradient has been observed, with rare incidence in Scandinavian hospitals and much higher occurrence in Mediterranean hospitals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stefani and Varaldo, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tiemersma et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Johnson, 2011</xref>). In particular, Sweden remains one of the few countries with a low prevalence of MRSA infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stenhem et al., 2006</xref>). A substantial proportion of MRSA cases in Sweden has been imported from abroad due to traveling and healthcare contacts in foreign countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stenhem et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Larsson et al., 2014</xref>). As a consequence, analyzing MRSA outbreaks in Sweden offers a good opportunity to study the hybrid dynamics of MRSA in hospital settings where both nosocomial transmission and importation occurs.</p><p>To facilitate better control of MRSA in hospital settings, several critical questions need to be answered. First, what are the relative roles of nosocomial transmission and infection importation from the community? Public health officials require an accurate assessment of the current force of infection within and into hospitals in order to deploy appropriate containment measures; however, with the increasing prevalence of MRSA in the community, disentangling HAIs from infections imported from the community has become difficult. Second, how many patients are colonized, and who and where are these high-risk individuals? Effective control would benefit from accurate determination of asymptomatic colonization rates in the general population; failure to estimate and account for colonization may result in long-term control issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cooper et al., 2004a</xref>). Although colonized patients can be identified using sequencing methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harris et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Long et al., 2014</xref>), the expense of these assays limits their application, particularly in underdeveloped countries where MRSA has become endemic. In light of this situation, mathematical modeling offers an alternative approach for locating individuals with a high probability of colonization and guiding the targeted deployment of laboratory testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grundmann and Hellriegel, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">van Kleef et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Opatowski et al., 2011</xref>). However, this inference problem is again complicated by the unobserved stealth transmission dynamics that occurs in the highly complex time-varying contact networks of the real world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Donker et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vanhems et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jarynowski and Liljeros, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Obadia et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Obadia et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rocha et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nekkab et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Duval et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>To address these issues, here we develop an agent-based network model-Bayesian inference system for estimating unobserved colonization and importation rates from simple incidence records. We use this system to infer the transmission dynamics of the most commonly diagnosed MRSA strain, UK EMRSA-15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grundmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Das et al., 2013</xref>), from multiple Swedish hospitals (Materials and methods). Key features estimated include the number of infections acquired in hospital and imported from outside, as well as the locations of individuals with a high colonization probability. Such information is crucial for designing cost-effective control measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cooper et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cooper et al., 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hubben et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Worby et al., 2013</xref>). In retrospective control experiments, decolonization of potentially colonized patients outperforms heuristic intervention strategies based on number of contacts, length of stay and contact tracing. These findings indicate that the model-inference system can inform effective, actionable and cost-effective measures for reducing nosocomial transmission.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Spatiotemporal features of MRSA infection</title><p>Observed incidence over a 6-year outbreak period is reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>.

Previous studies indicate that heterogeneity in infection risk exists across different types of ward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bootsma et al., 2006</xref>). For instance, patients in intensive care units (ICUs) typically suffer a higher risk of infection than those in non-ICU settings due to higher patient-healthcare-worker contact rates, high levels of antibiotic use, and high patient vulnerability to infection. In this study dataset, however, we observed no clear clustering of infections in certain wards. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, we use a raster plot to display the distribution of infections in 114 infected wards over time.

Infected wards tend to have a higher number of inpatients, a longer average length of stay as well as a larger ward size. Intuitively, the number of MRSA infections in a ward should increase as patient-days within the ward increase. However, the average number of infections is not observed to increase linearly with patient-days, indicating that patient-days per ward alone cannot explain the observed patterns of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). While these raw features provide a general understanding of MRSA transmission, they cannot be effectively employed to assess infection or colonization risk in a specific ward due to their largely overlapping distributions, which prevent a clear classification of risk. Instead, a quantitative analysis using mathematical modeling is needed.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The agent-based model</title><p>In hospital settings, MRSA transmission between colonized/infected patients and susceptible individuals is primarily mediated indirectly by healthcare workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lowy, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Temime et al., 2009</xref>). As a result, accurate representation of actual contact patterns is crucial for modeling MRSA transmission. Many previous studies have formulated transmission models using ordinary differential equations (ODEs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cooper et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kajita et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">D'Agata et al., 2009</xref>) or stochastic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Forrester et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kypraios et al., 2010</xref>). To account for heterogeneity among different settings, several studies have included multiple facilities in a single-model construct, incorporating prior information on facility type in order to characterize and differentiate transmission dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bootsma et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Forrester et al., 2007</xref>). These approaches were then generalized to permit connection among institutions at different scales (hospitals, nursing homes and long-term healthcare facilities, or multiple wards or units within a facility) with time-varying contact patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Thomas et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In this work, we model nosocomial MRSA transmission using an individual-level agent-based model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Macal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Assab et al., 2017</xref>). One major advantage of using an agent-based approach is that the heterogeneity of contact in different ward types can be accounted for within the model. For instance, even though we were provided no information about ward type, some of the heterogeneity among wards can be represented by the contact pattern specific to each ward, for example a longer length of stay in long-term healthcare units. Other aspects, however, are simplified; for example, due to the observed absence of infection clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), we assume a uniform transmission rate across different wards within the model. This assumption is ultimately justified by the good agreement between inferred dynamics and observations (as described later).</p><p>In the model, transmission occurs on the substrate of a time-varying contact network, which is constructed using the actual hospitalization records from 66 hospitals in Stockholm County, Sweden. In this contact network, nodes represent uniquely labeled patients, connected by undirected links among individuals sharing a ward at a given time. The rationale behind this network construction approach is that, if two patients stay in the same ward simultaneously, the shared healthcare personnel may facilitate transmission between them. The structure of the contact network is relatively stable over time, as indicated by the degree distributions of the weekly aggregated networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In particular, the degree distributions can be well fitted by a Weibull distribution, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:msup><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>6.15</mml:mn><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mn>10</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> (95% CI: <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>5.96</mml:mn><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mn>10</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>6.34</mml:mn><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mn>10</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>), <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf6"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>2.13</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> (95% CI: <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf7"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2.12</mml:mn><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>2.14</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>) (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf8"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.95</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>).</p><p>The contact network is time-varying and exhibits high spatiotemporal complexity. The daily in-hospital patient number fluctuates between 4000 and 7000 during the study period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>). Patient hospitalization time, readmission time, and patient-to-patient contact time all follow heavy-tailed distributions, spanning several orders of magnitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Moreover, about 100 connected components coexist in the contact network each week (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Connections between different connected components change over time due to the transfer and readmission of patients. 128,119 patients were transferred from one ward to another during their stay, and another 280,506 patients were readmitted within 1 year of their previous discharge. These patient movements connect healthcare facilities that would otherwise be isolated in the network and facilitate long-range transmission across multiple hospitals. A direct consequence of this patient movement is difficulty tracking the indirect transmission path of MRSA across different hospitals. For instance, a patient located in one hospital can be involved in the transmission occurring in another when he/she moves across multiple facilities. Detailed analyses of the contact network structure and hospitalization traffic can be found in Appendix 1.</p><p>Model patients are classified into three categories: susceptible individuals who are free of MRSA (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf9"><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>), colonized individuals who carry the bacteria asymptomatically (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf10"><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>), and confirmed positive patients (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf11"><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>). The model simulates two connected dynamics: nosocomial transmission and importation from the community. Here, the community is broadly defined as all locations outside the study hospitals, and may include households and healthcare facilities not covered in the study. Within hospitals, transitions between states (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf12"><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf13"><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf14"><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>) are governed by parameters that help define either interaction dynamics or the progression of infection. Specifically, a susceptible individual staying in a ward with a colonized person can become MRSA colonized with transmission probability <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf15"><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> per day. In our model, we assume that patients within a ward have the same rate of contact with each other, presumably mediated by the shared healthcare workers in a ward. The transmission process is density-dependent, as the force of infection in a ward increases with the number of colonized patients within the ward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Begon et al., 2002</xref>). Upon colonization, asymptomatic persons can return to the susceptible state at a spontaneous decolonization rate <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf16"><mml:mi>α</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, or they can test positive with an infection progression rate <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf17"><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>. We assume infected patients will receive treatment, no longer spread bacteria, and return to state <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf18"><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> with a recovery rate <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf19"><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>. Treatment is assumed to continue until infected patients are clear of MRSA. Given the exponential decay of infection probability, the characteristic treatment period is <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf20"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> days. Note that colonization only occurs between individuals connected by a link in the contact network, whereas decolonization, infection and recovery progress spontaneously, independent of the contact network. Outside the study hospitals, the transmission process is not explicitly simulated; instead, two additional parameters are introduced to represent transmission intensity. For patients who appear for the first time in hospital, we assume they belong to states <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf21"><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf22"><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> with probability <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf23"><mml:msub><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf24"><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>, respectively. As importation rates of colonized and infected patients depend on the time-varying MRSA prevalence outside hospitals, we assume the parameters <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf25"><mml:msub><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf26"><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> are time-dependent. Once patients appear in the contact network, the evolution of their states follows the dynamics as defined above. After discharge, we continue tracking the progression of colonized individuals; however, transmission outside the study hospitals is not represented. The flow of individuals between categories is illustrated schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>.</p><p>For a realistic scenario, disease-related model parameters may differ from person to person. To account for this variability during implementation, parameters, for example <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf27"><mml:mi>α</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf28"><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf29"><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, for each individual are randomly drawn from uniform ranges obtained from prior literature (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

IF can be used to infer the maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) of parameters in epidemic models and has been successfully applied to infectious diseases such as cholera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">King et al., 2008</xref>) and measles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">He et al., 2010</xref>). Initially developed for ODE models, IF has subsequently been generalized for other model forms (e.g. stochastic models) using the plug-and-play approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">He et al., 2010</xref>). Here, we adapt IF for agent-based models, leveraging an equation-free approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kevrekidis et al., 2003</xref>) that allows for mapping between the system-level observations (e.g. weekly incidence) used for the IF and the individual-level states evolved in the agent-based model (Appendix 1). In applying the IF, we perform multiple iterations using an efficient Bayesian filtering algorithm – the Ensemble Adjustment Kalman Filter (EAKF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson, 2001</xref>), which has been widely used in infectious disease forecast and inference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shaman and Karspeck, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pei and Shaman, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pei et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kandula et al., 2018</xref>). Details of the IF implementation can be found in Materials and methods.</p><p>Before applying the inference system to real-world data, we first need to validate its effectiveness. For the real-world data the inference targets are unobserved, so instead we test the inference system using model-generated synthetic outbreaks for which we know the exact values of the parameter. Although actual MRSA transmission dynamics cannot be fully described by the simplified agent-based model, performing synthetic tests provides validation that the inference system works if the transmission process generally follows the model-specified dynamics.</p><p>To generate synthetic outbreak observations, we used the agent-based model to simulate weekly incidence during a one-year period (52 weeks), and then imposed noise to produce the observations used in inference (See details in Appendix 1). We ran 20 iterations of the EAKF within the IF framework. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, we display the inference results for the three parameters <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf49"><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf50"><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf51"><mml:msub><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> at different iterations in one realization of the IF algorithm. The blue horizontal lines mark the target values used to generate the outbreak. The orange boxes show the distribution of posterior parameters (300 ensemble members) after each iteration. The IF algorithm returns the stabilized ensemble mean as the MLEs of parameters. As a result of the stochastic nature of model dynamics and initialization of the inference algorithm, different runs of the IF algorithm usually return slightly different MLEs. To obtain the credible intervals (CIs) for the MLEs, we repeated the inference for 100 times (see Materials and methods).

In its implementation, the performance of the inference system depends on the sensitivity of the observations to each parameter. In the agent-based model used here, observed incidence is less sensitive to <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf64"><mml:msub><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> due to the long period of colonization.

Nevertheless, this slight underestimation does not significantly affect the inferred dynamics. To demonstrate this insensitivity, we ran 1000 simulations using the inferred mean parameters and obtained distributions of weekly incidence from the stochastic agent-based model.

inferred parameters can be plugged back into the model to run simulations and obtain information addressing our questions of interest (see <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref> for an example). For instance, we performed 1000 model simulations using the inferred mean parameter values, and generated distributions of incidence from the stochastic agent-based model. These distributions are compared to observations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>. All observations fall within the whisker range of Tukey boxplots (see more analyses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). To further explore whether some of the key observed statistics can be reproduced using the inferred parameters, we display the distribution of the number of infected wards in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>. The observed number lies at the peak of the simulated distribution (vertical dash line). The spatial distribution of infections among different wards can be characterized by the distribution of wards with a certain number of infections in an outbreak. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, we compare this distribution obtained from 1000 simulations with what we observed in the data (red diamonds): the observed distribution agrees well with the simulated distributions. This close matching indicates that the model structure and inferred parameters can reliably reproduce the observed outbreak pattern in both space and time (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). In addition to generating a good model fit, the inference system also discriminates the burdens of nosocomial transmission and infection importation. Nosocomial and imported infections are distinguished by the location of MRSA colonization: if patients acquire MRSA in hospital, they are classified as nosocomial transmission cases; otherwise they are imported cases. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> compares the distributions of both types of infections generated from 1000 simulations: a substantial number of infections are inferred as importations. In clinical practice, the number of days between hospital admission and infection is usually used to distinguish hospital-acquired from community-acquired infections, typically with 48 hr used as the threshold. We performed this classification and compared the findings with our inference result. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>, the number of imported and nosocomial cases obtained from inference generally matches the classification result using days from admission to infection.</p><media id="video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-40977-video1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40977.022</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>One realization of the agent-based model simulation.</title><p>We visualize a single realization of the agent-based model during a one-year period.

This simultaneous rise may have been caused by household transmission initiated by asymptomatically colonized patients discharged from hospitals. After this growth phase, both transmission and importation rates were suppressed. Finally, the UK EMRSA-15 outbreak appears near eliminated in Swedish hospitals, represented by the inferred low values of all parameters. However, if control measures in hospital were to be relaxed, the colonized patients might spark another outbreak due to the lengthy colonization period, which highlights the need for asymptomatic colonization control in order to effect MRSA elimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cooper et al., 2004a</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Designing cost-effective interventions</title><p>Asymptomatic colonization is a major issue hindering the control and elimination of MRSA in hospitals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cooper et al., 2004a</xref>). Screening can identify colonized patients and evaluate the general colonization burden; however, it is an inefficient and costly measure that wastes resources that otherwise could be used to solve more urgent problems.

In order to evaluate the effectiveness of such interventions, we performed a retrospective control experiment. Specifically, we used the inferred parameters in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> to run the model for 6 years to reproduce the outbreak. Every 4 weeks, we used currently available information (as would be available in real time) to estimate patient colonization probabilities (see details in Materials and methods). The colonization probabilities estimated in real time are highly correlated with the results obtained using information from the whole course of the epidemic, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>. During the model integration, every 4 weeks, we selected patients with an estimated colonization probability higher than a certain threshold for screening. If positive, these inpatients were decolonized. To assess the impact of decolonization success rate on intervention impact, two efficiencies, 100% and 75%, were tested, and we repeated the experiment 1000 times. The findings show that the proposed intervention strategy can avert considerable numbers of colonization and infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>). Decreasing the decolonization threshold leads to a larger screened population (as shown in the inset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), and thus reduces colonization and infection further. However, the marginal benefit becomes negligible below a certain threshold value, as the remaining colonized and infected patients are possibly caused by importation, which cannot be directly controlled by inpatient intervention. The decolonization success rate also plays an important role, as indicated by the increased colonization and infection for the lower success rate.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40977.026</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Retrospective control experiment in Swedish hospitals.</title><p>The cumulative cases of colonization (<bold>A</bold>) and infection (<bold>B</bold>) after decolonizing patients with a hazard of colonization higher than a specified decolonization threshold.

Here, we compare the performance of the inference-based intervention with three alternative screening strategies informed by patient number of contacts, length of stay and contact tracing. For the former two, at each month, we ranked patients by their current total number of contacts (i.e. cumulative number of connections in the time-varying network since admission) or length of stay in a descending order, and created the screening list using the top-ranked patients. By varying the fraction of patients selected from the ranking (from 0% to 5%), we can inspect the control results for different numbers of screened patients. For contact tracing, upon each observation of infection, we tracked patients who stayed in the same ward with an infected individual within a certain time window prior to the infection, and screened those possibly colonized patients in hospitals. Tracing time windows ranging from 1 day to 14 days were tested. The number of screened patients does not increase significantly with tracing times longer than 14 days. Note that, screening and decolonization are performed only within hospitals. If patients listed for screening have already discharged before the diagnosis of infection, they are screened upon their next re-admission.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–D</xref>, the average numbers of colonized and infected patients are compared based on the number of screened patients. Heuristic control measures relying on the number of contacts, length of stay and contact tracing all limit MRSA transmission; however, a substantial additional reduction in both colonization and infection can be achieved through inference-based intervention. On average, inference-based screening of approximately 0.89% (6,617/743,599) of all patients can avert up to 38% (121/315) of infections and 9% (1,610/17,810) of colonizations. In comparison, the other three methods given similar numbers of screened patients only reduced infections and colonizations by 21% and 4% (number of contacts), 27% and 6% (length of stay), and 28% and 6% (contact tracing), respectively.</p><p>The colonization probability obtained from inference quantifies individual systemic risk given the general situation of transmission, regardless of the specific location of undetected colonization. In contrast, screening based on contact tracing identifies colonized individuals related to observed infections; however, with an unknown amount of imported colonization, this approach may overlook a considerable number of colonized patients, who can sustain subsequent transmission. As a result, the inference-based intervention can identify and treat the pivotal individuals, or superspreaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pei and Makse, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pei et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pei et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pei et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Teng et al., 2016</xref>), who may otherwise transmit MRSA asymptomatically in the first place. This preventive approach is more effective than contact tracing in the presence of frequent importation, as it disrupts probable transmission pathways. In real-world hospital settings, the proposed inference-based intervention could be implemented and evaluated in real time: it only requires hospitalization records and ward information.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this work, we have developed an agent-based model-inference framework that can estimate nosocomial MRSA transmission dynamics in the presence of importation. Further, we have shown that these inferred dynamics can be used to quantify patient colonization risk and guide more effective interventions.</p><p>The transmission dynamics generated using the agent-based model are intrinsically stochastic, that is, the observed record of UK EMRSA-15 infections is just one realization among an ensemble of all possible outcomes of an underlying highly stochastic process. In order to evaluate the general risk of MRSA transmission, key epidemiological parameters were inferred from the single observed realization. Previous studies have developed methods to infer transmission risk factors and reconstruct transmission paths using individual-level infection data for diseases such as H1N1 and MERS-CoV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cauchemez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cauchemez and Ferguson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cauchemez et al., 2016</xref>). In particular, Bayesian data augmentation approaches have been applied to MRSA models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Forrester et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kypraios et al., 2010</xref>); however, these approaches are not readily applicable to our dataset. The data assimilation scheme we developed here enables estimation of epidemiological parameters and key transmission information using aggregated incidence data. As demonstrated in the retrospective control experiment, assessment of individual colonization risk using aggregated data can be quite useful for preventing future MRSA transmission, especially when stealth importations are frequent.</p><p>In this study, we omitted representation of heterogeneity across different wards. This simplification is valid for the study Swedish hospitals, as we observed no infection clusters and the model reproduced key statistics of observations well. However, in other settings, clustering analysis and ward information may be necessary before the application of the inference system. Should certain wards suffer a much higher rate of infection, a separate suite of parameters can be defined and inferred for these wards, using priors that better represent this more intense transmission. We also only considered transmission among patients staying in the same ward. In the future, more contact information such as healthcare workers shared by a group of patients could be incorporated into the contact network. In addition, as the community defined in the model may include non-sampled hospitals, inferred community risk may have been overestimated as it also included contributions from those healthcare facilities outside the network.</p><p>We note that the reported inference results are obtained using only hospitalization records and UK EMRSA-15 case numbers. Should more data (e.g. surgery or treatment records) become available, this additional information could be incorporated into the agent-based model and used to refine the present results. Our model-inference framework provides a foundational platform for flexible simulation and inference of antibiotic resistant pathogens. In this study, we applied this system to Swedish hospitals with low MRSA prevalence. However, in the future, it could be used to provide actionable information for disease control in less developed settings where MRSA is endemic. In a highly interconnected area, transmission of antibiotic resistant pathogens from endemic regions to epidemic-free hospitals is more likely. This risk calls for containment measures in the general population and collaborative control efforts among multiple healthcare facilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Smith et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">D'Agata et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ciccolini et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Slayton et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Data description</title><p>The dataset contains admission and discharge records of 743,599 distinct patients from 66 hospitals (271 clinics, 1041 wards) in Stockholm County, Sweden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jarynowski and Liljeros, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rocha et al., 2016</xref>), spanning over 3500 continuous days during the 2000s.

The IF framework is designed as follows: an ensemble of system states, which represent the distribution of parameters, are repeatedly adjusted using filtering techniques in a series of iterations, during which the variance of the parameters is gradually tuned down. In the process, the distribution of parameters is iteratively optimized per observations and narrowed down to values that achieve maximum likelihood. This approach is based on an analytical proof that guarantees its convergence under mild assumptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ionides et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In its original implementation, the data assimilation method used in IF is sequential Monte Carlo, or particle filtering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arulampalam et al., 2002</xref>). Here, due to the high computational cost of the agent-based model, we use a different efficient data assimilation algorithm - the Ensemble Adjustment Kalman Filter (EAKF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson, 2001</xref>). Unlike particle filtering, which requires a large ensemble size (usually of the order O(<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf111"><mml:msup><mml:mn>10</mml:mn><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula>) or higher) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Snyder et al., 2008</xref>), the EAKF can generate results similar in performance using only hundreds of ensemble members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shaman and Karspeck, 2012</xref>). Originally developed for use in weather prediction, the EAKF assumes a Gaussian distribution of both the prior and likelihood, and adjusts the prior distribution to a posterior using Bayes rule in a deterministic way such that the first two moments (mean and variance) of an observed variable are adjusted while higher moments remain unchanged during the update (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson, 2001</xref>). In epidemiological studies, the EAKF has been widely used for parameter inference and forecast of infectious diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shaman and Karspeck, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pei and Shaman, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pei et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kandula et al., 2018</xref>).

Detailed explanation of the IF-EAKF system is provided in Appendix 1.</p><p>In each iteration of the IF, the standard deviation of each parameter is shrunk by a factor <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf125"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mo>∈</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> (or equivalently, the variance is discounted by a factor of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf126"><mml:msup><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula>). In practice, the discount factor <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf127"><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> can range between 0.9 and 0.99 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ionides et al., 2006</xref>). If <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf128"><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is too small, the algorithm may ‘quench’ too fast and fail to find the MLE; if it is too close to 1, the algorithm may not converge in a reasonable time interval. We stop the IF algorithm once the estimates of the ensemble mean stabilize. The number of iterations required for this convergence was determined by inspecting the evolution of posterior parameter distributions, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. Note that once the ensemble mean stabilizes, increasing the iteration time will not affect the MLE, although it can lead to a further narrowing of the ensemble distribution.</p><p>Algorithm 1 only returns the MLEs for the parameters; however, it is also desirable to obtain CIs for those MLEs. For deterministic ODE models, Ionides <italic>et al.</italic> used ‘sliced likelihood’ to numerically estimate the Fisher information and standard errors (SEs) of MLEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ionides et al., 2006</xref>). Here, for a highly stochastic system, evaluating the Fisher information numerically is challenging. As a result, we took another approach by running multiple realizations of the IF algorithm. In different runs, the MLEs are slightly different due to stochasticity in the agent-based model and in the initialization of the inference algorithm. In this work, we ran 100 independent realizations to generate the average MLEs of inferred parameters and their corresponding 95% CIs. Results from synthetic tests indicate that this approach is effective in calculating MLEs and quantifying their uncertainties.</p><table-wrap id="inlinetable1" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Algorithm 1.

ABC-based methods employ numerical simulations to approximate the likelihood function, in which the simulated samples are compared with the observed data. In a typical ABC rejection algorithm, large numbers of parameters are sampled from the prior distribution. For each set of parameters, the distance between simulated samples (generated using the parameters) and observed data is calculated. Parameters resulting in a distance larger than a certain tolerance are rejected, and the retained parameters form the posterior distribution. ABC methods can fully explore the likelihood landscape in parameter space. However, it requires large numbers of simulations, which may be prohibitive for the large-scale agent-based models considered here. In addition, a good choice of the tolerance in the rejection algorithm is needed. The IF algorithm, instead, is applicable to computationally expensive agent-based models, but may become trapped in the local optimum of the posterior distribution. In practice, this problem can be alleviated by exploring a larger prior parameter space and setting a slower quenching speed, that is, a smaller discount factor <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf157"><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Inferred parameters and 95% CIs for three synthetic tests</title><p>We report the inferred parameters and their corresponding 95% CIs for the synthetic tests in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>.

id="s4-4"><title>Inference-based intervention</title><p>To guarantee a fair comparison between the inference-based intervention and other heuristic strategies, we estimated the colonization probability using only real-time information available before control measures are effected. For instance, to estimate the colonization probability at the fifth month in the third year, we first infer the model parameters for the first 2 years, where we have data from the whole year, and then use the partial observation in the remaining 5 months to infer the model parameters for the third year. The inferred parameters are then used to generate 1000 synthetic outbreaks from the beginning, and the current colonization probability for each individual is calculated from these simulations. In the inset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, we show that the colonization probability estimated in real time is highly correlated with that obtained using information from the entire outbreak record. In practice, every 4 weeks, the estimated colonization probability and the decolonization list were updated. The inference-based intervention only uses information available at the time control measures are effected. As a consequence, it is a practical method that can be implemented in real time.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Martin Bootsma, Ben Cooper, Prabhat Jha and Lulla Opatowski for valuable comments on earlier versions of the manuscript.

This is possibly due to reduced patient traffic during weekends.</p><p>We next examined the total number of patients in the study hospitals. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>, the in-hospital patient number fluctuates between 4000 and 7000. Patient numbers exhibit a periodic behavior at an annual time-scale, as well as at finer weekly time-scale. We also present the number of new patients (with respect to the patients present the previous day) in the hospitals each day in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>. The number of new patients is relatively small compared with the total patients.</p><p>The distribution of patient time in hospital follows a power-law shape with a heavy tail (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Such heterogeneity leads to high spatiotemporal contact network complexity. In fact, the contact time between all pairs of patients follows a similar power-law distribution, as shown in the upper inset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>. The readmission time, that is, individual patient time between discharge and next admission, is a key parameter in MRSA transmission models. The lower inset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref> indicates that this readmission time is also quite heterogeneous, spanning from several days to up to a few years.</p><p>Next we examined the topological features of the weekly aggregated contact network in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>, which shows the number of patients in the giant connected component (GCC) and the entire contact network. While most patients belong to the GCC, there also exist many fragmented small connected components (CCs). The total number of CCs in the contact network is also presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>. About 100 CCs coexist in the network each week, but the size of small CCs is usually below 200, as shown in the inset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>. Connections between different CCs change over time due to the transfer and readmission of patients. 128,119 patients were transferred from one ward to another during their stay, and another 280,506 patients were readmitted within one year of their previous discharge. These patient movements connect healthcare facilities that would otherwise be isolated in the network and are responsible for long-range transmission across multiple hospitals.</p><p>Given the large heterogeneity in the network structure and contact time, a traditional compartmental model using ordinary differential equations (ODE) may not adequately capture actual transmission dynamics. Therefore, in this study we adopt an individual-level agent-based model.</p></sec><sec id="s8" sec-type="appendix"><title>Equation-Free approach</title><p>Instead of using a parsimonious ordinary differential equation model, we employ an agent-based model to account for the spatiotemporal complexity of the underlying contact patterns. In particular, agent-based models can be used to simulate epidemic spread using an Equation-Free approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kevrekidis et al., 2003</xref>). The transmission process evolves following microscopic update rules defined at the individual-level, and macroscopic states are aggregated from the total simulated population.</p><p>The Equation-Free approach has been widely used for multi-scale modeling in applied mathematics and statistical physics. It consists of three basic elements: (1), lift, which transforms macroscopic observations through lifting to one or more consistent microscopic realizations; (2), evolve, which uses the microscopic simulator to evolve these realizations for a given time; and (3), restrict, which aggregates the evolved microscopic realizations to obtain the macroscopic observation.</p><p>In the MRSA transmission model, some quantities, for example colonization importation, infection importation, and weekly incidence, are macroscopic values aggregated from the individual-level states. In model simulation, we first need to lift these macroscopic quantities to consistent microscopic realizations. To do this, we maintained multiple realizations (300 ensemble members) of individual-level states. For each new patient entering the hospitals, a random number <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf186"><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> was generated from a uniform distribution <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf187"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>υ</mml:mi><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>U</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">[</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>.

To evaluate the goodness of fit for incidence number in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, we performed the following statistical analysis. As the agent-based model is a highly stochastic system, the observed incidence in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> is only one possible outcome of the actual dynamics, whereas in our analysis, the stochasticity of incidence number needs to be considered. To this end, we compared several summary statistics quantifying the goodness of fit in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> with their distributions calculated from synthetic outbreaks (surrogate data) generated from the inferred dynamics. We first considered the log likelihood of observations. In particular, we generated 1000 synthetic outbreaks using the inferred parameters, and approximated the distribution of incidence number at each week. Then we calculated the log likelihood for the observed incidence in each synthetic outbreak, and estimated its distribution using these 1000 log likelihood values computed from the surrogate data. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>, we compared the log likelihood computed from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> (vertical red line) with this distribution (blue bars) and calculated the 2-sided p-value. The p-value is well above zero, indicating that, in terms of log likelihood, our inferred dynamics span and thus agree well with the observed incidence. In other words, the observed incidence in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> is a typical outcome from our inferred dynamics. The same analysis was also applied to root-mean-square error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf235"><mml:msup><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula>) and Pearson correlation coefficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>). The RMSE, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf236"><mml:msup><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> and Pearson correlation coefficient were calculated using the incidence time series in each synthetic outbreak and the mean incidence time series averaged over 1000 simulations.</p><p>For the opposite situation in which nosocomial transmission is less than importation, we performed the same test.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Ben Cooper as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Prabhat Jha as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Martin Bootsma (Reviewer #2); Lulla Opatowski (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This work makes both an important methodological contribution to the communicable disease modelling literature, and also an important practical contribution to the study of nosocomial infections. First, the authors develop a novel inference framework allowing inferences from individual based transmission models (overcoming computational problems with existing particle filtering approaches). Second, the methods are applied to make inferences about parameters for a multi-institutional MRSA outbreak across a network of hospitals in Sweden and simulations are used to show how such model-based inferences could translate into improved control measures for MRSA.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Clarification of exact nature of the MRSA data is needed. Does this only come from clinical infections or was there also screening on asymptomatic carriage?</p><p>2) Figure 1B is difficult to read and should be revised. Since only integers (0-5) are plotted, the continuous scale may not be the best choice and makes it difficult to pick out what numbers are being plotted.</p><p>3) Enough information needs to be presented to allow an interested reader to repeat this analysis on their own data. In particular, the following aspects of the methods were not clear to any of the reviewers:</p><p>i) In Algorithm 1, why is the discount factor raised to the power 2(l-1), rather than just (l-1). Is the 2 arbitrary?</p><p>ii) How should the discount factor <italic>a</italic> be chosen, and how do different values of <italic>a</italic> influence the algorithm? A value of 0.9 is used, but not explanation is given for this choice.</p><p>iii) Algorithm 1 returns the MLE of the parameter vector but makes no attempt to measure the associated uncertainty. Indeed, the variance of the parameter vector ensemble approaches zero as L increases. This is also seen in Appendix 1, Figure 4A. However, distributions for parameters are reported in Figure 3A, and the methods say that &quot;parameter distributions become stable after 5 iterations…which means our choice of L=10 is sufficient&quot;. So how are the distributions in Figure 3A derived? Are these just taken from the ensemble of parameter vectors stopping after 10 iterations (implying that if L had been taken as 20 or more, the distributions shown in Figure 3A would have had much lower variance?) Surely it is important to produce not only point estimates, but also appropriate measures of uncertainty associated with these; it is not clear if this is being done and justification of the choice of L=10 in the data analysis (subsection “Inference using the actual diagnostic data”) compared with L=20 in the synthetic tests (subsection “Synthetic tests”) is lacking.</p><p>iv) In Algorithm 1 the actual EAKF step is not explained. Given that space is not a limitation (and technical details can be put int he appendix), it would be helpful to provide details of this EAKF step with sufficient detail to enable replication by the interested reader.</p><p>4) Clarification of model assumptions is needed. In particular, it is unclear whether the increased decolonization rate <italic>μ</italic> was only present during treatment, and that afterwards the spontaneous decolonization rate <italic>α</italic> kicks in, or whether treated patients keep their increased rate <italic>μ</italic> also after the treatment is stopped. Linked to this, what is the duration of treatment?</p><p>5) An explicit unambiguous description of the transmission process within a ward is lacking. Is the process density-dependent or frequency-dependent?</p><p>6) Units are missing in Table 1.</p><p>7) A table with all parameters estimates is missing.</p><p>8) Figure 5A-B legend is confusing as the y-axis doesn't seem to depict a reduction but cumulative incidence. Clarification is needed.</p><p>9) Can more formal assessment of model fits with synthetic and real data be provided in addition to the plots in Figure 2 and Figure 3?</p><p>10) Figure 5 and associated text: it is unclear whether the model based control measures uses only data/information that would be available at the time point control measures are put in place. If the inference approach instead uses information from the whole course of the epidemic, then this would be an unfair comparison. This needs clarification.</p><p>11) Subsection “Statistical test of power-law distribution”: &quot;the significance level of 0.05&quot; Following the recent ASA statement on the use (and misuse of p-values) there is a consensus that we should be striving to move away from such &quot;bright lines&quot;. So fine to report the p-value, but we should try to avoid saying that. 049 is significant while. 051 isn't.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40977.034</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>This work makes both an important methodological contribution to the communicable disease modelling literature, and also an important practical contribution to the study of nosocomial infections.

Is the 2 arbitrary?</p></disp-quote><p>After each iteration, the standard deviation of each parameter is discounted by a factor <italic>a</italic>. This is equivalent to a discount of <italic>a</italic><sup>2</sup> on the variance, which is represented by multiplication with the diagonal matrix Σ. We have clarified this point in subsection “Iterated filtering for agent-based models” and subsection “Synthetic tests” of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>ii) How should the discount factor a be chosen, and how do different values of a influence the algorithm? A value of 0.9 is used, but not explanation is given for this choice.</p></disp-quote><p>In implementation, the discount factor, <italic>a</italic>, is typically selected to be between 0.9 and 0.99 (Ionides et al., 2006). If it is too small, the algorithm may “quench” too fast and fail to find the MLE; if it is too close to 1, the algorithm may not converge in a reasonable time interval. We now explain the choice of discount factor in subsection “Iterated filtering for agent-based models”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iii) Algorithm 1 returns the MLE of the parameter vector but makes no attempt to measure the associated uncertainty. Indeed, the variance of the parameter vector ensemble approaches zero as L increases. This is also seen in Appendix 1, Figure 4A. However, distributions for parameters are reported in Figure 3A, and the methods say that &quot;parameter distributions become stable after 5 iterations…which means our choice of L=10 is sufficient&quot;. So how are the distributions in Figure 3A derived? Are these just taken from the ensemble of parameter vectors stopping after 10 iterations (implying that if L had been taken as 20 or more, the distributions shown in Figure 3A would have had much lower variance?) Surely it is important to produce not only point estimates, but also appropriate measures of uncertainty associated with these; it is not clear if this is being done and justification of the choice of L=10 in the data analysis (subsection “Inference using the actual diagnostic data”) compared with L=20 in the synthetic tests (subsection “Synthetic tests”) is lacking.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an insightful question. Indeed, Algorithm 1 only returns the MLEs of parameters. For deterministic ODE models, Ionides et al. used “sliced likelihood” to numerically estimate the Fisher information and standard errors (SEs) of the MLEs (Ionides et al., 2006). Here, for a highly stochastic system, evaluating the Fisher information numerically is challenging. As a result, we employed another approach by running multiple realizations of the IF algorithm. In these different runs, the MLEs are slightly different due to the stochasticity in the agent-based model and the initialization of the inference algorithm. We ran 100 independent realizations to generate the average MLEs of inferred parameters and their corresponding 95% CIs. We explain this approach in subsection “Iterated filtering for agent-based models”.</p><p>The distributions shown in Figure 3A of the initial submission were the posterior distributions of 300 ensemble members after L=10 iterations in one realization of the IF algorithm. The reviewers are correct that if we continue the algorithm, these distributions will converge to a point, as is observed in Figure 2A and supplemental figures. To properly report the inference results in the revision, we now display the distributions of MLEs (ensemble means) obtained from the 100 runs in Figure 3A. In other figures, we have also clarified which distributions have been plotted. Please see changes in subsection “Iterated filtering for agent-based models”, subsection “Inference of MRSA transmission in Swedish hospitals” and relevant figure legends.</p><p>We stopped the algorithm after the ensemble mean estimate stabilized. In principle, the number of iterations required for convergence can be determined by inspecting the evolution of posterior parameter distributions, as in Figure 2A. Once the posterior mean stabilizes, increasing the iteration time will not affect the MLE, although it will surely lead to a gradually narrowed ensemble distribution. This point is now explained in subsection “Iterated filtering for agent-based models”. To keep the algorithm setting consistent with the synthetic test, we have extended the iteration time to L=20 for the inference using real-world diagnostic data in the revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iv) In Algorithm 1 the actual EAKF step is not explained. Given that space is not a limitation (and technical details can be put int he appendix), it would be helpful to provide details of this EAKF step with sufficient detail to enable replication by the interested reader.</p></disp-quote><p>A detailed explanation of the EAKF update was added to the appendix. Please see subsection “The Ensemble Adjustment Kalman Filter”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Clarification of model assumptions is needed. In particular, it is unclear whether the increased decolonization rate μ was only present during treatment, and that afterwards the spontaneous decolonization rate α kicks in, or whether treated patients keep their increased rate μ also after the treatment is stopped. Linked to this, what is the duration of treatment?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this ambiguity. In our model, we assume that treatment continues until infected patients are clear of MRSA. Given the exponential decay of infection probability, the characteristic treatment period is 1/μ days. We have clarified this assumption in subsection “The agent-based model” of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) An explicit unambiguous description of the transmission process within a ward is lacking. Is the process density-dependent or frequency-dependent?</p></disp-quote><p>We now explain the transmission process explicitly in subsection “The agent-based model” of the revised manuscript. Specifically, a susceptible individual staying in a ward with a colonized person can become MRSA colonized with transmission probability β per day. In our model, we assume that patients within a ward have the same rate of contact with each other, presumably mediated by the shared healthcare workers in a ward. The transmission process is density-dependent, as the force of infection in a ward increases with the number of colonized patients within the ward.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Units are missing in Table 1.</p></disp-quote><p>Units were added in Table 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) A table with all parameters estimates is missing.</p></disp-quote><p>All estimated parameters are now reported in Table 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure 5A-B legend is confusing as the y-axis doesn't seem to depict a reduction but cumulative incidence. Clarification is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>The legend of Figure 5A-B was changed to indicate that the y-axis is cumulative incidence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Can more formal assessment of model fits with synthetic and real data be provided in addition to the plots in Figure 2 and Figure 3?</p><p>We thank reviewers for this constructive suggestion. For the revision, we performed an analysis to evaluate the model fit. To do so, we inspect whether the observed incidence is a typical outcome from the inferred stochastic dynamics. Specifically, we compared several summary statistics quantifying the goodness-of-fit with their distributions calculated from synthetic outbreaks (surrogate data) generated from the inferred dynamics. The tested statistics include log likelihood, RMSE, R-squared and Pearson correlation coefficient. For all statistics, p-values are bounded away from zero, indicating that the observed incidence agrees well with the inferred dynamics. Details can be found in subsection “Synthetic tests”, Figure 2—figure supplement 1, Figure 2—figure supplement 3, Figure 2—figure supplement 5 and Figure 3—figure supplement 2.</p><p>10) Figure 5 and associated text: it is unclear whether the model based control measures uses only data/information that would be available at the time point control measures are put in place. If the inference approach instead uses information from the whole course of the epidemic, then this would be an unfair comparison. This needs clarification.</p></disp-quote><p>To guarantee a fair comparison with other control measures, we reran the inference-based intervention using only real-time information available before the control measures are effected. The colonization probability estimated in real-time is highly correlated with the results obtained using information from the whole course of the epidemic. The implementation details are now presented in the revised manuscript and can be found in subsection “Designing cost-effective interventions” and subsection “Inference-based intervention”. The results remain similar.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Subsection “Statistical test of power-law distribution”: &quot;the significance level of 0.05&quot; Following the recent ASA statement on the use (and misuse of p-values) there is a consensus that we should be striving to move away from such &quot;bright lines&quot;. So fine to report the p-value, but we should try to avoid saying that.049 is significant while.051 isn't.</p></disp-quote><p>Statements about statistical significance were removed.</p></body></sub-article></article>
