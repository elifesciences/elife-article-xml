However, most tools currently used to explore connectivity have low throughput, low selectivity, or limited accessibility. Here, we report the development of an improved packaging system for the production of the highly neurotropic RVdG<sub>envA</sub>-CVS-N2c rabies viral vectors, yielding titers orders of magnitude higher with no background contamination, at a fraction of the production time, while preserving the efficiency of transsynaptic labeling. Along with the production pipeline, we developed suites of ‘starter’ AAV and bicistronic RVdG-CVS-N2c vectors, enabling retrograde labeling from a wide range of neuronal populations, tailored for diverse experimental requirements. We demonstrate the power and flexibility of the new system by uncovering hidden local and distal inhibitory connections in the mouse hippocampal formation and by imaging the functional properties of a cortical microcircuit across weeks. Our novel production pipeline provides a convenient approach to generate new rabies vectors, while our toolkit flexibly and efficiently expands the current capacity to label, manipulate and image the neuronal activity of interconnected neuronal circuits in vitro and in vivo.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>rabies virus</kwd><kwd>circuit mapping</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>entorhinal cortex</kwd><kwd>interneurons</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010661</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020 Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>692692</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jonas</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Z 312-B27</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jonas</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004412</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LT 000256-2018-L</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sumser</surname><given-names>Anton</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010661</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020 Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>756502</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Joesch</surname><given-names>Maximilian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003043</institution-id><institution>EMBO</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALTF 1098-2017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sumser</surname><given-names>Anton</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mapping neuronal circuits is made substantially faster, simpler and more accurate with this extended toolkit of novel cell lines and vectors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Addressing the complexity and underlying structure of neuronal networks remains one of the biggest challenges in modern neuroscience, as this knowledge is essential for the understanding of circuit functionality in health and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fornito et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Morgan and Lichtman, 2013</xref>). Short- and long-range connectivity between populations of neurons in the central and peripheral nervous systems can be mapped with numerous existing techniques, with varying degrees of simplicity, efficiency and reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Luo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Luo et al., 2018</xref>). While recent advances in viral technology, such as anterograde and retrograde AAVs, now enable genetic targeting of populations based on their projection pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tervo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zingg et al., 2017</xref>), they can only be used for analysis of macrocircuits, due to their lack of specificity. In contrast, monosynaptic tracing technologies, based on engineered rabies virus, enable cell-type specific labeling of presynaptic partners, making it one of the most powerful toolkits to genetically dissect neuronal populations. This process is achieved in two steps: in the first, the avian TVA receptor and the rabies glycoprotein (G) are co-expressed in a predesignated population of cells, usually via administration of an AAV vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and in the second step, G-deleted rabies viral vectors, pseudotyped with the Avian Sarcoma and Leukosis Virus’s envelope glycoprotein A (envA) are introduced to the region containing TVA- and G-expressing neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), resulting in propagation of rabies particles exclusively from these starter cells to their presynaptic partners, but not to disynaptically connected neurons, and rarely to post-synaptic targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zampieri et al., 2014</xref>), regardless of their physical proximity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ginger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wickersham et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A new viral packaging system for fast, clean and high-throughput production of RVdG-CVS-N2c vectors.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) A schematic representation of the experimental workflow for achieving cell type-specific trans-synaptic retrograde labeling using G-deleted, envA-pseudotyped rabies viral vectors: Genetic dissection of cre<sup>+</sup> neurons (blue) for conditional expression of TVA and G (<bold>A</bold>); targeting of RVdG<sub>envA</sub> particles to labeled neurons for expression of a gene of interest (GOI), (<bold>B</bold>) and subsequent propagation of native-coat RVdG particles from starter cells to their presynaptic partners (<bold>C</bold>).

Furthermore, since large quantities of native-coat particles are routinely used to initiate the pseudotyping step of the viral production protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Osakada and Callaway, 2013</xref>), background contamination of native-coat particles in the pseudotyped stock is nearly unavoidable, which can result in false identification of projecting populations directly labeled by native-coat particles and not transsynaptically through the starter cells.</p><p>Recently, the deployment of the highly neurotropic CVS-N2c rabies strain for monosynaptic tracing was shown to identify 5–20 fold more presynaptic cells per starter cell than SAD B19, enabling a more comprehensive analysis of the diversity of presynaptic cells innervating a predesignated starter population. In addition, this strain was shown to be less neurotoxic, making it more suitable for experiments in behaving animals. However, the production process for these vectors is time-consuming and yields low viral titers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Reardon et al., 2016</xref>), presumably due to the use of neuronal cell lines for the various amplification and packaging steps. This limitation has so far restricted more widespread use of the superior CVS-N2c vector in circuit mapping experiments, particularly in its more useful pseudotyped form, whose preparation is even lengthier and the titers lower still.</p><p>Here, we report the development of a new packaging system, allowing expedited production of high-titer RVdG<sub>envA</sub>-CVS-N2c particles, free of background contamination from native-coat particles, and show that these vectors retain their superior expansion efficacy when compared to SAD B19 vectors. We also report an extended toolkit of AAV and CVS-N2c vectors which can be applied to a wide range of experimental paradigms, and demonstrate their efficacy in uncovering hidden neuronal connections, even in heavily explored circuits.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Improved packaging for RVdG viral vectors</title><p>Prolonged and cumbersome production has been a major limitation for G-deleted rabies virus vectors and most profoundly so for the CVS-N2c strain. Because CVS-N2c vectors exhibit enhanced neurotropism and retrograde labeling over SAD B19, improvements in the speed and quality of the various N2c production stages are necessary to realize the full potential of rabies viral vectors for mapping synaptic circuits. Here, we introduce a production protocol, based on two new packaging cell lines we have developed: (1) “HEK293-GT” cells, based on HEK293T cells stably expressing the chimeric SAD B19 codon optimized glycoprotein (oG) comprised of the extracellular domain of the Pasteur strain G and the transmembrane domain of the SAD B19G, along with the optimized T7 RNA polymerase (oT7pol), used for the initial rescue and amplification of native-coat particles, and (2) ‘BHK-eT’ cells, based on BHK21 cells stably expressing the envA glycoprotein, along with the TVA receptor, used for simultaneous vector pseudotyping and amplification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). The oG was selected for use in the rescue cell line because it can be used to efficiently rescue both the SAD B19 and the CVS-N2c strains and effectively transduce all cell types, whereas particles coated with the N2cG are highly specific to neuronal cell types and do not effectively transduce HEK293 or BHK-21 cells.</p><p>To improve the selection process for the transgene carrying cells, both cell lines make use of antibiotic resistance genes and strong constitutive promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Norrman et al., 2018</xref>). This ensures that cultures consist of purely transgene-expressing cells and that expression levels in those cells are high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-C</xref>). Furthermore, unlike previous packaging systems, the co-expression of TVA and envA in the BHK-eT cell line allows pseudotyped particles to propagate within the culture, similar to the native-coat ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>), enabling amplification and pseudotyping of vectors in a single short step. In addition, since a very small amount of native-coat, or even trace amounts of pseudotyped virus, are sufficient in order to initiate the pseudotyping process, contamination from native-coat particles in the final pseudotyped stock can be minimized, while the titer of the pseudotyped stock can be exceedingly high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). For each new viral batch produced (37 in total), we injected pseudotyped particles at work concentrations (1–5×10<sup>8</sup> TU ml<sup>-1</sup>) into naïve brains. We found only minimal non-specific labeling (a maximum of 1–2 labelled cells per 0.5–1 mm of tissue examined).</p><p>Even though the presence of native coat particles can be virtually eliminated from the preparation, it is still possible to see sparse non-specific labeling of pseudotyped particles in the absence of TVA, when extremely high vector titers (100–500-fold higher to our experimental requirements) are introduced into the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). To demonstrate that even this sparse labeling likely results from direct penetration of pseudotyped particles into damaged cells and cell processes along the needle tract, rather than from non-specific labeling with native coat particles, we transduced organotypic hippocampal cultures prepared from a WT mouse brain with envA-pseudotyped CVS-N2c-tdTomato, either immediately or one hour after lacerating the culture with a scalpel, to simulate physical damage to neuronal processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). We observed that cultures transduced immediately after the insult exhibited substantially higher transduction rates than cultures transduced one hour later, after most damaged processes had time to recover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D and E</xref>) confirming that physical damage (such as one that accompanies intracerebral injection with a Hamilton needle), can produce off-target labeling around the injection site, when high-titer virus is delivered.

Four weeks after AAV vectors were delivered to the DG, along with a single i.p. injection of tamoxifen (TMX) to induce recombination in the CreERT2 line, RVdG<sub>envA</sub>-CVS-N2c-EGFP vectors were introduced to the same location. This manipulation resulted in both highly specific targeting of tdTomato<sup>+</sup> adult-born DGCs in the inner granule cell layer, as well as robust retrograde labeling of afferents to these starter cells. This high efficacy manifested as widespread and specific labeling of layer-2 neurons of the medial and lateral entorhinal cortices (MEC and LEC, respectively), hilar mossy cells, CA3 pyramidal cells and a number of DG-projecting subcortical regions, including the medial septal (MS), the supramamilary (SuM), and the raphe (RN) nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref> and B), largely consistent with several previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Deshpande et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vivar et al., 2012</xref>).

To attain interneuron-specific retrograde labeling, we first used AAV vectors to express the TVA-2A-N2cG cassette under control of the interneuron-specific mDLX promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dimidschstein et al., 2013</xref>) in the CA1 of GAD1-EGFP mice. A subsequent injection of CVS-N2c-tdTomato revealed widespread labeling of 2<sup>nd</sup> order neurons both within the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 fields, as well as in the EC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). An additional analysis of co-labeling in the EC revealed a small population of long-range inhibitory projection neurons, located preferentially in the deeper layers 5 a and 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), whose existence has previously been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Basu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Melzer et al., 2012</xref>) but their location within the EC has so far remained unknown. In order to cross-validate and expand on these findings, we crossed Dlx5/6<sup>flpE</sup> mice with the double cre +flp, tdTomato reporter line Ai65 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Madisen et al., 2015</xref>). Hereby, using injections of AAV vectors with flp-dependent TVA-2A-N2cG expression cassette, followed by RVdG<sub>envA</sub>-CVS-N2c-EGFP-iCre, we were able to highlight and isolate the inhibitory projections to hippocampal inhibitory neurons, as the double cre +flp recombination required for tdTomato expression can only take place in inhibitory neurons transduced by the rabies virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). In line with our previous findings, we show that while the majority of excitatory cortical input to hippocampal inhibitory neurons originated in the superficial layers 2 and 3, long-range inhibitory projection neurons are almost exclusively found in the deeper layers 5 a and 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Further examination of labeling patterns of 2<sup>nd</sup> order neurons in deep-brain regions showed that in the MS and the diagonal band of Broca (DBB), a large fraction of cells are double-labeled, confirming that our labeling strategy for isolation of long-range inhibitory projections is exhaustive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). This strongly suggests that while the deeper cortical layers give rise to both inhibitory and excitatory hippocampal projections, the excitatory projection originated from a substantially larger population. This is particularly unexpected, as to-date, only sporadic evidence existed for the presence of cortico-hippocampal projections, excitatory or inhibitory, arising from the deeper layers of the EC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gloveli et al., 2001</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Bicistronic CVS-N2c vectors for efficient dual labeling</title><p>A previous report has shown that the B19 N-P linker sequence, which allows the virus to effectively separate these proteins, can also be used for separation of exogenous genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Osakada et al., 2018</xref>). While this approach could promote an expansion of the rabies toolkit to accommodate more complex experimental designs, it remains to be shown to whether efficient separation indeed takes place and whether, unlike the use of 2 A peptides or the IRES sequence, expression levels of the individual proteins remain unaltered.

We again targeted DGCs for retrograde labeling using these new vectors and recorded the action potential success rate of labeled neurons in the EC, following five light pulses, each 1 ms long, at varying frequencies. As predicted, action potentials could be reliably generated at much higher stimulation frequencies and at a much earlier time point following stimulation onset than has previously been shown for both SAD B19 and CVS-N2c vectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Osakada et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Reardon et al., 2016</xref>: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>). In these recorded neurons, the resting membrane potential was −55 mV to −75 mV, corroborating the functional integrity of the cells. From a total of 21 cells, 3 cells had lower membrane potential above –55 mV (but below –50 mV) and these were excluded from the final analysis. By recording synaptic responses to optogenetic stimulation from several neuronal populations sharing the same input as DGCs, such as neighboring, non-transduced DGCs, CA3 pyramidal neurons and dentate gyrus molecular layer interneurons, we also show that this tool can be reliably used for exploring circuit motifs, and also potentially for effective circuit-based manipulation in behaving animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Since our observations indicate that under in vitro conditions, cellular health and viability begin to deteriorate in preparations made &gt;10 days from RVdG-CVS-N2c injection, it is important to show that effective optogenetic activation can be achieved at an earlier time point, when the cells remain healthy and viable for the duration of the experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>In vivo measurements from extended cortical networks</title><p>While RVdG viral vectors are highly effective in describing circuit architecture, their neurotoxicity limits their use for many applications, in which long-term monitoring or manipulation of labeled circuit is required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Luo et al., 2018</xref>) and while a new technology for production of non-neurotoxic RVdG vectors was recently been presented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chatterjee et al., 2018</xref>), the current inability to produce these vectors in a pseudotyped form excludes their use for cell-type-specific tracing experiments.

However, since this cell line is relatively more difficult to transfect and maintain than other cell lines, this choice resulted in a lengthy and cumbersome production process, with low titer yields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Reardon et al., 2016</xref>). As this premise has not been directly tested, we surmised that the increased labeling efficiency stems from the N2c strain itself, rather than its production process, and created an alternative packaging system to optimize all the different steps of production. By co-expressing mammalian-optimized versions of the genes required for the rabies amplification process, in tandem with antibiotics-resistance genes driven by strong constitutive promoters, in highly resilient and easily maintained cell lines, our method effectively minimizes production time, while simultaneously increasing viral titers by orders of magnitude. The additional co-expression of TVA and envA in the pseudotyping cell lines reduces to a minimum the amount of native-coat virus needed to initiate the process, thereby nearly abolishing the presence of these particles in the pseudotyped stock, and vastly increasing tracing specificity. This advantage is particularly relevant when performing retrograde labeling from single cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rossi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wertz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wickersham et al., 2007b</xref>) where a small number of non-specifically labeled neurons can potentially account for a large fraction of the entire labeled population.</p><p>RVdG-CVS-N2c vectors have previously been shown to outperform the SAD B19 in almost any parameter measured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ohara et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Reardon et al., 2016</xref>), attributed to the use of neural precursor cells for their production. We show that contrary to the premise, vectors produced using the HEK-GT/BHKeT packaging system show comparable retrograde labeling efficiency to ones produced in N2A cells and significantly higher than that of SAD B19 particles. This attribute has allowed us to efficiently find and characterize non-canonical hippocampal connections, for which only anecdotal reports have been available. While we show that neurons transduced with CVS-N2c vectors produced using our cell lines maintain viability and physiological function for at least 16 days, since no direct comparisons of physiological properties and long-term viability were made with vectors produced in the N2A line, it remains possible that packaging these vectors in N2A cells would result in reduced neurotoxicity, when compared with vector packaged in non-neuronal cell lines.</p><p>Using these new vectors, we were able to demonstrate the ease in which non-canonical projections to a target population can be teased out. We chose to focus these efforts in the DG, as the ample existing anecdotal evidence allowed us to compare our results against previously verified data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hájos and Mody, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Katona et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Klausberger and Somogyi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Szabo et al., 2017</xref>). In line with these reports, retrograde labeling from DGCs labeled two distinct populations of inhibitory neurons, residing in the <italic>S.O</italic>. and <italic>S.LM</italic> of the CA1, which mainly contain neurons projecting to the apical dendrites of CA1 neurons. In addition to these aforementioned populations, we have also observed a third population of labeled neurons along the superficial most layer of the subiculum, directly in the path of perforant path fibers. Unlike the previous ones, these cells did not express the inhibitory fluorescent indicator for GAD1, which suggests that this might be a yet undiscovered intrahippocampal excitatory projection to the DG. Since in the GAD1-EGFP line not all inhibitory neurons may express the fluorescent marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tamamaki et al., 2003</xref>), it remains a possibility that these neurons are also inhibitory but are somehow genetically indisposed to express the marker. However, their pyramidal-like morphology, spiny dendritic arbors and putative expression of the CaMKIIa promoter, all hallmarks of excitatory neurons, render this possibility unlikely.</p><p>The successful deployment of RVdG<sub>envA</sub> viral vectors is mainly limited by the ability to genetically dissect the target population. While many different mouse lines have been previously used for this purpose, covering the vast majority of genetically unique populations, the robust amplification capabilities of RVdG-CVS-N2c vectors require a high degree of specificity, in order to avoid possible off-target effects. We have developed several approaches that could further improve experimental paradigms, designed to attain results that are more specific. For example, cre-off viruses with specific promoters for AAV vectors can be used together with their cre-on equivalents in order to determine which projections are specific to a target population in a given region, and which are shared by the general population of neurons in a given brain region. In addition, intersectional genomic and viral-borne recombination could be used to dissect and highlight specific sub-populations of projection neurons. Using the vectors we designed, this toolbox can be expanded further to include other restriction approaches, such as tet-controlled elements.</p><p>Complementing these tools is a new suite of mono- and bicistronic RVdG-CVS-N2c vectors, expressing a broad range of fluorophores, recombinases, synaptic markers, optogenetic actuators and genetically encoded calcium indicators, to enable for diverse experimental purposes (see Key resources table). We demonstrate the flexibility of this approach, by expressing and imaging the recently developed calcium indicator GCaMP8m (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>) in the presynaptic neuronal population of starter neurons, that themselves project to the thalamus. Furthermore, we show that using the CVS-N2c endogenous N-P linker, we could effectively separate at least two individual elements, and possibly more. Apart from enabling better tracking of distinct subcellular compartments, we also show that the separation of the fluorophore from optogenetic actuators can increase their light responsiveness, possibly as a result of improved membrane trafficking and higher expression levels. However, some of these properties should also be attributed to the improved ChR2 variant we used, which was shown to possess faster kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lin et al., 2009</xref>). Another benefit of this separation is better identification of labeled neurons, since the untethering of the fluorophore from membrane-bound proteins leads to its predominantly cytosolic expression.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We present here a comprehensive toolkit for rapid, high-throughput production of RVdG-CVS-N2c rabies viral vectors, along with an extended multipurpose AAV and CVS-N2c vector suites.

(CRL-3216, ATCC) with one of the following vectors: pMMLV-CAG-SAD B19_optimized_G-IRES-Puro, pMMLV-CAG-optimized_T7pol-IRES-BSD, pLenti-EF1a-envA-IRES-Neo and pMMLV-CAG-TVA-IRES-Puro, along with the compatible retro- or lenti-viral GAG-Pol and the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G), by means of calcium-phosphate precipitation. Viruses were collected and filtered 48 hr post transfection and used to transduce low-passage HEK293T or BHK-21 (CCL-10, ATCC) cells. Three days post transduction, the cells were passaged and one of the following antibiotics were added to the medium in order to select for the cells which stably express the respective construct: Puromycin dihydrochloride (3 µg ml<sup>–1</sup>), blasticidine S hydrochloride (15 µg ml<sup>–1</sup>), or G418 disulfate (Neomycin, 500 µg ml<sup>–1</sup>, Sigma-Aldrich in all cases). Once the cells reached full confluence again, they were passaged, and again supplemented with the antibiotics. This cycle was repeated for at least three times a week for two weeks before initial use for production of rabies viral vectors. The new cell lines have all tested negative for mycoplasma. All cell lines and plasmids presented in this study are available from the corresponding author upon request and all plasmids are also available from Addgene (See Key resources table).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Generation of bicistronic CVS-N2c rabies viral vectors</title><p>A method to produce bicistronic reading frames in rabies viral vectors has previously been described for vectors of the SAD B19 strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Osakada and Callaway, 2013</xref>). Here, we adapted this approach for CVS-N2c vectors by inserting the virus’s endogenous N-P linker between two coding sequences, which led to efficient separation of the proteins with no observable effect on the expression levels of either. The sequence for the linker used is: <named-content content-type="sequence">CATGAAAAAAActAACACTCCTCC</named-content> (lower case letters indicate the N-P boundary).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Production of rabies viral vectors</title><p>HEK293-GT cells were used to rescue both SAD B19 and CVS-N2c rabies viral vectors. First, the cells were plated in a 35 mm culture dish and allowed to grow till they reached 80–90% confluence. Subsequently, they were transfected with the rabies vector plasmid and the SADB19 helper plasmids pTIT-N, pTIT-P and pTIT-L using polyethylenimine (PEI). Twenty-four hours later, the transfected cells were resuspended and re-plated in a 100 mm culture dish and incubated at 37 °C/5% CO<sub>2</sub> until they regained full confluence. Cells were maintained that way with frequent medium changes until ~100% of the cells were fluorescent, usually 5–6 days from time of transfection and 1–2 days from the point fluorescence was first detected. At this point the medium was harvested, filtered, aliquoted, and kept at −80 °C until further use.</p><p>For pseudotyping of rabies vectors, BHK-eT cells were used to simultaneously pseudotype and amplify the vectors: First, low confluence BHK-eT cells were plated in two 100 mm culture dishes and each transduced with 0.5 ml of the native-coat virus. Once the cells reached full confluence, they were washed twice with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM), resuspended and each re-plated in a new 150 mm culture dish. Once the cells reached full confluence again and ~100% of them were fluorescent (~3 days post transduction), the medium was collected, filtered, stored at 4 °C and replaced with fresh medium. This process was then repeated for two to three consecutive days. Following the last collection, the virus was pooled and centrifuged at 70,000 rcf for 1.5 hr. Following centrifugation, the medium was aspirated and the viral pellet resuspended in 200 µl phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, aliquoted and stored at −80 °C until use.</p><p>For titration of envA-pseudotyped rabies viral vectors, HEK293-TVA were plated in 35 mm wells at low confluence along with one well containing HEK293T cells for detection of unpseudotyped particles. The following day, cells from one of the HEK293-TVA wells were resuspended and counted, while the cells in the remaining wells were transduced with 1 µl concentrated virus in serial dilutions ranging from 1:10–1:10,000. To estimate the presence of native coat particles in each preparation, HEK293T cells in similar confluence were transduced in parallel with 1 µl of undiluted virus. Three days later, the cells were resuspended, washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). The fraction of transduced cells in each well was determined using flow cytometry (FACS Aria III), where the most extreme cell in a population of non-treated cells was used to determine the threshold. The titer was finally calculated based on a previously published formula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wickersham et al., 2010</xref>). In all of the titrations performed for viruses produced using our packaging system fluorescently labeled cells were not detected in the control plate containing HEK293T cells, even when transduced with vectors at concentrations an order of magnitude higher than required for complete labeling of HEK-TVA cells. While on some occasions, cells in this control condition were detected beyond the predetermined threshold, these always had substantially weaker fluorescence than the peak fluorescence of the positively labeled cells. While it cannot be completely ruled out that these originate from cells transduced with native coat particles, it is more likely that this weak signal originates from slightly higher autofluorescence.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Production of adeno-associated viral vectors</title><p>Adeno-associated virus (AAV) production was performed in HEK293T cells based on a previously-published protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McClure et al., 2011</xref>). Briefly, fully confluent HEK293 cells were transfected with an AAV2 vector plasmid along with pAdenoHelper and the AAV-dj RepCap plasmids using PEI. Thirty-six hours post transfection, the cells were harvested, pelleted, and lysed using three freeze-thaw cycles. The lysed cells were incubated with benzonase-nuclease (Sigma-Aldrich) for one hour and then the debris was pelleted and the virus-containing supernatant collected and passed through a 0.22 µm filter. The collected supernatant was subsequently mixed with an equal amount of heparin-agarose (Sigma-Aldrich) and kept at 4 °C overnight with constant agitation. The following day, the agarose-virus mixture was transferred to a chromatography column and the agarose was allowed to settle. The supernatant was then drained from the column by means of gravity and the agarose-bound virus was washed once with PBS and then eluted using PBS supplemented with 0.5 M NaCl. The eluted virus was then filtered again, desalinated and concentrated using a 100 kDa centrifugal filter and then aliquoted and stored at −80 °C until use. All AAV plasmids presented in this study are available from Addgene (see Key resources table).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Animals</title><p>All transgenic driver and reporter lines have been previously characterized(see Key resources table). In all experiments, male and female mice were used interchangeably in equal proportions, in an age range which varied between 1 and 6 months old.

Experiments on C57BL/6 wild-type and transgenic mice were performed in strict accordance with institutional, national, and European guidelines for animal experimentation and were approved by the Bundesministerium für Wissenschaft, Forschung und Wirtschaft and Bildung, Wissenschaft und Forschung, respectively, of Austria (A.

The entire hippocampus with entorhinal cortex was dissected from the brain of 5- to 8-day-old wild type mouse pups and cut perpendicularly to the longitudinal axes using a McIllwain tissue chopper. Hippocampus extraction and cutting were performed in a medium containing Hanks’ Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS, Gibco) and 20% D-glucose (Braun). Slices were placed on microporous membrane inserts (Millicell, Millipore) floating on culture media containing 50% minimum essential medium, 25% basal medium Eagle, 25% heat-inactivated horse serum, 2 mM glutamax (all from GIBCO) and 0.62% D-glucose (Braun). Slice cultures were kept at 37 °C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, until used for viral transduction experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Stereotaxic intracranial virus injections</title><p>For in vivo delivery of viral vectors, 1- to 6-months-old male or female mice were anesthetized with isoflurane, injected with analgesics and placed in a stereotaxic frame where they continued to receive 1–5% isoflurane vaporized in oxygen at a fixed flow rate of 1 l min<sup>–1</sup>. Leg withdrawal reflexes were tested to evaluate the depth of anesthesia and when no reflex was observed an incision was made across the scalp to expose the skull. Bregma was then located, and its coordinates used as reference for anterior-posterior (AP) and medio-lateral (ML) coordinates while the surface of the dura at the injection site was used as reference for dorso-ventral (DV) coordinates. In our experiments, we used the following sets of AP/ML/DV coordinates (in mm): DG: −1.9/1.3/–1.9; CA1: −1.9/1.5/–1.2; V1: −3.5/2/–0.7; LD: −1.3/1.3/–2.5. AAV vectors were first diluted 1:5 in PBS and delivered to the injection site at a volume of 0.3 µl and a rate of 0.06 µl min<sup>-1</sup>, using a Hamilton syringe and a 32 G needle. After the injection was completed, the needle was left in place for a few additional minutes to allow the virus to diffuse in the tissue and then slowly retracted. At the end of the injection session, the scalp was glued back together, and the mice were returned to their home cage to recover. Injection of pseudotyped rabies viral vectors took place 2–3 weeks after initial injection of AAV vectors containing the TVA receptor and rabies glycoprotein. Pseudotyped rabies vectors were first diluted to reach a final concentration of ~2–5 x10<sup>8</sup> TU ml<sup>–1</sup> and then injected in the same manner as the AAV. Except for rabies injections into the DG of Prox1-cre transgenic animals, all other injections of rabies virus were shifted –0.2 mm AP and –0.2 mm ML. This was done in order to avoid, as much as possible, non-specific labeling along the needle tract of the first injection, due to the lack of complete specificity of cre-recombinase expression in the other transgenic lines used in this study.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Slice preparation and electrophysiology</title><p>Electrophysiological recordings from identified retrogradely-labeled cells were performed 5–7 days following injection of CVS-N2c vectors. Manipulated animals were anaesthetized using an MMF mixture consisting of medetomidin (0.5 mg kg<sup>–1</sup>), midazolam (5 mg kg<sup>–1</sup>) and fentanyl (0.05 mg kg<sup>–1</sup>) and subsequently perfused through the heart with 20 ml ice-cold dissection solution containing 87 mM NaCl, 25 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 10 mM D-glucose, 75 mM sucrose, 0.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 7 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> (pH 7.4 in 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 325 mOsm). The brain was then removed and the hippocampus along with the adjacent cortical tissue was dissected out and placed into a precast mold made of 4% agarose designed to stabilize the tissue. The mold was transferred to the chamber of a custom-built or a VT1200 vibratome (Leica Microsystems) and the tissue was transversely sectioned into 300-µm-thick slices in the presence of ice-cold dissection solution. Transverse cortico-hippocampal sections were allowed to recover for ∼30 min at ∼31 °C and then kept at room temperature (20 ± 1°C) for the duration of the experiments. During recordings, slices were superfused with recording solution containing 125 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 25 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.25 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 25 mM D-glucose, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> (pH 7.4 in 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>, ∼325 mOsm, at a rate of ∼1 ml min<sup>–1</sup> using gravity flow). Labeled neurons in the regions of interest were identified according to their fluorescent signal and patched using pulled patch pipettes containing: 125 mM K-gluconate, 20 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EGTA, 10 mM phosphocreatine, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM ATP, 0.4 mM GTP, 10 mM HEPES (pH adjusted to 7.28 with KOH, ∼310 mOsm); 0.3% biocytin was added in a subset of recordings. Patched cells were maintained in current-clamp mode at the neuron’s resting membrane potential. Signals from patched cells were acquired using an Axon Axopatch 200 A amplifier (Molecular Devices) and digitized using a CED Power 1401 analog-to-digital converter (Cambridge Electronic Design). Optogenetic stimulation was delivered using a blue-filtered white LED (Prizmatix, IL) at maximum intensity, passed through a 63×objective which was positioned above the recorded neuron. Ten bursts, spaced 20 s apart, consisting each of 5 light pulses (5 ms in duration) at 25 Hz were delivered to the tissue. Cells which exhibited responses with latency shorter than 1 ms or longer than 10 ms were excluded from the final analysis as they likely result from direct ChIEF activation in the recorded neuron or a polysynaptic response, respectively. Following these protocols, current steps ranging from −150 pA to 300 pA, with 25 pA increments, were delivered in current-clamp mode in order to determine firing frequency and input resistance, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kowalski et al., 2016</xref>). At the end of each recording session, the electrode was slowly retracted to create an outside-out patch, following which the slice was removed from the recording chamber, submerged in 4% PFA and subsequently kept in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB) until further processing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Fixed tissue preparation</title><p>For imaging purposes, animals were sacrificed 5–7 days after injection of CVS-N2c vectors. First, animals were anaesthetized as described in the previous section and intracardially perfused with 15 ml of 0.1 PB followed by 30 ml of 4% PFA. Following perfusion, the brain was removed and kept in 4% PFA overnight at 4 °C, which was subsequently replaced with 0.1 M PB. Fixed brains were sectioned 100 µm thick in either a coronal, parasagittal, or transverse plain and stored in 0.1 M PB at 4 °C.</p><p>For immunohistochemical labeling of transduced tissue, standard protocols were used. First, the sections were washed with PB 3 × /10 min. Next, sections were incubated with 10% normal goat serum (NGS) and 0.4% Triton X-100 for 1 hr, at room temperature (RT) with constant agitation and subsequently with the primary antibody (Rabbit anti-somatostatin, 1:500, BMA Biomedicals; Rabbit anti-parvalbumin, 1:1000, Swant antibodies; Chicken anti-GFP, 1:000, Abcam; Mouse anti-FLAG, 1:1000, Sigma-Aldrich), in PB containing 5% NGS and 0.4% Triton X-100, at 4 °C overnight. After washing, slices were incubated with isotype-specific secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated goat anti-rabbit, Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated goat anti-mouse or Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-chicken) in PB containing 5% NGS and 0.4% Triton X-100 for two hours in RT with constant agitation. After washing, slices were mounted, embedded in Prolong Gold Antifade mountant (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, Cat# P36930) and sealed with a 0.5 mm coverslip.</p><p>Neurons in acute slices that were filled with biocytin (0.3%) were processed for morphological analysis. After withdrawal of the pipettes, resulting in the formation of outside-out patches at the pipette tips, slices were fixed for 12–24  hr at 4  °C in a 0.1  M PB solution containing 4% PFA. After fixation, slices were washed, treated with Streptavidin Alexa Fluor 647 Conjugate (Thermo Fisher) for two hours at room temperature, washed again and embedded in Mowiol (Sigma-Aldrich).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Microscopy and image analysis</title><p>All representative confocal images were acquired using either an LSM 800 microscope (Zeiss) or a Dragonfly spinning disc confocal microscope (Andor). All representative confocal images displayed in this manuscript were processed using FIJI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>) and are shown as a maximal intensity projection of an image stack of 4–12 separate images. For quantification of cell numbers including channel overlap, Imaris 9 software was used.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Cranial window implantation for in vivo CVS-N2c-GCaMP8m imaging</title><p>Before the surgery, animals were injected with meloxicam (20 mg kg<sup>–1</sup> s.c., 3.125 mg ml<sup>–1</sup> solution) and dexamethasone (0.2 mg kg<sup>–1</sup> i.p., 0.02 mg ml<sup>–1</sup> solution). Anesthesia was induced by 2.5% isoflurane in oxygen in an anesthesia chamber. The mouse was subsequently fixed in a stereotaxic device (Kopf) with constant isoflurane supply at 0.7 to 1.2% in O<sub>2</sub> and body temperature controlled by a heating pad to 37.5 °C. After assertion that reflexes subsided, the cranium was exposed and cleaned of periost and connective tissue. A circular craniotomy of 4 mm diameter was drilled above V1, careful to leave the dura mater intact and the exposed brain constantly irrigated with artificial cerebrospinal fluid. A pulled glass capillary (tip diameter 30–40 µm) was loaded with CVS-N2c-GCaMP8m (5x10<sup>8</sup> TU ml<sup>–1</sup>) solution and 300 nl injected into the center of the craniotomy at a depth of 600 µm with a nanoliter injector (Nanoject, World Precision Instruments) at a speed of 30 nl min<sup>–1</sup> and leaving the needle in place for 5 min after the volume was injected. Subsequently, a 4 mm circular glass coverslip (CS-4R, Warner Instruments) was positioned on the brain and careful pressure applied with a toothpick mounted in the stereotaxic arm. The glass was first fixed in place with VetBond (3 M). Then after cleaning and drying the surrounding cranium, a multilayer of glues was applied. First, to provide adhesion to the bone, All-in-One Optibond (Kerr) was applied and hardened by blue light (B.A. Optima 10). Second, Charisma Flow (Kulzer) was applied to cover the exposed bone and fix the glass in place by also applying blue light. After removal of the fixation toothpick, a custom designed and manufactured (RPD, Vienna) headplate, selective laser-sintered from the medical alloy TiAl<sub>6</sub>V<sub>4</sub> (containing a small bath chamber and micro-ridges for repeatable fixation in the setup), was positioned in place and glued to the Charisma on the cranium with Paladur (Kulzer). Mice were given 300 µl of saline and 20 mg kg<sup>–1</sup> meloxicam s.c., before removing them from the stereotaxic frame and letting them wake up while kept warm on a heating pad. Another dose of 20 mg kg<sup>–1</sup> meloxicam s.c. and 0.2 mg kg<sup>–1</sup> i.p. dexamethasone was further injected 24 hr after conclusion of the surgery.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Setup and visual stimuli for in vivo imaging</title><p>Mice were head-fixed using a custom-manufactured clamp that was connected to a 3-axis motorized stage (8MT167-25LS, Standa). Mice could run freely on a custom-designed spherical treadmill (20 cm diameter). Visual stimuli were projected by a modified LightCrafter (Texas Instruments) at 60 Hz, reflected by a quarter-sphere mirror (Modulor) below the mouse and presented on a custom-made spherical dome (80 cm diameter) with the mouse’s head at its center. The green and blue LEDs in the projector were replaced by cyan (LZ1-00DB00-0100, Osram) and UV (LZ1-00UB00-01U6, Osram) LEDs respectively. A double band-pass filter (387/480 HD Dualband Filter, Semrock) was positioned in front of the projector to not contaminate the imaging. The reflected red channel of the projector was captured by a transimpedance photo-amplifier (PDA36A2, Thorlabs) and digitized for synchronization. Cyan and UV LED powers were adjusted to match the relative excitation of M- and S-cones during an overcast day, determined and calibrated using opsin templates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Govardovskii et al., 2000</xref>) and a spectrometer (CCS-100, Thorlabs). Stimuli were designed and presented with Psychtoolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brainard, 1997</xref>), running on MATLAB 2020b (Mathworks). Stimulus frames were morphed on the GPU using a customized projection map and an OpenGL shader to counteract the distortions resulting from the spherical mirror and dome. The dome setup allows to present mesopic stimuli from ca. 90° on the left to ca. 170° on the right in azimuth and from ca. 40° below to ca. 80° above the equator in elevation. During anatomical stack imaging, dense moving dots of different sizes and light intensities, moving in uncorrelated directions were shown, to excite neurons with a complex texture-like stimulus. For functional imaging, full field step gratings with temporal frequency of 2 Hz and spatial frequency of 0.1 cycles/° were shown moving in 8 randomly ordered directions. In each trial, the grating image remained stationary for 3 s and then moved for 7 s in the respective direction. Each direction was shown 5–10 times in total per session.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Imaging</title><p>Two-photon imaging was performed on a custom-built microscope, controlled by Scanimage (Vidrio Technologies) running on MATLAB 2020b (Mathworks) and a PXI system (National Instruments). The beam from a pulsed Ti:Sapphire laser (Mai-Tai DeepSee, Spectra-Physics) was scanned by a galvanometric-resonant (8 kHz) mirror combination (Cambridge Scientific) and expanded to underfill the back-aperture of the objective (16×0.8 N.A. water-immersion, Nikon); 1.9 by 1.9 mm field-of-view; 30 Hz frame rates. Fast volumetric imaging was acquired with a piezo actuator (P-725.4CA, Physik Instrumente). Emitted light was collected (FF775-Di01, Semrock), split (580 nm long-pass, FF580-FDi01, Semrock), band-pass filtered (green: FF03-525/50; red: FF01-641/75, Semrock), measured (GaAsP photomultiplier tubes, H10770B-40, Hamamatsu), amplified (TIA60, Thorlabs), and digitized (PXIe-7961R NI FlexRIO FPGA, NI 5734 16-bit, National Instruments). Laser wavelength was set to 935 or 955 nm, which excited GCaMP8 well and tdTomato sufficiently for anatomical identification. Maximum laser power used at the deepest planes was 80 mW mm<sup>–2</sup>. Due to the early start of imaging after implantation the tissue cleared only over the course of the imaging days, necessitating relatively high laser powers in the beginning. To avoid heat damage, only 15 min of continuous imaging was performed, after which imaging was paused for at least 5 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Podgorski and Ranganathan, 2016</xref>). At each recording day (day 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 14, 16 post RVdG<sub>envA-</sub>CVS-N2c-GCaMP8m injection), first a dense anatomical stack with a 10 µm plane distance over the full accessible depth and plane averaging over 25 frames was recorded in the injected area. If GCaMP labeled neurons were found, subsequently a functional imaging session was started over 5–8 z-planes with 25–50 µm plane distance and voxel size of 1.4–1.7 µm resulting in a volume rate of 4.2–5 Hz.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Imaging data analysis</title><p>Cell numbers were estimated by Imaris (Oxford Instruments) on anatomical stack images. Functional calcium imaging data was first analyzed with suite2p (v0.10.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pachitariu et al., 2016</xref>) for motion correction and ROI extraction. ROIs were then curated manually based on morphological and activity shape.

From the neuropil-corrected ROI fluorescence, baseline F0 was defined as the 8th percentile of a moving window of 15 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dombeck et al., 2013</xref>). dF/F0 was then calculated on the same window by first subtracting and then dividing fluorescence trace by median of the same 15-s window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Keller et al., 2012</xref>). Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was defined for each neuron by dividing the 99th percentile of the dF/F trace (‘signal’) by the standard deviation of its negative values after baseline correction (‘noise’). Direction selectivity index (DSI) and preferred direction was calculated based on the vector sum method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mazurek et al., 2014</xref>) on the mean dF/F0 of the 7 s per direction the grating was moving. DSI significance was estimated by a permutation test of the direction labels (resampled 1000 times) to define the proportion of DSIshuffled &gt;DSI.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All values were reported as mean and error bars as ± SEM.

of neural circuits. The CVS-N2c strain of rabies virus shows significantly higher efficiency of transsynaptic spread and less toxicity than the more commonly used SAD B19 strain but has been limited in use by an arduous and lengthy packaging process and low resultant titers. Here, Sumser et al. present a method that significantly speeds up the production process while reducing off-target expression. They also introduce a suite of novel reagents (34 novel plasmids) for monosynaptic tracing with the CVS-N2c strain that they commendably, have already deposited with Addgene. The work is an important advance that will reinvigorate rabies-mediated circuit tracing.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79848.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Seal</surname><given-names>Rebecca</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Wickersham</surname><given-names>Ian</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/042nb2s44</institution-id><institution>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.12.23.474014">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.23.474014v2">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Rebecca Seal as the Reviewing Editor and Laura Colgin as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Ian Wickersham (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors claim that the titer efficiency is high but do not clearly show the titers which should be calculated for virus harvested from cells expressing TVA and from cells not expressing TVA.</p><p>2) The authors claim that there is no contamination with G-coated rabies but do not show it. The authors need to demonstrate the level of background contamination by injecting the rabies without the TVA in WT mice. Leak expression from Cre-dependent &quot;starter&quot; AAVs should also be tested by injecting them and rabies in WT mice.</p><p>3) To improve the clarity of the manuscript, the authors should address all other points outlined by the reviewers below, which will not require any new experiments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors should examine the time course of health of the retrogradely infected cells and starter cells with electrophysiological measurements of membrane potential or a histological stain.</p><p>Extended Data Figure 7 seems errantly labeled in C.

We have added resting potential information of retrogradely infected cells and starter cells at ~ 7 days post injection (Figure 6D).</p><p>Regarding the time course of neuronal health beyond this point, the situation is more complex. Reardon et al., 2016 reported anecdotal evidence that channelrhodopsin stimulation was possible until 28 days after infection. However, other assays of integrity in this paper showed signs of degeneration at much earlier stages (e.g. increase of propidium iodide-positive cells 4 days after infection). Although we have obtained patch recordings at later times after injection, we had the impression that the – number – of labeled cells decreased, and that it is more difficult to get recordings. However, this is difficult to quantify, because of the high variability of labelling across animals. Furthermore, it is well known that neurons become less healthy and more difficult to record by electrophysiology in older animals, even in wild-type. Thus, after careful consideration, we arrived at the conclusion that obtaining compelling data will be difficult.</p><p>We also want to emphasize that the rabies virus-mediated expression of both ChIEF and GCaMP8 is highly powerful and has a fast onset. Therefore, we are sure that both actuator and/or indicator expression reach sufficiently high levels after ~5 days. Thus, although the health of neurons may decline at later times after infection, there is a large window in which meaningful functional connectivity measurements can be obtained. We have now mentioned this in the Results / Discussion section of the revised version (p. 11, top of the revised manuscript).</p><p>We hope that the reviewer can accept our reply, which represents an honest answer to a tricky question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Extended Data Figure 7 seems errantly labeled in C.
