Subsequent origin activation is under control of multiple protein kinases that either promote or inhibit origin activation, which is important for genome maintenance. Using the reconstituted budding yeast DNA replication system, we find that the flexible N-terminal extension (NTE) of Mcm2 promotes the stable recruitment of Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK) to Mcm2-7 double hexamers, which in turn promotes DDK phosphorylation of Mcm4 and −6 and subsequent origin activation. Conversely, we demonstrate that the checkpoint kinase, Rad53, inhibits DDK binding to Mcm2-7 double hexamers. Unexpectedly, this function is not dependent on Rad53 kinase activity, suggesting steric inhibition of DDK by activated Rad53. These findings identify critical determinants of the origin activation reaction and uncover a novel mechanism for checkpoint-dependent origin inhibition.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>DNA replication</kwd><kwd>DDK</kwd><kwd>Rad53</kwd><kwd>checkpoint</kwd><kwd>Mcm2-7</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM127428</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Remus</surname><given-names>Dirk</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM107239</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Remus</surname><given-names>Dirk</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The mechanism of Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK) recruitment to replication origins and its regulation by the checkpoint have been identified.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>To ensure the timely, accurate, and complete duplication of their genomes prior to cell division, eukaryotic cells initiate DNA replication at many replication origins distributed along the length of each chromosome. From each origin, two replication forks emanate in opposite direction to form a replication bubble. Although bidirectional origin firing has long been recognized as a universal feature of chromosomal DNA replication in all domains of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huberman and Riggs, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Prescott and Kuempel, 1972</xref>), how pairs of oppositely oriented replication forks are established at chromosomal origins remains poorly understood. In eukaryotes, two copies of the replicative DNA helicase, Mcm2-7 (henceforth referred to as MCM), are loaded as a stable double-hexameric complex around double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) at the origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Evrin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Miller et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Remus et al., 2009</xref>). The MCM complex comprises six related proteins of the AAA+ family of ATPases that assemble into a hexameric ring with defined subunit order. Intriguingly, the two hexamers in a MCM double hexamer (DH) associate in a head-to-head configuration, thus providing a platform for the establishment of oppositely oriented sister replisomes. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abid Ali et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Evrin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Miller et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Noguchi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Remus et al., 2009</xref>). However, MCM DHs are catalytically inactive and require the regulated association of the essential helicase co-factors Cdc45 and GINS to form two active replicative DNA helicase complexes, termed CMG (<underline>C</underline>dc45-<underline>M</underline>CM-<underline>G</underline>INS), which encircle single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) during unwinding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bell and Labib, 2016</xref>). Therefore, to ensure bidirectional origin firing, mechanisms must exist that ensure simultaneous progression of both helicase complexes from the origin. As the head-to-head orientation of CMG helicases assembled at the origin requires them to pass each other during origin activation, it has been proposed that an active CMG encircling ssDNA is blocked by a dsDNA-encircling inactive CMG potentially formed around the opposite MCM hexamer, thereby imposing origin bidirectionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Douglas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Georgescu et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The replication of chromosomes from multiple replication origins necessitates strict control mechanisms that prevent origins from re-firing within one cell cycle in order to maintain genome stability. Such re-replication control is achieved by a two-step mechanism that temporally separates helicase loading in late M and G1 phase from helicase activation in S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bell and Labib, 2016</xref>). Helicase activation is controlled by two cell cycle-regulated protein kinases, Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK) and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK), which act in conjunction with a defined set of co-factors, comprising Sld3·7, Sld2, Dpb11, Pol ε, and Mcm10, in addition to GINS and Cdc45, to mediate CMG assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Douglas et al., 2018</xref>). The essential targets of CDK during CMG assembly are Sld2 and Sld3, which physically interact with distinct Dpb11 BRCT domains when phosphorylated to recruit GINS and Pol ε to the origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bell and Labib, 2016</xref>). The mechanism by which DDK promotes CMG assembly is somewhat obscure. Genetic and biochemical studies demonstrate that MCM subunits are the essential targets for DDK during DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deegan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hardy et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Randell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sheu and Stillman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yeeles et al., 2015</xref>). Accordingly, DDK phosphorylation of the flexible N-terminal extensions (NTEs) of Mcm4 and −6 promotes the recruitment of Sld3·7 to MCM DHs by generating phosphorylation-dependent binding sites for Sld3, which in turn recruits Cdc45 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deegan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gros et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Heller et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tanaka et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yeeles et al., 2015</xref>). However, the nature and stoichiometry of the Sld3 interaction with MCM DHs is unclear, as Sld3 exhibits limited sequence specificity for phospho-dependent binding sites, and phospho-mimicking mutations in either Mcm4 or −6 are sufficient to bypass the requirement for DDK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deegan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Randell et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, other mutations in Mcm5 and Mcm4 that do not involve phospho-mimetic amino acid substitutions can also bypass the requirement for DDK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hardy et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sheu and Stillman, 2010</xref>). It is not known, if these mutations allow Sld3 recruitment in the absence of MCM phosphorylation, or if they bypass the requirement for Sld3 altogether.</p><p>Replication origins do not fire simultaneously upon S phase entry, but in a staggered programmatic manner throughout S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rhind and Gilbert, 2013</xref>). The replication timing program is in part imposed by limiting concentrations of the initiation factors Sld2, Dpb11, Sld3, Cdc45, and Dbf4, which restrict CMG assembly to subsets of origins throughout S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mantiero et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tanaka et al., 2011</xref>). While limiting initiation factors that interact transiently with origins are thought to be recycled from early to late origins in a normal S phase, such recycling is prevented by the S phase checkpoint to inhibit late origin firing. The S phase checkpoint is a vital kinase signaling cascade that induces a range of cellular responses in addition to the inhibition of origin firing, including increasing dNTP levels, stabilization of stalled replication forks, and DNA repair to promote genome maintenance during replication stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pardo et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In budding yeast, the minimal targets for checkpoint-dependent origin inhibition are Sld3 and Dbf4, which are substrates for the checkpoint effector kinase, Rad53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lopez-Mosqueda et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zegerman and Diffley, 2010</xref>). Rad53 phosphorylation of Sld3 inhibits its physical interactions with MCM, Cdc45, and Dpb11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deegan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lopez-Mosqueda et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zegerman and Diffley, 2010</xref>). How Rad53 inhibits Dbf4 is not clear. Rad53 was found to inhibit DDK kinase activity <italic>in vitro</italic>, but the mechanism of inhibition is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kihara et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Weinreich and Stillman, 1999</xref>). Moreover, DDK activity in these studies was assessed using isolated Mcm2 or Mcm7 subunits as substrates or by measuring DDK autophosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kihara et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Weinreich and Stillman, 1999</xref>). However, since DDK exhibits high specificity for Mcm4 and −6 in the context of MCM DHs, the effect of Rad53 on DDK activity at licensed origins remains to be determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Francis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Randell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sheu and Stillman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sun et al., 2014</xref>). Rad53 has also been reported to disrupt DDK-chromatin association in cells treated with hydroxyurea (HU) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pasero et al., 1999</xref>). DDK binds to chromatin via an interaction with MCM at licensed replication origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dowell et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Francis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jares and Blow, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jares et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sato et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sheu and Stillman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Takahashi and Walter, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Weinreich and Stillman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yanow et al., 2003</xref>). Several potential DDK docking sites have been identified in MCM based on pairwise interaction studies with individual MCM subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ramer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sheu and Stillman, 2006</xref>). However, it has not been tested to what extent these contribute to DDK binding in the context of the MCM DH, which is known to greatly stimulate DDK substrate specificity and kinase efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Francis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sun et al., 2014</xref>). How Rad53 may affect the DDK-chromatin association has not been addressed.</p><p>Here, we employ the reconstituted budding yeast DNA replication system to investigate the mechanism of DDK docking to MCM DHs and its regulation by Rad53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Devbhandari et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Devbhandari and Remus, 2020</xref>). We find that the flexible Mcm2 NTE is necessary for DDK docking onto MCM DHs, Mcm4 and −6 phosphorylation, and origin firing. The data suggests that the NTEs of both Mcm2 protomers in the MCM DH are required for efficient origin activation. Intriguingly, activated Rad53 can form a physical complex with DDK and disrupt DDK binding to MCM DHs in a manner that is independent of Rad53 kinase activity. These observations have important implications for the mechanism of bidirectional origin firing and its regulation by the replication checkpoint.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Residues 1–127 of Mcm2 are dispensable for MCM DH assembly and stability</title><p>While the structured N-terminal domains (NTDs) and AAA+ ATPase domains are conserved between archaeal and eukaryotic MCM proteins, the long unstructured NTEs of Mcm2, −4, and −6 are unique to eukaryotes. The NTEs of Mcm4 and −6 play a fundamental role during DNA replication by serving as phospho-acceptors for DDK kinase during origin activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deegan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Francis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Randell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sheu and Stillman, 2006</xref>). In contrast, the Mcm2 NTE contains a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) that mediates nuclear import of Cdt1⋅MCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liku et al., 2005</xref>) and a conserved histone H3/H4 binding domain (HBD) that controls nucleosome segregation at replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Foltman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Petryk et al., 2018</xref>). As nuclear import is irrelevant for DNA replication with purified proteins, and chromatin can be omitted from DNA replication reactions <italic>in vitro</italic>, we asked whether the Mcm2 NTE possesses a basic DNA replication function.

For this, we performed reconstituted MCM loading reactions on origin-containing DNA using purified ORC, Cdc6, and either wildtype Cdt1⋅MCM or Cdt1⋅MCM<sup>2-TEV</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Remus et al., 2009</xref>). Following MCM loading, DNA-bound complexes were washed to remove free proteins, treated with TEV protease, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The DNA was immobilized on paramagnetic streptavidin-coated beads via a single photo-cleavable 5’-terminal biotin moiety to allow elution of the DNA from the beads with UV light for analysis. To differentiate MCM DHs loaded around DNA from potential other more loosely associated complexes, such as the OCCM (<underline>O</underline>RC-<underline>C</underline>dc6-<underline>C</underline>dt1-<underline>M</underline>CM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yuan et al., 2017</xref>), DNA-bound complexes were washed with a high-salt buffer prior to DNA elution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Remus et al., 2009</xref>). While MCM DHs are resistant to salt-elution from the DNA, loading factors and loosely associated MCM complexes are efficiently disrupted by stringent salt washes. In addition, control MCM loading reactions were carried out in the presence of non-hydrolyzable ATPγS as MCM DH formation is strictly dependent on ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bell and Labib, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Remus et al., 2009</xref>). Using this approach, we demonstrate comparable DNA loading efficiencies for wildtype Cdt1⋅MCM and Cdt1⋅MCM<sup>2-TEV</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Moreover, truncation of the Mcm2 NTE from Mcm2-TEV-containing DHs, despite being efficient, did not negatively affect MCM DH retention on DNA. Thus, maintenance of MCM DHs is not dependent on residues 1–127 of the Mcm2 NTE.</p><p>Next, we tested if Mcm2 residues 1–127 are important for MCM loading during pre-RC formation. For this we digested Cdt1·MCM<sup>2-TEV</sup> with TEV protease and re-purified the resulting Cdt1·MCM<sup>2Δ127</sup> complex from the digestion reaction by gel-filtration chromatography. Truncation of the Mcm2 N-terminus did not have a noticeable effect on Cdt1·MCM stability, as Cdt1·MCM<sup>2Δ127</sup> eluted in a mono-disperse peak at the expected position for the Cdt1·MCM heptamer during gel-filtration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

For this, we assembled MCM DHs from Cdt1⋅MCM<sup>2-TEV</sup> on bead-immobilized DNA and monitored DDK phosphorylation-dependent gel-mobility shifts of MCM subunits by SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). MCM DHs harboring Mcm2-TEV were either digested or mock-treated with TEV protease prior to DDK addition. In the presence of the full-length Mcm2 NTE, Mcm4 and Mcm6, but not any of the other MCM subunits, exhibited a pronounced retardation in gel-mobility in the presence of DDK. The disappearance of the unphosphorylated Mcm4 and −6 bands at higher DDK concentrations demonstrates that these subunits were phosphorylated quantitatively by DDK. In contrast, the DDK-dependent gel-retardation of Mcm4 and −6 was strongly diminished at all DDK concentrations tested when the Mcm2 NTE was truncated with TEV protease prior to DDK addition. Thus, the Mcm2 NTE promotes the phosphorylation of Mcm4 and Mcm6 by DDK in the context of MCM DHs.</p><p>Phosphorylation of the Mcm4 and −6 NTEs by DDK promotes the assembly of the CMG helicase. We, therefore, tested if truncation of the Mcm2 NTE impairs CMG assembly using an origin-dependent CMG helicase assay that detects CMG helicase activity by the generation of highly unwound circular plasmid DNA, termed U-form DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Douglas et al., 2018</xref>). As expected, generation of U-form DNA in the presence of either Mcm2-WT or Mcm2-TEV is dependent on both CDK and DDK, demonstrating that plasmid unwinding is dependent on CMG assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Importantly, generation of U-form DNA was suppressed specifically in the presence of Mcm2-TEV when TEV protease was added to the reaction after the MCM loading step, prior to the addition of DDK and other initiation factors. This data is consistent with residues 1–127 of the Mcm2 NTE promoting CMG assembly. In summary, we conclude that the Mcm2 NTE is important for DNA replication by promoting the phosphorylation of Mcm4 and −6 by DDK and subsequent CMG assembly, whereas it is dispensable for DNA replication after CMG assembly.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The Mcm2 NTE promotes DDK docking onto MCM DHs</title><p>Next, we addressed how Mcm2 may promote the phosphorylation of Mcm4 and −6 by DDK. Previous studies had proposed a docking mechanism by which a stable association of DDK with MCM DHs promotes processive multi-site phosphorylation of the Mcm4 and −6 NTEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Francis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sheu and Stillman, 2006</xref>). These studies, however, either utilized complex cell extracts to load MCM onto DNA, which may include unknown proteins that bridge the DDK-MCM interaction, or examined the binding of DDK to the isolated Mcm4 subunit, leaving open the question how DDK interacts with MCM subunits in the context of the MCM DH. We, therefore, investigated the direct binding of DDK to purified MCM DHs <italic>in vitro</italic>. For this, MCM DHs bound to DNA immobilized on paramagnetic beads were isolated from MCM loading reactions, washed with high-salt buffer, and incubated under various conditions with purified DDK.</p><p>Titration of DDK into a MCM DH binding reaction revealed that DDK binding to the DNA beads started to saturate at 75 nM DDK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Importantly, when MCM DH formation was prevented by omission of Cdt1⋅MCM from the MCM loading reaction DDK binding to the DNA beads was not observed even at 300 nM DDK, demonstrating that DDK associates with MCM DHs on the DNA. To determine if DDK binds specifically to MCM DHs, we performed MCM loading reactions in the presence of ATP or ATPγS in order to assemble MCM DHs or OCCMs, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Unlike the MCM DH, the OCCM contains only a single MCM hexamer partially loaded around DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yuan et al., 2017</xref>). Because the OCCM is sensitive to high-salt buffer washes, free proteins were removed from the reactions by low-salt buffer washes and DNA-bound complexes were subsequently incubated with DDK in the presence of ATPγS. DDK binding was exclusively observed in the presence of MCM DHs; neither OCCM nor the individual loading factors ORC, Cdc6, or Cdt1⋅MCM, or pairwise combinations of these, formed stable complexes with DDK on DNA.

contribution of the Mcm2 NTE to the DDK-MCM DH interaction. To this end, MCM DHs harboring Mcm2-TEV were incubated with TEV protease prior to addition of DDK. As before, proteolytic removal of residues 1–127 from the Mcm2 N-terminus did not affect MCM DH stability on the DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). However, truncation of the Mcm2 N-terminus resulted in severely diminished binding of DDK to MCM DHs, demonstrating that Mcm2 residues 1–127 are important for the association of DDK with MCM DHs. To determine if the Mcm2 N-terminus is important only for the recruitment of DDK or also for the retention of DDK on MCM DHs, TEV protease was added to the reaction either before or after DDK binding. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, while truncation of the Mcm2 NTE prior to the addition of DDK inhibited DDK-MCM DH complex formation as before, addition of TEV protease after DDK-MCM DH complex formation also led to the release of DDK from MCM DHs, demonstrating that the Mcm2 NTE is required for the retention of DDK on MCM DHs.</p><p>The DDK-MCM DH complex was remarkably resistant to extensive buffer washes including up to 0.3 M KOAc, attesting to the relative stability of the DDK-MCM DH interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Disruption of the complex was observed in wash buffer containing 0.5 M NaCl, a condition in which MCM DHs remain stably bound to DNA, indicating that electrostatic interactions play an important role in mediating the DDK-MCM DH interaction. In the above experiments DDK binding to MCM DHs was monitored in the presence of the non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue ATPγS with the intention to trap DDK bound to MCM DH. Indeed, reduced DDK binding to MCM DHs was observed in the absence of nucleotide relative to the level of DDK binding to MCM DHs in the presence of ATP, ATPγS, or the non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue adenylyl-imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP), indicating that ATP binding promotes DDK-MCM DH complex formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). In the presence of ATP, both Cdc7 and Dbf4 exhibit a pronounced retardation in gel-mobility due to the auto-phosphorylation activity of DDK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hughes et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Weinreich and Stillman, 1999</xref>). Intriguingly, the level of DDK binding to MCM DHs was essentially identical in the presence of ATP, ATPγS, or AMP-PNP. This demonstrates that DDK docking onto MCM DHs is independent of Mcm4 and −6 phosphorylation. Moreover, these observations reveal that DDK remains stably bound to the MCM DHs after phosphorylation of the Mcm4 /-6 NTEs. Together, these results demonstrate that the Mcm2 NTE is required for the physical interaction of DDK with MCM DHs, explaining the inhibition of Mcm4 and −6 phosphorylation in its absence.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Efficient origin activation requires the Mcm2 N-termini of both MCM hexamers</title><p>Bidirectional origin firing requires the activation of both MCM hexamers in a MCM DH to form a pair of oppositely oriented replication forks.

Importantly, at Cdt1·MCM concentrations below 80 nM origin firing efficiency strongly correlates with Cdt1·MCM concentration, thus allowing sensitive detection of loss of MCM DH activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Similar to our previous approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), total DNA synthesis in the complete absence of the Mcm2 residues 1–127 was reduced by ~75% relative to that in the presence of full-length Mcm2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5 A+B</xref>). This DNA synthesis defect was due to a defect in origin activation and not fork progression as leading and lagging strand lengths were similar in both conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Importantly, DNA replication was reduced by ~50% at a 1:1 ratio of Cdt1·MCM<sup>2Δ127</sup> to wildtype Cdt1·MCM, well beyond the 25% reduction expected if one Mcm2 NTE was sufficient for normal origin activation. The fact that the loss in DNA replication levels falls short of the 75% reduction expected if both Mcm2 NTEs in the Mcm2-7 DH were required for origin firing is attributable to the residual origin activity observed in the absence of Mcm2 NTEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Mcm2-WT does not rescue the Mcm2Δ127 replication defect.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Standard DNA replication reaction using p1017 (4.8 kb) as template.

The normal half-unit length leading strand length obtained on circular DNA templates results from the termination of DNA replication at the plasmid pole opposite the replication origin when sister replication forks emanating from a replication origin converge.

However, some residual DDK binding and significant Mcm4 and −6 phosphorylation occurred in the presence of Rad53-kd, indicating that Rad53-kd-mediated inhibition of DDK is inefficient.

In contrast, Rad53-kd was unable to inhibit origin firing when added after DDK to the replication reaction and only partially inhibited origin firing when pre-incubated with DDK prior to addition at the MCM loading step. These observations are consistent with genetic data demonstrating that kinase-dead alleles of Rad53 are deficient in origin inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lopes et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pellicioli et al., 1999</xref>). We conclude that activated Rad53 inhibits DDK binding to Mcm2-7 DHs, which in turn inhibits Mcm4 and −6 phosphorylation and origin activation.</p><p>Our observation that Rad53-WT but not Rad53-kd inhibits DDK binding to MCM DHs and subsequent origin firing is consistent with current models implicating Rad53 phosphorylation of Dbf4 in DDK inhibition. Interestingly, previous studies have indicated that a physical interaction between Rad53 and DDK also contributes to the inhibition of origin activation by the checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duncker et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Matthews et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Varrin et al., 2005</xref>). Whether this physical interaction simply mediates Dbf4 phosphorylation by Rad53 or contributes independently to DDK inhibition by Rad53 has not been addressed. Therefore, to determine if Rad53 phosphorylation of DDK is required for the inhibition of DDK binding to MCM DHs we monitored DDK-MCM DH complex formation in the presence of AMP-PNP. As we have shown above, AMP-PNP promotes DDK binding to MCM DHs to the same extent as ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Strikingly, the ability of Rad53 to prevent DDK recruitment to MCM DHs or to displace DDK from MCM DHs was undiminished in the presence of AMP-PNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Thus, DDK phosphorylation by Rad53 is not required to control DDK-MCM DH complex formation.</p><p>To address the non-catalytic mechanism by which Rad53 may inhibit DDK, we tested if Rad53 can form a stable complex with DDK that may sequester DDK and thereby inhibit MCM phosphorylation. For this, we monitored Rad53-DDK complex formation by gel-filtration. Intriguingly, Rad53-WT and Rad53-kd exhibit very different elution profiles during gel-filtration chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). While Rad53-kd elutes at a volume that is consistent with a monomeric structure, Rad53-WT elutes as a oligomeric complex. Rad53 and its human homolog, Chk2, are known to associate into homo-dimeric complexes during activation by trans-autophosphorylation, suggesting the oligomeric form of Rad53 observed here is a dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahn and Prives, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cai et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Oliver et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wybenga-Groot et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Xu et al., 2002</xref>). However, contrary to our observation, both kinase-dead Rad53 and Chk2 have been shown previously to also form dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cai et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wybenga-Groot et al., 2014</xref>). As these previous studies were carried out with truncated kinase versions, it is possible that the additional domains present in our full-length Rad53-kd construct affect its dimerization. For example, the isolated Chk2 kinase domain adopts a highly distinct dimer configuration from that of a Chk2 construct spanning the FHA and kinase domain, supporting the notion that domain composition can affect the oligomeric structure of Rad53/Chk2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cai et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Oliver et al., 2006</xref>). Importantly, Rad53-WT but not Rad53-kd eluted as a stable complex with DDK during gel-filtration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Thus, the ability of Rad53 to bind DDK correlates with its origin inhibition function.

Based on this configuration, it was proposed that an inactive CMG encircling dsDNA blocks the progression of a CMG formed around the opposite hexamer to impose bidirectional origin firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Douglas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Georgescu et al., 2017</xref>). However, a stalled CMG helicase encircling ssDNA would pose a threat to DNA integrity due to the exposure of the displaced strand at the active CMG. In addition, due to the ability of inactive CMG complexes to slide freely along duplex DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Douglas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wasserman et al., 2019</xref>) we consider it unlikely that an inactive CMG would pose a significant barrier to an opposing replication fork on naked DNA <italic>in vitro</italic>. As an alternative fail-safe mechanism, we propose that simultaneous activation of both MCM hexamers at an origin is controlled by an interdependent mechanism. Our data identify the Mcm2 NTE as a critical component of such a mechanism, as loss of a single Mcm2 N-terminus at a MCM DH inhibits origin activity without inducing unidirectional firing. Mechanistically, we propose that both Mcm2 NTEs in a MCM DH are required for tethering of a pair of DDK molecules to promote symmetric phosphorylation of both hexamers. It will, therefore, be important in future studies to determine the stoichiometry of DDK in the DDK-MCM DH complex. Supporting an interdependent hexamer activation mechanism, recent findings have demonstrated that both MCM hexamers loaded at an origin have to be physically associated to support CMG activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Champasa et al., 2019</xref>). Interdependent MCM activation may conceivably be required at the origin melting step, which may involve two CMGs working in opposite direction against each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Froelich et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Langston and O'Donnell, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Noguchi et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Our proposed role of the Mcm2 NTE as a DDK docking site is supported by a previous yeast two-hybrid study that detected a specific pairwise interaction between Dbf4 and the Mcm2 N-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ramer et al., 2013</xref>). Although a docking interaction between DDK and the structured NTD of Mcm4 was suggested by <italic>in vitro</italic> studies with purified DDK and Mcm4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sheu and Stillman, 2006</xref>), we find that in the context of the MCM DH this interaction is insufficient to tether DDK in the absence of the Mcm2 NTE. However, our data does not rule out the possibility that DDK docking involves a complex interaction surface comprising critical interactions with multiple MCM subunits. In fact, we show that MCM DHs, but not the single MCM hexamers contained in OCCMs, are stably bound by DDK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This is consistent with previous data demonstrating that MCM DHs are preferred phosphorylation targets for DDK over single MCM hexamers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Francis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sun et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, structural determinants in addition to the Mcm2 NTE govern the interaction of DDK with MCM DHs. Moreover, prior phosphorylation of MCM by other kinases has also been shown to promote DDK binding to MCM at origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Francis et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, we show that ATP-binding promotes DDK-MCM complex formation. How ATP-binding may promote DDK binding to MCM DHs is not clear, but it is possible that ATP stabilizes an active site conformation in Cdc7 that is more conducive to substrate engagement than the nucleotide-free form, as has been proposed for other protein kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Taylor and Kornev, 2011</xref>). Structural characterization of the DDK·MCM DH complexes isolated here will help define the details of the DDK-MCM interface. Such an analysis may also help resolve the mechanism of Mcm4/6 phosphorylation by DDK, which may occur across the hexamer-hexamer interface or within the hexamer bound by a DDK molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sun et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We find that DDK remains stably bound to MCM DHs even after phosphorylation of the Mcm4 and −6 NTEs. DDK phosphorylation of MCM is opposed by dephosphorylation of MCM by the Rif1-PP1 phosphatase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alver et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davé et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hiraga et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hiraga et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mattarocci et al., 2014</xref>). While tethering of DDK to MCM DHs may, therefore, not be essential for maintaining DDK phosphorylation of Mcm4/6 in the absence of Rif1-PP1 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, lane six and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, lane 4), it is likely to promote MCM phosphorylation <italic>in vivo</italic> by shifting the balance between DDK and Rif1-PP1 activity toward DDK. Additionally, as Dbf4 concentrations are limiting for origin activation, retention of DDK at early origins until origin firing may prevent premature recycling of DDK to late origins to establish the replication timing program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mantiero et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tanaka et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, retention of DDK at unfired origins has been proposed to restrict DDK targeting of Eco1 until late S phase to control cohesion in the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Seoane and Morgan, 2017</xref>). These mechanisms imply that DDK release from MCM DHs is regulated by origin activation. Since DDK targets MCM DHs specifically, hexamer separation may be sufficient to induce DDK release. Alternatively, tethering of DDK to the long and flexible Mcm2 NTE may allow DDK to remain bound to replisomes. Indeed, the association of DDK with replisomes was shown to link DNA replication with meiotic recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Murakami and Keeney, 2014</xref>). Analogously, DDK bound to replisomes in a mitotic S phase may promote spatio-temporal coordination of DNA replication with other chromosomal processes such as chromatin assembly or DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Furuya et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gérard et al., 2006</xref>). It will, therefore, be interesting in future experiments to determine the dynamics of the DDK-MCM interaction during DNA replication.</p><p>We find that activated Rad53 inhibits DDK binding to MCM DHs by a steric mechanism that is independent of Dbf4 phosphorylation by Rad53 (model <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).

The M and C domains embrace the Cdc7 kinase to mediate Cdc7 activation, while the N motif forms part of an N-terminal BRCT domain that is dispensable for Cdc7 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Almawi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dick et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hughes et al., 2012</xref>). Intriguingly, an N-terminal fragment encompassing the BRCT and M domains is required and sufficient to target Dbf4 to MCM complexes loaded at replication origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dowell et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Francis et al., 2009</xref>), while a physical interaction between Rad53 and the Dbf4 BRCT domain has been proposed to contribute to checkpoint-dependent origin control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duncker et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Matthews et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Matthews et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, competitive binding of Rad53 to the Dbf4 BRCT domain is likely in part responsible for the inhibition of DDK binding to MCM DHs observed here. The N-terminal region of Dbf4 has also been shown to interact with ORC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duncker et al., 2002</xref>). However, consistent with a previous study in whole-cell yeast extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Francis et al., 2009</xref>), we show here that purified MCM DHs can recruit DDK to replication origins independently of ORC and, conversely, that ORC alone is incapable of recruiting DDK to DNA.</p><p>Both Rad53-WT and Rad53-kd can inhibit DDK recruitment to MCM DHs, but the block of Mcm4 and −6 phosphorylation and origin activation in the presence of Rad53-kd is incomplete. More strikingly, unlike Rad53-WT, Rad53-kd is completely deficient for displacing DDK from MCM DHs and thereby inhibit origin firing. However, as Rad53-dependent DDK displacement from MCM DHs does not require Rad53 kinase activity, we suggest that the oligomeric state of Rad53, the Rad53 phosphorylation state, or both control the ability of Rad53 to displace DDK from MCM DHs. While Rad53-kd is monomeric in solution, we show that active Rad53-wt forms oligomers, likely dimers, in solution. We propose that following recruitment to MCM DHs, DDK may form a dimer on the MCM DH surface that is in complex with both Mcm2 NTEs, which we show are required for maintaining DDK at MCM DHs. A DDK dimer bound to a MCM DH may require simultaneous disruption of the interaction of both DDK molecules with MCM for DDK release, explaining the proficiency of dimeric Rad53-WT and, conversely, deficiency of monomeric Rad53-kd to compete DDK off MCM DHs. Following DDK displacement, PP1 would then be able to dephosphorylate the Mcm4 and −6 NTEs and thus inactivate the origin. On the other hand, as DDK is monomeric in solution, both Rad53-WT and Rad53-kd can bind DDK prior to MCM DH binding, but the interaction of Rad53-kd with DDK is unstable and insufficient to block origin firing. Thus, Rad53 would block DDK binding to MCM DHs <italic>in vivo</italic> only after checkpoint-induced activation and dimerization, as expected. To test this hypothesis, it will be important to generate catalytically active mutants of Rad53 that are deficient for stable dimerization.</p><p>A Rad53 kinase-independent mechanism for DDK inhibition was unexpected as previous studies have demonstrated that mutation of Rad53 phosphorylation sites in Dbf4 and Sld3 allows late origin firing in the presence of HU or MMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lopez-Mosqueda et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zegerman and Diffley, 2010</xref>). It is possible that origin efficiency under this condition will further increase upon disruption of the Rad53-DDK interface. Alternatively, phosphoacceptor-site mutations in Dbf4 may also affect the physical interaction between Dbf4 and Rad53. These possibilities remain to be tested in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key

Cells were grown in 48L YP/2 % glycerol/2 % lactic acid pH 5.5 (YPLG) at 30°C to a density of 2 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells/mL. Protein expression was induced with 2 % galactose for 4 hr. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with 25 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.6/1 M sorbitol and resuspended in 0.5 volumes of buffer A (45 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.6/0.02 % NP-40 substitute/10 % glycerol)/100 mM NaCl/1 mM DTT/1 x protease inhibitor cocktail (Pierce). The cell suspension was pipetted dropwise into liquid nitrogen to generate frozen popcorn and stored in −80°C. Cells were lysed by crushing the popcorn in a Spex freezer mill, using 10 cycles of 2 min run + 1 min cooldown at 15 CPS. Resulting whole cell lysate was thawed and supplemented with 1 volume of 45 mM buffer A/100 mM NaCl/1 mM DTT/1 x protease inhibitor cocktail. 5 M NaCl was added to the lysate to a final concentration to 300 mM. After 20 min of gentle agitation at 4°C, cell lysate was centrifuged in a T-647.5 rotor (Thermo Fisher) at 40,000 rpm for 1 hr at 4°C. The clear soluble phase was recovered and DDK pulled down with 1 mL packed FLAG affinity agarose beads (Sigma) for 4 hr at 4°C with gentle rocking. Beads were collected by centrifugation and washed with 10 volumes of buffer A/300 mM NaCl/1 mM DTT. Beads were resuspended in 1 volume of buffer A/300 mM NaCl/2 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub>/1 mM DTT and incubated with λ protein phosphatase (NEB) at 50 U/mL for 1 hr at 23°C with agitation. Beads were collected and protein eluted in five volumes of buffer A/300 mM NaCl/1 mM DTT supplemented with 0.25 mg/mL 3xFLAG peptide. Eluates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The FLAG pulldown was repeated until DDK was depleted from the extract. Fractions containing DDK were pooled, and the volume reduced to 0.5 mL using an Amicon spin concentrator (Millipore). The pooled, concentrated eluate was fractionated on a 24 mL Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL (GE Healthcare) gel filtration column in buffer A/300 mM NaCl/1 mM DTT.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Bruce Stillman as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors have studied how the DDK (Cdc7-Dbf4) protein kinase activates the initiation of DNA replication. They show, using an Mcm2 subunit in which the amino-terminus can be removed, that this region of Mcm2 is not required for Mcm2-7 double hexamer (DH) formation, but is required for DNA replication. The Mcm2 amino terminus recruits the DDK and promotes phosphorylation of Mcm4 and Mcm6 subunits, but after that it is not required for the Sld3-dependent step in the initiation of DNA replication. Finally, the authors address the role of Rad53 in the inactivation of DDK phosphorylation. They find that Rad53 inhibits DDK binding to loaded Mcm2-7 double hexamers or that it promotes DDK removal from the Mcm2-7 DH and find that this inhibition is lessened by mutating the Rad53 kinase domain but does not require ATP hydrolysis or phosphorylation of Mcm2-7 by DDK or Rad53.</p><p>This is a nice paper whose strength are the studies identifying the N-terminal extension of Mcm2 as a DDK binding site on the Mcm2-7 double hexamer. The evidence that removing this binding site inhibits Mcm2-7 phosphorylation, DNA unwinding, and DNA replication initiation is robust and compelling. The use of a protease cleavable form of the Mcm2 protein is a nice touch that allows the removal of the tail at various times in any reaction. This provides clear evidence that the 1-127 region of Mcm2 is important at the DDK step of the initiation reaction. Although this finding does not eliminate additional roles for this region that act later during replication, the authors point out that the distribution of products is not changed suggestion no role during elongation. It is interesting that there is relatively little effect of including chromatinized DNA in the reaction, given that part of what is removed is the binding site for histones.</p><p>The last part of the work regarding the involvement of Rad53, and specifically that Rad53 dimerization is needed for DDK displacement by Rad53, is more speculative and would need more evidence to validate the model presented in Figure 7. Thus, toning down the discussion on this point would be valuable.</p><p>The revised paper does not require new experimental data, but addressing the issues raised below in a revised manuscript would strengthen the report.</p><p>Revisions:</p><p>1) The level of DDK required for maximal binding to the Mcm2-7 DH and the phosphorylation of Mcm4 and Mcm6 is 75nM under the conditions employed, but Figure 5—figure supplement 1 shows that 300nM of DDK does not saturate the amount of DNA synthesis. Perhaps the authors could comment on this difference. Of course, DDK might perform multiple functions in the initiation of DNA replication.</p><p>2) In Figure 1, does the NTE truncation affect MCM loading (as well as DH stability)? This issue is actually addressed in Figure 5B, but the issue would usefully be covered at the start, either by including data in this figure or by making reference in the text to where the experiment will be presented.</p><p>3) Figure 3: Why does the efficiency of replication appear increased when TEV protease is added to MCM2-wt (Figure 3B)? Also, in Figure 3B, it would be useful to show a “-TEV protease” negative control within the Mcm2-TEV set of reactions.</p><p>4) Figure 4: Figure 4C: What concentration of DDK was used (to allow comparison with parts A and B)? Figure 4E: A band shift suggests that Dbf4 seems to be phosphorylated/modified when ATP is added. Could the authors explain, and discuss possible reasons and interpretation?</p><p>Could the authors explain in the text for what reason ATP/an ATP analogue might be needed to promote full levels of DDK association?</p><p>5) Figure 5: Figure 5C: The text states that there is no evidence of asymmetric or uni-directional replication coming from the activation of a single hexamer, but the reasons given for this interpretation are difficult to understand. This conclusion needs to be better explained.</p><p>6) The weakest aspect of the paper revolves around the model that DDK bound Mcm2 is required for both of the two Mcm2-7 complexes for efficient initiation to occur. Although the authors propose a model that the 1:1 complex is inactive, the data is not sufficiently different from what would be expected if this complex were just slightly less active (e.g. 2-fold). More importantly, the model of that DDK bound to one kinase phosphorylates the tails of the other kinase has no support in the paper and should be removed or additional experiments added. If this trans model is right, then there are clear experiments to demonstrate this is the case that are well within the authors' abilities. They should be added to support the model or the model should be left out of the paper so that if or when they demonstrate this interesting idea it can be a clear new result. This is not an essential add but if such experiments are not added then the model should be removed. The authors would need more replicates of Figure 6 C, D, and E to be a convincing quantitative argument. Even then, there are clearly other explanations for the data.</p><p>7) Figure 6: It is shown that like wt Rad53, a kinase-dead mutant Rad53 is largely able to repress DDK binding to MCM, but the kinase-dead mutant Rad53 is unable to displace DDK from pre-formed DH. The authors suggest that their result would be explained if Rad53 dimerization is the essential requirement to inhibit DDK binding to Mcm2-7, mediated by Rad53 trans-autophosphorylation. While an interesting suggestion, they do not really test this idea. It is therefore suggested that the authors modulate the conclusions and model arising from Figure 6, to avoid the false impression that the necessity for Rad53 trans-auto-activation and dimerization has been demonstrated. One possibility would be to remove the data on the kinase-dead mutant altogether. Alternatively, the authors should considerably tone down their interpretation and discussion concerning the phenotype of the kinase-dead mutant (including removing the comment about autophosphorylation from the Abstract, and the illustration in Figure 7 that Rad53 phosphorylation and dimerization are important, since this has not been demonstrated).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58571.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions:</p><p>1) The level of DDK required for maximal binding to the Mcm2-7 DH and the phosphorylation of Mcm4 and Mcm6 is 75nM under the conditions employed, but Figure 5—figure supplement 1 shows that 300nM of DDK does not saturate the amount of DNA synthesis.

Please note that the experiment in Figure 5—figure supplement 1B has been carried out with the Mcm2-D127 truncation in order to demonstrate that increased DDK concentrations can partially suppress the replication defect of Mcm2-D127, consistent with the notion that the Mcm2 NTE is an affinity determinant for DDK. This experiment, therefore, corresponds to the MCM DH-DDK binding experiment in Figure 4B, lanes 5-8, which also does not reach saturation of DDK binding to MCM DHs even at 300 nM DDK.</p><p>Nonetheless, we do indeed observe that DNA synthesis does also not saturate at 75 nM DDK in replication assays with Mcm2-wt (data not shown, but available upon request). We believe this is due to the fact that in the replication assay DDK is added to a complex mixture of MCM DHs and free Cdt1·MCM complexes present at the MCM loading step of the replication reaction, whereas free Cdt1·Mcm2-7 complexes are removed by washes of the DNA beads in the MCM DH-DDK binding experiments of Figure 4 prior to addition of DDK. It is, therefore, likely that the excess of free Cdt1·MCM competes with DNA-bound MCM DHs for DDK in the replication assay.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In Figure 1, does the NTE truncation affect MCM loading (as well as DH stability)?

Also, in Figure 3B, it would be useful to show a “-TEV protease” negative control within the Mcm2-TEV set of reactions.</p></disp-quote><p>The “-TEV protease” replication control experiment for Mcm2-TEV is shown in the original Figure 2—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 4: Figure 4C: What concentration of DDK was used (to allow comparison with parts A and B)?</p></disp-quote><p>DDK was used at 150 nM. While previously noted in the Materials and methods section, we now indicate this also in the figure legend to Figure 4C for clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4E: A band shift suggests that Dbf4 seems to be phosphorylated/modified when ATP is added. Could the authors explain, and discuss possible reasons and interpretation?</p></disp-quote><p>DDK is known to undergo autophosphorylation. This has been shown for both yeast and human DDK. We now provide appropriate references in the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Could the authors explain in the text for what reason ATP/an ATP analogue might be needed to promote full levels of DDK association?</p></disp-quote><p>We can only speculate about the reasons, but now consider in the Discussion the possibility that by analogy to other protein kinases ATP binding either induces a conformational change or stabilizes a conformation in Cdc7 that is more conducive to substrate engagement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 5: Figure 5C: The text states that there is no evidence of asymmetric or uni-directional replication coming from the activation of a single hexamer, but the reasons given for this interpretation are difficult to understand. This conclusion needs to be better explained.</p></disp-quote><p>An expanded explanation is now included in the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The weakest aspect of the paper revolves around the model that DDK bound Mcm2 is required for both of the two Mcm2-7 complexes for efficient initiation to occur. Although the authors propose a model that the 1:1 complex is inactive, the data is not sufficiently different from what would be expected if this complex were just slightly less active (e.g. 2-fold). More importantly, the model of that DDK bound to one kinase phosphorylates the tails of the other kinase has no support in the paper and should be removed or additional experiments added. If this trans model is right, then there are clear experiments to demonstrate this is the case that are well within the authors' abilities. They should be added to support the model or the model should be left out of the paper so that if or when they demonstrate this interesting idea it can be a clear new result. This is not an essential add but if such experiments are not added then the model should be removed. The authors would need more replicates of Figure 6 C, D, and E to be a convincing quantitative argument. Even then, there are clearly other explanations for the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that additional evidence is needed to address the stoichiometry of the DDK-MCM DH complex and to resolve the issue of <italic>cis</italic>- or <italic>trans</italic>-phosphorylation of Mcm4/6 by DDK. In response to the reviewer’s comments we have, therefore, removed the interpretation of the data of Figure 5 with regard to DDK stoichiometry and refocused the description of the data in Figure 5 on the lack of uni-directional origin firing in the presence of both Mcm2-WT- and Mcm2D127. In addition, we now point out in the Discussion that it will be important in future studies to determine the stoichiometry of DDK in the DDK-MCM DH complex. At this point we do not make any assumptions in the paper regarding the <italic>cis</italic>-/<italic>trans</italic>-phosphorylation mechanism of Mcm4/6 by DDK.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figure 6: It is shown that like wt Rad53, a kinase-dead mutant Rad53 is largely able to repress DDK binding to MCM, but the kinase-dead mutant Rad53 is unable to displace DDK from pre-formed DH. The authors suggest that their result would be explained if Rad53 dimerization is the essential requirement to inhibit DDK binding to Mcm2-7, mediated by Rad53 trans-autophosphorylation. While an interesting suggestion, they do not really test this idea. It is therefore suggested that the authors modulate the conclusions and model arising from Figure 6, to avoid the false impression that the necessity for Rad53 trans-auto-activation and dimerization has been demonstrated. One possibility would be to remove the data on the kinase-dead mutant altogether. Alternatively, the authors should considerably tone down their interpretation and discussion concerning the phenotype of the kinase-dead mutant (including removing the comment about autophosphorylation from the Abstract, and the illustration in Figure 7 that Rad53 phosphorylation and dimerization are important, since this has not been demonstrated).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the role of Rad53 autophosphorylation and dimerization needs to be affirmed by additional data. This is complicated by the fact that activation/autophosphorylation depends on Rad53 dimerization. In light of the reviewer’s comments we have removed the statement on the roles of Rad53 autophosphorylation and dimerization from both the Abstract and the conclusions in the main text. Instead, we raise the possibility in the Discussion that the Rad53 oligomeric state or its phosphorylation state, or both, may control the ability of Rad53 to sequester DDK.</p><p>Moreover, we now present additional data demonstrating that Rad53-wt, but not Rad53-kd, can form a stable complex with DDK, which supports our model for the steric inhibition of DDK by Rad53. In addition, while our previous experiments have focused on the effect of Rad53 on DDK binding to MCM DHs, we now include data that extend the effect of Rad53 on DNA synthesis. We consider our observation of a steric mechanism for Rad53 function a major novel finding and consider the data involving Rad53-kd important to support this observation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
