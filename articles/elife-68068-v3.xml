DNA-binding and transcriptional activation domains (ADs). Because few ADs have been described, we tested domains tiling all yeast transcription factors for activation in vivo and identified 150 ADs. By mRNA display, we showed that 73% of ADs bound the Med15 subunit of Mediator, and that binding strength was correlated with activation. AD-Mediator interaction in vitro was unaffected by a large excess of free activator protein, pointing to a dynamic mechanism of interaction. Structural modeling showed that ADs interact with Med15 without shape complementarity (‘fuzzy’ binding). ADs shared no sequence motifs, but mutagenesis revealed biochemical and structural constraints. Finally, a neural network trained on AD sequences accurately predicted ADs in human proteins and in other yeast proteins, including chromosomal proteins and chromatin remodeling complexes. These findings solve the longstanding enigma of AD structure and function and provide a rationale for their role in biology.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells adapt and respond to changes by regulating the activity of their genes. To turn genes on or off, they use a family of proteins called transcription factors. Transcription factors influence specific but overlapping groups of genes, so that each gene is controlled by several transcription factors that act together like a dimmer switch to regulate gene activity.</p><p>The presence of transcription factors attracts proteins such as the Mediator complex, which activates genes by gathering the protein machines that read the genes. The more transcription factors are found near a specific gene, the more strongly they attract Mediator and the more active the gene is. A specific region on the transcription factor called the activation domain is necessary for this process. The biochemical sequences of these domains vary greatly between species, yet activation domains from, for example, yeast and human proteins are often interchangeable.</p><p>To understand why this is the case, Sanborn et al. analyzed the genome of baker’s yeast and identified 150 activation domains, each very different in sequence. Three-quarters of them bound to a subunit of the Mediator complex called Med15. Sanborn et al. then developed a machine learning algorithm to predict activation domains in both yeast and humans. This algorithm also showed that negatively charged and greasy regions on the activation domains were essential to be activated by the Mediator complex.</p><p>Further analyses revealed that activation domains used different poses to bind multiple sites on Med15, a behavior known as ‘fuzzy’ binding. This creates a high overall affinity even though the binding strength at each individual site is low, enabling the protein complexes to remain dynamic. These weak interactions together permit fine control over the activity of several genes, allowing cells to respond quickly and precisely to many changes.</p><p>The computer algorithm used here provides a new way to identify activation domains across species and could improve our understanding of how living things grow, adapt and evolve. It could also give new insights into mechanisms of disease, particularly cancer, where transcription factors are often faulty.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>transcription factor</kwd><kwd>activation domain</kwd><kwd>mediator complex</kwd><kwd>machine learning</kwd><kwd>high-throughput screening</kwd><kwd>molecular simulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-DK121366</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kornberg</surname><given-names>Roger D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000015</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Energy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing (SciDAC) program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dror</surname><given-names>Ron O</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>4D Nucleome Grant (U01HL130010)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lieberman Aiden</surname><given-names>Erez</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Encyclopedia of DNA Elements Mapping Center Award (UM1HG009375)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lieberman Aiden</surname><given-names>Erez</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PHY-2019745, Center for Theoretical Biological Physics</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lieberman Aiden</surname><given-names>Erez</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Q-1866</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lieberman Aiden</surname><given-names>Erez</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund12"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>McNair Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Scholar Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lieberman Aiden</surname><given-names>Erez</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund13"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006221</institution-id><institution>United States - Israel Binational Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019276</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lieberman Aiden</surname><given-names>Erez</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund14"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004316</institution-id><institution>IBM Corporation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>In-kind support</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lieberman Aiden</surname><given-names>Erez</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000005</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Defense</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>National Defense Science &amp;

They thus serve key roles in central processes such as growth, stress response, and development, and their mutation or misregulation underlies many human diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Spitz and Furlong, 2012</xref>). A TF includes a sequence-specific DNA-binding domain (DBD) and an effector domain that regulates nearby gene transcription. Activation domains (ADs) – effector domains that increase transcription – have long been of particular interest due to their roles as oncogenic drivers and use as scientific tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bradner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brückner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dominguez et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>ADs were discovered as regions that could independently stimulate transcription when ectopically recruited to a gene promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brent and Ptashne, 1985</xref>). Early experiments showed that ADs were unlike structured domains because progressive truncations showed graded reductions in activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hope and Struhl, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hope et al., 1988</xref>). Subsequent studies showed that ADs were disordered and had few similarities in their primary sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mitchell and Tjian, 1989</xref>). Instead, ADs were classified based on their enrichment of certain residues, whether acidic, glutamine-rich, or proline-rich.</p><p>Acidic ADs are the most common and best characterized. Acidic ADs retain activity when transferred between yeast and animals, pointing to a conserved eukaryotic mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fischer et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Struhl, 1988</xref>). While some have found that acidic residues are necessary for activation, others have found that they are dispensable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brzovic et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pacheco et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Staller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Warfield et al., 2014</xref>). Besides their negative charge, acidic ADs are rich in bulky hydrophobic residues. Mutating these hydrophobic residues reduces activation, often in proportion to the number mutated.</p><p>Because AD sequences are highly diverse and poorly conserved, only a small fraction of all ADs in eukaryotic TFs have likely been annotated. Sequence motifs have been proposed based on analysis of select ADs but have not been used for large-scale prediction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Piskacek et al., 2007</xref>). Screens of random sequences in yeast identified many activating sequences that represented as many as 1–4% of elements tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hackett et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ravarani et al., 2018</xref>). Actual protein sequences are, however, highly non-random. Direct screening of protein sequences has identified relatively few ADs at low resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arnold et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Tycko et al., 2020</xref>). There is a need for methods to experimentally detect or computationally predict all ADs.</p><p>ADs stimulate transcription of genes by recruiting coactivator complexes, especially the Mediator complex, which interacts with RNA Polymerase II and regulates its transcription initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kornberg, 2005</xref>). Mediator is necessary for TF-dependent activation in vitro and in vivo and is required for regulation by enhancers in all eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen and Taatjes, 2015</xref>). Mediator and TFs are concentrated at strong enhancers, perhaps in a phase-separated state, which may play a role in gene activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boija et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sabari et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Shrinivas et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Whyte et al., 2013</xref>). Beyond Mediator, TFs have been suggested to recruit other conserved multiprotein complexes, including TFIID, SAGA, and SWI/SNF, that play roles in activation of various genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hahn and Young, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mitchell and Tjian, 1989</xref>). While many such TF interactions have been described, their occurrence and roles remain to be determined.</p><p>Biochemical studies of TF-coactivator interaction have given insight into the mechanism of activation. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies revealed short alpha helices formed by acidic ADs of yeast Gcn4 protein, with hydrophobic faces contacting hydrophobic surfaces of the Med15 subunit of Mediator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brzovic et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Tuttle et al., 2018</xref>). NMR constraints were consistent with multiple possible AD binding poses, suggesting a dynamic ‘fuzzy complex’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Tompa and Fuxreiter, 2008</xref>). Further consistent with these ideas, solvent exposure of aromatic residues was associated with activation in a screen of Gcn4 AD variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Staller et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Here, we combine quantitative, high-throughput measurements of in vivo activation and in vitro interaction with computational modeling to characterize ADs. We identify 150 ADs in budding yeast and describe their shared sequence attributes. We extend the analysis by training and validating a neural network that predicts new ADs across eukaryotes. Guided by predictions, we design and measure activation of thousands of AD mutants to derive a deeper understanding of the principles underlying activation. Correlating activation with measurements of binding of ADs to Mediator in vitro identifies the key protein interactions driving activation, for which we predict atomic structures using a peptide-docking algorithm. We derive structural features common to AD-Mediator interactions and use them to explain measurements of Mediator recruitment kinetics in vitro. In total, we develop an integrated model for function, sequence determinants, molecular interactions, and kinetic features of TF ADs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A quantitative screen identifies 150 activation domains from all yeast transcription factors</title><p>We identified ADs across all TFs in budding yeast with the use of a quantitative, uniform, and high-throughput activation assay.

All 164 yeast TFs were tiled by a DNA oligonucleotide library expressing 7460 protein segments, each 53 amino acids (aa) in length, with a step size of 12–13 aa (3.8-fold coverage). The library was cloned into the aTF expression plasmid and transformed into yeast cells. Using fluorescence-activated cell sorting, cells with a defined level of aTF expression were selected by mCherry signal and sorted into eight bins based on GFP expression. By next-generation sequencing, the distribution of each protein tile across the bins was determined and the mean value was used to calculate activation—namely, the fold increase in GFP relative to background.

However, AD sequences appeared to share no common motifs upon inspection. The 9aaTAD motif, originally proposed based on yeast ADs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Piskacek et al., 2007</xref>), predicted ADs poorly: only 10% of 9aaTAD-containing tiles activated in our assay, which was not significantly more predictive than scrambled versions of the motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). A de novo search for motifs using DREME also found none that were shared by more than two ADs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bailey, 2011</xref>). Evidently, ADs are diverse in sequence and not predictable from simple motifs.</p><p>The lack of motifs suggests that activation is determined not by positions of individual residues but by distributed or redundant features. We pursued this point by measuring activation of a panel of designed mutants of eight ADs. Indeed, 94% of scanning single-amino acid mutants affected activation by less than twofold, and all still activated more than 10-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F–G</xref>).

Activation was gradually, and finally completely, eliminated as either characteristic was reduced. It is noteworthy that the Gcn4 AD, a focus of many past studies, uniquely tolerated mutation of up to six acidic residues. Most notably, activation by acidic and hydrophobic mutants were related to the number, rather than position, of mutated residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1H</xref>).

Altogether, the performance of PADDLE was validated across a wide range of both wild-type and mutant sequences in yeast.</p><p>Classic experiments showed that many acidic ADs retained activity even when transferred between yeast and animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fischer et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Struhl, 1988</xref>), so we investigated whether PADDLE could identify ADs in human TFs that would activate in human cells. Using PADDLE, we predicted 236 high-strength and 366 moderate-strength ADs, together spanning 462 (27%) human TFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>).

PADDLE also predicted 41 high-strength and 45 moderate-strength ADs from among 419 transcription-regulating viral proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). We randomly selected 25 high-strength predicted ADs from human TFs and measured their activation individually using a luciferase reporter in HEK293T cells. Remarkably, 23 domains (92%) activated luciferase expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). While other classes of human ADs, such as glutamine-rich or proline-rich ADs, are not predictable by PADDLE since they are not present in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, acidic activation mechanisms are evidently conserved and the patterns learned by PADDLE are generalizable across eukaryotes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>PADDLE identifies the core regions and key residues of every activation domain</title><p>To uncover the principles of acidic activation learned by PADDLE, we analyzed predictions on designed mutant sequences and developed hypotheses, which we then experimentally tested in a second library. We noticed from predictions on sequences less than 30 aa that yeast ADs contained short, independently activating regions, which we term core ADs (cADs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). As an experimental test, we measured in vivo activation of 13-aa-long fragments tiling ten ADs in 1-aa steps. Predictions proved highly accurate (R<sup>2</sup> score = 0.84, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>), and both predictions and experiments identified at least one significantly activating 13-aa cAD within each AD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>; p&lt;0.001).</p><p>Across all yeast TFs, PADDLE predicted that the minimal region for activation could be localized to within a 20-aa cAD in 85% of ADs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). These cADs still shared no motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G</xref>), but instead had an especially high density of acidic and hydrophobic residues, even more so than the full ADs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). To quantify the contribution of each residue to activation, we predicted the impact of mutating each position in each cAD to alanine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Single-aa mutants in these short cADs had a large predicted impact on activation, unlike in the longer 53-aa ADs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F–G</xref>), and showed clear trends when grouped by residue identity. Mutating the bulkiest hydrophobic residues led to the greatest decreases in predicted activation, and the three most important were Trp, Phe, and Leu (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1I</xref>). Mutating acidic or basic residues had opposite but comparable effects on predicted activation. Together, these analyses identify the regions and residues across ADs that contribute most to activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>A high density of acidic and hydrophobic residues is sufficient for most core ADs to activate, but some require a defined sequence and alpha helical structure</title><p>Having identified the core AD regions, we sought to understand the sequence properties that drive their activation.

We directly determined whether the 28 strongest 13-aa cADs require helical folding by measuring the impact of inserting a helix-breaking proline. Within the seven central positions of each 13-aa cAD, we individually mutated each non-hydrophobic residue to alanine or proline and asked whether proline inhibited activation relative to alanine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Proline mutations inhibited activation more than threefold over alanine in nine ADs (32%), including up to an 11-fold drop in activation in the Tda9 cAD. However, proline mutations inhibited activation by less than twofold in 16 cADs (58%). These effects were consistent between different positions within the same cAD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Interestingly, all three cADs that contained a basic residue (Pul4, Tda9, and Rsf2:586) were strongly inhibited by proline, suggesting that a helix is necessary to position their inhibitory positive charge away from the coactivator binding interface. Most notably, the magnitude of proline disruption was tightly correlated with the wild-type-to-scramble ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, Pearson’s r = 0.842), showing that constraints on structure and sequence, or a lack thereof, were closely linked. Thus, composition-driven cADs typically do not need to form a helix and likely sample disordered conformations, while cADs that require their wild-type sequence typically also require helical folding, employing a structure-driven mechanism.</p><p>To understand these two contrasting mechanisms, we studied them in a simplified system of artificial cADs that used only the four most activation-promoting residues. We examined 9-aa sequences (denoted ‘9mers’) consisting entirely of only two types of amino acids each—Asp and either Leu, Phe, or Trp—so that all possible such sequences (3 × 2<sup>9</sup> = 1536) could be systematically assayed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). As expected, activation required a balance of hydrophobic and acidic residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>), so we focused analysis on aa compositions with the strongest median activation: 9mers with five or six hydrophobic residues. Within these, nearly all Phe 9mers and Trp 9mers activated regardless of their sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), characteristic of a composition-driven mechanism and consistent with the highly hydrophobic nature of Phe and Trp residues. However, Leu 9mers spanned a wide range of activity with only a minority that were strongly activating, characteristic of structure-driven activation requiring a specific ordering of residues.</p><p>To see what allows only certain Leu 9mers to activate, we examined all possible short motifs containing two or three Leu residues. The only motif strongly associated with activation was LxxLL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>; p&lt;10<sup>−8</sup> by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). This motif was strictly required for activation in these 9mers, present in two copies in the three strongest 9mers, found in two wild-type structure-driven cADs (Put3 and Crz1), and previously described in ADs of many nuclear receptors and other TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Plevin et al., 2005</xref>). This motif also suggests an explanation for why helical folding was necessary for cADs with less hydrophobicity: by placing Leu residues along one face of an alpha helix, the motif efficiently forms a hydrophobic binding surface.</p><p>The analogous FxxFF and WxxWW motifs were also significantly but more weakly associated with activation of Phe 9mers and Trp 9mers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). However, their strongest predictor of activation was the average position of acidic residues, with N-terminal skew highly favored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). Most dramatically, DDDFFFFFF activated 20-fold while its reverse sequence FFFFFFDDD activated just 1.3-fold. One role of N-terminal negative charge could be to neutralize the macroscopic dipole that arises from alpha helix backbone hydrogen bonds, stabilizing helical conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rocklin et al., 2017</xref>). Even though a helix is not necessary for composition-driven activation, this effect could reduce the entropic cost of binding to coactivators by promoting transient folding.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Activation domains are strongly inhibited by nearby clusters of hydrophobic residues</title><p>Despite the importance of hydrophobic residues for activation, PADDLE also predicted that some TFs contained cADs whose activation was inhibited by nearby clusters of hydrophobic residues. We confirmed this experimentally for Rds1, in which residues 239–263 alone activated 6.8-fold but extending the sequence by eight aa, five of them hydrophobic, abolished activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). Inhibition by hydrophobic residues also explains the weak activation of some scrambled 53-aa ADs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>).</p><p>To systematically quantify inhibition, we measured the effect on activation when the Pdr1 cAD was placed next to a library of 2177 random 20-aa sequences chosen to span a wide range of net charge and hydrophobic content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>). As expected, negative charge with moderate hydrophobicity bolstered activation. Positive charge without hydrophobicity inhibited activation, but even variable regions with +8 charge (+4 net charge) still activated an average of 4.4-fold. Therefore, the local clustering of negative charges near hydrophobic residues renders the Pdr1 cAD resistant to global changes in net charge, suggesting that interactions between opposite charges within the peptide do not fully prevent binding to coactivators. In contrast, hydrophobic residues at high density inhibited activation completely. This suggests that inhibitory hydrophobic clusters interact with hydrophobic residues in the cAD, completely preventing their interaction with coactivators. Consistent with two independent mechanisms of inhibition, basic and hydrophobic residues together reduced activation additively. In total, these experiments mapped the biochemical and structural properties that drive both activation and inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>The large majority of activation domains bind Mediator, and its recruitment is a key driver for activation</title><p>The surprising ability of simple biochemical features to explain a large and diverse set of ADs suggests that these features may also drive interactions with coactivator complexes.

Moreover, ADs that did not bind Med15 tended to activate weakly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>), so it is possible that many bind Med15 at levels below the detection limit of our pull-down assay, which was less sensitive than our activation assay (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Just as with activation, high acidic and hydrophobic content were associated with Med15 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1G</xref>). The Gln3 AD that did not require acidic residues also did not bind Med15 substantially (2.1-fold enrichment), suggesting that it activates through other mechanisms.</p><p>Most notably, activation strength and Med15 binding of tiles were directly proportional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). To test this relationship further, we measured Med15 binding of the set of AD mutants in which aromatic residues were systematically removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In every case, Med15 binding and activation were strongly correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), showing that the hydrophobic features that drive activation similarly underlie Med15 binding. Moreover, the ability for binding of a single protein in vitro to quantitatively explain activation in vivo suggests that Mediator recruitment is a key driver for gene activation and determined largely by AD binding to its Med15 subunit.</p><p>ADs can bind different coactivators, though the extent of such interaction is unknown. To explore the possibility, we also examined binding of TF tiles to TFIID, a key factor in the transcription of nearly all genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Warfield et al., 2017</xref>). Yeast TFIID contains three known AD-binding subunits, Taf4, Taf5, and Taf12, which form a subcomplex with Taf6 and Taf9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Layer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Wright et al., 2006</xref>). We isolated this TFIID subcomplex and confirmed its interaction with the VP16 AD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Pull-downs of the TF tiling library with the TFIID subcomplex enriched fragments up to 6.7-fold above random sequence controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1I–J</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). In total, 27 ADs (18%) across 26 TFs bound the TFIID subcomplex (p&lt;0.001), greatly expanding its repertoire of known interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–C</xref>). However, all ADs that bound TFIID also bound Med15, and despite the identical pull-down conditions, ADs bound more weakly to TFIID than to Med15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1K</xref>). While more TFIID interactions may be discoverable if assay sensitivity can be further optimized, these results suggest that TFIID has lower affinity for most ADs and provide no evidence for its specific targeting as a coactivator. Since TFIID binding by ADs is redundant and less frequent, its role in most TF-directed activation is secondary to that of Mediator.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Med15 uses a shape-agnostic, fuzzy interface to bind diverse activation domain sequences</title><p>What structural features of Med15 enable its promiscuous yet functional interaction with diverse AD sequences?

First, KIX domain residues previously shown by NMR to be important for interacting with the Pdr1 AD were recapitulated by the best-scoring model of this interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Thakur et al., 2008</xref>). Second, the degree of alpha helix formation across the 28 cADs was consistent with the effect of proline insertion on in vivo activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). As expected, cADs that were inhibited by proline predominantly bound both domains as an alpha helix, and conversely cADs that bound both domains in disordered conformations were minimally affected by proline insertion. Some cADs that were minimally affected by proline insertion were modeled as alpha helical, possibly because disordered regions are underrepresented in protein structure databases on which Rosetta was trained.</p><p>A unifying feature of the interactions was the prominent role of hydrophobic contacts at the protein interface. Hydrophobicity-driven interactions between proteins often employ high shape complementarity to maximize interface area and minimize solvent-exposed area. However, the flat surface of the KIX domain was ineffective in burying hydrophobic cAD residues, which on average had as much surface area exposed to solvent as area contacting the KIX domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, top). For example, the best-scoring Pdr1 AD model used Ile and Leu residues along one helical face to contact the KIX domain, but this left Trp and Tyr residues on the opposite face exposed to solvent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The poor hydrophobic shape complementarity of the KIX domain was frequently mitigated by multiple salt bridges and cation-pi interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). ABD1, which formed fewer ionic interactions, engaged cADs through a larger surface formed by its contoured hydrophobic ridge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, bottom). Nevertheless, hydrophobic residues of most cADs were incompletely buried, with those residues showing greater than 20% of area exposed to solvent in over half of all structures. Thus, despite the central role of hydrophobic AD residues in activation and Med15 binding, hydrophobic shape complementarity is not an important feature of ABD-cAD interactions.</p><p>Consistent with weak constraints on the shape of the binding interface, all cADs bound in diverse poses. For example, the 10 best-scoring models of the War1 cAD bound the KIX domain with its helix axis at different orientations and with different helical faces presented toward the interaction surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). To quantify this diversity, we defined the unique binding poses of each ABD-cAD interaction by clustering similar structures based on cAD backbone root mean square distance (2 Å distance cutoff), and then counted the number of poses adopted by the 10 best-scoring models. The 10 best-scoring models of nearly every cAD, when interacting with either domain, adopted six or more distinct poses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). To ensure that this did not result from insufficient sampling, we generated tenfold more candidate models (500,000 total) for six cADs binding the KIX domain. For all six cADs, the 10 best-scoring models still adopted seven or more distinct poses, despite spanning a narrower range of Rosetta scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E–F</xref>). Disordered cADs, lacking helical content, adopted especially many distinct poses; also, poses were frequently sampled only once, suggesting that disordered cADs inhabit an extremely large conformational space that may reduce the entropic cost of binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1G–H</xref>). Altogether, these structures point to a shape-agnostic nature of Med15 ABD interaction surfaces and support the idea of a multi-pose, fuzzy mode of interaction.</p><p>To explore the consequence of fuzzy binding for amino acid sequence constraints, we took Leu, Phe, and Asp residues from models of all cADs and plotted their binding positions on the KIX and ABD1 interfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). As expected, the hydrophobic Leu and Phe residues occupied regions distinct from the negatively charged Asp residues. However, the Leu and Phe distributions were similar to each other: there was no binding pocket that selectively preferred one residue over the other, despite large differences in their size and shape. The diversity of AD sequences may thus be understood in terms of the fuzzy nature of the AD-ABD interaction, which only loosely constrains the characteristics of hydrophobic AD residues.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>The high valence of TF-Mediator interactions enables tunable, long-lived, yet dynamic binding</title><p>Pull-down experiments with individual ABDs showed no appreciable binding to any of nine ADs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>), consistent with the previous suggestion that multiple ABDs are required for strong binding to Med15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brzovic et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Tuttle et al., 2018</xref>).

To understand the advantages conferred by the high valence of TF-Mediator interactions, we studied the kinetics in vitro of the initial step of activation: TF-driven recruitment of Mediator to DNA. We performed these experiments with Gcn4, which forms homodimers and has an extended AD consisting of three cADs. We isolated budding yeast Mediator complex, coupled DNA containing a Gcn4 motif to a NeutrAvidin-coated surface, added Gcn4, and measured real-time binding of Mediator by surface plasmon resonance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Mediator bound to the Gcn4-DNA complex with an apparent dissociation constant of K<sub>D</sub> = 14 nM ± 2 nM and an interaction half-life of 2.7 ± 0.2 min. We repeated the experiment with DNA containing 2, 4, or 6 copies of the Gcn4 motif. Mediator bound the resulting Gcn4-DNA complexes with identical on-rates. Mediator was also recruited more efficiently, with more Mediator bound per mole of Gcn4 than on templates with only one motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The interaction half-life, however, increased with additional copies of the Gcn4 motif—up to 16 min when six motifs were present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–C</xref>). If all copies bound Mediator independently, then the half-life should be the same, regardless of the number of copies. The presence of additional, neighboring ADs retards dissociation by enabling recapture of Mediator released from one AD through binding to another. A slower dissociation rate corresponds to an increase in apparent affinity constant.</p><p>Conversely, we found that the multiplicity of ABDs in Mediator facilitated binding of Gcn4 ADs. When the surface plasmon resonance experiment was repeated with large excess Gcn4 in solution, there was almost no change in the measured on-rate. Even 160-fold excess of Gcn4 had only minimal effect on the rate of Mediator binding and final level achieved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1E</xref>). To maintain stable TF-DNA complexes without TFs in solution, we repeated these experiments using a fusion of the Gcn4 AD to nuclease deficient EcoRI(E111Q), which resides on DNA for many hours and also forms homodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Wright et al., 1989</xref>). Still, Mediator with no Gcn4 competitor or with 250-fold excess of Gcn4 competitor bound similarly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Excess competitor Gcn4-DNA complexes also failed to slow Mediator binding to the surface. Evidently, binding of Gcn4 to Mediator does not appreciably block binding of other Gcn4 molecules. This behavior may be explained by the occurrence of multiple Gcn4-binding sites on Mediator and weak interaction of a cAD with any one site. Rapid association-dissociation equilibrium of a cAD allows a second Gcn4 molecule to interact with Gcn4-bound Mediator, increasing the frequency of exchange of one Gcn4 molecule by another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Such facilitated exchange provides a rationale for both the fuzzy nature of the AD-ABD interaction and the multiplicity of ABDs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Activation domains are present in all major coactivator complexes</title><p>PADDLE predictions and previous experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Liu and Myers, 2015</xref>) identified two strong ADs in the Med2 subunit of Mediator, which is adjacent to Med15 in the Mediator complex, suggesting a broader role for ADs beyond TF proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1F</xref>).

These complexes contained 2.9-fold more activating fragments than expected by chance (p&lt;10<sup>−12</sup> compared to randomly shuffled controls), suggesting a functional role. Domains that activate on their own could be inactive in their natural context if buried within a protein or protein complex. To investigate this possibility, we cross-referenced coactivator ADs with all available structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and with the Database of Disordered Protein Predictions (D2P2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Berman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Oates et al., 2013</xref>). In fact, 23 ADs were predicted in D2P2 to be highly disordered (more than 30%) or were predominantly disordered or unresolved in PDB structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>), and so may be exposed and active in vivo. For example, cohesin, which binds Mediator and forms enhancer-promoter contacts through loop extrusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Davidson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kagey et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sanborn et al., 2015</xref>), contained strong and likely-disordered ADs in its subunits Scc1 (RAD21 homolog), Scc3 (STAG1/2 homolog), and Smc3, as well as multiple ADs on the meiotic-specific subunit Rec8. These cohesin ADs, as well as ADs within other coactivators, may play a role in gene regulation by driving interactions with Mediator.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Although activation domains (ADs) have been studied for over three decades, their locations in TFs and mechanisms of activation have remained enigmatic. Combining quantitative, high-throughput experiments and computational modeling, we determined the biophysical principles underlying activation by acidic ADs. We trained a neural network to predict ADs in yeast and humans, which led to the discovery of new ADs and activation mechanisms. While an amphipathic helix can enhance activation, most ADs simply activate through an abundance of clustered acidic and bulky hydrophobic residues. ADs bind the hydrophobic and basic surface of Med15 activator-binding domains (ABDs) through a fuzzy interface. The low shape complementarity of this interaction only weakly constrains AD sequences, explaining their high diversity. We show that the dynamic nature of transcriptional signaling arises from the fuzzy and multivalent nature of TF-Mediator interactions. Finally, an expanded role for ADs is suggested by our finding that ADs are present in all major coactivator complexes.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Quantitative, high-throughput measurements of activation enabled prediction of new ADs and revealed the principles underlying acidic activation</title><p>We obtained high-throughput measurements of activation strength that were both quantitative and precise. This enabled us to detect—and predict with PADDLE—how activation strength depends on amino acid sequence, amino acid composition, and valence. Quantitation was achieved by inducing artificial TF (aTF) binding for a brief, defined period so that GFP levels were representative of transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">McIsaac et al., 2013</xref>), and by partitioning the range of GFP signal into eight levels for sorting. Others have measured activation only as an on-off binary system or screened for non-quantitative measures of activation, such as cell survival or pull-down of a cell surface marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arnold et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ravarani et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Tycko et al., 2020</xref>). We achieved high precision by restricting measurements to cells with a defined level of aTF expression. Controlling for this frequently overlooked confounding variable was critical because activation was strongly dependent on aTF abundance, especially at low levels of expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Another approach is to account for TF expression by sorting based on the GFP reporter signal divided by aTF expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Staller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Staller et al., 2021</xref>); this introduces substantial variability, because activation has a non-linear relationship with aTF expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>), and because this ratio can be systematically biased by features that affect aTF expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). This may be why it has been concluded that acidic residues are not necessary for Gcn4 activation, whereas using a similar reporter system we found definitive evidence to the contrary.</p><p>By this approach, we found that all ADs in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> employ a shared acidic and hydrophobic basis and trained a neural network termed PADDLE to predict sequences that activate on this basis. PADDLE predicted ADs in human TFs with 92% accuracy, indicative of broad conservation of the acidic activation mechanism, and identified hundreds of new ADs in human TFs and virus proteins. PADDLE could further be used to interpret the functional impact of cancer-associated and naturally occurring mutations in human ADs. Predicted ADs from multiple species and instructions for running PADDLE are available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://paddle.stanford.edu">paddle.stanford.edu</ext-link>.</p><p>During our development of PADDLE, a predictor of yeast activation named 'ADpred'’ was published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Erijman et al., 2020b</xref>). ADpred, a shallow neural network trained on random protein sequences, achieved a prediction accuracy of 93% on random sequences. However, its accuracy on wild-type sequences was much lower: only 33% of ADs predicted by ADpred activated in our experiments, and 29% of the ADs we identified were not predicted by ADpred, only 3.1-fold and 2.3-fold better than random predictions, respectively (alternatively, tile-wise AUPRC of 0.294; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1J–K</xref>, Materials and methods). This discrepancy may be because the random sequences on which ADpred was trained do not sufficiently represent the vastly larger space of actual protein sequences; for example, random sequences rarely form significant secondary structure. This failure to generalize highlights the importance of matching neural network training data to the prediction task and underscores the advantage of experiments on wild-type and related mutant sequences.</p><p>PADDLE predictions were also crucial for generating, refining, and testing hypotheses for activation mechanisms. For example, we unexpectedly discovered that hydrophobic residues could inhibit activation by noticing that sub-domains of certain non-activating regions were predicted to activate on their own. More generally, predictions on AD subsequences identified the core domains responsible for activation at single-amino acid resolution, focusing subsequent experiments on these domains. By combining a high-throughput assay to measure and a machine learning algorithm to predict activity of protein sequences, we have demonstrated a design-build-test-learn cycle that could be applied to accelerate discovery of protein function in other areas of research.</p><p>This approach yielded the most detailed view to date of the principles governing acidic AD sequence, which we summarize as follows. Activation arises from an abundance of acidic and bulky hydrophobic residues, especially Asp, Trp, Phe, and Leu. The most potent activators cluster these residues densely, forming short core ADs. In most ADs, and especially with high hydrophobic content or abundant Phe and Trp residues, this clustering is sufficient to activate in a composition-driven manner, regardless of sequence or secondary structure. ADs with lower hydrophobic content, particularly those with many Leu residues, instead must position their hydrophobic residues along one face of an alpha helix to activate. Overall, the loose constraints on sequence explain the remarkable diversity and lack of evolutionary conservation of ADs.</p><p>The unusual plasticity in AD sequence has several advantages. It facilitates spontaneous evolution of new ADs, since an appreciable proportion of even random sequences can activate. This flexibility would allow organisms to develop new transcriptional circuits responsive to their unique needs. Furthermore, in contrast to classical interactions in which structure and function are dependent on a few key residues, activation strength can be adjusted gradually by mutation. Indeed, the observation that nearly all core ADs could increase their strength with simple mutations demonstrates that proper regulation requires precisely adjusted rather than maximized activation. Similarly, AD sequences can preserve their activity while evolving other features, such as in the Gal4 C-terminal AD, whose sequence is specifically bound and inhibited by Gal80 in the absence of galactose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Johnston et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ma and Ptashne, 1987</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>ADs bind Mediator using a shape-agnostic fuzzy interaction, which explains the heterogeneity of AD sequences and enables facilitated exchange of bound molecules</title><p>With the use of mRNA display, we found that 73% of ADs bound the Med15 subunit of Mediator and that binding strength was strongly predictive of activation for thousands of wild-type and mutant protein sequences. In contrast, a five-protein TFIID subcomplex bound only 18% of ADs, all of which also bound Mediator. We conclude that Mediator recruitment by TFs is a key driver for gene activation, and Mediator recruitment is largely determined by affinity of ADs for the Med15 subunit. These findings are in keeping with reports that Mediator recruitment occurs independently of other coactivators and can stimulate the recruitment of other coactivators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ansari and Morse, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ansari et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Govind et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>How is Med15, through its four activator-binding domains (ABDs), able to interact with such a large diversity of AD sequences? Despite the importance of hydrophobic interactions, our structural modeling showed that neither the Med15 KIX domain nor ABD1 provided enough shape complementarity to bury the hydrophobic residues of cADs. Consistent with this, most cADs did not need to form an alpha helix to activate. The lack of shape constraint has two important consequences. First, all modeled cADs bound each ABD in many distinct, equally favored poses. We therefore suggest that fuzzy binding to Med15, previously demonstrated for the Gcn4 AD, is employed by all ADs. Second, neither ABD showed favored binding positions of Leu versus Phe residues of the cAD, suggesting that the shapes of those residues were unimportant. Thus, the loose constraints on binding shape explain the loose constraints on AD sequence. Instead, each ABD can be approximated as a hydrophobic surface, which engages hydrophobic AD residues through simple hydrophobic forces, flanked by basic residues, which form salt bridges and cation-pi interactions with acidic and aromatic AD residues. Clusters of hydrophobic residues adjacent to ADs inhibit activation, presumably because they compete for interaction with hydrophobic AD residues.</p><p>Many experiments have shown that transcriptional initiation involves a cycle in which (1) TFs recruit Mediator to enhancers or upstream activating sites, (2) Mediator contacts the promoter and orchestrates a series of events starting with chromatin rearrangement, followed by pre-initiation complex formation and finally RNA polymerase II recruitment, and (3) Mediator facilitates phosphorylation of the polymerase C-terminal domain, which releases polymerase into transcriptional elongation and triggers dissociation of Mediator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jeronimo and Robert, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Knoll et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Robinson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Whyte et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Wong et al., 2014</xref>). Mediator release is apparently necessary because stably recruiting Mediator by fusing individual subunits to a DNA-binding domain failed to activate in nearly all subunits tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). The cycling of Mediator complexes increases the responsiveness of transcriptional regulation in at least two ways. First, it requires certain steps to be repeated in order to continue initiating transcription, preventing the system from locking into an activated state. Second, it frees Mediator complexes to participate in regulation of other genes, which all depend upon and compete for a relatively limited supply of Mediator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Flanagan et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gill and Ptashne, 1988</xref>). Thus, TFs must recruit Mediator in a manner that is specific and high-affinity but still dynamic.</p><p>Our kinetic experiments showed that Mediator binds Gcn4-DNA complexes with high affinity but that excess Gcn4 does not impede this interaction, showing that interacting Mediator and Gcn4 molecules can exchange rapidly. If a bimolecular interaction occurs through a single site, a competing molecule cannot bind until the first molecule dissociates which, in a case of high affinity interaction, is a slow process. Our observations are indicative of facilitated exchange, arising from the multiple sites and fuzzy nature of the Gcn4-Mediator interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Fuzzy interactions allow for rapid association and dissociation, because a high proportion of random encounters lead to weak but productive binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ferreira et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sugase et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Tompa and Fuxreiter, 2008</xref>). One among multiple binding sites will frequently be available for a second molecule, which can invade and facilitate release of the first. Similarly, accelerated dissociation or exchange of the <italic>E. coli</italic> sequence-flexible DNA-binding protein Fis in the presence of competitor proteins was proposed to occur by transitioning through a destabilizing Fis-DNA-Fis ternary complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Graham et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kamar et al., 2017</xref>). These advantageous kinetics provide a rationale for the prevalence of multivalent fuzzy interactions among transcription proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Coactivator complexes contain ADs that may drive cross-interaction</title><p>ADs have primarily been characterized in TFs where they serve to recruit coactivators such as Mediator, TFIID, SAGA, SWI/SNF, and NuA4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hahn and Young, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mitchell and Tjian, 1989</xref>). Our finding that functional ADs are also present in all coactivator complexes suggests that ADs have broader roles. First, coactivator ADs could interact with ABDs within the same complex, limiting their weak or non-specific binding to TFs. These auto-inhibited coactivators could still bind to ADs clustered on DNA through facilitated exchange. For example, we found that two cADs activated more efficiently and two DNA-bound Gcn4 dimers recruited Mediator more efficiently in tandem than individually. Second, coactivator ADs could amplify activation by mediating interactions between coactivators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ansari and Morse, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Liu and Myers, 2015</xref>). For example, upon Mediator binding to TFs, the two ADs on Med2 would be liberated from auto-inhibition and could recruit other coactivators. Alternatively, Mediator and other coactivators could cluster in the nucleoplasm through AD-ABD cross interactions and bind together to promoters. Either mode of interaction would explain why recruitment of the Med2/Med3/Med15 subcomplex suffices to recruit SWI/SNF to the <italic>CHA1</italic> promoter and suffices for activation of the <italic>ARG1</italic> gene, while deletion of both Med2 ADs impairs transcription of galactose-inducible genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ansari et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Liu and Myers, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Phase separation of Mediator and TFs has recently been demonstrated in vitro and is proposed to underlie enhancer-promoter clustering and transcriptional activation in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boija et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sabari et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Shrinivas et al., 2019</xref>). Phase separation may occur when a protein makes dynamic self-interactions through two or more binding domains, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Banani et al., 2016</xref>). Interactions between the four Med15 ABDs and the two Med2 ADs make possible phase separation of the Mediator tail subcomplex; other coactivators, with both ADs and ABDs, might phase separate as well. The functional role of such phase separation, if it occurs, is unclear. A parsimonious interpretation suggests that phase separation of coactivators and TFs is simply a macroscopic consequence of the high valence and dynamism of coactivator-TF interactions, features which may serve an altogether different purpose.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Solving the enigma of AD structure and function</title><p>ADs have long been enigmatic, due to the apparent mismatch of their structure and function: AD sequences are abundant among random polypeptides, and yet ADs bind their targets with high specificity; AD peptides are apparently disordered, and yet they bind with high affinity. We now understand that these structural features of ADs are ideally suited to their functions—they render AD-target interaction dynamic, through rapid yet weak binding to single sites and strong binding yet rapid displacement from multiple sites. Dynamic AD-target interaction may serve various purposes, such as a rapid response to changing conditions, and the recruitment of multiple AD-bearing proteins to a single target. For example, Mediator bound to RNA polymerase II at a promoter might interact transiently with TFIID, SAGA, SWI/SNF complex and other proteins during transcription. This mechanism may be employed with other unstructured sequences and high valence targets in other cellular processes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>S. cerevisiae)</italic></td><td>BY4711</td><td>ATCC</td><td>200873</td><td><italic>MATalpha trp1delta63</italic></td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (human)</td><td>HEK293T</td><td>ATCC</td><td>CRL-3216</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td>Oligo pool libraries</td><td>Twist Bioscience</td><td>Custom synthesis</td><td>Sequences provided in source data files</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pMVS142-pACT1-mCherry-Zif268-EBD-MCS-KAN</td><td>Addgene</td><td>99049</td><td>Barak Cohen</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pMVS102-P3-GFP-NATMX6</td><td>Addgene</td><td>99048</td><td>Barak Cohen</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Fetal bovine serum</td><td>Millipore</td><td>TMS-031-B</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td>XL10 Gold Ultracompetent Cells</td><td>Agilent</td><td>200315</td><td>For cloning</td></tr><tr><td>Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td>Phusion polymerase</td><td>New England Biolabs</td><td>M0531L</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>AMPure XP beads</td><td>Beckman Coulter</td><td>A63880</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pFN26A BIND plasmid</td><td>Promega</td><td>E1380</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pGL4.35 plasmid</td><td>Promega</td><td>E1370</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>Dual-Glo Luciferase assay</td><td>Promega</td><td>E2920</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pBirAcm</td><td>Avidity</td><td>AVB99</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td>BL21 Star (DE3) competent cells</td><td>ThermoFisher</td><td>C601003</td><td>For protein expression</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>Ni-NTA Suerflow resin</td><td>Qiagen</td><td>30410</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pFASTBac1 plasmid</td><td>ThermoFisher</td><td>10360014</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>MEGAscript T7 transcription kit</td><td>ThermoFisher</td><td>AM1333</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td>T4 DNA ligase</td><td>New England Biolabs</td><td>M0202S</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Amicon Ultracel 0.5 mL 30K MWCO column</td><td>Millipore Sigma</td><td>UFC503024</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>Model 422 Electro-Eluter</td><td>Bio Rad</td><td>1652976</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>Retic Lysate IVT Kit</td><td>ThermoFisher</td><td>AM1200</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td>PF30P oligo</td><td>IDT</td><td>Custom synthesis</td><td>/5Phos/AA AAA AAA AAA AAA AAA AAA A/iSp9//iSp9//iSp9/AC C/3Puro/</td></tr><tr><td>Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td>SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase</td><td>ThermoFisher</td><td>18064014</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin T1</td><td>ThermoFisher</td><td>65602</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td>Salmon Sperm DNA</td><td>ThermoFisher</td><td>15632011</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td>BSA</td><td>New England Biolabs</td><td>B9000S</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>PADDLE</td><td>This paper</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://github.com/asanborn/PADDLE">github.com/asanborn/PADDLE</ext-link></td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Resource availability</title><p>Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the Lead Contact, Roger Kornberg (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://kornberg@stanford.edu">kornberg@stanford.edu</ext-link>).

Cells were then pelleted and washed once in FACS buffer (PBS, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1% BSA; sterile filtered), and finally suspended in FACS buffer at roughly 40 million cells/mL.</p><p>Cells were analyzed and sorted on a BD Influx Cell Sorter at the Stanford Shared FACS Facility. Cells from different sub-libraries were pooled just prior to sorting. The 10–15% largest cells were excluded from sorting, and then an additional filter was applied to limit mCherry signal to within a twofold range. For the remaining cells, the full range of GFP signal was divided into eight evenly spaced bins in log scale; cells were first sorted into the four low bins and then sorted into the four high bins. In total, 2.85 million cells and 2.65 million cells were sorted for the first and second libraries, respectively.</p><p>To define the background GFP signal, cells containing the negative control plasmid were also induced with 10 nM beta-estradiol and their distribution across the eight GFP bins defined above was measured. We found that these cells had slightly increased levels of GFP signal relative to untransformed cells, potentially because binding of the aTF alone slightly opens up chromatin around the GFP promoter. Cells expressing just one plasmid containing the VP16, Gcn4, or Pho4 AD were also individually analyzed (by similarly measuring their distribution across same eight GFP bins) and compared to results obtained for identical sequences in the pooled activation screen.</p><p>Cells sorted into each of the 8 GFP bins and a sample of total input cells (nine samples total) were grown overnight and then pelleted. Pellets were treated with lyticase and then plasmid DNA was extracted using a Qiagen Miniprep kit. The region of the plasmid encoding the variable protein fragment was PCR-amplified for 11–20 cycles (based on the OD600 of the culture) using Phusion polymerase with PCR primers that added flanking sequences corresponding to the standard Illumina sequencing primers. After a column cleanup, a second PCR was performed with primers that added sample-specific barcodes and the P5 and P7 sequences for Illumina sequencing. This second PCR product was SPRI size-selected using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) at 1x dilution, and the different samples were pooled for paired-end sequencing on the Illumina NextSeq 550. Roughly 2 million reads of 2 × 76 bp length were sequenced per sample.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Activation assay in human cells</title><p>The pFN26A BIND plasmid (Promega), which contains a Renilla luciferase gene used for normalization, was used to express domains of interest fused to a GAL4 DBD. Genes expressing 50 randomly chosen putative human ADs predicted by PADDLE were synthesized in a single oPool (IDT) with Gibson homology arms, amplified using Phusion polymerase, and cloned into pFN26A BIND (digested with AsiSI and PmeI) using Gibson assembly. The product was transformed into Agilent XL10 Gold cells, and then plated onto LB Carb plates. Forty-three colonies were picked, which yielded clones of 25 correct unique ADs. In addition, plasmids expressing a VP16 AD-positive control or three random protein sequences for negative controls were individually cloned in the same manner.</p><p>HEK293T cells were plated at 24,000 cells per well of a 96-well plate. The next day, cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 3000 with 50 ng of cloned pFN26A BIND plasmid and 50 ng of pGL4.35 (Promega), which contains a Firefly luciferase reporter gene under the control of a minimal promoter driven by nine upstream GAL4 DNA-binding sites. Each plasmid was transfected into triplicate wells. Seventy-two hours after transfection, luminescence from renilla and firefly luciferases were measured using the Dual-Glo Luciferase assay system (Promega) on a BioTek Synergy two plate reader. Measured activity of each predicted AD or control sequence was computed by dividing the Firefly luciferase signal by the Renilla signal and then averaging the triplicate values. Fold-activation was computed by dividing the activity of each predicted AD by the mean activity of the three negative controls, Z-scores were computed based on log-scale fold-activation by standardizing the negative controls to mean of 0 and variance of 1, and p-values were computed with one tailed Z-tests.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Cloning and purification of proteins</title><sec id="s4-7-1"><title>Med15</title><p><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Med15 contains four ABDs: KIX (residues 6–91), ABD1 (residues 158–238), ABD2 (residues 277–368), and ABD3 (residues 484–651) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Herbig et al., 2010</xref>).

Specifically, sub-library pools were PCR-amplified using primers that added an upstream T7 promoter sequence and a downstream linker and HA-tag but no stop codon. Thus, all encoded peptides were of the form MSGT[variable protein sequence]TSVGGSGSYPYDVPDYA and fused to mRNA at the C-terminus. In addition to the two sub-libraries, similar DNA sequences encoding positive control ADs from VP16, Gcn4, and Pho4 and three negative control random protein sequences were synthesized as gBlocks (IDT) (containing an upstream T7 promoter sequence and a downstream linker and HA-tag but no stop codon).</p><p>All subsequent work was performed in RNase-free conditions. mRNA was in vitro transcribed for 4 hr at 37°C using the MEGAscript T7 transcription kit (Thermo) and purified with RNeasy mini columns (Qiagen). The PF30P oligo containing a poly-A sequence, spacers, and puromycin was synthesized by IDT and ligated to the 3’ end of the mRNA using Moore-sharp splinted ligation by T4 DNA ligase. The ligation product was desalted by three rounds of concentrating in 0.5 mL Amicon Ultracel 30K MWCO columns and diluting in water. The desalted product was run on a denaturing 4% polyacrylamide gel with 7 M urea. The band corresponding to full-length ligated mRNA was excised from the gel and recovered using the Model 422 Electro-Eluter with 3500 MWCO caps (Bio Rad). After concentrating and desalting in the same manner, the ligated and purified mRNA was used in an in vitro translation reaction using the Retic Lysate IVT kit (Thermo) for 60 min at 30°C. MgCl<sub>2</sub> and KCl were added to final concentrations of 60 mM and 500 mM, respectively, and the sample was incubated for 15 min at room temperature to encourage puromycin fusion.

Second, to estimate the number of cells sorted into each of the 8 GFP bins that expressed a given protein fragment <italic>F</italic>, the total number of cells sorted into each bin was multiplied by the fraction of sequencing reads for that bin that mapped to <italic>F</italic>. Any fragment represented by fewer than 10 cells were excluded from further analysis. Third, the average GFP signal of cells expressing <italic>F</italic> was calculated as a weighted average from the average GFP signal observed in each bin during sorting weighted by the distribution of the number of cells expressing <italic>F</italic> across the eight bins. Because GFP distributions cells expressing single AD sequences were normally distributed in FACS data when GFP signal (arbitrary units) was plotted in log-scale, all averages of GFP distributions were calculated in log-scale (equivalently, a geometric mean of GFP values). The standard deviation of GFP signal of cells expressing <italic>F</italic> was similarly calculated in log-scale and used as a metric for measurement precision. All averages involving activation reported in the paper are calculated in log-scale (equivalently, a geometric mean). Fourth, the fold-activation of <italic>F</italic> was calculated as the mean GFP signal of <italic>F</italic> divided by the mean GFP signal of negative control cells (see below). Z-scores were calculated by standardizing the GFP signal of negative control cells to mean 0 and variance one in log scale and p-values were calculated with one tailed Z-tests.</p><p>The mean and standard deviation GFP signal of negative control cells was defined in one of two ways. In the experiment with sub-libraries A and B, a sample of estrogen-induced cells containing only the empty pRS414-TFchassis plasmid was assayed under identical conditions and the mean and standard deviation GFP signal was computed from FACS data. In the experiment with sub-libraries D and E, these values were instead determined internally from the 50 random sequence negative controls in the pooled library. Since a small fraction of random sequences activate, outlier sequences were iteratively excluded if they had GFP signal greater than three standard deviations away from the mean, resulting in three sequences excluded from each sub-library. Then mean and standard deviation were computed from the sum of the negative control GFP distributions.</p><p>In activation assays with sub-libraries D and E, we noticed that many sequencing reads that were mapped with a small number of errors corresponded to fragments with a very large GFP standard deviation. Upon closer examination of sequencing reads of example fragments, the same sequencing errors were consistently found, which likely corresponded to mutations that occurred in vivo that affected function of the protein fragment (e.g. inactivation of a strong AD by a frameshift mutation). We therefore used only reads that aligned perfectly for this experiment. Furthermore, fragments with GFP standard deviation greater than 4.5 were excluded from further analysis.</p><p>The following three metrics were tracked: the number of total unique fragments, number of fragments observed in at least one of the eight GFP bins, and number of fragments that passed filtering. For the activation assay with sub-libraries A and B, this was (7637, 7604, 7549) for sub-library A and (2900, 2833, 2813) for sub-library B. The same metrics for the activation assay with sub-libraries D and E was (7733, 7716, 7345) for sub-library D and (4261, 4261, 4252) for sub-library E.

ADs were defined for all intervals of the protein that had a mean positional Z-score (MPZ) greater than 3.5. Starting with intervals that had the highest maximal MPZ score, the start and stop positions of the AD were defined by the full width half maximum; that is, the positions in the protein at which the MPZ fell below half of the maximal MPZ value in that interval. If the AD defined in this manner includes a new region with an MPZ score higher than the original maximal value, this indicated that the MPZ peak was only small relative to nearby peaks, so the AD was then excluded.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Activation data analysis</title><p>We compared our ADs with the Induction Dynamics gene Expression Atlas (IDEA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hackett et al., 2020</xref>), which induced expression of every TF individually and measured ‘v_inter’ parameters that describe the resulting fold-change in the expression of all target genes.

Because the goal was to quantify the total content of hydrophobic residues rather than the net hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity, hydrophobic content of a peptide is computed as the sum of the scores of only the hydrophobic residues (i.e. those with negative ∆G).

ADs predicted by ADpred were defined using the authors’ criteria, namely sites with five or more contiguous residues with a score &gt;= 0.8. An ADpred-predicted region was considered correct if it overlapped by at least five aa with a significantly activating tile (p&lt;0.0001). With this approach, ADpred achieved a precision and recall of 0.366 and 0.692 in predicting experimental ADs, respectively. When ADpred-predicted regions were randomly shuffled 100 times to different proteins and positions, the average precision and recall of these shuffled predictions were 0.120 and 0.295 respectively. Alternatively, to compare ADpred predictions directly to our experimental measurements of activation, a representative ADpred score for each 53-aa TF tile in our library was calculated by taking the 80th percentile of ADpred scores of 30-aa tiles contained within the 53-aa tile.

Fragments with fewer than 30 reads in the input sample or fewer than five reads in the bound sample were excluded from downstream analysis. Baseline binding was defined using the 50 random protein control sequences in each library, except the sequences that were outliers in the activation assay were excluded. Specifically, random control outliers were iteratively removed if their activation was more than three standard deviations away from the mean (in log scale), resulting in the exclusion of random control #2, 12, 16, 38 from sub-library A and #17, 18, 21, 22, 31, 43 from sub-library B. Binding enrichment of each fragment was then computed as the fractional pull-down of the fragment divided by the mean fractional pull-down (in log scale) of the random controls. Because fractional pull-down and enrichment were normally distributed in log-scale, all averages involving pull-down or enrichment reported in the paper are calculated in log-scale (equivalently, a geometric mean). Z-scores were computed by standardizing the binding enrichment of random controls to mean 0 and variance one in log-scale and P-values were calculated with one tailed Z-tests. Triplicate measurements for Med15 pull-downs and duplicate measurements for TFIID subcomplex pull-downs were combined by averaging the binding enrichment values. A small number of highly positively-charged fragments bound in Med15 pull-downs when the mRNA display library was purified on a sucrose gradient but did not bind when the sucrose gradient was omitted. Suspecting that this binding was artifactual, potentially through non-specific binding to mRNA tags, we excluded from analysis 92 fragments that bound with Z-score between −2.5 and 1 without the sucrose gradient and had a Z-score at least 3.5 higher with the sucrose gradient than without.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Overlap of ADs and Med15- and TFIID subcomplex-binding domains</title><p>Med15-binding domains were annotated in the same manner as ADs using a mean positional Z-score, but with a cutoff of 2.23.

Interaction types were computed with GetContacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Venkatakrishnan et al., 2019</xref>) and per-AA accessible surface areas were computed with FreeSASA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mitternacht, 2016</xref>). For each final docked structural model, buried peptide surface area was taken by subtracting the accessible surface area of the peptide in complex with the receptor from the accessible surface area of the peptide on its own. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, marked positions correspond to atom CG of Asp, atom CG of Leu, and the midpoint of the CG and CZ atoms in Phe (the center of the aromatic ring). Residues are shown from all the 10 best models from different clusters for all core AD structures if the marked position is within 3 Angstroms of the KIX domain or ABD1 structure.</p><p>Adapted FlexPepDock code, and wrapper code for GetContacts and FreeSASA are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/drorlab/med15">https://github.com/drorlab/med15</ext-link>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Ramon Lorenzo Labitigan, Peter Geiduschek, and members of the Kornberg lab for critical feedback and discussions; Ramon Lorenzo Labitigan for assistance with the manuscript and figures; Ralph Davis and Shigeki Nagai for providing purified Mediator; Barbara Davis for assistance with experiments; Namita Mitra and Zane Colaric for sequencing; Ricardo Zermeno and the Stanford Shared FACS Facility for cell sorting; the Weis lab for sharing tissue culture facilities; Rich Roberts and Terry Takahashi for advice on mRNA display; the Stanford Research Computing Center for providing computational resources and support; and Shantao Li, Haiwen Gui, Sarah Gurev, Avanti Shrikumar, and Christopher Yeh for help with machine learning.

important sequence composition and structural features of yeast transcriptional activation domains and the nature of their biochemical interactions with the Med15 subunit of the coactivator Mediator. It also presents biochemical findings supporting the notion that interactions of multiple activation domains of a transcription factor with a multiplicity of activator binding domains within Mediator cooperate to ensure stable recruitment of Mediator and efficient stimulation of transcription initiation.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Simple biochemical features underlie transcriptional activation domain diversity and dynamic, fuzzy binding to Mediator&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Revise the manuscript text or figures to address the following comments:</p><p>1. Text should be revised to eliminate overreaching statements claiming that all ADs or core ADs have been identified here, and that the principles governing the function of all ADs have been identified. Text and figures should also be modified to make it clear when conclusions are based on PADDLE predictions versus experimentally analyzed mutations of ADs. Several overreaching statements should be qualified regarding conclusions that recruitment of Mediator through Med15 is the predominant interaction between ADs and cofactors driving transcriptional activation in vivo, and that recruitment of TFIID is secondary at best. The relevant locations in text are as follows:</p><p>– line 64 and 120: Given that the tiling approach in Figure 1 identified only 75-85% of previously reported ADs, these are likely to be overstatements.</p><p>– Figures 3F-3G, and Figure S7B should be labeled to make it clear that the ADs being analyzed were predicted; and the text in lines 215-219 should be revised to make it clear that the mutations were generated in silico and their effects on activation predicted by PADDLE.</p><p>– lines 218-219 and line 222: This is an overstatement as many of the conclusions are based on predictions by PADDLE, and might not stand up to experimental testing. The words &quot;all&quot; and &quot;every&quot; should be replaced by &quot;many&quot;.</p><p>– 233-235: this is an overstatement as only 28 13-amino acid cADs were analyzed and only 19 of these appear to activate by the composition-driven mechanism.</p><p>– lines 250-252: Should be qualified to say that these features generally hold, as there are some grey areas in the results of Figure S4B, with some supposedly composition-driven cADs in which proline substitutions had significant effects, eg. War1 and Oaf3.</p><p>– lines 346-349: This seems like an overstatement as it is quite possible that other coactivators will contain subunits with ABD segments capable of the fuzzy interactions identified by Hahn and colleagues for the Med15 ABDs.</p><p>– lines 361-364: This is an overstatement, as there are certainly some TF tiles that bound TFIID and Med15 with similar affinity in Figure S4I-K. Also, these in vitro pulldown assays might not reflect recruitment in vivo or the extent to which TFIID vs. Mediator provides coactivator function at particular promoters.</p><p>2. Line 180-181: Was this true only for one AD, Arg81? Lines 231-232: Indicate the correlation coefficient and associated p-value for the plot in Figure S4A.</p><p>3. The definitive manner in which the authors state that they used 'all yeast TFs' (164) as their starting point requires explanation. Where do these come from? Who decided this was the complete list? The list of TFs used should be provided and its origin disclosed.</p><p>4. At the end of page 5, line 101-102, the authors allude to cells being assay per tile and 99 being 'seen' in at least 10 cells. This may require better explanation for the uninitiated. At least this reviewer found it difficult to comprehend what was meant.</p><p>5. In Figure 1D, please mark the positions of known (previously characterized) ADs.</p><p>6. In 1F, a large proportion of the TFs do not contain an AD. This requires a comment or proposed explanation.</p><p>7. The references to the Rosetta suite programs on page 26, line 373 is confusing. It should be moved to line 272 (after 'Rosetta Suite').</p><p>8. Lines 135-138. The description of the relative abilities of Asp and Glu to promote activation and the results in Figure 2 figure supplement 1D is a little confusing to me. Would it be appropriate to say that Asp is more strongly associated with activation by wild type tiles than Glu, rather than saying that Asp but not Glu is associated…? If not, the authors should comment further on their observation that in a fair number of cases ADs with Asp residues mutated with Glu exhibit reduced but still substantial activation activity.</p><p>9. Line 311. The authors should describe Med15 as the primary Mediator subunit targeted by &quot;many ADs,&quot; rather than implying that it is the primary subunit targeted by all. As shown in Figure 5C, while a remarkable 73% of ADs tested do bind MED15, there are still a significant number that don't.</p><p>10. Lines 386-388 and Figure 6, figure supplement 1B. The authors should comment on the group of cAD domains whose activities are minimally affected (&lt;3-fold) by PRO insertion but predicted by modeling to have a high percentage of residues in alpha helix when bound to KIX domain.</p><p>11. Line 991, legend to Figure 3, Supplement 1, panel A. I suspect the authors meant to refer to panel B, rather than C, for comparable PADDLE predictions.</p><p>12. Legend to Figure 6A. the legend refers to hydrophobic (yellow) and acidic (green) residues that form the AD-binding surfaces displayed. In the figure green residues are labeled as basic.</p><p>13. Consider revising the text to address the Recommendations to authors provided by each of the reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Text should be revised to eliminate overreaching statements claiming that all ADs or core ADs have been identified here, and that the principles governing the function of all ADs have been identified.

They initially tile 164 known yeast transcription factors to measure activation by 7460 protein segments, each 53 amino acids (aa), with a step size of 12-13 aa to measure their ability to activate transcription. This allows them to identify 150 ADs in 96 TAs, which are then characterized in different ways, again by HTP approaches, and used to train a deep learning computer model to predict the location and strength of acidic ADs in both yeast and humans. It does so with impressive precision. The authors also identify sequence and structural determinants for these domains, again using HTP. To more generally characterize the ability of these ADs to work with a general co-activator, the interaction with Mediator subunit 15 (Med15) is characterized, also by HTP methods. This results in the conclusion that Med15 is able to bind most ADs by making use of a shape-agnostic, fuzzy interface. Further mechanistic characterization results in a model for multivalent AD-Coactivator interaction, and for transcription activation in general.</p><p>The results are persuasive, and the conclusions supported by the findings. This is an important paper in the field.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This paper addresses the longstanding question of the nature of transcription activation domains. The authors combine high-throughput biochemical identification and characterization of activation domains present in all known yeast transcription factors with sophisticated structural modeling using neural networks to generate a predictor (referred to as PADDLE) of activation domains that they demonstrate can be applied to higher eukaryotes.

In so doing, they have defined common biochemical features of a large and important class of activation domains conserved from yeast to mammals and provide solutions to longstanding questions about activation domain structure and function. There are, however, transactivation domains that fall into other classes (e.g. glutamine-rich activation domains) and that may not have scored highly in their assay.

It would be interesting to know which features of PADDLE proved to be key to its predictive power (eg. percentage of acidic and bulky hydrophobic residues, secondary structure, disorder, other considerations). Which features of PADDLE make it superior to the authors' initial model that relied on activation domain composition of acidic and hydrophobic residues?
