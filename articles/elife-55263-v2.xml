The link between ELA and risk for psychopathology is well established but the developmental mechanisms remain unclear. Using a mouse model of resource insecurity, limited bedding (LB), we tested the effects of LB on the development of fear learning and neuronal structures involved in emotional regulation, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA). LB delayed the ability of peri-weanling (21 days old) mice to express, but not form, an auditory conditioned fear memory. LB accelerated the developmental emergence of parvalbumin (PV)-positive cells in the BLA and increased anatomical connections between PL and BLA. Fear expression in LB mice was rescued through optogenetic inactivation of PV-positive cells in the BLA. The current results provide a model of transiently blunted emotional reactivity in early development, with latent fear-associated memories emerging later in adolescence.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mouse</kwd><kwd>early life adversity</kwd><kwd>medial prefrontal cortex</kwd><kwd>amygdala</kwd><kwd>development</kwd><kwd>fear conditioning</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH115914</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bath</surname><given-names>Kevin G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH115049</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bath</surname><given-names>Kevin G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS105219</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Manzano Nieves</surname><given-names>Gabriela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Early life adversity (ELA) accelerated PV+ interneuron development in BLA and delayed the ability of pre-adolescent mice to express, but not form, an auditory conditioned fear memory in childhood.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Early life adversity (ELA) increases the lifetime risk for multiple forms of psychopathology, including anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agid et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Draijer and Langeland, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Heim and Nemeroff, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Koenen and Widom, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Widom, 1999</xref>). ELA is associated with higher rates of negative outcomes than similar events experienced in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Felitti et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Heim and Nemeroff, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McCauley et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mullen et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Salmon and Bryant, 2002</xref>). The increased lifetime risk for psychopathology is proposed to be the result of alterations in the developmental trajectories of brain centers regulating emotional learning and emotional expression. In agreement with this prediction, ELA has been shown to drive early engagement of the basolateral amygdala (BLA), a key node supporting emotional processing, threat assessment, and fear learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bath et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moriceau et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The neural circuit(s) supporting fear and aversive learning in adult rodents have been well characterized. Numerous studies have shown that the prelimbic (PL) subregion of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) projects to the BLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Do-Monte et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vertes, 2004</xref>) and is necessary for fear retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burgos-Robles et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Courtin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sierra-Mercado et al., 2011</xref>), whereas the infralimbic (IL) subregion of mPFC supports extinction learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adhikari et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Do-Monte et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sierra-Mercado et al., 2011</xref>). Over early development, PL projections into amygdala begin to emerge around postnatal day (PND) 7, increasing through adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cunningham et al., 2002</xref>), and being pruned back during early adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bouwmeester et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cressman et al., 2010</xref>). The relatively late integration of the PL into the threat learning circuit may explain recent reports suggesting that the infant PL, unlike adult PL, is not involved in the expression of sustained fear responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chan et al., 2011</xref>). Investigating the impact of ELA on the development of the fear circuit will allow us to simultaneously identify potential mechanisms promoting developmental changes in learned aversive behaviors and possible underlying changes that may contribute to ELA-associated effects on anxiety, depressive, and threat learning behavior.</p><p>Recently, a rodent model of resource insecurity, limited bedding and nesting (LB), was developed to simulate aspects of resource insecurity and altered parental care in human populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bolton et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rice et al., 2008</xref>). LB has been shown to induce significant distress in the dam, alter patterns of maternal behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bolton et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gallo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McLoyd, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rice et al., 2008</xref>), and delay developmental processes such as sexual maturation and physical growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Manzano Nieves et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yam et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, LB impacts behavioral outcomes with effects that persist into adulthood, increasing depressive-like behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Goodwill et al., 2019</xref>), altering behavioral response to stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cohen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Manzano-Nieves et al., 2018</xref>), and affecting hippocampal-dependent learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bath et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bath et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Manzano-Nieves et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). However, the effects of LB on the development of neuronal populations and regions supporting fear learning and expression are less well understood. In this study, we tested the impact of LB on the development of subregions of mPFC, BLA, projections from mPFC to BLA, as well as their effect on the acquisition and expression of fear learning across early development.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that LB delayed physical development in mice and altered developmental expression of fear learning. Specifically, LB resulted in decreased body weight and brain weight from infancy into pre-adolescence. Changes in physical development were accompanied by an increase in parvalbumin (PV)-positive cell density in the BLA of peri-weanling mice and sex-specific changes in mPFC to BLA anatomical connectivity during peri-adolescence. During the period of elevated PV-positive cell density, mice transiently failed to exhibit threat-associated freezing behavior, with expression of this learned fear re-emerging during the peri-adolescent and adolescent period. Furthermore, the diminished fear expression during the peri-weaning period could be rescued through optogenetic inactivation of PV-positive cells in the BLA. Based upon these results, an ELA-associated premature increase in PV-positive cells in BLA as associated with a transient decrease in the expression, but not acquisition of fear learning.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Early life adversity decreases physical growth</title><p>In humans, ELA is associated with changes in expected weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hult et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Maniam et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">RondÃ³ et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wainstock et al., 2013</xref>), with low weight in infancy predicting poorer cognitive outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Corbett and Drewett, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Strathearn et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, weight may serve as a biomarker for altered neurodevelopment and later risk for pathology. To model ELA in the form of resource insecurity, dams and pups were placed in conditions of low bedding and nesting materials (LB) from PND 4â11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bolton et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McLoyd, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rice et al., 2008</xref>). To assess the impact of LB on somatic and brain development, the body weight and brain weight of control (Ctrl) and LB reared mice was measured at select ages across early development (PND 16, 21, 28, and 35). We found that LB reared female mice weighed significantly less than control mice at PND 16, 21, and 28, with differences diminishing by PND 35 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> top), while LB reared males weighed significantly less than control male mice at PND 21 and 28 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> bottom). Examination of brain weight in females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> top) revealed a significant decrease in brain weight at PND 21, 28 and 35. LB males had decreased brain weight when compared to control males at PND 16, 21, and 28, with differences resolved by PND 35 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> bottom). We predicted that ELA may shift resources away from somatic development to spare brain development. To test this prediction, the brain-to-body weight ratio was calculated across developmental time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). LB reared female mice had a higher brain-to-body weight ratio than female control mice at PND 16, 21 and 28, while LB males had an increased brain-to-body ratio at PND 21 and 28. Thus LB effects on brain and total body weight were not proportional, with a greater impact on the development of the body at select developmental time points.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Limited bedding (LB) resources early in life, altered somatic and brain development.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Timeline of resource restriction manipulation (PND 4â11) and description of developmental time points tested.

The age (in days) at which each separate cohort of mice underwent each stage of auditory fear learning is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. To dissociate cue-memory from context-memory, mice were habituated to two contexts (context A and B) for 5 min per context for 2Â consecutive days. Mice were then conditioned to six tones (75 dB, 30 s) that each co-terminated with a foot-shock (0.57 mA, 1 s) in context A and tested for memory recall 24 hr post-conditioning in context B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In control mice, we observed a significant developmental increase in freezing behavior from PND 19 to PND 22. However, in LB reared mice, we found significantly lower levels of freezing compared to control mice during cue recall at PND 22, but not at later developmental time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), indicating a possible delay in cue-associated fear learning in LB mice. Further, a significant decrease in freezing to the conditioning tones was observed in LB males at PND 21 and in LB females at PND 28. To determine if differences in recall at PND 22 were the result of diminished learning at PND 21, conditioning curves of control and LB mice were matched for levels of freezing during acquisition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Matching was conducted by mixing male and female data, and systematically removing individual animal data from the analysis until LB and Ctrl conditioning curves at PND 21 were overlapping and not significantly different. The results showed that deficits in fear expression could not be solely explained by differences in freezing observed during conditioning. To determine if the lower levels of freezing in LB mice at PND 22 were the result of deficits in acquisition, consolidation, or recall; separate cohorts of male and female mice were conditioned at PND 21 and tested at either 1 hr (pre-consolidation), 6 hr (post-consolidation), 24 hr (short-term recall), or 7 days (long-term recall) post conditioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). At 1 hr, there was a small but significant decrease in freezing observed in LB reared mice compared to controls. At 6 hr, no differences in levels of freezing were detected between LB and control reared mice, indicating that LB mice could freeze to the cue and appeared to have consolidated the fear memory. By 24 hr, LB mice showed significantly lower freezing compared to control mice, suggestive of deficits in fear memory. Interestingly, at 7 days post conditioning, LB freezing levels did not differ from control levels. In aggregate, initial learning was intact but freezing to the conditioned tones was transiently impaired 24 hr post conditioning. Together the results suggest that LB reared mice form a cue-associated fear memory at PND 21 but are not able to behaviorally express this memory during early development. However, with time, behavioral expression of fear, in the form of freezing, re-emerges. Follow-up analysis on sex differences were performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) showing that both LB males and LB females showed the decrease in freezing 24 hr post condition followed by an increase in freezing 7 days post conditioning. A significant decrease in freezing was observed 1 hr post conditioning in control females when compared to control males. A battery of tests were conducted in males and females to ensure that effects of fear expression were not due to differences in anxiety-like behavior (light/dark box test: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>; elevated plus maze: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>), locomotion (open field test: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3</xref>), or foot-shock sensitivity and reactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3âfigure supplement 4</xref>).

PV-positive interneurons are known to begin differentiating between PND 10â28, reaching a mature phenotype at approximately PND 30 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berdel and MoryÅ, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">DÃ¡vila et al., 2008</xref>).

No differences in PV-positive cell density was observed at PND 16, with both groups expressing low densities of PV-positive cells. Furthermore, the difference in PV-positive cell density between LB and control groups subsided by PND 28, with control PV-positive cell density rising to match those observed in LB mice. The increase in PV-positive cell density in the BLA of LB mice at PND 21 was not observed in the other regions of the fear circuit assessed here, including the prelimbic (PL; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> center) and infralimbic (IL; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> right) subregions of the mPFC. A non-significant decrease in PV-positive cell density in LB mice was observed at PND 50 in BLA, IL, and PL. This decrease in PV-positive cell density was not observed in other brain regions such as the primary motor cortex and somatosensory cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, the decrease in PV-positive cell density may be indicative of changes in parvalbumin protein concentration within BLA, IL, and PL as mice transition into adulthood. Studies assessing protein concentrations in combination with additional labeling techniques will be needed to fully determine whether this represents a true decline. Together these findings suggest that LB increased PV positive cell density in the BLA but not the mPFC, suggesting region-specific effects of LB rearing.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>LB alters select markers for neuronal populations in mPFC and BLA.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative image of immunohistochemical labeling in the BLA of an LB PND 21 mouse (left).

To ensure that the increased freezing was not due to effects on locomotion or anxiety-like behavior, mice were placed in an open field and PV-positive cells in the BLA were optogenetically inhibited and the behavior of mice was tracked.

To ensure that inhibition of PV-positive cells was modulating BLA activity, a subset of unilaterally implanted mice were administered light for 15 min while freely moving in their homecage. Since parvalbumin neurons work to inhibit neuronal activity, we hypothesized that inactivation of the inhibitory interneurons should lead to increased activity of excitatory neurons and therefore increased expression of the immediate early gene cFos.

Since LB male and female mice exhibited diminished fear expression at PND 21, and PL projections into BLA are known to promote fear learning, while IL projections into BLA support fear extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Do-Monte et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Giustino and Maren, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lee and Choi, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sierra-Mercado et al., 2011</xref>), we sought to investigate whether LB altered anatomical connectivity between mPFC and BLA in our hands. To test if LB altered the timing and density of projections from mPFC to BLA, the retrograde tracer cholera toxin B (CTB) was injected unilaterally into the BLA and the number of labeled cells in PL and IL were quantified. Injections were performed 1 day prior to the time point of interest (e.g. PND 15 for PND 16) and perfusions performed 1 day later (e.g. PND 17 for PND 16). Four time points were tested (PND 16, 21, 28 and 35; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6AâC</xref>). As labeling could be affected by efficiency of CTB uptake following injection and BLA placement, we used an ANCOVA analysis with BLA area at the site of injection and CTB injection area as covariates. Previous research has reported no effects of LB rearing on BLA volume at PND 20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Guadagno et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, we interpreted the corrected estimated mean densities, obtained through the ANCOVA analysis as accounting for between animal differences in CTB injection size and injection placement (potential limitations of this approach may be found in the Discussion and MaterialsÂ andÂ methods). An independent ANCOVA was conducted for each age group and each sex (for analysis of Ctrl males vs Ctrl females see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>). In males, LB did not affect the density of PL to BLA or IL to BLA labeled cells at PND 16, 21, 28 or 35. However, LB female mice did show an increase in PL to BLA projecting cells at PND 21 and 28 when compared to Ctrl females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and E</xref>). LB females did not differ from Ctrl females in IL to BLA projection densities. Next, we sought to determine if LB altered the balance of PL and IL inputs into BLA across development. We determined the relative difference in PL and IL projections as a factor of the total number of labelled cells for each mouse ((PL - IL) / (PL + IL)). This value, or projection index, accounts for between-subject differences in labeling efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). No differences in projection index were found between LB and Ctrl reared male mice. A significant increase in the projection index was observed in LB reared females when compared to Ctrl females at PND 16, but not at PND 21, 28 or 35, suggesting an upwards shift in PL over IL inputs into BLA at that age in females. These results suggest that females may be more sensitive to LB induced alterations in the development of mPFC anatomical connectivity to BLA.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>LB altered mPFC to BLA anatomical connectivity in females but not males.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram of CTB 594 retrograde injection into the BLA.

We found that LB decreased physical growth during postnatal development, with a more robust effect on the body than the brain. Delayed brain growth was accompanied by significant effects on the timing of maturation (as indexed by developmental change in cell density or protein levels) for specific cell populations in select brain regions. LB led to a selective increase in PV-positive cell density within the BLA at PND 21 (peri-weaning). Furthermore, LB reared mice at PND 21 were able to learn, but not express, an auditory conditioned fear response, which was rescued by inhibiting PV-positive cell activity in the BLA of LB reared mice. In addition, LB rearing led to sex-specific changes in the anatomical connectivity of PL and BLA in female peri-adolescent mice. Together this data supports the idea that LB rearing alters the timing of maturation of subclasses of cells in key brain regions supporting threat learning and the expression of fear memories, with possible implications for later pathology development.</p><p>Previous research in humans has shown that childhood resource insecurity in the form of poverty, specifically during infancy, is associated with altered regional brain volume, with the prefrontal cortex and amygdala being affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hair et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hanson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Luby et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sheridan et al., 2012</xref>). However, the mechanisms by which poverty confers risk for altered brain development and how these factors impact the development of region and cell specific populations of neurons remains largely unknown. Here, rearing mice under conditions of resource restriction, altered the development of select populations of neurons in the mPFC and BLA, key regions involved in fear learning and threat assessment. In the BLA, LB led to an earlier rise in the density of PV positive cells, and a sex and age-specific increase in PL inputs to BLA. Further, LB altered levels of myelin basic protein at select developmental time points in the mPFC, effects that may contribute to altered development and functional readouts for behaviors that were not assessed here. Consistent with our results, studies in humans have found that childhood poverty decreases prefrontal activity in adulthood and reduces the ability of prefrontal cortex to suppress amygdala activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kim et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Given the developmental changes observed in LB reared mice, we sought to test if these effects may be related to changes in threat assessment and responding to fear associated stimuli. As the mPFC and BLA are critical for fear learning, mice at different developmental ages underwent Pavlovian tone-shock association learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anglada-Figueroa and Quirk, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arruda-Carvalho and Clem, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Etkin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Giustino and Maren, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sierra-Mercado et al., 2011</xref>). Control reared mice showed the expected developmental trend of being able to condition to a tone-shock association at PND 21, but not at PND 16. Interestingly, LB reared animals were unable to express the conditioned memory 24 hr after conditioning at either PND 16 or PND 21, indicating a later developmental emergence of this behavior. At PND 21, LB mice were able to express the conditioned memory at a short delay (6 hr), indicating that deficits in freezing were not due to an inability to engage the freezing response. Furthermore, the freezing response re-emerged 7 days following conditioning, indicating that learning had occurred. Thus, LB may disrupt the developmental ability of animals to express, but not form, specific types of conditioned fear memories.</p><p>Previous research from our group and others have found effects of LB on depressive-like behavior in females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Goodwill et al., 2019</xref>), but failed to find significant differences in anxiety-like behavior in adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Goodwill et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Manzano Nieves et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Manzano-Nieves et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Naninck et al., 2015</xref>). Consistent with previous work, we did not find an effect of LB on general measures of anxiety. However, LB mice, when compared to Ctrls, had increased total time performing head dips in the elevated plus maze (EPM) at PND 21 and decreased number of entries in the light/dark box at PND 28 and 35, suggesting that LB rearing may be altering aspects of risk assessment, which were not directly tested in this study. Furthermore, we report no effects of LB rearing on auditory fear conditioning in young adults. This finding is in conflict with previous reports demonstrating a significant effect of LB rearing on auditory fear conditioning and expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Guadagno et al., 2018</xref>). Differences between our fear conditioning results and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Guadagno et al., 2018</xref> may be due to species differences (activity levels, learning differences, stress tolerance) or LB protocol (administration from PND 1â9 vs PND 4â11, cage changes versus no cage changes). It is possible that differences in LB paradigm may alter the frequency of abusive behaviors leading to differences in outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gallo et al., 2019</xref>). Detailed, meticulous studies comparing the timing of LB protocol administration and its effects on maternal behavior will be needed to understand how timing and duration of LB rearing impact auditory fear conditioning.</p><p>Previous research from our lab has demonstrated that LB can induce accelerated PV-positive cell differentiation in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bath et al., 2016</xref>), but may also selectively decrease PV-positive cell counts in brain regions such as the orbitofrontal cortex in adult females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goodwill et al., 2018</xref>). Consistent with reported effects in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bath et al., 2016</xref>), we found that LB led to an earlier rise in PV-positive cell density in BLA, with PV-positive cell density being higher in LB reared mice compared to controls at PND 21. However, PV-positive cells are not increased across all brain regions or across all timepoints. Analysis of PV-positive cell density in rostral primary somatostatin cortex (S1) and rostral primary motor cortex (M1) revealed decreased cell counts in LB mice at PND 16 when compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The decreased PV-positive cell density in M1 and S1 were not persistent, with no effects being observed in S1 at any other age tested, and with increased PV-positive cell density being observed in M1 at PND 21 and 75. Together our data on PV-positive cell density across development and across brain regions revealed a mosaic effect of LB on PV-positive cell density. The mosaic effect may be the consequence of differences in the developmental timing of maturation of these brain regions, with seeding of PV-positive precursors occurring prior to the ELA manipulation in some areas. Alternatively, this may represent differing sensitivity of these regions to the stress signals (e.g. through differing regional expression of glucocorticoid (GR) and mineralocorticoid (MR) receptors, whose activation may have transcriptional effects impacting cellular maturation and plasticity). Future research testing potential mechanisms underlying region-specific sensitivity will be needed.</p><p>PV-positive neuronal activity in the BLA has been shown to be capable of modulating fear expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Davis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wolff et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, PV-positive cell density has previously been shown to be negatively correlated with innate threat responses in post-weanling rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Santiago et al., 2018</xref>). Consistent with the previously described role of PV-positive cells in BLA, we found that mice reared under LB conditions had a decreased fear response, as indexed by lower freezing to a tone previously paired with a shock at PND 21. We posit that the precocious rise in PV positive cells in BLA may have blunted the ability to express, but not learn a fear association. In support of this interpretation of the data, optogenetic inhibition of PV-positive cells in BLA was sufficient to rescue the low freezing phenotype of PND 21 LB reared mice. However, other inhibitory neuronal populations within the BLA are also capable of modulating fear expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Krabbe et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lucas and Clem, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rovira-Esteban et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wolff et al., 2014</xref>), thus, questions regarding the potential of other populations of neurons to be able to mask the effect of LB rearing remain to be explored. Although we did not observe differences between LB and control mice in somatostatin or VGLUT 2 cell densities at PND 21, this does not rule out the possibility of changes in physiological properties of these classes of cells. LB in rats has been shown to increase spine density and dendritic length of neurons and increase the excitability of BLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Guadagno et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, additional studies will be needed to fully examine the role of the effects of LB rearing on diverse neuronal populations and on behaviors across development. The work included here significantly extends our knowledge of the role of PV positive cells in the development of fear expression, and possible mechanisms through which ELA can drive developmental changes in threat assessment and fear expression.</p><p>We show that LB increased PV-positive cell counts, and that this effect may have driven the decrease in fear expression at PND 21. However, it is also possible that LB-induced changes in mPFC to BLA anatomical connectivity may have contributed to the decreased freezing observed at PND 22. Previous studies in rats have shown that the mPFC can modulate auditory fear conditioning as early as PND 24, but not at PND 17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kim et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, it has been shown that stimulation of the IL subregion of the mPFC can decrease fear expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Do-Monte et al., 2015a</xref>). Through the analysis of PL to BLA and IL to BLA projection densities, we found that LB females had increased PL to BLA estimated mean densities at PND 21 and 28. LB males did not significantly differ from Ctrl males at any age. Given that the deficits in fear expression at PND 22 are observed in both males and females, it is unlikely that differences in mPFC connectivity are driving the observed effects on cue associated fear learning. Additional experiments will be required to determine if increased PL to BLA anatomical connectivity in LB females is leading to increased functional connectivity, or the sex selective elevation in depressive-like behaviors we previously observed in females following LB rearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Goodwill et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, future studies will be needed to examine the mechanisms and the consequences of the increased anatomical connectivity between these regions.</p><p>In sum, this work reveals complex effects of limited resource rearing, on the timing of neuronal and circuit maturation, and the developmental expression of fear learning. We found that resource restriction in the form of LB during early development can drive regional and cell selective effects on maturation, with profound implications for behavioral development. Specifically, we have found that LB increased PV-positive cell density in the BLA at PND 21, and transiently altered the ability of mice to express a threat-associated memory. The transient suppression of threat-associated fear behavior may increase risk taking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Haushofer and Fehr, 2014</xref>), increase the chances of incurring a secondary stressor, and mask emotional symptoms of early life trauma during the peri-weaning period, only to emerge as pathology in adolescence. Such observations may explain the latent period of neuropsychiatric symptom expression in children exposed to early life trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Teicher et al., 2009</xref>). Future studies assessing the contribution of altered development of these fear circuits to later symptom development will be needed.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials

On day 3, mice received tone-shock associative learning in the fear conditioning chamber. During fear conditioning, mice were presented with six tones (30 s, 4 KHz, 75 dB) with each tone co-terminating with a 1 s foot-shock (0.57 mA). Tone shock pairings were separated by an inter-trial interval of 1.5 min. Testing for fear expression occurred on day 4 of the testing protocol, unless otherwise stated. Fear expression testing consisted of exposing mice to two tones in the control chamber (habituated chamber where no fear conditioning occurred). Different cohorts of animals, across multiple litters were used to test mice at the different developmental time points.

For the remaining portion of the western blot protocol, transfer membranes were kept at 4Â°C.</p><p>Membranes were blocked for 1 hr in 5% non-fat milk in Tris-buffered saline Tween-20 (TBST, containing 10 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Tween-20, pH 7.6), followed by incubation with primary antibodies diluted in 5% non-fat milk/0.5% bovine serum albumin in TBST at 4Â°C overnight. Membranes were washed with TBST three times (15 min per wash) and incubated with secondary antibody in 5% non-fat milk/0.5% bovine serum albumin in TBST for 1 hr. Membranes were then washed with TBST three times (15 min per wash), then visualized with Amersham ECL Western Blotting Detection Reagent (RPN2106, GE Life Sciences) using a C600 Azure Biosystems imaging system (Dublin, CA). Densitometry analysis was conducted with a gel imaging module of NIH ImageJ software.</p><sec id="s4-7-1"><title>Primary antibodies used for western blotting</title><p>Mouse anti-Î²-Tubulin (1:2000, Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-GAPDH (1:2000, Cell Signaling Technology), mouse anti-Calretinin (1:500, Swant), mouse anti-Calbindin (1:500, Swant) rabbit anti-Myelin Basic Protein (1:1000, Abcam), rabbit anti-VGLUT1 (1:1000, Millipore). Secondary antibodies used for this study were: HRP conjugated donkey anti-mouse (1:2000, Jackson ImmunoResearch) and donkey anti-rabbit (1:2000, Jackson ImmunoResearch).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Cholera toxin B injections</title><p>Alexa 594 conjugated cholera toxin B (CTB) (Fisher Scientific) was used to retrogradely label the projections from PL and IL to BLA, in male and female mice, at postnatal ages PND 16, 21, 28, and 35. CTB (1.0 mg/mL) was injected (0.15 ul) into the left BLA 1 day prior to the time-point of interest (e.g. PND 15 for PND 16). In order to inject the CTB into BLA across development separate coordinates were used for each age. Developmentally appropriate coordinates were empirically derived from pilot surgeries. Coordinates used for the CTB injections were as follows: (PND 15: DVÂ =Â â5.075, MLÂ =Â â3.05, APÂ =Â â1.1; PND 20: DVÂ =Â â5.1, MLÂ =Â â3.1, APÂ =Â â1.15; PND 34: DVÂ =Â â5.2, MLÂ =Â â3.15, APÂ =Â â1.2). Mice were perfused 48 hr post-injection. The brain was dissected, sectioned (40 Âµm), mounted, counter-stained with DAPI (Fisher Scientific) and visualized using a fluorescent microscope. The density of CTB positive cells in the PL and IL was measured.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Optogenetic surgery and inhibition of PV+ cells</title><p>Female mice homozygous for Cre under the control of a parvalbumin driver (JAX#008069- <italic>Pvalb<sup>tm1(cre)Arbr</sup></italic>) were crossed with a male heterozygous floxed Halo (JAX#014539- <italic>Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm39(CAG-hop/EYFP)Hze</sup></italic>). The cross resulted in the selective expression of halorhodopsin in PV+ cells (Het PV-Cre, Het Halo âPV Halo miceâ) and mice from the same litter that were Cre positive, but lacked the optogenetic channel (Het PV-Cre, null floxed Halo âLight controlâ). Mice were bilaterally implanted with an in-house made ceramic optic fiber (Ã200 Âµm Core, 0.50 NA; Thorlabs, Newtown, NJ) at PND 15 above BLA (Placements: DVÂ =Â â5.1, ML = = + / - 3.1, APÂ =Â â1.15). For surgeries, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane gas anesthesia (2.0%â2.5% in 1 l/min oxygen) and secured to the stereotaxic apparatus. The scalp was shaved and cleaned, Buprenex (0.1 mg/kg, as an analgesic) was administered intraperitoneally and lidocaine was applied. The skin above the skull was removed to expose the skull. A â¼1 mmâdiameter craniotomy was drilled above BLA. The right side implant was lowered and temporarily secured with Metabond (Parkell Inc, Brentwood, NY) while the left side fiber optic was placed. Following the implantation of the second optic fiber, a thin layer of metabond was placed above the skull to adhere the dental acrylic to the skull. After the dental adhesive solidified, isoflurane administration was stopped, and mice were allowed to wake.</p><p>Mice began fear conditioning protocol at PND 19 (as described above), with optogenetic inhibition occurring at PND 21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). During conditioning, PV+ cells in the BLA were photo-inhibited with constant light (620 nm Plexbright LED, Plexon, Dallas, TX), using an LED driver (Plexon, Dallas, TX) during the 30 s of the tone (including the 1 s foot-shock). The light power delivered, as measured through the optic fiber pre-implant, ranged from 1.5 to 2 mW per side. Following the fear conditioning protocol, a random subset of the mice were tested for locomotion in an open field under conditions of light stimulation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Microscopy</title><p>Neurolucida software was used to analyze immunohistochemical data. Either a light (for DAB staining) or epi-fluorescent microscope (for fluorescence) was used when appropriate. For quantification of neuronal cell density, brain regions were traced at 4x magnification and borders were defined as shown in Paxinos and Franklin mouse brain atlas. Immunoreactive or fluorescent positive neurons within each region were identified by an observer blind to condition and treatment (10x). All region contours with identified cells were saved and the number of cells and area within each contour was assessed using StereoInvestigator. For each brain region, 3â4 sections per brain were averaged to obtain a mean density.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>A two-tailed studentâs <italic>t-test</italic> was used to compare between two groups. When more than two groups were assessed the appropriate ANOVA was performed as stated in the figure legends. All ANOVA tests were followed by Sidakâs multiple comparison test, assessing the effects of treatment at each given age and/or assessing developmental differences within each treatment.</p><p>Two separate analyses of CTB retrograde injection data are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6DâE</xref>, the density of CTB-positive cells in PL and IL (obtained as described in the microscopy section above), was analyzed through the use of an ANCOVA analysis. Two covariates were used in the ANCOVA analysis: 1) the area of the BLA at the site of the injection and 2) the area of the injected CTB at the site of the injection. The site of the injection was defined as the brain section where the needle track was at the ventral most point. The area of the injected CTB was used as a correction for injected volume, while the area of BLA at the injected site was used as a correction for rostral - caudal placement, as the BLA increases in area as you move caudally. Using the two covariates, the ANCOVA analysis performed per age per sex per region, returned an estimated mean value, the 95% confidence intervals, and the pairwise comparison statistics presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6DâE</xref>. A secondary analysis, projection index, correcting for efficiency of labeling is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>. For this analysis, the density of CTB labeling (obtained as described in the microscopy section above) in IL was subtracted from PL (PL-IL) and divided by the total number of cells labeled (PL+IL). The projection index [(PL-IL)/(PL+IL)] thus accounts for differences in labeling efficiencies between mice. This data is presented as mean + / - SEM, with statistical significance being determined by a two-tailed student t-test conducted per age, per sex, as detailed in the figure legend.</p><p>With the exception of data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6DâE</xref>, Statistical analysis was performed using Prism Graphpad statistical and graphing software. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6DâE</xref> was analyzed with SPSS statistical software. All data were graphed using Prism Graphpad statistical and graphing software. For all statistical analyses, statistical significance was defined as p&lt;0.05.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Methods relevant to supplementary figures</title><sec id="s4-12-1"><title>Open field test</title><p>To test for differences in locomotor activity and anxiety-like behavior, mice were placed in an open field arena as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Goodwill et al., 2019</xref>). Distance moved and the time spent in the center of the arena were recorded during a 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3</xref>) or 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2</xref>) minute test using the Ethovision video-tracking system. The arena was digitally divided into two zones (center and periphery), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Goodwill et al., 2019</xref>). Decreased time in the center was used as an indicator of anxiety-like behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12-2"><title>Elevated plus maze</title><p>To assess anxiety-like behavior at PND 21 mice were placed in an elevated plus maze as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Manzano Nieves et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Manzano-Nieves et al., 2018</xref>). The EPM consisted of two open (unprotected) and two closed (protected) arms. Greater time in the closed (protected) arms is defined as higher anxiety-like behavior. Mice were allowed 7 min to explore the maze. The time spent in the protected vs. unprotected arms was assessed. Videos were recorded, and behavior was tracked using Noldus Ethovision XT 10.0 software. All trials were conducted under low-light conditions (~109 Lux). Time spent and distance walked in the open and closed arms of the EPM were assessed using the mouse tracking module. The amount of time, and number of instances, that the animals spent with their head below the surface of the open arms (Head Dips) was manually scored by an independent observer blind to the sex and condition of the mice.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12-3"><title>Shock sensitivity assay</title><p>To assess the minimum foot-shock intensity required to elicit a behavioral response (visible flinch or audible vocalization), PND 21 mice were placed in an operant conditioning chamber (Med associates, Fairfax, VT). Mice were exposed to a series of foot shocks, beginning at 0.06 mA and increasing at 0.02 mA intervals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Manzano-Nieves et al., 2018</xref>). Each shock intensity was presented three times. The amplitude of the foot-shock at which a given mouse first flinched, and/or audibly vocalized to 2 out of 3 foot shocks at a given intensity was recorded by two independent observers blind to condition to insure agreement on these measures. Flinching was defined as the mouse moving its body reflexively downward, making its body smaller, directly following a foot-shock. Vocalization was defined as the emittance of an audible sound.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by funding by the National Institutes of Health, from the NIMH (MH115914- KGB; MH115049- KGB) and NINDS (NS105219- GMN).

decreases fear expression in pre-adolescence by accelerating amygdalar parvalbumin cell development&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kate Wassum as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Claire-Dominique Walker (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript examined the impact of early adversity, specifically that caused by resource insecurity, here modeled by limited bedding, on physical and neural development and the trajectory of emotional learning. The experiments are conducted over an age period adequately spanning the late neonatal, early juvenile, adolescent and adult age, in line with the period of postnatal maturation of anatomical connections between basolateral amygdala and prefrontal cortex. This kind of time course work is essential because snapshots of behavior or brain function at single time points either completely miss effects or lead to erroneous conclusions as to the direction of effect. Limited bedding impaired somatic and neural development at a gross level, but resulted in a transient suppression of fear memory recall, which occurs coincident with an elevation in parvalbumin cell density in the basolateral amygdala. This impairment in fear recall was rescued by optogenetic inactivation of basolateral amygdala parvalbumin neurons during fear learning. Thus limited bedding-induced accelerated development of basolateral amygdala parvalbumin neurons seems not influence fear memory consolidation, but does impair recall of the memory the following day. Overall, these studies are carefully run, with internal replication built in and thoughtful data analysis.</p><p>Overall, all of the reviewers were positive about the research in the manuscript, and there was only one essential revision issue that was brought up by all reviewers which requires attention, and this is the lack of an appropriate no-LB control optogenetic study on memory recall to determine if the effects of inhibition of PV+ neurons in the BLA have an influence in control mice. Given the nature of this study, it was felt that the addition of this control group would be achievable within the designated timeframe, and so all reviewers agreed this was an essential revision.</p><p>In addition to this revision there are several other more minor issues which the reviewers felt required attention and they are listed below. Please address all of these issues in your response letter.</p><p>Reviewer comments to address:</p><p>1) It is not clear if there has been work done on the fidelity of the mouse Cre line being used demonstrating that halorhodopsin expressing cells are indeed PV+ GABA interneurons. If so, could the authors mention a citation for this, and if not, it would be probably good for the authors to at least show colocalization for Cre expression with vGAT and PV.</p><p>2) Why was constant light used to drive halorhodopsin inhibition rather than light pulses? There is evidence that constant light overheats tissue and leads to inadvertent transcriptional activity if tissue is not damaged. For prolonged inhibition of activity, a chemogenetic approach may be more desirable. New work is not necessary (suggested for future) but justification of constant light in methods is needed.</p><p>3) It makes sense that releasing PV inhibition in the BLA could enhance freezing behavior. While the authors do not find an effect of ELA on other inhibitory neurons, a valuable control would still be testing whether silencing of any other inhibitory cell type in the BLA produces a similar enhancement of freezing. Given the significant extra work to provide evidence of specificity, authors may instead choose to note possibility/limitations in the text.</p><p>4) Why was interneuron maturation assessed by IHC for PV-expressing neurons but by Western for other classes of cells?</p><p>5) Attempts to control for CTB injection differences by covarying for injection area are to be commended. It would also be useful to calculate a simple ratio of projection density / injection area to see if significant differences remain.</p><p>6) Please remove assertions that the limited bedding mouse paradigm models poverty and/or refugee experience, which is significantly more complex in humans and involves layers of society and not just âdisorganizedâ care. Bedding is only one resource that is restricted for the mice, whereas human poverty impacts nutritional quality, social stability, educational opportunities, etc.</p><p>7) Additional discussion of why/how the LB paradigm could accelerate PV+ maturation in some brain regions and delay it in others (encompassing several papers from this lab) is warranted.</p><p>8) Why would LB from 4-11 only affect density measures at P35, and only alter ratio at PN21 (Figure 5)? It is not clear how the authors interpret these delayed effects and differences in timing.</p><p>9) Reduced body weight gain has been demonstrated in virtually every study using the LB paradigm in both mice and rats. Ratio of brain weight over body weight nicely shows that there is possibly an element of brain sparing to this effect. In Figure 1, data for PND16 should be drawn on a different scale as it is difficult to evaluate the group difference at that age. Obvious and significant differences are reported for older ages. Figure 1âfigure supplement 1, the color code for males is confusing and not well contrasted. Brain/body weight is certainly one index of somatic development, but it would have been nice to complement with anogenital distance in both sexes. Do the authors have data pertaining to this variable between controls and LB mice?</p><p>10) How exact is the assumption that PV+ cell number is associated with changes in cell differentiation? The authors indicate that LB accelerates the differentiation of PV in the BLA, however, differences could also be due to the level of immunostained signal in the BLA at young ages. Replace the term &quot;differentiation&quot; by increased PV-positive cell number.</p><p>11) In Figure 3, the standard errors for PV density are very large for PND21 in the BLA. There is a clear overlap of the standard errors suggesting that the Ctl and LB groups are not significantly different. In this case, the authors should correct their statistical analyses to perform a 2 way ANOVA (age x treatment) followed by post-hoc tests instead of a series of t-tests. This is a critical point as it is one of the main results of the manuscript.</p><p>12) The experiments with optogenetic inhibition of PV+ cells in the BLA are very elegant and carefully designed. In Figure 4C, placement of the optical fiber suggests that the LA rather than the BLA was inhibited. Disinhibition of the LA will likely lead to BLA activation and a similar increase in %freezing, but this should be discussed. Please provide the bregma level for the fiber optic placement. Provide a better photomicrograph of mPFC GFP staining. Even with higher magnification, there are no cells that can be detected.</p><p>13) &quot;.â¦the impact of LB on mPFC and BLA connectivity remained unknown.&quot; This is inaccurate as other studies have examined connectivity between these two structures after ELA. Please mention and reference these important imaging (DTI and rsfMRI) studies: Bolton et al., 2018, Yan et al., 2010 and Guadagno et al., 2018. The authors could precise: &quot;anatomical connectivity&quot;. Throughout the manuscript &quot;anatomical connectivity&quot; should be used. It is unclear how the CTB injection size was determined? In fact, it should be a volume of injection since several sections likely contained CTB. How projection density was normalized should be explained in greater details in methods.</p><p>14) Please provide high resolution photomicrographs of the injection site in the BLA as well as the projection areas in mPFC. What is the background for this type of labeling? Please indicate whether you found layer differences in the density of labeling in the mPFC IL and PL.</p><p>15) The authors provide figures in the manuscript where data from both sexes are pooled, yet in the supplementary figures, there are significant effects of sex and age on the %freezing during conditioning. I wonder whether these data should not be presented in the manuscript as well as complement to Figure 2. Interestingly also, Figure 2âfigure supplement 1 fails to find significant differences in %freezing behavior between Ctl and LB adult mice (both male and female). This is surprising given the assumption that ELA leads to phenotypes of increased anxiety and fear responsiveness as demonstrated by several other groups in similar conditions. This should be discussed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.55263.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer comments to address:</p><p>1) It is not clear if there has been work done on the fidelity of the mouse Cre line being used demonstrating that halorhodopsin expressing cells are indeed PV+ GABA interneurons.

The group that generated this PV-Cre line demonstrated that more than 90% of PV+ cells are labeled in this mouse line (Hippenmeyer et al., 2005 PLoS Biol). Further, as part of a collaboration for a separate project with Dr. Barry Connors (Goodwill et al., 2019), we have characterized the intrinsic properties of PV Cre x NpHR positive cells in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) of slices obtained from this line of mice (unpublished data). Based on characterizing the intrinsic property of PV-Cre cells in the OFC, we are confident that the clear majority of the cells (all cells patched to date) exhibit all of the properties of GABAergic PV+ cells. Similar work has been carried out using this same PV-Cre mouse line in combination with AVV-NpHR-EGFP cell infection, to show selective silencing of PV+ cell populations (Royer et al., 2012 Nat Neuro).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Why was constant light used to drive halorhodopsin inhibition rather than light pulses?

New work is not necessary (suggested for future) but justification of constant light in methods is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and had a similar concern prior to undertaking these studies, which motivated our specific approach. We previously carried out in vitro optogenetic inhibition of parvalbumin positive cells using NpHR in slices derived from this same mouse line (aforementioned collaboration with Dr. Connors, also see publication- Goodwill et al., 2019). Recordings were carried out at three different current intensities in the same cell from a PV Cre x NpHR mouse. Patched cells had all of the properties of fast spiking PV+ cells under both patch and current stimulation conditions. We found that spiking of these cells could be immediately silenced upon light stimulation, that this silencing was maintained through a 20 minute protocol, and that normative spiking resumed upon light removal, with no rebound inhibition, no enhanced spiking following release, and no obvious effects on the intrinsic properties of these cells. We would like to also note that in our protocol, we employed the use of light generated from LED drivers, which provide lower power, but effective modulation of NpHR. Use of lower power light sources may eliminate potential heating or transcriptional effects that may be observed with continuous higher power light stimulation when using lasers as the light source. Despite this, we have now included a caveat about the use of constant light and possible benefits of using other approaches.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It makes sense that releasing PV inhibition in the BLA could enhance freezing behavior. While the authors do not find an effect of ELA on other inhibitory neurons, a valuable control would still be testing whether silencing of any other inhibitory cell type in the BLA produces a similar enhancement of freezing. Given the significant extra work to provide evidence of specificity, authors may instead choose to note possibility/limitations in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment and agree that there may be potential effects of silencing of other populations of cells on freezing behavior. For example, in adult animals, manipulation of CCK cells alters engagement of freezing behavior (Rovira Esteban et al., 2019). We agree that the manipulation of activity of a number of other cellular populations may in fact drive changes in freezing behavior (augmentation or inhibition). Our studies, and the choice of inhibition of PV positive cells in BLA, were focused on the observation of altered PV positive cell density at early developmental timepoints, and the attempt to provide proof of concept that they could be influencing freezing levels by releasing the believed net effect of an increased PV influence on regional activity at this age. Our observations support the argument that decreasing the influence of PV at this age can restore freezing behavior, and in the anticipated direction. Experiments manipulating other classes of cells could have interesting and important effects and add to our understanding of the effects of activity of these cells in regional activity and will be important studies to carry out in the future. However, we believed that such studies were outside of the scope of the current manuscript, as we had observed limited effect of LB rearing on gross metrics of cellular maturation for other classes of cells (e.g. SST and vGLut). Experiments silencing SST+ cells may also support changes in freezing behavior, which would be interesting, but may merely represent another mechanism of altering behavioral output, but one that was not likely impacted by LBN rearing. We have added text indicating this caveat and the need to look at the influence of manipulating additional classes of cells on this behavior over development.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Why was interneuron maturation assessed by IHC for PV-expressing neurons but by Western for other classes of cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for bringing up this important point. We had planned to use multiple methodologies for quantification of cell density over development in the varied classes of cells. However, for IHC approaches, the PV antibody was the most robust marker used across development. Work with other antibodies provided exceedingly poor staining in tissue at the early developmental ages that were being assessed (possibly due to developmental changes in antigen availability). Variability in the quality of IHC hampered our ability to conduct such developmental assays for a broader range of markers. Given these limitations, we moved to using alternate methods to verify results for glutamatergic neurons and somatostatin positive neurons. We used additional mice that genetically express Cre recombinase under either the somatostatin (SST) or glutamatergic (Vglut2) promoter. We crossed each of these lines of mice with an Ai14 (Td-tomato reporter mouse). Using this method, we verified a subset of the findings showing no effect of LB rearing on SST+ or vGlut2<sup>+</sup> cell density in BLA at P21. This is now included in the supplemental data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Attempts to control for CTB injection differences by covarying for injection area are to be commended. It would also be useful to calculate a simple ratio of projection density / injection area to see if significant differences remain.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. After running the requested analysis we found that increased PL to BLA projections at PND 21 (p = 0.000757) remained significant while differences at PND 28 were no longer significant (p = 0.099). This analysis strategy did not impact statistical significance for other comparisons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Please remove assertions that the limited bedding mouse paradigm models poverty and/or refugee experience, which is significantly more complex in humans and involves layers of society and not just âdisorganizedâ care. Bedding is only one resource that is restricted for the mice, whereas human poverty impacts nutritional quality, social stability, educational opportunities, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this point and agree that the human condition is much more complex than what is modeled with the limited bedding intervention in mice. We have deleted the requested assertion and have revised the manuscript to reflect that we are observing effects of loss of maternal resources on pup care and development, and do not overreach with our description of this mimicking poverty/refugee experiences.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Additional discussion of why/how the LB paradigm could accelerate PV+ maturation in some brain regions and delay it in others (encompassing several papers from this lab) is warranted.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this point and have added brief discussion of this in a recent review paper (Bath 2020, TINS). We now include additional supplemental data showing that LB leads to significant delays in the developmental increase in PV positive cell density in the primary motor and primary somatosensory cortex, supporting those assertions. We have also added a brief discussion of why regionally specific effects may be occurring.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Why would LB from 4-11 only affect density measures at P35, and only alter ratio at PN21 (Figure 5)? It is not clear how the authors interpret these delayed effects and differences in timing.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent question, which we are currently working to understand. Based upon our prior work in hippocampus and other brain regions, we know that LB from P4-11 may be impacting the migration (less likely) or timing of maturation and differentiation in at least some classes of cells (we focused on PV positive cells). In that prior work, we have found in control animals that PV expression begins to elevate in these regions well after the LB manipulation (P16- Bath et al., 2016) and not reaching peak levels until ~P28. Further, this inhibition likely plays a role in the maturation of the local circuit, functioning in the stabilization and pruning of later developing projections from other brain regions. Thus, LB rearing may have cascading downstream effects on additional maturational processes, which may not manifest until later timepoints. Further, some of these effects may persist, or resolve due to ongoing plasticity in the system, or utilizing alternate strategies and computations to drive shifts in behavior.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Reduced body weight gain has been demonstrated in virtually every study using the LB paradigm in both mice and rats. Ratio of brain weight over body weight nicely shows that there is possibly an element of brain sparing to this effect. In Figure 1, data for PND16 should be drawn on a different scale as it is difficult to evaluate the group difference at that age. Obvious and significant differences are reported for older ages. Figure 1âfigure supplement 1, the color code for males is confusing and not well contrasted. Brain/body weight is certainly one index of somatic development, but it would have been nice to complement with anogenital distance in both sexes. Do the authors have data pertaining to this variable between controls and LB mice?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included an inset in panels A and B of Figure 1 that provides a zoomed in version of PND 16 data. We have changed the colors in the Figure 1âfigure supplement 1 to enhance contrast. We agree that anogenital distance would be a useful complementary measure of somatic development. However, the anogenital distance for Ctrl and LB mice was not recorded as part of this study and we are unable to obtain this data at this time. However, we will strive to include it as part of our developmental measures for future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) How exact is the assumption that PV+ cell number is associated with changes in cell differentiation? The authors indicate that LB accelerates the differentiation of PV in the BLA, however, differences could also be due to the level of immunostained signal in the BLA at young ages. Replace the term &quot;differentiation&quot; by increased PV-positive cell number.</p></disp-quote><p>We have amended the manuscript to reflect the reviewerâs comment. The increase in PV positive cells was confirmed with a reporter mouse line that would be less sensitive to fluctuating PV levels from immunostaining. The term âdifferentiationâ was somewhat loosely used to mean the developmental change in the expression of the PV protein, which we interpreted as the differentiation of this class of cells to express a PV phenotype, not necessarily differentiation from precursor to mature phenotype. To address the reviewer concern, we have now replaced the term differentiation with âincreased PV-positive cell densityâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) In Figure 3, the standard errors for PV density are very large for PND21 in the BLA. There is a clear overlap of the standard errors suggesting that the Ctl and LB groups are not significantly different. In this case, the authors should correct their statistical analyses to perform a 2 way ANOVA (age x treatment) followed by post-hoc tests instead of a series of t-tests. This is a critical point as it is one of the main results of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for bringing this to our attention. There was an issue in the rendering of the figure due to last minute changes in the manuscript between the editorial review and the scientific review process, where the graph was accidentally changed to depict standard deviation instead of standard error of the mean. We have now corrected this issue to show the mean and SEM for the data presented. We agree with the reviewer that a 2-way ANOVA would have been a better statistical approach. However, due to logistical issues associated with the number of animals and sections prepared, immunostaining was performed separately for each age. This meant that we could only ensure that the various factors associated with differences in quality of labeling (e.g. incubation durations, separate preparations of primary antibody incubation solution, washes, separate preparation of secondary incubation reagents, and development reagents and incubations) were matched within an age group but not across ages. Because of the way the data was generated we did not feel that it was appropriate to include analysis across ages. The same is true for the western blots.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) The experiments with optogenetic inhibition of PV+ cells in the BLA are very elegant and carefully designed. In Figure 4C, placement of the optical fiber suggests that the LA rather than the BLA was inhibited. Disinhibition of the LA will likely lead to BLA activation and a similar increase in %freezing, but this should be discussed. Please provide the bregma level for the fiber optic placement. Provide a better photomicrograph of mPFC GFP staining. Even with higher magnification, there are no cells that can be detected.</p></disp-quote><p>In accordance with previous work done by members of this research team (Goodwill et al., 2018, Do Monte, 2015) we aimed to place optical fibers on the surface of the brain region to be optically inhibited. However, we do recognize that in this study, the placement of the fibers has the potential to also influence cellular activity in LA. We have now added this caveat to the discussion of our results.</p><p>The targeted placement of the optical fibers were as follows: DV = -5.1, ML = = +/- 3.1, AP = -1.15 and is included in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>We agree that it was hard to identify the PV+ cells within mPFC and now provide a zoomed in image as part of Figure 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) &quot;.â¦the impact of LB on mPFC and BLA connectivity remained unknown.&quot; This is inaccurate as other studies have examined connectivity between these two structures after ELA. Please mention and reference these important imaging (DTI and rsfMRI) studies: Bolton et al., 2018, Yan et al., 2010 and Guadagno et al., 2018. The authors could precise: &quot;anatomical connectivity&quot;. Throughout the manuscript &quot;anatomical connectivity&quot; should be used. It is unclear how the CTB injection size was determined? In fact, it should be a volume of injection since several sections likely contained CTB. How projection density was normalized should be explained in greater details in methods.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now provided a more precise description of anatomical connectivity throughout the manuscript.

What is the background for this type of labeling? Please indicate whether you found layer differences in the density of labeling in the mPFC IL and PL.</p></disp-quote><p>An example image of the CTB injections into BLA and the cell labeling in mPFC has now been included in Figure 6. Unfortunately, due to limitations at the time of data collection, no layer information was recorded for this dataset.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) The authors provide figures in the manuscript where data from both sexes are pooled, yet in the supplementary figures, there are significant effects of sex and age on the %freezing during conditioning. I wonder whether these data should not be presented in the manuscript as well as complement to Figure 2. Interestingly also, Figure 2âfigure supplement 1 fails to find significant differences in %freezing behavior between Ctl and LB adult mice (both male and female). This is surprising given the assumption that ELA leads to phenotypes of increased anxiety and fear responsiveness as demonstrated by several other groups in similar conditions. This should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this request, as we had collected data in both male and female mice for the bulk of our measures, because we are very interested in potential sex differences (Bath 2020- TINS). In prior manuscripts, reviewers have had difficulty with the either the discussion of the complexity associated with sex differences or the additional length of results and discussion when separating out sex specific data, and thus we tried to keep the focus on the main effect (suppressed freezing at P21). We now have happily amended Figure 2 to show the sex specific effects and separated out male and female data in other figures. We have also included a discussion addressing the lack of significant increases in fear expression and anxiety-like behaviors within our LB reared mice. Previous research from our group (Goodwill et al., 2019, Manzano Nieves et al., 2018, Manzano Nieves et al., 2019) and others (Naninck et al., 2015; Others) have found effects of LB on depressive-like behavior in females but failed to find significant differences in anxiety-like behavior in adult mice. Ongoing work in our lab has replicated the lack of effect in auditory fear conditioning in adult mice. However, we are aware that other groups (Guadagno et al., 2018) have found significant effects of LB rearing on fear conditioning and expression. Differences between our fear conditioning results and Guadagno et al., 2018 may be due to species (differences in activity levels, learning differences, stress tolerance) or LB protocol (administration from PND 1-9 vs PND 4-11).</p></body></sub-article></article>
