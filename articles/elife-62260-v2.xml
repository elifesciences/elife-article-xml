pregnancy is achieved. Here, we evaluate the hypothesis that prolactin, one of the first hormones to change secretion pattern following mating, is involved in driving this suppression of physical activity levels during pregnancy. We show that prolactin can acutely suppress RWA in non-pregnant female mice, and that conditional deletion of prolactin receptors (Prlr) from either most forebrain neurons or from GABA neurons prevented the early pregnancy-induced suppression of RWA. Deletion of Prlr specifically from the medial preoptic area, a brain region associated with multiple homeostatic and behavioral roles including parental behavior, completely abolished the early pregnancy-induced suppression of RWA. As pregnancy progresses, prolactin action continues to contribute to the further suppression of RWA, although it is not the only factor involved. Our data demonstrate a key role for prolactin in suppressing voluntary physical activity during early pregnancy, highlighting a novel biological basis for reduced physical activity in pregnancy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>prolactin</kwd><kwd>running wheel</kwd><kwd>pregnancy</kwd><kwd>prolactin receptors</kwd><kwd>medial preoptic area</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001505</institution-id><institution>Health Research Council of New Zealand</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>14-568</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grattan</surname><given-names>David R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008247</institution-id><institution>University of Otago</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ladyman</surname><given-names>Sharon R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>University of Otago School of Biomedical Sciences/Dunedin School of Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ladyman</surname><given-names>Sharon R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Despite voluntary exercise being rewarding to mice, pregnancy hormones act in the maternal brain to markedly reduce the time females choose to engage in this activity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pregnancy and lactation represent profound physiological challenges. The sustained changes in metabolic rate typical of pregnancy have been described as ‘at the limits of human physical capability,’ similar to that expended in extreme physical activity such as an ultramarathon, but over a longer timeframe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Thurber et al., 2019</xref>). To enable the pregnant female to cope with these demands, hormonal changes associated with pregnancy drive a wide range of adaptations to maternal physiology, and in particular, complex changes in metabolic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Napso et al., 2018</xref>). Using a mouse model to characterize metabolic adaptations in pregnancy, we have shown that along with increases in energy intake, pregnant females rapidly lower their energy expenditure and physical activity levels, as measured by daily voluntary running wheel activity (RWA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ladyman et al., 2018a</xref>). This profound change in behavior is likely important to offset the prolonged elevation in basal metabolic rate characteristic of pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ladyman et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Forsum and Lof, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Morrison, 1956</xref>). Remarkably, however, the reduction in RWA starts very early in pregnancy before there is any significant increase in metabolic load, even before implantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ladyman et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Slonaker, 1925</xref>), and thus, can be considered an anticipatory adaptation in preparation for the future metabolic demands. Based on the very rapid change in behavior, we hypothesized that this reduction in physical activity must be mediated by the hormonal changes associated with the maternal recognition of pregnancy. In rodents, one of the very first changes in hormones in pregnancy is the mating-induced initiation of twice-daily prolactin surges that are required to maintain corpus luteum function in the ovary to sustain the pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Phillipps et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we have investigated if there is a role for prolactin in mediating the pregnancy-induced suppression of RWA.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Reduced physical activity during early pregnancy</title><p>The presence of a running wheel enables a robust assessment of an animal’s choice to voluntarily engage in exercise or not. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> depicts daily RWA from a single representative female mouse during different reproductive states, showing the cyclical running patterns characteristic of the estrous cycle with increased running preceding each ovulation; profound reductions in RWA during pregnancy and lactation, apart from a brief increase in RWA the night after birth; and the rapid return to non-pregnant levels of RWA following weaning of pups. To enable experiments both within behavioral phenotyping cages and within their normal home cages, we investigated voluntary RWA during pregnancy independently using two different types of running wheels. Our metabolic phenotyping cages (Promethion, Sable Systems International) had a traditional upright wheel, while a saucer/low-profile wheel was used in the home cages. The upright wheel potentially takes more effort to run on, whereas the saucer wheel has less resistance and the possibility of ‘coasting’ on the wheel may lead to higher RWA being detected (as suggested by the higher average ‘distance’ measured in the saucer group vs. the upright wheel group, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, p&lt;0.0001, t = 4.608, df = 60) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">De Bono et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Girard et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Manzanares et al., 2018</xref>). Regardless of the different equipment, all mice showed a rapid reduction in RWA early in pregnancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, significant effect of time p&lt;0.0001, F(21, 1163) = 1163 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, significant effect of physiological state [non-pregnant, non-lactating control, henceforth referred to as ‘non-pregnant’ group] vs. early pregnancy: p&lt;0.0001, F(1, 47) = 133.8, Sidak’s multiple comparisons; non-pregnant vs. early pregnancy: upright wheel p&lt;0.0001, t = 7.887, df = 47; saucer wheel p&lt;0.0001, t = 8.461, df = 47), demonstrating that this is a robust behavioral change induced as early as the first day of pregnancy. Day of birth was deemed the day pups were first observed in the home cage (checked between 0800 hr and 1700 hr). During the dark phase following the first observation of pups, RWA was significantly increased compared to either the dark phase immediately before the day of birth or the second dark phase after pups were born/observed (significant effect of time p&lt;0.0001, F(2, 110) = 43.10, Sidak’s multiple comparisons: day before birth vs. day of birth p&lt;0.0001, t = 8.671, DF = 110.0; day of birth vs. day after birth p&lt;0.0001, t = 7.210, DF = 110.0; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This increase was observed in 88% of mice (50 out of 57) and is likely to be associated with the hormonal changes that drive the postpartum ovulation in mice, although this was not further investigated.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Pregnancy rapidly decreases voluntary running wheel activity (RWA).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Daily RWA of one representative mouse through one cycle of reproduction (pre-pregnancy estrous cycles, pregnancy, lactation, and after the weaning of her pups).

Mice were housed in Promethion metabolic and behavioral monitoring cages before and during pregnancy (as previously described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ladyman et al., 2018a</xref>). We observed that pregnancy significantly influenced both energy expenditure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, repeated measures ANOVA p=0.0002, F(1.457, 7.286) = 39.86) and total daily ambulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, repeated measures ANOVA p=0.005, F(2.063, 8.253) = 10.24). Both energy expenditure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, paired t-test p=0.03, t = 2.812, df = 5) and ambulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> paired t-test p=0.03, t = 3.121, df = 4) were significantly reduced in early pregnancy compared to the non-pregnant state. This suggests that early pregnancy is associated with reduced physical activity, independent of the actual form of physical activity measured. When mice are housed with running wheels, this reduction in physical activity is only detected as a major reduction in RWA, likely because this accounts for by far the greatest proportion of their overall physical activity levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ladyman et al., 2018a</xref>), whereas in the current study, when housed without running wheels, the reduction in physical activity is detected in home cage ambulation, which is the predominant form of physical activity in this situation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Acute effects of prolactin on physical activity and behavior</title><p>The immediate change in behavior following the onset of pregnancy suggested that it was induced by hormonal changes very early in pregnancy. We hypothesized that prolactin was the most likely candidate due to the rapid induction of twice-daily prolactin surges induced by mating in rodents. This idea was supported by the observation that the reduction in RWA persisted throughout pregnancy and lactation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), conditions characterized by high prolactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Phillipps et al., 2020</xref>). To determine if prolactin can acutely influence physical activity, we investigated the effects of acute prolactin treatment on physical activity in non-pregnant mice. In addition to RWA in their home cages, a number of other indices of physical activity were assessed in various behavioral tests including both novel and familiar environments. C57BL/6J female mice (metestrous phase of the estrous cycle) that had been housed with a running wheel for at least 3 weeks were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with either prolactin (5 mg/kg) or vehicle 30 min before the start of the dark phase of the light/dark cycle and RWA was monitored. On the following metestrus, mice were injected with the alternative treatment (prolactin or vehicle) such that all mice received both treatment and control in a random order. Prolactin treatment led to a significant reduction in RWA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, repeated measures two-way ANOVA, interaction time × treatment p&lt;0.0001, F(13, 286) = 6.684, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, paired t-test p = 0.007, t = 3.28, df = 11), particularly in the first 3 hr of the dark phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, Sidak’s multiple comparisons test: vehicle vs. prolactin 1 hr p=0.0009 [t = 5.107, df = 18.65], 2 hr p = 0.0173 [t = 3.736, df = 20.61], 3 hr p=0.0248 [t = 3.742, df = 15.91]) when female mice normally engage in their maximal levels of RWA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">De Bono et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Manzanares et al., 2018</xref>). No effect of acute prolactin treatment on RWA activity was observed in male mice (repeated measures two-way ANOVA, interaction time × treatment p=0.9222, F(13, 286) = 0.5028, and paired Student’s t-test p=0.8732, t = 0.1634, df = 11; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). In accordance with previously published work (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Manzanares et al., 2018</xref>), our C57BL/6J female mice ran significantly more per 24 hr than male mice (comparison between vehicle-treated females and males from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and D</xref>, Student’s t-test p&lt;0.0001, t = 8.547, df = 22).

To enable more detailed investigation of physical activity levels within the familiar home cage environment, ambulatory movement was examined in C57BL/6J female mice housed in Promethion metabolic phenotyping cages, <italic>without access to running wheels</italic>. Mice were habituated to these cages, including handling and the associated removal from cages, for at least a week. On the metestrous phase of the estrous cycle, mice received an i.p. injection of either prolactin (5 mg/kg) or vehicle 30 min before the start of the dark phase of the light cycle, in a counterbalanced manner as described above. Prolactin treatment led to a significant reduction in ambulation during the 12 hr of the dark phase of the light cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, repeated measures ANOVA, interaction time × treatment, p=0.016, F(13, 234) = 2.079), although this was a subtle effect and only evident in the late stages of the dark phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, Sidak’s multiple comparisons test: vehicle vs. prolactin 12 hr p=0.03, t = 3.7, df = 12.6). The measure of ‘ambulation distance’ in these cages is generated by an algorithm that interprets multiple infrared beam breaks in a consecutive direction as forward movement or ‘ambulation.’ Interestingly, when total counts of XY beam breaks were examined, prolactin treatment tended to increase, rather than decrease, total beam breaks, although there was no significant difference detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, repeated measures ANOVA, interaction time × treatment p=0.078, F(13, 234) = 1.628). Further examination indicated that prolactin treatment significantly increased fine movement beam breaks, defined as beam breaks that are not in a consecutive direction, thus indicating non-ambulatory (stationary) movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, repeated measures ANOVA, interaction time × treatment, p&lt;0.0001, F(13, 117) = 183.9, <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis: vehicle vs. prolactin, p&lt;0.05 for hours 5–12, t ranges from t = 3.038–4.119, df = 117). This increase in fine movement counts was observed both in the first 4 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, paired t-test p=0.0009, t = 4.882, df = 9) and the total 12 hr (paired t-test p=0.028, t = 2.619, df = 9, data not shown) of the dark phase. To determine what fine movement activities might be influenced by prolactin, another cohort of C57BL/6J female mice were video recorded in their home cages for 40 min following prolactin or vehicle injection (as described above). Recordings were analyzed to determine the time spent in various activities, such as nest building and grooming. There was no difference identified in the time spent doing any of these behaviors following prolactin or vehicle injection except for time spent ‘still, off nest,’ which was slightly yet significantly reduced in the prolactin-treated group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, paired Student’s t-tests, ‘still, off nest’: p = 0.047, t = 2.261, df = 10). Overall, this set of experiments demonstrated that prolactin reduces voluntary RWA in female mice, but had little or no significant impact on general ambulation levels in either a novel environment or in the home cage. Therefore, while rapid changes in RWA activity in early pregnancy may be driven by mating-induced prolactin surges, there is no evidence to support a similar mechanism underlying reductions in ambulation in early pregnancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Prolactin does not acutely decrease ambulation.</title><p>Bars represent total distanced traveled in an open field test (OFT) of 30 min duration (<bold>A</bold>) or elevated plus maze (EPM) of 5 min duration (<bold>B</bold>) carried out in the dark phase of the light cycle under dark conditions following either vehicle or prolactin (5 mg/kg intraperitoneally [i.p.]) treatment in female mice in the metestrous stage of the estrous cycle (n = 8 per group; t-test).

In mice, Prlr are highly expressed in the hypothalamus, mostly localized to the arcuate, ventromedial (VMN), paraventricular (PVN), anteroventral periventricular nuclei, and the preoptic area (POA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kokay et al., 2018</xref>). Within the POA, there is high expression of Prlr in the median, periventricular, and medial regions. Lower expression is observed in the anterior hypothalamic area and dorsomedial hypothalamus. Outside of the hypothalamus, the medial amygdala, anterior bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST), lateral septum, and periaqueductal gray also have robust Prlr expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown et al., 2010</xref>). Expression of Prlr in the hypothalamus does not appear to undergo significant modification during pregnancy and lactation, except for an increase in the arcuate nucleus detected in late pregnancy in the rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Augustine et al., 2003</xref>). During pregnancy, elevated levels of phosphorylation of the transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (pSTAT5) are detected throughout the brain. This is a well-characterized intracellular signaling molecule-activated downstream of the Prlr (and a range of other cytokines), but we have shown that the majority of pSTAT5 in the brain during pregnancy is caused by increased Prlr activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gustafson et al., 2020</xref>), both by surges in prolactin early in pregnancy and by rising placental lactogen as pregnancy progresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Phillipps et al., 2020</xref>).

In other words, both genotypes showed the normal pregnancy-induced suppression in RWA in early pregnancy, and there was no major effect of deletion of Prlr in arcuate kisspeptin neurons. On closer analysis of the early pregnancy change in RWA, while both genotypes showed a decrease in RWA behavior early in pregnancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, interaction genotype × early pregnancy, p=0.01, F(1, 18) = 7.559, Sidak’s multiple comparisons test for significant effect of time: <italic>Prlr<sup>l</sup></italic><sup>ox/lox</sup>, p&lt;0.0001, t = 9.307, df = 28; <italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>/<italic>Kiss1</italic><sup>Cre</sup>, p&lt;0.0001, t = 5.419, df = 28), the effect of pregnancy on RWA in the first few days of pregnancy (days 1–3) was subtly reduced in <italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>/<italic>Kiss1</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice compared with control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, interaction genotype × early pregnancy, p=0.01, F(1, 18) = 7.559, Sidak’s multiple comparisons test for significant effect of genotype: early pregnancy, p=0.0049, t = 3.329, df = 28). Thus, these data suggest the possibility that prolactin action on arcuate kisspeptin neurons may play a small contributing role in the initial reduction in RWA during pregnancy, but this is not the major factor in mediating this response. Later in pregnancy, <italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>/<italic>Kiss1</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice and controls did not differ in their RWA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, total RWA day 15: p = 0.8949, t = 0.1345, df = 14; cumulative RWA days 16–18: p=0.7656, t = 0.3041, df = 14).</p><p>Finally, we sought to narrow down the site of action for prolactin in mediating the effect on RWA during early pregnancy. Our previous work has identified the medial POA as a key site mediating prolactin action on behavioral adaptations associated with pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brown et al., 2017</xref>). This region has also been linked to the hormonal regulation of RWA during the estrous cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grigsby et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">King, 1979</xref>). The MPOA contains the largest concentration of Prlr-expressing neurons in the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown et al., 2010</xref>), and over 50% of these neurons are GABAergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brown et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, RWA is inherently rewarding for rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Novak et al., 2012</xref>), and we have previously identified a Prlr-sensitive projection from the MPOA to the VTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brown et al., 2017</xref>), potentially impacting on dopamine-mediate reward pathways. Hence, we hypothesized that prolactin action on these behavioral circuits originating in the MPOA may mediate the suppressive effect on RWA.</p><p>To investigate this possibility, we used an adeno-associated virus (AAV) to deliver Cre recombinase specifically into the MPOA of adult female <italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup> mice, with controls consisting of AAV-mCherry delivered to <italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup> mice. Following recovery from stereotaxic surgery for virus delivery, mice were housed with a running wheel for at least 3 weeks, then mated, and RWA was monitored throughout pregnancy. Similar to what we have reported previously, AAV-cre injection into the MPOA of <italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup> mice resulted in Cre-mediated recombination expression of GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) and removed all functional prolactin responses from this region, as determined by prolactin-induced pSTAT5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brown et al., 2017</xref>). Replicating work we have published previously, this manipulation also led to the mothers abandoning their pups following birth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, number of live pups on day 3 lactation: Student’s t-test p&lt;0.0001, t = 10, df = 15), confirming the critical role of Prlr in this area for normal maternal behavior in lactation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brown et al., 2017</xref>). Mice with a specific deletion of Prlr in the MPOA did not show the immediate change in RWA once pregnant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, interaction virus injection × day of pregnancy, p&lt;0.0001, F(21, 303) = 3.451).

During lactation, mice spent an extensive amount of time nursing offspring and were in a negative state of energy balance, either of which may impact this change in activity. Since complete deletion of Prlr from the MPOA leads to abandonment of pups and termination of lactation, it was not possible to assess the role of Prlr in this area in the suppression of RWA during lactation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we have shown that the mating-induced release of prolactin, acting through Prlr in the brain, induces a marked reduction in RWA in mice very early in their pregnancy, and this suppressive effect continues throughout pregnancy and into the first few days of lactation. It seems likely that this profound behavioral response is an important addition to a range of hormone-induced metabolic adaptations that have been characterized to facilitate a positive energy balance during pregnancy, including leptin resistance, increased appetite, and reduced energy expenditure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ladyman et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ladyman et al., 2012</xref>). From an evolutionary perspective, these can be viewed as adaptive strategies, enabling pregnant females to build up energy reserves in preparation for the pronounced metabolic demands associated with fetal growth and the subsequent lactation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Butte and King, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dunsworth et al., 2012</xref>). In our modern obesogenic environment, however, such changes have become maladaptive, contributing to excessive weight gain during pregnancy with the associated increased risk in pregnancy complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). Increasing numbers of women are coming into pregnancy already overweight or obese, and over 50% of women now exceed the Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines for optimal weight gain during pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chung et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goldstein et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Voerman et al., 2019</xref>). Indeed, obesity during pregnancy has been described as the ‘<italic>most common clinical risk factor encountered in obstetric practice’</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Krishnamoorthy et al., 2006</xref>). As it is difficult to alter energy intake, increasing energy expenditure through exercise during pregnancy has become highly advocated as a therapeutic intervention that produces healthier gestational weight gain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sanabria-Martinez et al., 2015</xref>). However, despite pregnant women being well-informed about the benefits and safety of exercise during pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harrison et al., 2018</xref>), 60–80% of pregnant women do not engage in physical activity as recommended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amezcua-Prieto et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gaston and Vamos, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hesketh and Evenson, 2016</xref>). This suggests a disconnect between knowledge and action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harrison et al., 2018</xref>), and poses the question of whether there is a biological basis for decreased physical exercise during pregnancy. Indeed, women report fatigue, pregnancy symptoms, and lack of motivation all as barriers to exercise during pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harrison et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we describe a previously unknown hormonal mechanism that may be contributing to the loss of motivation for exercise in pregnancy.</p><p>Three distinct approaches to deleting Prlr in specific neuronal populations each effectively prevented the initial pregnancy-induced suppression of RWA. Firstly, a broad forebrain neuron-specific deletion of Prlr using the <italic>Prlr<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic>/<italic>Camk2a</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mouse blocked the effect, implicating a prolactin action in the brain, but this model was complicated by hyperprolactinemia and abnormal estrous cycles. Using the <italic>Prlr<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic>/<italic>Slc32a1</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice to provide a more targeted deletion of Prlr in GABAergic neurons also blocked the effect. Validation work showed that this genetic cross resulted in over 70% deletion of Prlr expression from GABAergic neurons, leaving Prlr expression in other neurons unaffected. Finally, a region-specific deletion of Prlr from the MPOA using an AAV-cre in adult mice also completely blocked the effect. Collectively, we interpret these data as implicating a population of neurons in the MPOA, at least some of which are likely to be GABAergic, in mediating this profound change in behavior in response to elevated prolactin in early pregnancy. Deletion of Prlr from arcuate nucleus kisspeptin neurons demonstrated a smaller, more subtle attenuation of the early pregnancy-induced suppression in RWA, suggesting that prolactin-sensitive kisspeptin neurons in the arcuate nucleus may make a minor contribution to the immediate reduction in RWA in early pregnancy.</p><p>After the initial decrease in RWA early in pregnancy, RWA is fairly stable until about day 11 onwards when further decreases in RWA occurs, and by late pregnancy levels are extremely low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ladyman et al., 2018a</xref>). This additional decline in RWA in mid-pregnancy takes place when body weight is starting to increase rapidly. and hence it seems likely that this further decrease in RWA is due to physical constraints caused by fetal growth, but this is yet to be investigated. Despite this overall decrease in RWA in the latter parts of pregnancy, Prlr KO models still showed attenuated suppression of RWA compared with control pregnant mice, demonstrating that an inhibitory action of prolactin on RWA is present throughout pregnancy. Interestingly, in mice with Prlr deleted in GABA neurons, this attenuated suppression of RWA was progressively less evident as pregnancy advanced, becoming similar to controls over the last few days of pregnancy. In contrast, the forebrain Prlr KO mouse and the MPOA-specific Prlr KO showed elevated levels of RWA compared to controls that remained elevated throughout pregnancy. This difference suggests the likelihood that several distinct prolactin-sensitive pathways regulate the effects of pregnancy on RWA. The early pregnancy response we originally set out to study seems to predominantly involve a GABAergic subpopulation in the MPOA. In late pregnancy, a non-GABAergic population appears to play the major contributing role. In lactation, prolactin only contributes to the suppression of RWA in the first few days while lactation is being established, and this also appears to be through a non-GABAergic population. While it is tempting to speculate that this lactation effect would be mediated by the same neuronal population as the effect in late pregnancy, mice with an MPOA-specific KO of Prlr do not establish lactation, and hence we could not evaluate RWA in early lactation in that model.</p><p>The MPOA is involved in regulating a wide range of homeostatic and behavioral functions, including parental behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kohl et al., 2017</xref>), and in particular, prolactin action on maternal behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bridges, 2015</xref>). We have recently shown (replicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) that prolactin action in this area is critical to the normal expression of maternal behavior in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brown et al., 2017</xref>). Hence, the prolactin-mediated effect on RWA, described here, might be considered part of the complex adaptive role of the MPOA in promoting appropriate parental responses, triggered by the hormonal changes of pregnancy and lactation. In contrast to the total failure of maternal behavior in mice lacking Prlr in the MPOA, however, the ‘forebrain Prlr deletion’ mouse line were still able to care for their offspring. Despite losing only approximately 50% of Prlr in the MPOA, these animals clearly showed attenuated pregnancy-induced and early lactation-induced suppression of RWA, suggesting that either the neurons influencing RWA are only a subset of those required for the expression of maternal behavior or that there is no major overlap in these neuronal pathways. The MPOA has previously been linked to RWA, with the increased running in response to estradiol treatment apparently mediated through estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) in the MPOA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grigsby et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">King, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wei et al., 2018</xref>). The neuronal cell types mediating the RWA response to estradiol have not been elucidated, but an estrogen-responsive MPOA circuit projecting to the VTA has been shown to be critical for maternal behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wei et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fang et al., 2018</xref>), and at least some of these ERα-expressing neurons in the MPOA are GABAergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Herbison, 1997</xref>). It is possible that estradiol and prolactin may be targeting similar populations of neurons to impact this behavior. Given the strong evidence linking VTA dopamine projections with the rewarding aspects of RWA, this remains a strong candidate for mediating the effect of prolactin on RWA. Within the MPOA, there is extensive heterogeneity in neuronal cell types that express the Prlr, even amongst GABAergic subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moffitt et al., 2018</xref>), and further work will be required to determine the specific cell type involved in this action of prolactin.</p><p>The fact that the very low RWA seen in late pregnancy persists throughout lactation, when the physical limitations imposed by pregnancy have resolved, points more to a hormonal mechanism being involved. Interestingly, our data suggest that prolactin is only partially involved in the ongoing suppression seen during lactation, and other factors must also be involved. A possible candidate is progesterone, which is known to decrease RWA in rodents through opposing the positive influence of estradiol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lightfoot, 2008</xref>). In mice, progesterone begins to increase around 48 hr following detection of a copulatory plug and then is high-throughout pregnancy until around 24 hr before parturition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barkley et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Murr et al., 1974</xref>). After birth, progesterone secretion is reinitiated in rodents due to prolactin-induced rescue of the corpus luteum following a postpartum ovulation. While there is evidence from progesterone receptor knockout rats that progesterone interactions with this receptor are not required for regulating RWA during the estrous cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kubota et al., 2016</xref>), it seems possible that the very high levels of progesterone seen during pregnancy and lactation are facilitating the prolactin-induced suppression of RWA as pregnancy advances and also contributing during lactation. An alternative possibility is that the ongoing suppression of RWA in lactation involves a different mechanism to that seen in pregnancy. The somatosensory inputs provided by the suckling stimulus initiated at the nipple are known to influence motor functions in the mother, promoting a quiescent, upright nursing posture (kyphosis) to allow pups to readily access and suckle at the nipples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stern and Lonstein, 2001</xref>). Conceivably, these same neural inputs may suppress motivation to engage in RWA.</p><p>Overall, the data provide novel and convincing evidence of a prolactin-mediated adaptive change in RWA during early pregnancy in mice that continues to contribute, along with other factors, to the suppression of RWA as pregnancy progresses. Collectively, the engagement of multiple signals to drive a reduction in RWA in pregnancy and lactation suggests that there must be some biological advantage to successful reproduction of inducing this profound change in behavior. Under the conditions we housed our animals in, there was not any catastrophic failure in pregnancy outcomes associated with transgenic mouse lines that engaged in more RWA during pregnancy. Under less optimal conditions, however, a failure to show this adaptive response might have more serious consequences. Whether a prolactin-mediated adaptive change in voluntary physical exercise also occurs in women during pregnancy requires attention. Prolactin, and its closely related placental analogue, placental lactogen are both highly regulated hormones during human pregnancy, among the top 1% of proteins increasing in the blood at this time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aghaeepour et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Romero et al., 2017</xref>). These changes occur progressively throughout human pregnancy, as opposed to being an immediate mating-induced increase as seen in rodents, but are still likely to be sufficiently elevated in the blood to be having effects in the brain by the end of the first trimester. It seems probable that these elevated levels of lactogenic hormones in women are contributing to the broad range of adaptations that are occurring during pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Napso et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grattan and LeTissier, 2015</xref>). As discussed above, however, in the current environment some of these changes may have become maladaptive and potentially compromise healthy behaviors. Such a possibility needs to be seriously considered in providing obstetric advice to pregnant women.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>, female and male)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">C57BL/6J</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jackson Laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Stock #:000664;

Mice received bilateral 0.8 µl injections of AAV/DJ-CMV-mCherry-iCre (1.8 × 10<sup>13</sup>, Vector Biosystems) for gene deletion group or AAV/DJ-CMV-mCherry (3.7 × 10<sup>13</sup>, Vector Biosystems) for control group into the MPOA (coordinates were 0.07 anterior to Bregma, 0.3 mm lateral to midline, and depth from top of the brain was adjusted by body weight: &lt; 22 g 4.7 mm depth, &gt; 22 g 4.9 mm). Injections were given at a rate of 80 nl/min, and the syringes were left in situ for 3 min before and 10 min following completion of injection. Mice were left to recover for 1 week, then housed individually with running wheels for at least 3 weeks prior to mating. Only mice that showed GFP staining in the MPOA, successfully went through pregnancy, and abandoned their litters as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brown et al., 2017</xref>) were included in the MPOA-specific deletion of Prlr group. For the control group, only mice that underwent surgery for control virus injection, showed no GFP staining in the MPOA, and successfully went through pregnancy were included (inclusion/exclusion for the control group was not influenced by successful nurturing of offspring, although no mice in this group abandoned their pups).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p><italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>/<italic>Camk2a</italic><sup>Cre</sup>, <italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>/<italic>Slc32a1</italic><sup>Cre</sup>, and <italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>/<italic>Kiss1</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice have been previously characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brown et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brown et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brown et al., 2019</xref>). To confirm the deletion of Prlr in this study, immunohistochemistry for prolactin-induced pSTAT5 was used for <italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>/<italic>Camk2a</italic><sup>Cre</sup> and <italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>/<italic>Slc32a1</italic><sup>Cre</sup> lines, while immunohistochemistry for GFP, which is indicative of cre-mediated recombination of the Prlr gene in this <italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup> mouse line, was used for the <italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>/<italic>Kiss1</italic><sup>Cre</sup> line. Both prolactin-induced pSTAT5 and GFP immunohistochemistry were used to demonstrate deletion of Prlr in MPOA AAV-cre-injected <italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup> mice. For pSTAT5 immunohistochemistry, mice received an i.p. injection of prolactin (5 mg/kg) 45 min before perfusion. Mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital then perfused transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were removed and processed for immunohistochemistry for GFP or pSTAT5, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brown et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, for pSTAT5 immunohistochemistry coronal brain sections (30 µm) underwent an antigen retrieval procedure consisting of incubation in 0.01 mM Tris (pH 10) at 90°C for 5 min, then were left to cool for 10 min. Sections were incubated in rabbit anti-phospho STAT5 antibody (dilution 1:1000, polyclonal rabbit anti-phospho-STAT5, Tyr 694, #9351, Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) for 48 hr. Following this, sections were incubated in biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (dilution 1:300, BA-1000, Vector Laboratories, Inc, Burlingame, CA) for 90 min and then incubated in Vector Elite avidin-biotin-HRP complex (dilution 1:100) for 60 min and labelling was visualized with nickel diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride using glucose oxidase to create a black, nuclear precipitate. For GFP, immunohistochemistry sections were incubated in anti-GFP antibody (dilution 1:20,000, polyclonal rabbit-anti GFP, A6455, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) for 48 hr at 4°C. Sections were then treated as for pSTAT5 immunohistochemistry. Chromagen immunohistochemistry was examined using a light microscope at either 10× or 20×, and numbers of positively stained cells were counted in either two sections (MPOA, PVN) or three sections (ARC, VMN) per mice and anatomically matched between mice.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>RNAscope in situ hybridization</title><p><italic>Prlr</italic> mRNA in MPOA GABA neurons was assessed by RNAscope in situ hybridization in <italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>/<italic>Camk2a</italic><sup>Cre</sup> and <italic>Prlr</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>/<italic>Slc32a1</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice and their respective littermate controls. Non-pregnant female (8–10 weeks of age, group housed) mice were perfused on random days of the estrous cycle with 2% paraformaldehyde and sections (14 µm) through the POA sliced in a cryostat and float-mounted onto SuperFrost plus slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific NZ Ltd, North Shore City, New Zealand), air dried for 1 hr at room temperature, and stored at –20°C till further processing. <italic>Prlr</italic> and <italic>Slc32a1</italic>-positive cells were detected using specific probes (Prlr: Mm-Prlr-01, targeting the nucleotide sequence in the region 1107–2147 of NM_011169.5, Cat # ADV588621, vGAT: Mm-Slc32a1-C2, targeting the nucleotide sequence in the region 894–2037 of NM_009508.2, Cat # 319191_C2) in an RNAscope 2.5HD Duplex assay in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions with minor modifications (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Hayward, CA). Briefly, sections were thawed at 55°C and post-fixed for 3 min in 2% paraformaldehyde. After incubation in RNAscope hydrogen peroxidase solution to block endogenous peroxidases, tissue was immersed in 100% ethanol then air dried. Tissue was permeabilized by incubation in RNAscope protease plus solution for 30 min at 40°C then incubated in a mixture of the <italic>Prlr</italic> probe and <italic>Slc32a1</italic> probe (1:500 ratio). This was followed by a series of amplification incubation steps between which sections were washed twice with the provided washing buffer. After amplification steps 1–6, positive hybridization for <italic>Slc32a1</italic> was detected by incubation with provided detection reagents (Fast-RED B:Fast-RED A, 1:60) for 10 min at room temperature. Following another four amplification steps interspersed with washes, positive hybridization for <italic>Prlr</italic> was detected by incubation with provided detection reagents (Green-B:Green A, 1:50) for 10 min. Slides were then dried and coverslipped using VectaMount mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). Images were taken using an AX70 Provi light microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and attached Spot RT digital camera (Spot Imaging, Sterling Heights, MI), and number of cells within the POA that displayed positive hybridization for both probes, as determined using Advanced Cell Diagnostic’s RNAscope scoring guidelines, was assessed in two sections per animal. Sections were anatomically matched between animals. Separate RNAscope in situ hybridization runs were carried out for each transgenic mouse line and hence they were analyzed separately.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were carried out with GraphPad Prism software. All group sizes refer to biological replications. p&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant, and all data are presented as the mean ± SEM. ROUT outlier test was used to determine any outliers, and outliers were removed from the data group. Student’s t-test was used to analyze daily RWA activity with different wheel types, distance traveled in EPM and OFT, virgin daily RWA, pSTAT5-positive cell number, virgin body weight, uterus weight, and fetus number. Paired Student’s t-test was used to analyze EE and ambulation in early pregnancy and total overall RWA, fine movement, and time spent engaging in different behaviors following prolactin or vehicle treatment. Two-way ANOVA followed by Sidak’s multiple comparisons test was used to analyze the change in RWA from non-pregnant (4 days prior to mating) to early pregnancy (days 1–3 of pregnancy). Repeated measures ANOVA followed by Sidak’s multiple comparisons test was used to analyze prolactin effects on RWA, ambulation, XY beam breaks, and fine movement in virgin state. One-way ANOVA was used to analyze daily EE and ambulation during the different weeks of pregnancy. Mixed effects analysis followed by Sidak’s multiple comparisons test was used to analyze changes in daily RWA, body weight, and food intake across pregnancy. Mann–Whitney test was used to analyze estrous cycle data, pup number during early lactation, GFP-positive cell number, and number of <italic>Prlr</italic>-positive, <italic>Slc32a1</italic>-positive cells determined by RNAscope in situ hybridization.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Supervision, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Supervision, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was performed in strict accordance with the Animal Welfare Act (1999) New Zealand.

provides new insights into the management of energy during pregnancy by determining that the hormone prolactin acts within the brain to immediately reduce activity when pregnancy occurs. Previously prolactin was known for its role in maintaining the corpus luteum, required for pregnancy, and in the maternal behavior and lactation associated with the postpartum period, but the findings here expands its role as well as inform about the mechanistic origins of this previously over looked behavioral response.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A reduction in voluntary physical activity during pregnancy in mice is mediated by prolactin&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Peg McCarthy as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kate Wassum as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Stephanie Padilla (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Pregnancy generally occurs in a state of positive energy balance, which can be achieved, in part, by less physical activity in the form of voluntary exercise. In this manuscript Ladyman et al., use a mouse model to investigate a neural mechanism underlying decreased voluntary exercise during early pregnancy. They show that mice are less active (voluntary exercise and home-cage activity) during pregnancy; coincident with increased levels of the hormone prolactin. Next they demonstrate that an acute injection of prolactin is sufficient to decrease WRA during the dark phase, in females but not males. Finally, using a series of genetic crosses to knock-out prolactin receptor in various cell types within the brain, they investigate the necessity of prolactin signaling to attenuate voluntary WRA in early pregnancy. The authors conclude that prolactin signaling in the MPOA is a key site by which prolactin mediates an influence on WRA.</p><p>This report provides a plausible, albeit limited, mechanistic explanation for the rapid and dramatic decrease in locomotion seen in mice following initiation of pregnancy. The purpose of the two daily surges in prolactin following successful mating has always been deemed to be the rescue and continued function of the corpus luteum, thereby maintaining the pregnancy. But the work here demonstrates a behavioral role for the prolactin as well by reducing locomotion, presumably for purposes of reducing metabolic burn in anticipation of the pending increased caloric demands.</p><p>The paper shows interesting and new findings and potentially contribute with the field by describing a new role of prolactin in the brain controlling a specific behavior. However, some points still need to be better addressed by the authors in order to strengthen their hypothesis:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The validation data of the manuscript needs to be improved. Although the authors showed that prolactin receptor deletion from VGAT positive neurons reduced the number of pSTAT5 cells in the MPOA and ARC, a lot of prolactin-induced pSTAT5 cells could still be observed. These remaining cells may not express VGAT or the deletion may affect only part of the VGAT-positive neurons. To clarify this point, a co-localization study should be performed to indicate whether the remaining pSTAT5 cells in the knockout animals express do or do not VGAT.</p><p>2) In all mouse models shown (CamK-Cre, vGat-Cre and AAV-Cre MPOA), there are some mice that showed a robust reduction in voluntary physical activity during pregnancy, whereas other animals show no reduction or even an increase in this behavior. This variability precludes the existence of a statistical significance. Or it indicates that the prolactin receptor deletion may not be equally effective in all animals. It is important that the authors discuss this variability that could be caused by several factors: a) insufficient PRLR deletion in the non-responders; b) simple biological variability; c) prolactin action is not relevant to regulate this behavior in a subset of animals. Especially regarding this last hypothesis, did the authors identify an aspect that differentiates responsive from non-responsive mice (e.g., animals that already show low activity before mating; number of pups at birth; low secretion of prolactin during pregnancy, etc.)? When analyzing the data individually by animals, it appears that the central action of prolactin regulating physical activity is not relevant for part of the animals, reinforcing the comment that the authors seem to overestimate their findings. Of note, in other behaviors, like maternal behavior, central prolactin action is necessary in 100% of animals. This does not seem to be the case for voluntary physical activity during pregnancy.</p><p>3) The reviewers agree that a strong connection between prolactin action and GABA neurons specifically in the POA was not made and that those claims need to be tempered or bolstered by additional experiments. Even though several mouse lineages were used, the authors did not provide a conclusive model that explain how prolactin action on GABAergic neurons of the preoptic area regulates the voluntary physical activity during pregnancy. In the Discussion, they postulate a possible regulation of dopamine secretion and consequently the rewarding aspect of the wheel running, but more experiments in this aspect are necessary to support this claim or these comments need to be clarified as being speculative. There are many additional questions that could be answered or speculated upon: Is the prolactin effect stimulatory or inhibitory in these cells? Is this a mono- or polysynaptic circuit that controls VTA dopamine neurons? How prolactin interacts with estrogen receptor α in the MPOA (the authors provided reference that ER-α cells in this area regulates wheel running)? How the neurocircuit that controls maternal behavior is related to the neurocircuit that controls voluntary activity (is there a overlap or they are different neurons)? Thus, additional experiments to describe the exact mechanism involved in the prolactin`s effects on voluntary activity seems to necessary otherwise this paper is mostly observational and it is actually not quite surprising that preoptic area mediates behavioral aspects controlled by prolactin (e.g., prolactin effects on maternal behavior is mediated by this area, so other behavioral modifications during the pregnancy/lactation cycle may also be part of these same neurocircuit).</p><p>4) In 2018, the authors published a paper describing reduction in voluntary physical activity in mice [PMID: 29738792]. In that study, the authors showed reduced running wheel activity, like the present study, but differently than here they showed normal spontaneous ambulatory activity inside the cages. In the present study, the authors showed reduced daily ambulation (Figure 1F). The authors did not discuss the possible explanations for these divergent findings and this is important to differentiate the behavior in running wheels (rewarding task) with simple ambulatory movements (possible exploratory behavior).</p><p>5) Although there is no doubt that deletion of prolactin receptor causes the maintenance of a higher running wheel activity during pregnancy, this behavior is still reduced during mid and late pregnancy. Thus, this behavior is not completely dependent on prolactin action. Although the authors discuss this point, the tone in many parts of the manuscript (title, abstract, results, conclusion) is that this behavior relies completely on prolactin signaling. Thus, it is important to say clearly that although prolactin regulates this behavior, there is likely other factors involved (not only in the Discussion).</p><p>6) Continuing the previous comment, the figures emphasize early pregnancy (which is when the authors found the most robust findings), but neglected mid and late pregnancy (these data are not shown in the figures as early pregnancy). Thus, the complete information about the changes in all pregnancy periods are important, especially because it is clear that prolactin receptor knockout mice still present reductions in this behavior, even though in a lesser extend compared to control animals.</p><p>7) Based on the results of this manuscript, I would expect estrous-cycle associated prolactin fluctuations to impact WRA. Given this, it is surprising that WRA is increased on proestrus, when circulating prolactin levels are high. Can the authors comment on this? Related: how do circulating levels of prolactin compare on proestrus versus early pregnancy in mice?</p><p>8) Throughout the manuscript the authors use the term &quot;virgin&quot; to refer to non-pregnant animals. Virginity is a state of never having copulated and can be entirely independent of pregnancy and so is not the correct descriptor here. Moreover, it's use suggests that the reduction in locomotion only occurs in the first pregnancy following a &quot;loss&quot; of virginity. Please replace this term with either &quot;non-pregnant&quot;, or &quot;cycling&quot;. It also raises the question, is the same degree of reduction in RWA seen in multiparous females? Or is this phenomenon limited to the first pregnancy, which would change the interpretation considerably.</p><p>9) Please include full statistical reporting (e.g., F, t statistics, degrees of freedom etc.) in the main manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.62260.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The validation data of the manuscript needs to be improved. Although the authors showed that prolactin receptor deletion from VGAT positive neurons reduced the number of pSTAT5 cells in the MPOA and ARC, a lot of prolactin-induced pSTAT5 cells could still be observed. These remaining cells may not express VGAT or the deletion may affect only part of the VGAT-positive neurons. To clarify this point, a co-localization study should be performed to indicate whether the remaining pSTAT5 cells in the knockout animals express do or do not VGAT.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge this important point. We have previously reported that vGAT-positive neurons make up about 50% of the Prlr-positive neurons in the MPOA, and our present data support that observation. We have now added new RNAScope validation data to assess the degree of Prlr knockout in VGat-positive neurons in both the CKC- and VGAT-Prlr KO lines. These data have been added to figure 4 supplementary data (Figure 4 Suppl. 1B and Figure 4 Suppl. 2B), and show that the vast majority of vGat positive cells have lost Prlr expression in both of these models, and that the majority of the remaining Prlr expression is in vGat-negative neurons. This is particularly interesting for the CKC-line, which we originally included to provide a global Prlr knockout in neurons, but in the MPOA, we found that it only targets about 50% of the Prlr-expressing neurons (likely with considerable overlap with the vGat line). We have also expanded our discussion on these transgenic mouse lines, adding citations to papers containing additional validation studies characterising these lines (lines 210-219, 284-291).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In all mouse models shown (CamK-Cre, vGat-Cre and AAV-Cre MPOA), there are some mice that showed a robust reduction in voluntary physical activity during pregnancy, whereas other animals show no reduction or even an increase in this behavior. This variability precludes the existence of a statistical significance. Or it indicates that the prolactin receptor deletion may not be equally effective in all animals. It is important that the authors discuss this variability that could be caused by several factors: a) insufficient PRLR deletion in the non-responders; b) simple biological variability; c) prolactin action is not relevant to regulate this behavior in a subset of animals. Especially regarding this last hypothesis, did the authors identify an aspect that differentiates responsive from non-responsive mice (e.g., animals that already show low activity before mating; number of pups at birth; low secretion of prolactin during pregnancy, etc.)? When analyzing the data individually by animals, it appears that the central action of prolactin regulating physical activity is not relevant for part of the animals, reinforcing the comment that the authors seem to overestimate their findings. Of note, in other behaviors, like maternal behavior, central prolactin action is necessary in 100% of animals. This does not seem to be the case for voluntary physical activity during pregnancy.</p></disp-quote><p>As with any biological result there will always a degree of variation, and factors such as stress (which can acutely increase running wheel activity) cannot be ruled out as things that may influence an individual RWA measurement on any particular day. Basal levels of RWA are very variable between individuals, even in inbred mouse strains such C57BL6/J, but do seem to be quite consistent within each individual (leading some groups to pre-screen to select “high runners” or “low runners” for studies of this type PMID:9670598, PMID: 30071007). We did not try to pre-select for any particular behaviour, but rather attempted to deal with the biological variation through using appropriate group sizes and using a longitudinal study design comparing the pregnancy-induced change in RWA levels in each mouse individually as a percentage of its pre-pregnancy levels. We have not focused on absolute RWA distance, since we were specifically interested in the early pregnancy-induced change in behaviour within each individual. We have increased our use of individual data points in our figures to highlight these pregnancy-induced changes. As shown in figure 1D, despite the wide variability in absolute levels of running, and the potential for confounding factors to influence running over multiple testing days across the experiment, only 3 mice out of more than 60 demonstrated an increase in RWA in pregnancy. Out of our various control groups for the transgenic mouse studies, we only observed 2 animals that did not show a decrease in RWA% after successful mating. For a behaviour response, we have found this observation to be quite robust.</p><p>In response to this comment, we have assessed the possibility that additional variation has been introduced by “insufficient Prlr deletion” in some animals (Figure 4 supplementary 1 and 2). We did find that Prlr deletion was never 100% of the targeted population, but the levels of expression found after the various modes of Prlr deletion were actually remarkably consistent. Hence, we do not consider that variable degree of KO is a significant contributing factor to the variation in behavioral response. Nevertheless, we do agree that deletion of Prlr from the right subpopulation of neurons was important, and that not all of our manipulations have fully targeted that population. The most effective manipulation on the behaviour was the AAV-Cre mediated deletion of Prlr from the MPOA, and this also was most effective in terms of loss of functional responses to Prlr, targeting all of the heterogeneous populations of Prlr expressing neurons in this region.</p><p>With respect to the specific question about whether prolactin action is “not relevant in some animals”, we do not think this is supported by the data. As mentioned above, the pregnancy-induced suppression of RWA was robust and was observed in over 95% of control animals. Perhaps this is highlighted best in the source data provided with figure 4. We probably have insufficient “non-responders” to make strong conclusions, but we could not discern any aspect that differentiated these mice from the majority of mice that showed the characteristic early pregnancy response (for example assessing activity levels before mating, numbers of pups, degree of prolactin receptor deletion in the transgenic mouse lines). Most likely, we believe this might have been some non-specific variability introduced by the animals’ state of stress or anxiety on the day of measurement. The loss of the early pregnany effect in the 3 different KO groups was also remarkably consistent. Indeed, in our experience, the effect of the Prlr KO on RWA activity was more pronounced than that seen for maternal behaviour. Both the CKC and vGat-induced deletion of Prlr expressed relatively normal maternal behaviour, presumably because the remaining Prlr expression in the MPOA (approx. 50% of neurons) was sufficient to express this behaviour. It was only when we knocked out Prlr in all neurons in the MPOA (using the AAV-Cre) did we see failure of maternal behaviour (as reported previously, and replicated here). This may mean that it is the other, non-vGat neurons in the MPOA that are more important for maternal behaviour, or that these circuits can compensate for a partial loss in Prlr-mediate inputs. In contrast, the pregnancy-induced reduction in RWA was lost to a significant degree in all 3 different Prlr KO groups. We have added this to the discussion (lines 503-509)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The reviewers agree that a strong connection between prolactin action and GABA neurons specifically in the POA was not made and that those claims need to be tempered or bolstered by additional experiments. Even though several mouse lineages were used, the authors did not provide a conclusive model that explain how prolactin action on GABAergic neurons of the preoptic area regulates the voluntary physical activity during pregnancy. In the Discussion, they postulate a possible regulation of dopamine secretion and consequently the rewarding aspect of the wheel running, but more experiments in this aspect are necessary to support this claim or these comments need to be clarified as being speculative. There are many additional questions that could be answered or speculated upon: Is the prolactin effect stimulatory or inhibitory in these cells? Is this a mono- or polysynaptic circuit that controls VTA dopamine neurons? How prolactin interacts with estrogen receptor α in the MPOA (the authors provided reference that ER-α cells in this area regulates wheel running)? How the neurocircuit that controls maternal behavior is related to the neurocircuit that controls voluntary activity (is there a overlap or they are different neurons)? Thus, additional experiments to describe the exact mechanism involved in the prolactin`s effects on voluntary activity seems to necessary otherwise this paper is mostly observational and it is actually not quite surprising that preoptic area mediates behavioral aspects controlled by prolactin (e.g., prolactin effects on maternal behavior is mediated by this area, so other behavioral modifications during the pregnancy/lactation cycle may also be part of these same neurocircuit).</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that many of the questions raised in this comment remain unanswered, and we have tried to ensure that our discussion of the current set of data has been appropriately tempered such that it does not overstate the evidence. We have focused on trying to narrow down the site of action of prolactin in mediating this behavioural response. We accept that in hindsight, the role of the MPOA in mediating these responses is perhaps not surprising, because prolactin exerts such significant effects on maternal behaviours through this region, and because single cell RNASeq studies have confirmed that it contains such a heterogeneous range of neuronal populations that express the Prlr (PMID:30385464). But at the outset of these experiments, we did not predict this. While a few studies have linked the MPOA to RWA, most studies looking at RWA focused on other circuits, such a lateral hypothalamus inputs to the VTA (PMID: 26341832, PMID: 30010830, PMID:30069057), or the evidence showing a role for arcuate kisspeptin neurons in influencing RWA (PMID:30744968). In fact, we were most surprised when we found that deletion of Prlr on kisspeptin neurons had little effect, as this was our favoured hypothesis <italic>a priori</italic>. We have now tried to incorporate these additional questions into the discussion, and ensured that we are quite clear about what our data shows, and what is speculation about potential mechanism that will require extensive additional experimentation to assess (lines 364-373, 459-473). As discussed in point 2, above, while there might be overlap with the circuits controlled pup-directed maternal behaviour, there are also differences, in that maternal behaviour seems to cope better with Prlr deletion from sub populations (such as vGat containing neurons), whereas the prolactin effect on RWA was largely lost with the sub-population-specific deletion of Prlr.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In 2018, the authors published a paper describing reduction in voluntary physical activity in mice [PMID: 29738792].

This impacts on their time available for engagement in other ambulatory movements in the cage (for example, we have found that nonpregnant mice with access to wheels will only walk about 100m per day around their cage, whereas when housed without wheels, their ambulatory activity is doubled PMID:29738792). In the new data, to specifically assess ambulatory activity, we housed the mice without access to running wheels, and thus, their physical activity levels were only simple ambulatory movements. In both cases, the total engagement with physical activity was lowered by pregnancy. We have included this information in the text (lines 98-99, 107-112, 148). In the mice with access to running wheels, the reduction in overall activity was only detected as a major reduction in RWA, likely because this accounts for by far the greatest proportion of their overall physical activity levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Although there is no doubt that deletion of prolactin receptor causes the maintenance of a higher running wheel activity during pregnancy, this behavior is still reduced during mid and late pregnancy. Thus, this behavior is not completely dependent on prolactin action. Although the authors discuss this point, the tone in many parts of the manuscript (title, abstract, results, conclusion) is that this behavior relies completely on prolactin signaling. Thus, it is important to say clearly that although prolactin regulates this behavior, there is likely other factors involved (not only in the Discussion).</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge this point, and agree that there are important distinctions to be made. It is clear that during mid and late pregnancy other factors also contribute to reducing overall levels of RWA, and we hypothesize that weight gain and physical constraint caused by fetal growth are likely to be involved. It is also possible that other pregnancy-specific biological factors contribute (such as the rising levels of progesterone). We have changed the title and abstract to be clearer on this, and added further data addressing this point, and extensive additional discussion (lines 36-37, 93-95, 249-265, 318-328, 396-397, 416-420, 475-495, 522-526, 535-540). The most obvious role for prolactin is seen in early pregnancy, apparently driving the abrupt decrease in RWA in the first 1-2 days following mating. While it is clear is that some other factors are involved in the progressive further reduction of RWA seen in the 2<sup>nd</sup> and third trimesters, our data demonstrate that prolactin still plays a role throughout this period, as the KO mice still run more than controls at all timepoints during pregnancy, even when heavily pregnant in the days leading up to parturition. We have also added additional data evaluating RWA during lactation (Figure 7). Here, the physical constraints of pregnancy have resolved, but the suppression of RWA is sustained. Interestingly, our data support a role for prolactin in suppressing RWA in the initial stages of lactation, but this is not sufficient to account for the complete suppression of RWA right through until weaning. We provide some discussion about what those other factors might be. Collectively, the engagement of multiple signals to drive a reduction in RWA in pregnancy and lactation suggests that there must be some biological advantage to successful reproduction of inducing this profound change in behavior. Under the conditions we housed our animals in, there were some consequences of the increased running activity on pregnancy outcome, in terms of pup growth – but there was not any catastrophic failure. Under less optimal conditions, however, a failure to show this adaptive response might have more serious consequences.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Continuing the previous comment, the figures emphasize early pregnancy (which is when the authors found the most robust findings), but neglected mid and late pregnancy (these data are not shown in the figures as early pregnancy).

As indicated in the comment, this shows the ongoing contribution of prolactin to the suppression of RWA at these later timepoints. As mentioned above, we have also added a figure evaluating the role of Prlr in lactational changes in RWA (Figure 7, 399-410, 522-526, 535-540), and added additional discussion about this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Based on the results of this manuscript, I would expect estrous-cycle associated prolactin fluctuations to impact WRA. Given this, it is surprising that WRA is increased on proestrus, when circulating prolactin levels are high. Can the authors comment on this? Related: how do circulating levels of prolactin compare on proestrus versus early pregnancy in mice?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a fascinating question, and one that we have also considered. In fact, the increase in RWA during the estrous cycle is detected during the night leading up to proestrus (i.e. is measured on proestrus, but represents what has happened in the 24 hours prior to proestrus. RWA is then reduced over the next 24 hours leading up into estrus (including the time of ovulation and the expression of reproductive behaviour)). There is actually very little data showing high circulating prolactin levels on proestrus in mice. While one early study (Michael 1976, PMID: 1033549) found increased prolactin at the start of the dark phase on proestrus in a mixed bred strain, others using this same strain of mouse only detected a much smaller increase in prolactin concentrations that did not occur until after the start of the dark phase (Deleon et al., 1990 PMID: 2374113). In other studies, no significant rise in prolactin was detected on proestrus and any mild elevation was seen in the middle of the dark phase (Yani and Nalasawa 1974, Sinha et al., 1976 PMID: 1237395). In particular, Shinha et al., 1976 (PMID: 1237395) measured prolactin levels in the afternoon of proestrus in C57BL6 mice and found no significant increase. Because of this lack of information, we have recently completed a study evaluating serum prolactin during the estrous cycle in mice (Phillipps et al., in preparation). The bottom line is that we can detect a small but significant rise in prolactin on proestrus, compared with diestrus. While it does peak in the afternoon of proestrus, around the time of the preovulatory LH surge, it is not as pronounced and well-defined as the proestrous prolactin surge seen in rats. Importantly for the current discussion, however, this rise in prolactin is occurring at a time when RWA is declining, after a peak on the night leading up to proestrus. Our previous work (Larsen et al., PMID: 20484459) has shown robust mating-induced surges in prolactin secretion from the afternoon of day 1 of pregnancy, before the start of the dark phase, which would be the timing when increased endogenous prolactin may have the most influence on peak running wheel activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Throughout the manuscript the authors use the term &quot;virgin&quot; to refer to non-pregnant animals. Virginity is a state of never having copulated and can be entirely independent of pregnancy and so is not the correct descriptor here. Moreover, it's use suggests that the reduction in locomotion only occurs in the first pregnancy following a &quot;loss&quot; of virginity. Please replace this term with either &quot;non-pregnant&quot;, or &quot;cycling&quot;. It also raises the question, is the same degree of reduction in RWA seen in multiparous females? Or is this phenomenon limited to the first pregnancy, which would change the interpretation considerably.</p></disp-quote><p>This point is well-made, and we have modified the text as suggested. For accuracy, we have adopted the term: “non-pregnant, non lactating” as the description for these animals, and having defined that, more typically use the term “non-pregnant” in referring to this group. Although we like the term “cycling”, we have found that this is confusing for many researchers who are not routinely thinking about the estrous cycle of mice (particularly in a paper about running!). The question regarding what happens with multiparity is an excellent one. At this stage, we do not know, but the fact that “non pregnant” levels of RWA activity return immediately upon weaning of pups would suggest that this is a transient effect specific to pregnancy and lactation, and would be likely to be repeated in subsequent pregnancies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Please include full statistical reporting (e.g., F, t statistics, degrees of freedom etc.) in the main manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been done, as requested.</p></body></sub-article></article>
