neurodegeneration, depending on cell-type and cellular contexts. Emerging evidence implicates abnormal DLK signaling in several neurodegenerative diseases. However, our understanding of the DLK-dependent gene network in the central nervous system remains limited. Here, we investigated the roles of DLK in hippocampal glutamatergic neurons using conditional knockout and induced overexpression mice. We found that dorsal CA1 and dentate gyrus neurons are vulnerable to elevated expression of DLK, while CA3 neurons appear less vulnerable. We identified the DLK-dependent translatome that includes conserved molecular signatures and displays cell-type specificity. Increasing DLK signaling is associated with disruptions to microtubules, potentially involving STMN4. Additionally, primary cultured hippocampal neurons expressing different levels of DLK show altered neurite outgrowth, axon specification, and synapse formation. The identification of translational targets of DLK in hippocampal glutamatergic neurons has relevance to our understanding of selective neuron vulnerability under stress and pathological conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>microtubules</kwd><kwd>RiboTag profiling</kwd><kwd>stathmin</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>c-Jun</kwd><kwd>neuron degeneration</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 127314</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jin</surname><given-names>Yishi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012378</institution-id><institution>Kavli Institute for Brain and Mind, University of California, San Diego</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2020-1711</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ritchie</surname><given-names>Erin M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>TÃBÄ°TAK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2214-A</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Acar</surname><given-names>Dilan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>DLK signaling network reveals the conserved function in neuritogenesis and synapse formation, and highlights the regulation of c-Jun translation and microtubule homeostasis in hippocampal selective neuron vulnerability.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mammalian Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase (MAP3K12) Dual Leucine Zipper Kinase (DLK) is broadly expressed in the nervous system from early development to mature adults. DLK exerts its effects primarily through signal transduction cascades involving downstream MAP2Ks (MKK4, MKK7) and MAPKs (JNK, p38, ERK), which then phosphorylate many proteins, such as transcription factors including c-Jun, to regulate cellular responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asghari Adib et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hirai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Itoh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jin and Zheng, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tedeschi and Bradke, 2013</xref>). In cultured neurons, DLK is localized to axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hirai et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lewcock et al., 2007</xref>), dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pozniak et al., 2013</xref>), and the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hirai et al., 2002</xref>). DLK is also associated with transporting vesicles, which are considered platforms for DLK to serve as a sensor of neuronal stress or injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Holland et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tortosa et al., 2022</xref>). Despite broad expression, functional investigations of DLK have been limited to a few cell types under specific conditions.</p><p>Constitutive DLK knockout (KO) mice, generated by removing the N-terminus of DLK, including the ATP binding motif of the kinase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hirai et al., 2006</xref>), or by deleting the entire kinase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ghosh et al., 2011</xref>), die perinatally. The development of the embryonic nervous system is largely normal, with mild defects in radial migration and axon track formation in the developing cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hirai et al., 2006</xref>) and neuronal apoptosis during development of spinal motor neurons and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ghosh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Itoh et al., 2011</xref>). Selective removal of DLK in layer 2/3 cortical neurons starting at E16.5 results in increased dendritic spine volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pozniak et al., 2013</xref>). Induced deletion of DLK in adult mice causes no obvious brain structural defects; synapse size and density in hippocampus and cortex appear unaltered, although basal synaptic strength is mildly increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pozniak et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, under injury or stress conditions, DLK exhibits critical context-specific roles. In DRG neurons, DLK is required for nerve growth factor withdrawal induced death, promotes neurite regrowth, and is also involved in retrograde injury signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ghosh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Holland et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Itoh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Shin et al., 2012</xref>). In a spinal cord injury model, DLK is required for <italic>Pten</italic> deletion<italic>-</italic>induced axon regeneration and sprouting as well as spontaneous sprouting of uninjured corticospinal tract neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Saikia et al., 2022</xref>). In optic nerve crush assay, DLK is necessary for <italic>Pten</italic> deletion<italic>-</italic>induced axon regeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGC), but also contributes to injury-induced RGC death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Watkins et al., 2013</xref>). In a mouse model of stroke, increased DLK expression is associated with motor recovery following knockdown of the CCR5 chemokine receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Joy et al., 2019</xref>). These studies reveal critical roles of DLK in development, maintenance, and repair of neuronal circuits.</p><p>DLK is known to be expressed in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blouin et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hirai et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mata et al., 1996</xref>). Loss of DLK, either constitutively or in adult animals, causes no discernable effect on hippocampal morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hirai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pozniak et al., 2013</xref>). Microarray-based gene expression analysis did not detect significant changes associated with loss of DLK in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pozniak et al., 2013</xref>). However, following exposure to kainic acid, loss of DLK, or preventing phosphorylation of the downstream transcription factor c-Jun, significantly reduces neuron death in hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Behrens et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pozniak et al., 2013</xref>). Additionally, elevated levels of p-c-Jun are observed in hippocampus of patients with Alzheimerâs disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Le Pichon et al., 2017</xref>). Induced human neurons treated with ApoE4, a prevalent ApoE variant associated with Alzheimerâs disease, also show upregulation of DLK, which leads to enhanced transcription of APP and thus AÎ² levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huang et al., 2017</xref>). These data suggest that transcriptional changes downstream of DLK may be an important aspect of its signaling in hippocampal neuron degeneration under pathological conditions.</p><p>Here, we investigate the DLK-dependent molecular and cellular network in hippocampal glutamatergic neurons, which show selective vulnerability in Alzheimerâs disease, ischemic stroke, and excitotoxic injury. Using DLK conditional knockout and overexpression mice, we reveal hippocampal regional differences in neuronal death upon elevated DLK signaling. We describe translational changes in hippocampal glutamatergic neurons using RiboTag-seq analysis. We show that the key transcription factor c-Jun and a member of the stathmin family, STMN4, display DLK-dependent translation. Our analyses on hippocampal tissues and cultured neurons support the conclusion that the DLK-dependent signaling network has important roles in the regulation of microtubule homeostasis, neuritogenesis, and synapse formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>DLK conditional knockout in differentiating and mature glutamatergic neurons does not alter gross morphology of hippocampus</title><p>As a first step to define the roles of DLK in hippocampal glutamatergic neurons, we verified DLK expression (encoded by <italic>Map3k12</italic>) in hippocampal tissue by RNAscope analysis.

In hippocampus <italic>Slc17a7<sup>Cre</sup></italic> (encoding VGLUT1) express Cre recombinase strongly in CA3 and in a subset of pyramidal neurons close to stratum oriens in CA1 at P4, with broad expression in both CA1 and CA3 by P14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harris et al., 2014</xref>). In dentate gyrus, expression of <italic>Slc17a7<sup>Cre</sup></italic> begins in neurons nearer the molecular layer around P4, with expression spreading towards the polymorph layer gradually during the first two postnatal months. By western blot analysis of hippocampal protein extracts, we found that full-length DLK protein was significantly reduced in DLK(cKO) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). The DLK antibody also detected a protein product of lower molecular weight at much reduced levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). As <italic>Map3k12</italic> mRNA lacking the floxed exon was expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>), this lower-molecular weight protein could be produced by using a downstream alternative start codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C1</xref>), but would lack the N-terminal palmitoylation motif and ATP-binding site that are essential for DLK activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Holland et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Huntwork-Rodriguez et al., 2013</xref>).

Induced human neurons show increased DLK abundance about ~fourfold in response to ApoE4 treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huang et al., 2019</xref>). Increased expression of DLK can lead to its activation through dimerization and autophosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nihalani et al., 2000</xref>). We thus asked how increased DLK signaling affects hippocampal glutamatergic neurons. We previously described a transgenic mouse, H11-DLK(iOE), which allows Cre-dependent DLK overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Li et al., 2021</xref>). The DLK transgene is coexpressed with tdTomato through a T2A peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D</xref>).

Additional analysis at the mRNA level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> WT vs DLK(iOE) DEGs) and at the protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1E</xref>) suggest that the increase in DLK abundance was around three times the control level. The localization patterns of DLK protein appeared to vary depending on region of hippocampus and age of animals in both control and DLK(iOE) mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>DLK(iOE) mice were born normally, and developed noticeable progressive motor deficits around four months of age, which became worse by one year of age. We stained brain sections for NeuN at P10, P15, P60, and 1 year of age and observed a progressive reduction in brain size of these mice, compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2B and C</xref>).

By P15, the DLK(iOE) mice showed significant thinning of the CA1 pyramidal layer. We detected increased TUNEL staining signals in CA1 pyramidal layer, compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3F and G</xref>). By P60, most CA1 pyramidal neurons were lost, while DG began to show thinning, which continued to worsen at 1 year of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1F, I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2B and C</xref>).

Additionally, in P60, dorsal CA1 showed significantly fewer surviving neurons, while ventral CA1 pyramidal layer thickness appeared more similar to control than dorsal regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2A and B</xref>). Neuronal death generally induces reactive astrogliosis. We stained for GFAP, a marker of astrocyte reactivity.

Microglia appeared ramified in control mice and more reactive-looking in DLK(iOE) mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3E</xref>).

The genes upregulated in DLK(iOE) (114) had enrichment in GO terms related to apoptosis, cell migration, cell adhesion, and the extracellular matrix organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), whereas the genes downregulated (146) had GO terms related to synaptic communication and ion transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Similar GO terms were also identified using the list of genes coordinately regulated by DLK, derived from our RRHO analysis. Among the genes upregulated in DLK(iOE), some were known to be involved in neurite outgrowth (<italic>Plat</italic>, <italic>Tspan7, Hap1</italic>), endocytosis or endosomal trafficking (<italic>Snx16, Ston2, Hap1</italic>), whereas the genes down-regulated in DLK(iOE) included ion channel subunits (<italic>Cacng8, Cacng3, Grin2b, Scn1a</italic>) and those in exocytosis and calcium related proteins (<italic>Doc2b, Hpca, Cadps2, Rab3c, Rph3a</italic>). A significant cluster of differentially expressed genes in DLK(iOE) included those that regulate AMPA receptors (<italic>Nptx1, Nptxr, Cnih3, Gpc4, Arc, Tspan7</italic>) and cell adhesion molecules (<italic>Nectin1, Flrt3, Pcdh8, Plxnd1</italic>). A further survey using SynGO, a curated resource for genes related to synapse formation and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Koopmans et al., 2019</xref>), revealed 42 of 260 differentially expressed genes in DLK(iOE) showed significant enrichment in synaptic organization and postsynaptic receptor signaling processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Conversely, 10 of the 36 differentially expressed genes in DLK(cKO) were annotated to function in similar synaptic processes as in DLK(iOE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1J</xref>). The bioinformatic analysis suggests that increased DLK expression can promote translation of genes related to neurite outgrowth and branching and reduce those related to the maturation and function of synapses.</p><p>The hippocampus is comprised of multiple glutamatergic neuron types with distinct spatial patterns of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lein et al., 2004</xref>). As we observed regional vulnerability to DLK overexpression, we next asked if the differentially expressed genes associated with DLK(iOE) might show correlation to the neuronal vulnerability. We first surveyed the endogenous expression pattern of the 260 significantly changed genes in DLK(iOE) in hippocampus using in situ data from 8-week-old mice from the Allen Brain Atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lein et al., 2007</xref>). We found that about a third of the genes downregulated in DLK(iOE) showed enriched expression in CA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1G</xref>), and some of these genes, including <italic>Tenm3, Lamp5,</italic> and <italic>Mpped1,</italic> were up-regulated in DLK(cKO) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1H and I</xref>). In comparison, about 50% of the genes upregulated in DLK(iOE) showed comparable expression among hippocampal cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1F</xref>). Additionally, among the 42 synaptic genes that were differentially expressed in DLK(iOE), a notable portion of the downregulated genes showed enriched expression in CA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>), while the upregulated genes were expressed in all regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).</p><p>Additionally, we compared our Slc17a7-RiboTag datasets with CamK2-RiboTag and Grik4-RiboTag datasets from 6-week-old wild type mice reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">TraunmÃ¼ller et al., 2023</xref>; GSE209870. We defined a list of genes enriched in CamK2-expressing CA1 neurons relative to Grik4-expressing CA3 neurons (CA1 genes), and those enriched in Grik4-expressing CA3 neurons (CA3 genes) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). When compared with the entire list of Slc17a7-RiboTag profiling in our control and DLK(cKO), we found CA1 genes tended to be expressed more in DLK(cKO), compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1K</xref>), while CA3 genes showed a slight enrichment in control though the trend was less significant and less clustered towards one genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1L</xref>). Moreover, many CA1 genes related to cell-type specification, such as <italic>Foxp1</italic>, <italic>Satb2</italic>, <italic>Wfs1</italic>, <italic>Gpr161</italic>, <italic>Adcy8</italic>, <italic>Ndst3</italic>, <italic>Chrna5</italic>, <italic>Ldb2</italic>, <italic>Ptpru</italic>, and <italic>Ntm,</italic> did not show significant downregulation when DLK was overexpressed. These observations imply that DLK likely specifically down-regulates CA1 genes both under normal conditions and when overexpressed, with a stronger effect on CA1 genes, compared to CA3 genes. Overall, the informatic analysis suggests that decreased expression of CA1 enriched genes may contribute to CA1 neuron vulnerability to elevated DLK, although it is also possible that the observed down-regulation of these genes is a secondary effect associated with CA1 neuron degeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>DLK regulates translation of JUN and STMN4</title><p>The transcription factor c-Jun is a key downstream factor in DLK and JNK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hirai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Itoh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Welsbie et al., 2017</xref>). Our RiboTag analysis suggests that expression and translation of <italic>Jun</italic> mRNA to be significantly dependent on DLK expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). To further test this observation, we performed immunostaining of hippocampal tissues using an antibody recognizing total c-Jun. In control mice, glutamatergic neurons in CA1 had low but detectable c-Jun immunostaining at P10 and P15, but reduced intensity at P60; those in CA3 showed an overall low level of c-Jun immunostaining at P10, P15, and P60; and those in DG showed a low level of c-Jun immunostaining at P10 and P15, and an increased intensity at P60 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A, C and E</xref>). In DLK(iOE) mice at P10 when no discernable neuron degeneration was seen in any regions of hippocampus, only CA3 neurons showed a significant increase of immunostaining intensity of c-Jun, compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). In P15 mice, we observed further increased immunostaining intensity of c-Jun in CA1, CA3, and DG, with the strongest increase (~fourfold) in CA1, compared to age-matched control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2C</xref>). The overall increased c-Jun staining is consistent with RiboTag analysis. We also analyzed DLK(cKO) mice at P60, and observed a trend for decreased c-Jun in CA3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2E</xref>); the modest effects of DLK(cKO) on c-Jun proteins could be due to detection limitations for low levels of c-Jun. As phosphorylation of c-Jun (p-c-Jun) is known to reflect activation of DLK and JNK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hirai et al., 2006</xref>), we further investigated p-c-Jun levels in these mice. In control mice at P10, P15, only a few neuronal nuclei showed strong staining with p-c-Jun in CA1, CA3 and DG. In DLK(iOE) mice, we observed increased p-c-Jun-positive nuclei in CA1 at P10, and strong increase in CA1 (~tenfold), CA3 (~sixfold), and DG (~eightfold) at P15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2B and D</xref>). The levels of p-c-Jun remained elevated in the surviving neurons in all three regions of DLK(iOE) mice at P60 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2C</xref>). In DLK(cKO) mice, p-c-Jun levels in CA3 showed a significant reduction, with the trend of reduced levels in CA1 and DG, compared to control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2F</xref>, P60). These results are consistent with a conclusion that translation of <italic>Jun</italic> mRNAs and phosphorylation of c-Jun show dependency on levels of DLK, with CA1 neurons showing higher dependence upon DLK overexpression.</p><p>The Stathmin family of proteins is thought to regulate microtubules through sequestering tubulin dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Charbaut et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chauvin and Sobel, 2015</xref>).

In control mice, we detected the levels of STMN4 to peak around P8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1B, C, F and G</xref>). The abundance of STMN4 in DLK(cKO) and DLK(iOE) was subtly altered, which could be due to broad expression of STMN4 in hippocampus masking specific changes in glutamatergic neurons. We thus examined <italic>Stmn4</italic> mRNAs in hippocampus by RNAscope. <italic>Stmn4</italic> mRNAs were present in glutamatergic neurons across all regions of the hippocampus, with strongest expression in CA1 pyramidal neurons.

To assess whether DLK affects microtubules in hippocampal glutamatergic neurons, we performed Tuj1 immunostaining. We did not detect obvious changes in DLK(cKO) when compared to controls at P60 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In DLK(iOE) mice at P15, expression levels and patterns of neuronal microtubules in each region of hippocampus appeared similar to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2E</xref>), although we found the overall Tuj1 staining pattern at P15 to be less defined and consistent. By P60, many CA1 neurons died and the hippocampus exhibited thinning of all strata within CA1, and the Tuj1 staining pattern became less organized in parallel dendrites in the stratum radiatum (SR) region of CA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). Increased Tuj1 staining in thin branches extended in varied directions, with bright staining seen in the apical dendrites near the pyramidal neuron cell body.</p><p>Several post-translational modifications of microtubules are thought to correlate with stable or dynamic state of microtubules. To explore whether DLK expression levels affected microtubule post-translational modifications, we performed immunostaining for acetylated tubulin, a modification generally associated with stable, longer-lived microtubules, and tyrosinated tubulin, a terminal amino acid that can be removed and is typically found on dynamic microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Janke and Magiera, 2020</xref>). We detected no significant difference in the staining pattern and intensity of either tyrosinated tubulin or acetylated tubulin in DLK(cKO) mice, compared with age-matched control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4NâR</xref>). In DLK(iOE) mice at P15, both tubulin modifications showed no significant differences in pattern or intensity in CA1 SR, compared to age-matched control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4EâH</xref>), despite neuron death beginning in CA1. By P60, we observed increased staining intensity of acetylated tubulin and tyrosinated tubulin in the apical dendrites of surviving neurons in DLK(iOE) mice, particularly with tyrosinated tubulin staining revealing bright signals on small, thin branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4JâM</xref>). To discern whether such microtubule modification changes were from neurons, we immunostained tissue sections with antibodies for MAP2, a neuron specific microtubule associated protein. We observed bright MAP2 signal in thin branches extending in varied directions in DLK(iOE) mice, compared to age-matched control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2F and G</xref>).

To evaluate this observation, we examined synapses in the hippocampus by immunostaining for Bassoon, a core protein in the presynaptic active zone, Vesicular Glutamate Transporter 1 (VGLUT1) for synaptic vesicles, and Homer1, a post-synaptic scaffolding protein. In control mice and DLK(cKO) at P60, Bassoon staining in stratum radiatum (SR) of dorsal CA1, where CA3 neurons synapse onto CA1 dendrites, showed discrete puncta that were mostly apposed to the postsynaptic marker Homer1, representing properly formed synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We measured size and density by counting Bassoon and Homer1 puncta and the sites where Bassoon and Homer1 overlap, a proxy for synapses. We detected no significant difference in DLK(cKO), compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5AâF</xref>). To assess effects of DLK overexpression on synapses, we immunostained hippocampal sections from both P10 and P15, with age-matched littermate controls. Quantification of Bassoon and Homer1 immunostaining revealed no significant differences in CA1 SR and CA3 SR and SL in P10 mice of DLK(iOE) and control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2AâF</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3AâJ</xref>).

In DIV2 neurons from control mice, DLK was present in cell soma, likely reflecting Golgi apparatus localization as reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hirai et al., 2002</xref>), and showed a punctate pattern in neurites, particularly the axon growth cone regions. We also immunostained for STMN4 and observed a similar punctate localization in the cell soma, neurites, and growth cones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), in line with published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chauvin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gavet et al., 2002</xref>). STMN4 puncta appeared to be non-overlapping with DLK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). In DIV2 neurons from DLK(cKO), STMN4 exhibited a similar punctate pattern, with intensity comparable to that in control neurons.

In our control cultures at DIV2, the majority of tdTomato labeled neurons developed multiple neurites from the cell soma, with one neurite developing into an axon, defined here as a neurite longer than 90 Âµm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Additionally, thin, often short, neurites were observed branching off from the cell soma, axons, dendrites, and growth cones. In DLK(cKO) cultures at DIV2, we observed a trend of more neurons without an axon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), though the differentiated axons appeared morphologically indistinguishable from control. The total number of neurites around the cell soma in DLK(cKO) neurons was significantly reduced, compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and D</xref>). In DLK(iOE) cultures at DIV2, we observed a significant increase in the percentage of neurons without an axon and also neurons with multiple axons, compared to control cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Moreover, neurons expressing high levels of DLK protein displayed an increased number of neurites either around the cell soma as primary neurites or as secondary neurites, compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and D</xref>). Such neurites were typically thin, and frequently appeared short, like filopodia. These thin neurites sometimes developed a rounded tip and showed beading appearance, resembling degeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and E</xref>). These data suggest a role for DLK in neurite formation and axon specification in cultured hippocampal glutamatergic neurons.</p><p>We further analyzed microtubules in individual neurites of the DIV2 neurons. Control neurons exhibited staining for tyrosinated tubulin in differentiated axons and dendrites as well as filopodia and towards peripheral regions of growth cones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Acetylated tubulin was present in differentiated axons and dendrites and in the central region of growth cones where stable microtubules were present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>), and was absent from filopodia and microtubules in the peripheral regions of growth cones. The thin neurites in neurons expressing very high levels of DLK appeared to have thin bundles of microtubules, and these neurites generally were not associated with a growth cone or microtubules splaying apart at the end as was common in WT growth cones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Neurites from neurons with high DLK expression also had tyrosinated tubulin, while acetylated tubulin was frequently absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and F</xref>). Additionally, STMN4 was present in the thin neurites, especially in those with high levels of DLK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), suggesting the thin neurites may likely be dynamic in nature. These results suggest that in cultured hippocampal neurons high levels of DLK promotes formation of short, thin, dynamic branches.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Increased DLK expression alters synapses in primary hippocampal neurons</title><p>Our RiboTag data showed enrichment of synaptic genes in both DLK(cKO) and DLK(iOE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1J</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> WT vs DLK(cKO) DEGs, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> WT vs DLK(iOE) DEGs).

DLK(iOE) neurons also formed spines that tended to be more immature, with significantly fewer mushroom spines and a higher percentage of thin spines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D, F and G</xref>). These results reveal that expression levels of DLK appear to be inversely correlated with spine density and maturity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Selective vulnerability of hippocampal glutamatergic neurons to increased DLK expression</title><p>Under normal conditions, the abundance of endogenous DLK in many parts of the brain is generally kept at a low level. Elevated DLK signaling has been associated with traumatic injury and implicated in Alzheimerâs disease and other neurodegenerative conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asghari Adib et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jin and Zheng, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Le Pichon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tedeschi and Bradke, 2013</xref>). Despite its broad expression, we know little about DLKâs role in the central nervous system. In this study, we combined conditional knockout and overexpression of DLK to uncover its roles in the hippocampal glutamatergic neurons. Our finding that conditional deletion of DLK in the glutamatergic neurons using <italic>Slc17a7<sup>Cre</sup></italic> in late embryonic development does not cause discernable morphological defects is consistent with the previous reports that hippocampal neurons are largely normal in constitutive knockout of DLK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hirai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hirai et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, induced overexpression of DLK, which leads to activation of JNK signaling evidenced by increased p-c-Jun, causes the glutamatergic neurons in dorsal CA1 and dentate gyrus to undergo pronounced death, while CA3 neurons appear less vulnerable even under chronic elevated DLK expression. The levels of DLK in our DLK(iOE) mice model appear comparable to those reported under traumatic injury and chronic stress. The pattern of DLK-induced neuronal death shares similarity to the differential vulnerability of CA1 and CA3 neurons reported in patients with Alzheimerâs disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">West et al., 1994</xref>), and animal models of oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wilde et al., 1997</xref>), ischemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Smith et al., 1984</xref>), and glutamate excitotoxicity from NMDA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vornov et al., 1991</xref>). The dorsal-ventral hippocampal neuron death pattern associated with increased expression of DLK is also similar to that observed in animal models of ischemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Smith et al., 1984</xref>). Such regional differences of hippocampal neurons in response to insults or genetic manipulation may be attributed to multiple factors, such as the nature of the neural network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Viana da Silva et al., 2024</xref>), intrinsic differences between CA1 and CA3 neurons in their abilities to buffer calcium changes, mitochondrial stress, protein homeostasis, glutamate receptor distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schmidt-Kastner, 2015</xref>), and as discussed further, the degree to which transcription factors, such as p-c-Jun or other AP1 factors, are activated under different conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>DLK-dependent cellular network exhibits commonality and cell-type specificity</title><p>DLK to JNK signaling is known to lead to transcriptional regulation. Several studies have used transcriptomic profiling to reveal DLK-dependent gene expression in different regions of the brain, such as cerebellum and forebrain, and in specific neuron types, such as DRG neurons and RGC neurons following axon injury or nerve growth factor withdrawal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goodwani et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Larhammar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Le Pichon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Watkins et al., 2013</xref>). One recent study reported RiboTag profiling of the DLK-dependent gene network in axotomized spinal cord motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Asghari Adib et al., 2024</xref>). In agreement with the overall findings from these studies, we find that loss of DLK in hippocampal glutamatergic neurons results in modest expression changes in a small number of genes, while overexpression of DLK leads to expression changes in a larger set of genes. Gene ontology analysis of our hippocampal glutamatergic neuron translatome reveals a similar set of terms as found in the other expression studies, including neuron differentiation, apoptosis, ion transport, and synaptic regulation.</p><p>Comparison of the translational targets of DLK in our study with these prior analyses also shows notable differences that are likely specific to neuron-type and contexts of experimental manipulations. For example, we find a strong induction of <italic>Jun</italic> translation associated with increased expression of DLK, but no significant changes in <italic>Atf3</italic> or <italic>Atf4</italic> translation, which were reported to show DLK-dependent increases in axotomized spinal cord motoneurons, and injured RGCs and DRGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Asghari Adib et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Larhammar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Watkins et al., 2013</xref>). Most ATF4 target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Somasundaram et al., 2023</xref>) also show no significant changes in our hippocampal glutamatergic neuron translatome. Moreover, we find a cohort of synaptic genes showing expression dependency on DLK (such as <italic>Tenm3, Nptx1</italic>, and <italic>Nptxr),</italic> but not any of the complement genes (<italic>C1qa, C1qb, C1qc</italic>), which are up-regulated in the regenerating spinal cord motor neurons where neuron-immune cell interaction has a critical role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Asghari Adib et al., 2024</xref>). Genomic structure and regulation intrinsic to the cell type may be a major factor underlying the gene expression differences in ours and other studies. Elevated DLK signaling in axotomized neurons may promote a strong regenerative response through activation of transcription factors, such as ATF3 and ATF4, whereas JUN and others that are actively expressed in hippocampal neurons may lead to a strong effect on refining synapses in response to DLK signaling. Overall, ours and the previous studies underscore the importance of systematic dissection of molecular pathways to understand neuron-type specific functionality to DLK signaling.</p><p>Our analysis of the spatial expression patterns of genes that showed association with DLK expression levels provides molecular insight to the differential vulnerability of hippocampal glutamatergic neurons under neurodegenerative conditions. We find that a select set of genes enriched in CA1 are up-regulated in DLK knockout and down-regulated upon DLK overexpression. The c-Jun transcription factor has a key role in hippocampal cell death responses as mutations preventing c-Jun phosphorylation led to decreased neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampus following treatment with kainic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Behrens et al., 1999</xref>). Basal levels of c-Jun and phosphorylated c-Jun in hippocampus are generally low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goodwani et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pozniak et al., 2013</xref>). We find modest reductions in p-c-Jun in DLK(cKO) glutamatergic neurons, consistent with previous studies of the constitutive knockout of DLK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hirai et al., 2006</xref>). In contrast, in DLK(iOE) neurons, translation of c-Jun and phosphorylation of c-Jun are increased, with CA1 neurons exhibiting higher increase than CA3 neurons. The c-Jun promoter has consensus AP1 sites, and c-Jun can regulate its own expression levels in cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Angel et al., 1988</xref>), NGF-deprived sympathetic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eilers et al., 1998</xref>) and kainic acid treated hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mielke et al., 1999</xref>). While our data does not pinpoint the molecular changes explaining why CA3 would show less vulnerability to increased DLK, we may speculate that DLK(iOE) induced signal transduction amplification may differ in CA1 vs CA3. CA1 genes appear to be more strongly regulated than CA3 genes, consistent with our observation that increased c-Jun expression in CA1 is greater than that in CA3. Other parallel molecular factors may also contribute to resilience of CA3 neurons to DLK(iOE), such as HSP70 chaperones, different JNK isoforms, and phosphatases, some of which showed differential expression in our RiboTag analysis of DLK(iOE) vs WT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> WT vs DLK(iOE) DEGs). Together with other genes that show dependency on DLK, the DLK and Jun regulatory network contributes to the regional differences in hippocampal neuronal vulnerability under pathological conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Conserved functions of DLK in regulating Stathmins</title><p>Stathmins are tubulin binding proteins broadly expressed in many types of neurons. Several studies have reported that DLK can regulate the expression of different Stathmin isoforms in multiple neuron types under injury conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Asghari Adib et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">DeVault et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Larhammar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Le Pichon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shin et al., 2019</xref>). In the hippocampus <italic>Stmn2</italic> is expressed at a higher level than <italic>Stmn4</italic>, with the relative ratios of <italic>Stmn4:Stmn2</italic> in hippocampus much higher than in DRGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zeisel et al., 2018</xref>). We find that DLK can modulate expression and translation of <italic>Stmn4</italic> in hippocampal neurons. ChIP-seq data for Jun from ENCODE (ENCSR000ERO) suggest a possible binding site in the promoter region of Stmn4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">The ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Luo et al., 2020</xref>). STMN4 expression in hippocampus peaks around P8, correlating to neurite outgrowth and synapse formation and pruning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Paolicelli et al., 2011</xref>). At the level of hippocampal tissue, loss of DLK causes no detectable changes to microtubules, while increased levels of DLK appear to alter microtubule homeostasis in dendrites, with generally increased levels of both stable and dynamic microtubule markers. The CA1 neurons in DLK(iOE) also show fewer parallel microtubule arrays of apical dendrites, with short branches extending in varied directions. Our results from primary hippocampal neurons support roles for DLK in both short neurite and axon formation, similar to observations in cortical neurons, where DLK contributes to stage specific regulation of microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hirai et al., 2011</xref>). In primary cortical neurons overexpression of STMN4 can increase neurite length and branching when an epigenetic cofactor regulating MT dynamics was knocked down (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tapias et al., 2021</xref>). We speculate that DLK-dependent regulation of STMN4 and other STMNs may have a critical role in the long-term cytoskeletal rearrangements for neuronal morphology and synapse formation or stability. Nonetheless, as Stmns have considerable redundancy in expression and function, changes in STMN4 alone are unlikely to be a major factor for the observed hippocampal regional neuron death.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conserved roles of DLK in synapse formation and maintenance</title><p>The in vivo functions of the DLK family of proteins were first revealed in studies of synapse formation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Collins et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nakata et al., 2005</xref>). Our hippocampal glutamatergic neuron translatomic data extends this function by revealing a strong theme of DLK-dependent network in synapse organization, adhesion molecules and regulation of trans-synaptic signaling, especially related to AMPA receptor expression and calcium signaling, such as Neuronal Pentraxin 1 and Neuronal Pentraxin Receptor <italic>Nptx1</italic> and <italic>Nptxr</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">GÃ³mez de San JosÃ© et al., 2022</xref>). From our synapse analysis in culture, we find increased DLK alters pattern of presynaptic protein Bassoon, consistent with the findings on <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nakata et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Collins et al., 2006</xref>). We also find DLK regulates dendritic spine morphology, with loss of DLK associated with a greater number of spines with more mature spine morphology, while increased DLK was associated with fewer and less mature spines. These results are similar to that observed in layer 2/3 cortical neurons where loss of DLK is associated with larger dendritic spines in developing neurons and higher density of spines when exposed to AÎ² plaques, which lead to loss of nearby spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Le Pichon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pozniak et al., 2013</xref>). In CA1 dendritic regions, DLK overexpression reduced Homer1 density, suggesting synaptic defects may correlate with the onset of degeneration. In axotomized spinal cord motor neurons DLK induces activation of complement, leading to microglial pruning of synapses in injured motoneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Asghari Adib et al., 2024</xref>). These data support a conserved role of DLK in synapse formation and maintenance, through regulating the translation of genes involved in neuron outgrowth, synaptic adhesion, and synapse activity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Limitation of our study</title><p>We have investigated roles of DLK in hippocampal glutamatergic neuron development, synapse regulation, and neuron death processes. We infer that DLK-dependent expression and translation of CA1 enriched genes may likely play roles in regional vulnerability to increased DLK signaling. However, our RiboTag profiling was performed with whole hippocampus at time when CA1 death was noticeable. Our analysis of spatial expression patterns of DLK-dependent genes relies on available data from adult animals, which may not reflect the patterns at P15, or in response to altered DLK. We cannot rule out that some of the decreased expression of CA1 enriched genes in DLK(iOE) could be secondary due to neuronal death that could result in fewer CA1 neurons present in our mRNA samples. Our analysis also does not directly address why CA3 neurons are less vulnerable to increased DLK expression. Future studies using cell-type specific RiboTag profiling and other methods at a refined time window will be required to address how DLK-dependent signaling interacts with other networks underlying hippocampal regional neuron vulnerability to pathological insults. While we find evidence for apoptosis, other forms of cell death may also occur. Additional experiments will be needed to elucidate in vivo roles of STMN4 and its interaction with other STMNs. It is worth noting that a systematic analysis of gene networks in neuron types selectively vulnerable to Alzheimerâs disease has suggested processes related to axon plasticity and synaptic vesicle transmission, particularly with relation to microtubule dynamics, may be involved in the neuronal vulnerability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Roussarie et al., 2020</xref>). Combining gene profiling of specific cell types in hippocampus with advanced technology in function dissection will continue to provide clarification to roles of DLK in the central nervous system under normal and pathological conditions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key

Tissues were homogenized by Dounce homogenization using 30 passes pestle A and 30 passes pestle B. Samples were spun down at 13,000 x <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4 C. Supernatants were collected, and protein concentration was determined using the BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 23227). Equal concentration of proteins (~10â20 ng) were run on NuPAGE 4â12% Bis-Tris Gel, 1.0 mm (Invitrogen, NP0322BOX) with 20X NuPAGE MES SDS Running Buffer (Invitrogen, NP0002). Protein samples were transferred by wet transfer to a PVDF membrane (0.2 Î¼m, Bio-RAD, 1620177) by Mini Trans-Blot Cell at 100 mA for 1 hr at 4 Â°C. Membranes were blocked in 5% skim milk in TBST for 1 hr at room temperature, and then incubated with primary antibody in 3% BSA or 5% skim milk in TBST at 4 Â°C overnight. Membranes were washed 3x10 min in TBST and incubated with 1:5000 of the appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibody in 3% BSA in TBST at room temperature for 1 hr, then washed 3x10 min in TBST. Bands were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents (GE Healthcare, RPN2106) or Pico PLUS Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 34580) using a Licor Odyssey XF Imager. Molecular weight markers were PageRuler Plus Prestained Protein Ladder (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 26619) or Precision Plus Protein Ladder (Bio-Rad, 1610374).</p><p>Quantification of western blot images was performed by measuring identical size regions from each band, subtracting the background signal, and normalizing to internal actin controls for each sample. Time course analysis was further normalized to P1 WT protein levels. All images shown had N=3 biological replicates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>STMN2/STMN4 antibody specificity</title><p>Given their highly similar protein size and sequences, we wanted to evaluate STMN2 and STMN4 antibody specificity. We used two antibodies for each. STMN2 antibodies were a mouse monoclonal anti-STMN2 (R&amp;D Systems, MAB6930) and a rabbit polyclonal anti-STMN2 (Proteintech, 10586â1-AP). STMN4 antibodies were a mouse monoclonal anti-STMN4 (Santa Cruz, Sc-376936) and a rabbit polyclonal anti-STMN4 (Proteintech, 12027â1-AP). We tested the specificity of STMN2 and STMN4 antibodies by co-staining for STMN2 and STMN4, or with two separate STMN2 or STMN4 antibodies. In each case, antibody signal overlapped in the cell soma, presumably at the Golgi, as well as larger puncta elsewhere, with some overlapping small puncta, and some non-overlapping small puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Overlapping and non-overlapping signal was also visualized by plotting intensity of signal along the neurite. By western blot STMN2 and STMN4 were highly similar at the protein MW and levels, though the STMN4 antibodies tested detected a larger MW band specific to STMN4, suggesting some specificity. The STMN2 antibodies also occasionally recognized a smaller MW band only recognized with the Proteintech STMN4 antibody but not the Santa Cruz STMN4 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Furthermore, while STMN4 protein levels increased relative to Î²-actin in mice with increased DLK, STMN2 protein levels did not show significant increases. These different expression patterns validated some degree of specificity with these antibodies. Based on our analysis, the STMN4 Santa Cruz antibody (Sc-376936) may be more specific to STMN4 than the STMN4 Proteintech antibody (12027â1-AP) though it appears less sensitive. The STMN2 antibodies showed strongest overlap of puncta and similar MW proteins, thus we were unable to detect differences in specificity. Whether the antibodies may also detect some of the same isoforms is not clear without further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Immunofluorescence of hippocampal tissues</title><p>Mice were transcardially perfused with saline solution followed by 4% PFA in PBS.

To determine the molecular mechanisms underlying this effect, ribotag mice were used to determine changes in active translation which identified Jun and STMN4 as DLK-dependent genes that may contribute to this effect. Finally, experiments in cultured neurons were conducted to better understand the in vivo effects. These experiments demonstrated that DLK overexpression resulted in morphological and synaptic abnormalities.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This study provides interesting new insights into the role of DLK in the normal function of hippocampal neurons. Specifically, the study identifies:</p><p>(1) CA1 vs CA3 hippocampal neurons have differing sensitivity to increased DLK signaling.</p><p>(2) DLK-dependent signaling in these neurons is similar to but distinct from the downstream factors identified in other cell types, highlighted by the identification of STMN4 as a downstream signal.</p><p>(3) DLK overexpression in hippocampal neurons results in signaling that is similar to that induced by neuronal injury.</p><p>The study also provides confirmatory evidence that supports previously published work through orthogonal methods, which adds additional confidence to our understanding of DLK signaling in neurons. Taken together, this is a useful addition to our understanding of DLK function.</p><p>Comments on the latest version:</p><p>The authors have sufficiently addressed all issues raised with the initial manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.101173.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ritchie</surname><given-names>Erin M</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/0168r3w48</institution-id><institution>University of California, San Diego</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">La Jolla</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Acar</surname><given-names>Dilan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/0168r3w48</institution-id><institution>University of California, San Diego</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">La Jolla</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhong</surname><given-names>Siming</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/0168r3w48</institution-id><institution>University of California, San Diego</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">La Jolla</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Pu</surname><given-names>Qianyi</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/0168r3w48</institution-id><institution>University of California, San Diego</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">La Jolla</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Yunbo</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/0168r3w48</institution-id><institution>University of California, San Diego</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">La Jolla</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>Binhai</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/0168r3w48</institution-id><institution>University of California, San Diego</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">La Jolla</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Jin</surname><given-names>Yishi</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/0168r3w48</institution-id><institution>University of California San Diego</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">La Jolla</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>eLife Assessment</bold></p><p>This manuscript describes the impact of modulating signaling by a key regulatory enzyme, Dual Leucine Zipper Kinase (DLK), on hippocampal neurons.

The phenomenon is clear but there is no link to gene expression changes. In fact, the highlighted transcript in this work, Stmn4, changes in a DLK-dependent manner in CA3.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is a very interesting question not answered by our gene expression analysis. While we verified Stmn4 expression levels to correlate to the levels of DLK, we do not think that increased Stmn4 per se in DLK(iOE) is a major factor accounting for CA1 death vs CA3 survival. Several published studies have also reported regulation of Stmn4 mRNAs in other cell types, in the contexts of cell death (Watkins et al., 2013; Le Pichon et al., 2017) and axon regeneration and cytoskeleton disruption (Asghari Adib et al., 2024; DeVault et al., 2024; Hu et al., 2019; Shin et al., 2019). As Stmns have significant expression and function redundancy, conventional knockdown or overexpression of individual Stmn generally does not lead to detectable effects on cellular function. As CA3 neurons are widely known for their dense connections and show resilience to NMDA-mediated neurotoxicity (Sammons et al., 2024; Vornov et al., 1991), we speculate that the differential vulnerability of CA1 and CA3 under DLK(iOE) is a reflection of both the intrinsic property, such as gene expression, and also their circuit connection.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we have included following statement on pg 18:</p><p>âWhile our data does not pinpoint the molecular changes explaining why CA3 would show less vulnerability to increased DLK, we may speculate that DLK(iOE) induced signal transduction amplification may differ in CA1 vs CA3. CA1 genes appear to be more strongly regulated than CA3 genes, consistent with our observation that increased c-Jun expression in CA1 is greater than that in CA3. Other parallel molecular factors may also contribute to resilience of CA3 neurons to DLK(iOE), such as HSP70 chaperones, different JNK isoforms, and phosphatases, some of which showed differential expression in our RiboTag analysis of DLK(iOE) vs WT (shown in File S2. WT vs DLK(iOE) DEGs).

Their data are therefore a mix of cells where DLK does and does not change cell death. The key issue is whether DLK does/does not have an effect based on the expression changes it drives.</p></disp-quote><p>At the time of planning the Ribo-Tag experiment several years ago, we focused on the hippocampal glutamatergic neurons. Due to technical difficulty in micro-dissecting individual hippocampal regions from this early timepoint, we opted to use whole hippocampi to isolate ribosome-associated mRNAs. We agree with the reviewer that it is important to sort out DLK-dependent general gene expression changes vs those specific to a particular cell type where DLK impacts its survival. With emerging CA1, CA3 and other cell-type specific Cre drivers and advanced RNAseq technology, we hope that our work will stimulate broad interest in these questions in future studies.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we have included new analysis comparing our Vglut1-RiboTag profiling (P15) with CamK2-RiboTag (for CA1) and Grik4-RiboTag (for CA3) (P42) published in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">TraunmÃ¼ller et al., 2023</xref> (GSE209870). We find that &gt;80% of the top ranked genes in their CamK2-RiboTag (for CA1) and Girk4-RiboTag (for CA3) were detected in our VGlut1-RiboTag (revised methods and Supplemental Excel File S3). CA1-enriched genes tended to be expressed higher in DLK(cKO), compared to control, whereas CA3-enriched genes showed less significant correlation to DLK expression levels. Additionally, many genes known to specify CA1 fate do not show significant downregulation in DLK(iOE). This analysis, along with other data in our manuscript, is consistent with an idea that DLK does not regulate neuronal fate.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we presented this additional analysis in Fig. S6K-L, and expanded text description on page 9:</p><p>âAdditionally, we compared our Vglut1-RiboTag datasets with CamK2-RiboTag and Grik4-RiboTag datasets from 6-week-old wild type mice reported by (TraunmÃ¼ller et al., 2023; GSE209870). We defined a list of genes enriched in CamK2-expressing CA1 neurons relative to Grik4-expressing CA3 neurons (CA1 genes), and those enriched in Grik4-expressing CA3 neurons (CA3 genes) (File S3). When compared with the entire list of Vglut1-RiboTag profiling in our control and DLK(cKO), we found CA1 genes tended to be expressed more in DLK(cKO) mice, compared to control (Fig.S6K), while CA3 genes showed a slight enrichment in control though the trend was less significant, and were less clustered towards one genotype (Fig.S6L). Moreover, many CA1 genes related to cell-type specification, such as <italic>FoxP1</italic>, <italic>Satb2</italic>, <italic>Wfs1</italic>, <italic>Gpr161</italic>, <italic>Adcy8</italic>, <italic>Ndst3</italic>, <italic>Chrna5</italic>, <italic>Ldb2</italic>, <italic>Ptpru</italic>, and <italic>Ntm,</italic> did not show significant downregulation when DLK was overexpressed. These observations imply that DLK likely specifically down-regulates CA1 genes both under normal conditions and when overexpressed, with a stronger effect on CA1 genes, compared to CA3 genes. Overall, the informatic analysis suggests that decreased expression of CA1 enriched genes may contribute to CA1 neuron vulnerability to elevated DLK, although it is also possible that the observed down-regulation of these genes is a secondary effect associated with CA1 neuron degenerationâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Is the subtle decrease in synapse number (Basson/Homer co-loc.) in the DLK (OE) simply a function of neurons (and their synapses, presumably) having died?

The ambitious aim here is to understand the DLK-dependent gene network in the brain and, to pursue this, they explore the role of DLK in hippocampal glutamatergic neurons using conditional knockout and induced overexpression mice. They produce evidence that dorsal CA1 and dentate gyrus neurons are vulnerable to elevated expression of DLK, while CA3 neurons appear unaffected. Then they identify the DLK-dependent translatome featured by conserved molecular signatures and cell-type specificity. Their evidence suggests that increased DLK signaling is associated with possible STMN4 disruptions to microtubules, among else. They also produce evidence on cultured hippocampal neurons showing that expression levels of DLK are associated with changes in neurite outgrowth, axon specification, and synapse formation.

I am somewhat more skeptical of interpretations and conclusions on spatial anatomical selectivity without stereological approaches and also going directly from (extremely complex) Ribotag profiling patterns to relevance based on immunohistochemistry and no additional interventions to manipulate (e.g. by knocking down or blocking) their top Ribotag profile hits. Also, it seems to this reviewer that major developmental claims in the paper are based on gene translational profiling dependent on DLK expression, not DLK activation, despite some evidence in the paper that there is a correlation between the two.

Therefore, it is not straightforward that the differentially expressed genes or pathways caused by DLK overexpression changes could be due to processes related to neurodegeneration. Indeed, the authors find enrichment of signals related to pathways involved in extracellular matrix organization, apoptosis, unfolded protein responses, the complement cascade, DNA damage responses, and depletion of signals related to mitochondrial electron transport, etc., all of which could be the consequence of neurodegeneration regardless of cause.

It looks to me that this selection is already confounded by neurodegeneration which could be the cause for their downregulation. Therefore, such gene profiles may not be directly linked to neuronal vulnerability.

Consistently, GO term analysis using the list of genes coordinately regulated by DLK, derived from our RRHO analysis, leads to identification of similar GO terms related to up- and downregulated genes as using DLK(iOE)-RiboTag data alone.

In <italic>Vglut1Cre/+;H11-DLKiOE/+</italic> mice at P10 when no discernable neuron degeneration was seen in any regions of hippocampus, only CA3 neurons showed a significant increase of immunostaining intensity of c-Jun, compared to control (Fig.S7A).

In 2A under P15 and especially P60, it is difficult to see the difference - this needs lower magnification and a lot of care that anteroposterior levels are identical because hippocampal sector anatomy and volumes of sectors vary from level to level. One wonders if the cortex shrinks, too. This is important.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising the point. We have provided images to view the anteroposterior level in Fig.S2A-C.

One may need stereological analysis, otherwise this substantial claim appears overinterpreted.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the comment.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we included a new supplemental figure (Fig. S2) showing lower magnification images of coronal sections, and used cautionary wording, such as âCA3 is less vulnerable, compared to CA1â, to minimize the impression of over-interpretation. By NeuN staining, at P10, P15, P60, we did not observe detectable difference in overall hippocampus architecture, apart from noted cell death of CA1 and DG and associated thinning of each of the layers. At 46 weeks, some animals showed differences in the overall shape of dorsal hippocampus, though this appeared to reflect a disproportionately large CA3 region compared to other regions (Fig S2). Increased GFAP staining (Fig.S5A-C) was detected in CA1 but not in CA3, and microglia by IBA1 staining (Fig.S5E) also displayed less reactivity in CA3, compared to CA1. Thus, based on NeuN staining, GFAP staining, IBA1 staining and analysis of the differentially regulated genes, we infer that the effect of DLK(iOE) in CA1 is different than the effect on CA3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is the GFAP excess reflective of neuroinflammation? What do microglial markers show? The presence of neuroinflammation does not bode well with apoptosis. Speaking of which, TUNEL in one cell in Supplementary Figure 4E is not strong evidence of a more widespread apoptotic event in CA1.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included staining data for the microglia marker IBA1. Both GFAP and IBA1 showed evidence of reactivity particularly in the CA1 region (S5A-E), supporting the differential vulnerability in different regions, though whether cell death is primarily due to apoptosis is unclear.</p><p>We agree that our data of sparse TUNEL staining at P15 (Fig S5F,G) do not rule out whether other mechanisms of cell death may also occur.

This is a significant methodological problem because it is not easy to sample neurons without involving stereological methods. With the approach taken here, there is a risk that significance may be overblown.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewerâs point.

We did not observe significant differences in the proportion of cells labeled with each marker in DLK(cKO) or DLK(iOE) cultures (Fig.S13E).

The major issues are the need for more information about the over-expression of DLK and a need to extrapolate to an in vivo condition with DLK. A considerable amount of useful information is presented with some very nicely done experiments but it is not yet a coherent or integrated story. The lack of impact of DLK overexpression in some neurons is perhaps the most impactful observation of the study and would be great to have more information around the differential transcriptional/signaling response in these cell types. There is also a need for more experimental details and to address several questions about the mouse genetic and translatome analysis. They are valid concerns that require attention by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the editors and reviewers for their thoughtful evaluation and suggestions.

Is this a representative field of view?</p></disp-quote><p>We have re-examined images, and observed no effect on hippocampal morphology at 1 yr. We now included representative images in the revised Fig S1D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Is the DLK protein section staining in Figure 2C a real signal? The staining looks like speckles and is purely somatic. Axonal staining is widely expected based on the literature and the authors' own work. There should be a specificity control.</p></disp-quote><p>To our knowledge, axonal staining of DLK reported in the literature is mostly based on cultured DRG neurons. In addition to the reported axonal localization, DLK is present in the cell soma, near the golgi (Hirai et al., 2002), and in the post-synaptic density (Pozniak et al., 2013).</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we addressed this point by including controls with no primary antibody, and using an antibody against the closely related kinase, LZK. These additional data are shown in (Fig.S3C,D) (previously Fig.S2C), supporting that DLK protein staining represents real signal. At P10 and P15, DLK immunostaining around CA3 showed axonal staining of the mossy fibers, as well as in the soma and dendritic layers (Fig.S3C,D). A similar pattern was also seen in primary cultured neurons (Fig 6A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The protein expression of DLK in the transgenic overexpressor (Figure S7C) looks, to the resolution of this blot, to be at least 50kD heavier than 'WT' DLK. Can the authors explain this discrepancy?</p></disp-quote><p>The Cre-induced DLK(iOE) transgene has T2A and tdTomato in-frame to C-terminus of DLK. It is known that T2A âself-cleavageâ is often incomplete. DLK-T2A-tdTomato would be about 50 kD bigger than WT DLK. We now include the transgene design in revised Fig S1D, and also stated in figure legend of Fig.S8C (previously S7C) that âLarger molecular weight band of DLK in <italic>Vglut1Cre/+</italic>;H11-DLKiOE/+ would match the predicted molecular weight of DLK-T2A-tdTomato if T2A-peptide induced âself-cleavageâ due to ribosomal skipping is ineffective (Fig.S1D).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Expression changes in DLK affect various aspects of neurites in CA1 cultures (Figure 6), and changes in DLK also modestly affect STMN4 (and 2, perhaps indirectly) levels (Figure S7C), but there is no indication that DLK acts via STMN4 to cause these changes. It is not clear what to make of these data. Of note, Stmn4 levels change in response to DLK in CA3, without DLK affecting cell death in this region.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate and agree with the comment. Other studies (Asghari Adib et al., 2024; DeVault et al., 2024; Hu et al., 2019; Larhammar et al., 2017; Le Pichon et al., 2017; Shin et al., 2019; Watkins et al., 2013) reported expression changes in Stmn4 mRNAs in other cell types and cellular contexts, which appeared to depend on DLK. Hippocampal neurons express multiple Stmns (Fig.S8A). While we present our analysis on the effects of DLK dosage on Stmn4, and also Stmn2, we do not think that DLK-induced changes of Stmn4 expression per se is a major factor underlying CA1 cell death vs CA3 survival.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we addressed this point in âLimitation of our studyâ (pg 20):</p><p>âAdditional experiments will be needed to elucidate in vivo roles of STMN4 and its interaction with other STMNsâ.</p></body></sub-article></article>
