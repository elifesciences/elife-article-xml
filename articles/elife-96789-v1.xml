The microbiome plays a pivotal role in host physiology and pathophysiology, with some species conferring benefits to the host and others causing damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Delannoy-Bruno et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lynch and Hsiao, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Morais et al., 2021</xref>). Over the past decades, tremendous effort, including ours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jia et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2017</xref>), has been devoted to understanding the impact of microbial strains or more complex communities on their hosts. In fact, interactions between the host and microbiome are mutually bidirectional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bäckhed et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jiang et al., 2019</xref>), conferring benefits to the host and microbial sides. Nevertheless, the knowledge of the effect of the host on the resident microbial community is still in its infancy. Studies reveal that hosts play a crucial role in shaping the assembly and composition of their unique microbiome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Muegge et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Olm et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Valeri and Endres, 2021</xref>). However, environmental fluctuations frequently happen at much shorter time scales that preclude bacterial adaptation by genetic mutation or species displacement. To cope with these situations, microbial communities have developed sophisticated transcriptional reprogramming to globally regulate gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avraham et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Becattini et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Prescott and Decho, 2020</xref>). Pathobionts routinely sense and specialize on host-derived substrates, execute context-dependent transitions from harmful to commensal states, and generate the host-associated continuum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barak-Gavish et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Proctor et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Somvanshi et al., 2012</xref>). In this regard, the molecular mechanism by which the host restrictively controls gene transcription and metabolism of their microbiome remains much undefined.</p><p>Microbial populations frequently aggregate in several dozen micrometers and stochastically undergo specific differentiation into subpopulations with strikingly distinct properties, employing a strategy known as bet-hedging to survive rapid changes in the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eldar and Elowitz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Raj and van Oudenaarden, 2008</xref>). As such, bacteria manifest heterogeneous transcriptional profiles, leading to phenotypic heterogeneity among individual bacterial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gasch et al., 2017</xref>). Traditionally, gene expression of bacterial cells has been investigated in bulk or on a population level by mixing and averaging mRNA simultaneously from sorts of cells. Single-cell transcriptomics is revolutionizing the analysis of phenotypic cell-to-cell variation in eukaryotes, enabling us to explore the heterogeneity heretofore hidden within population behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Klein et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mancio-Silva et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Perez et al., 2022</xref>). Recently, droplet-based high-throughput bacterial single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) methods have been developed and applied to study antibiotic-associated heterogeneous cellular states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ma et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xu et al., 2023</xref>). We took advantage of this approach to tackle the challenge that the host induces transcriptionally distinct subpopulations of target bacteria during the interaction, contributing to a full appreciation of the phenotypic heterogeneity within microbiome.</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> has a relatively simple bacterial community of commensal and opportunistic pathogens, typically predominated by 5–20 bacterial species. All <italic>Drosophila</italic> microbes are facultative bacteria that alternate between free-living and host-associated lifestyles. <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic> is an opportunistic pathogen and generates a pink pigment prodigiosin that is characteristically oscillatory to metabolic activities, making it a visible bioindicator of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> metabolism. In this regard, <italic>Drosophila</italic> has provided a promising model to study symbiosis, dysbiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chandler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>To investigate whether and/or how the host modulates bacterial lifestyles, we used a reductionist approach in which germ-free (GF) <italic>Drosophila</italic> was re-associated with <italic>S. marcescens</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kuraishi et al., 2011</xref>). We found that <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae sufficiently outcompeted <italic>S. marcescens</italic>, and resulted in shifts in the transcriptomic and metabolomic profile in bulk and single-cell resolution, providing a robust paradigm to further study the host-microbe interaction with the <italic>Drosophila</italic> model.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae alter surface topography and population size of microbes</title><p>All <italic>Drosophila</italic> microbes are facultative bacteria that alternate between free-living and host-associated lifestyles. Free-living bacteria initially form small microcolonies extending from the substratum, continue to expand, coalesce, and eventually generate a surface slick (a biofilm-like cell mat) that is visible to the naked eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koo and Yamada, 2016</xref>). Fascinatingly, the topography of surface slick was typically altered by fly colonization. The surface slick associated with strong wild-type flies was corn-like yellow, and the mature layer of the bacterial community was completely broken (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The destruction process was further exacerbated by overcrowded larvae that liquefied the upper food layer, leading to a yellow aqueous layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). However, it was gray and partially segmented by weak flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), and even pale and intact associated with infertile flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These results indicate that <italic>Drosophila</italic> plays a critical role in altering the topography of bacterial community on <italic>Drosophila</italic> media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deines et al., 2020</xref>). Our data showed that the cultivable bacterial loads associated with weak or infertile flies were dramatically higher than those of strong stocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), indicating that the host diminishes the bacterial load of the shared niche.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae shape topographies and carrying capacities of bacterial community.</title><p>(<bold>A–D</bold>) Representative images of sticky ‘biofilm-like’ formation on the surface of the sugar-corn-yeast medium whereby <italic>Drosophila</italic> flies with differential robustness were raised.

Similarly, bacterial loads were substantially higher in the medium associated with males and virgin females (without progenies) than in the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), suggesting that larvae mainly cause a decline in bacterial population size. Consistently, the 50-day-aged flies that deposited few eggs mimicked weak flies with gray surface slick and a decline in bacterial loads. Moreover, transplanted larvae directly caused a dose-dependent decline in the overall bacterial loads in the habitat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). These findings demonstrate that <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae play a critical role in outcompeting their symbionts in the shared habitat.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae antagonize <italic>S. marcescens</italic> in the niche</title><p>To experimentally characterize the impact of the host on the symbiont, we applied a reductionist approach in which <italic>Drosophila</italic> mono-associated with <italic>S. marcescens</italic> was generated as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. Crawling larvae (~96 hr post oviposition) were concurrently transferred to fly food vials with 10<sup>7</sup> CFU bacterial load. We found that <italic>S. marcescens</italic> alone formed a pink surface slick in the medium over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, top). The color intensity of surface slicks was initially accumulated, peaked at 24 hr timepoint post inoculation, but gradually faded thereafter. We quantified the optical density of prodigiosin inside surface slicks with the spectrophotometer as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kalivoda et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pan et al., 2020</xref>). The time-course amount of prodigiosin was congruent with the color density visible to the naked eye above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Compared to <italic>S. marcescens</italic> alone, the color intensity of surface slicks was significantly dampened by larval transplantations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, bottom). As expected, the amount of prodigiosin of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> in coculture substantially declined compared with that of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> alone. Next, we examined bacterial titers in the food at regular intervals.

However, the population of coexisting <italic>S. marcescens</italic> reached the plateau value within 2 days. Moreover, the number of CFUs was predominantly suppressed by larva transplantation at the initial phases of colonization (within 72 hr post inoculation) compared to that of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), consistent with the result that larvae thwarted the number of total mixed bacteria in the diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Noteworthily, the growth of single <italic>S. marcescens</italic> was comparable (at 96 hr post inoculation) or even lower (at 120 hr post inoculation) than corresponding <italic>S. marcescens</italic> in coculture, likely that single <italic>S. marcescens</italic> rapidly exhausted their nutritional resources and underwent ecological suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ratzke et al., 2018</xref>).

Our data showed that flies challenged with <italic>S. marcescens</italic> alone manifested higher mortality than flies with <italic>S. marcescens</italic> in coculture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), suggesting that larva antagonizes the pathogenicity of <italic>S. marcescens</italic>. In addition, the expression of virulent factors was thwarted by larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). However, <italic>S. marcescens</italic> more efficiently sustained optimal larval development upon nutrient scarcity than both axenicity and commensal <italic>L plantarum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Matos et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Storelli et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>), indicating that larvae-associated <italic>S. marcescens</italic> could impart fitness benefits to their hosts. To rule out the possibility that phenotypic alterations could stem from genomic mutations, we examined the prodigiosin yield and CFUs of re-culturing <italic>S. marcescens</italic> that had coexisted with larvae. Our results showed that neither prodigiosin yield nor CFUs of re-culturing <italic>S. marcescens</italic> differed from the original strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>), suggesting that a phenotypic switch was driven primarily by transcriptional reprogramming. The cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria is composed of a single layer of peptidoglycan surrounded by a membranous structure, which may function as a virulence factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pan et al., 2022</xref>).

Additionally, we observed that the expression of genes related to cell wall biosynthesis was dampened by larva transplantation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>).

To tackle this issue, we agitated fly food to imitate larva locomotion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

However, larval transplantation resulted in a much more robust decline in color intensity of surface slicks, prodigiosin yield, and population size than agitation alone. Of note, the surface of the slick with agitation appeared lighter than that of larvae, possibly due to a stratification of prodigiosin following agitation. In addition, the expression of prodigiosin synthesis genes was thwarted by the agitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E</xref>).

Functional annotations of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were assigned using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG).

In the current study, we found that <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae act as a competitive regulator that prevents <italic>S. marcescens</italic> overgrowth and antagonizes its pathogenicity. <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae reshaped the transcriptomic and metabolomic profile of <italic>S. marcescens</italic>, characterized by the lifestyle switch from pathogenicity to mutualism toward the fly. More importantly, we highlight that the host alters the single-cell transcriptomic atlas of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> and phenotypic heterogeneity in bacterial populations.</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> adults are routinely attracted to oviposit their eggs on rotting fruits that possess both commensal and pathogenic microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wong et al., 2017</xref>). Extensive attention has been dedicated to the essential roles of symbiotic bacteria in modulating the physiology of their animal partner, or to the molecular mechanisms underlying physiological benefits to their host. However, it’s necessary to explore both sides of symbioses to obtain a more complete understanding of the host-bacteria interaction. <italic>S. marcescens</italic> encounters a cost associated with symbiosis, as the population size for it is diminished in the shared niche before 72 hr post inoculation by the larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Our findings highlight that larvae alleviate intraspecies competition of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> through population size control at the initial stage. Taking into account these findings, the competition model is more plausible to the larvae-pathogen system where larvae efficiently prevent the overgrowth of the potential pathogenic bacterial community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burns et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Foster et al., 2017</xref>). Interspecies competition for nearly the same or similar nutrients and space occurs in the habitat, making <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae a potential competitor for <italic>S. marcescens</italic>. Intriguingly, a previous study reported the contrasting result that <italic>Drosophila</italic> farms its commensal <italic>L. plantarum</italic>, and is required to optimize the extraction of dietary nutrients and sustain the growth of their symbionts upon chronic undernutrition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Storelli et al., 2018</xref>). To reconcile the two contradictions, another model of species cooperation is suggested. Consequently, larval transplantations favored long-term maintenance of <italic>L. plantarum</italic> on the diet, and benefits from symbiosis override the costs of the initial competition in the long run, conferring the beneficial effect of larval presence on bacterial maintenance. This paradox possibly reflects a strategy developed by <italic>Drosophila</italic> to preserve its own fitness. Potential pathogens differ from commensal bacteria, because they generate secondary metabolites threatening insect life at the static stage of growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). If the larvae obtain benefits to promote their development and growth, they must exert strict control over them through AMPs and reactive oxygen species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sharp and Foster, 2022</xref>). We found that larvae-derived AMPs efficiently antagonized <italic>S. marcescens</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–F</xref>), thereby recapitulating the response of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> to <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae. Yet, the full complement of larva-derived factors required for bacterial controls as well as their mode of functions remains elusive, paving the way to seek the evolutionary-conserved animal factors essential to maintain symbiosis. Taken together, our findings of the host on microbial communities would improve our understanding of the ecology of host-symbiont interactions.</p><p>Owing to their saprophagous foraging behavior, <italic>Drosophila</italic> has to cope with many potential pathogens in the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Black et al., 2018</xref>). We’re appreciating the profound influence of the host on the resident microbial community, but the underlying molecular mechanisms by which the host is potentially involved in the perpetuation of host-bacteria symbiosis are still poorly understood. Our result showed that <italic>S. marcescens</italic> versatilely displayed transcriptional and metabolomic adaptations to <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), avoiding being competitors when they are associated with the host. Indeed, <italic>S. marcescens</italic> rapidly reached the plateau and exhausted its nutritional resources, and then generated secondary metabolites that could endanger insect life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Consistently, our transcriptome data suggest the pathogen-to-commensal transition of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> by the presence of larvae, including ABC transporters, phosphotransferase system, quorum sensing, and exosome. In gram-negative bacteria, these exporters transport lipids and polysaccharides from the cytoplasm to the periplasm, or certain substances that need to be extruded from the cell, including surface components of the bacterial cell (e.g. capsular polysaccharides, lipopolysaccharides, and teichoic acid), proteins involved in bacterial pathogenesis (e.g. hemolysis), hydrolytic enzymes, competence factors, toxins, bacteriocins, peptide antibiotics, and siderophores. In addition, quorum sensing, used by pathogens in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.britannica.com/science/disease">disease</ext-link> and infection, regulates gene expression following population density through autoinducers, allowing bacterial populations to communicate and coordinate group behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mukherjee and Bassler, 2019</xref>). The findings suggest that the microbiome responds to host physiology by altering gene expression and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Penterman et al., 2014</xref>). Consistently, a study observed that commensal bacteria calibrate their transcriptional and metabolic output to different systemic inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fyhrquist et al., 2019</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest that larvae elicit a set of expressed genes in their harmful symbionts, favoring the shift from a pathogenic to a commensal stage.</p><p>Most microbial communities consist of a genetically diverse assembly of different organisms, and the level of genetic diversity plays an important part in community properties and functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davies et al., 2022</xref>). However, genetically identical microbial cells can show different behaviors, including differences in growth speed, gene expression, and metabolism, and biological diversity can arise at a lower level of biological units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackermann, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avraham et al., 2015</xref>). Fortunately, the recent development of methods to interrogate populations on the single-cell level has dramatically altered our understanding of cellular heterogeneity by providing much greater resolution of different cell types and cell states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hare et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Imdahl et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McNulty et al., 2023</xref>). By applying this technique, we indeed observed that single cells differ from each other with respect to gene expression even when genetic and environmental differences between cells are reduced as much as possible in a shaking liquid medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Recent development in single-cell techniques facilitates to reveal that distinct bacterial subpopulations contribute unique colonization and growth strategies to infection sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lloréns-Rico et al., 2022</xref>). For example, the host can drive <italic>Salmonella</italic> phenotypic heterogeneity at the single-cell level throughout the course of infection, highlighting how variation in gene expression and metabolic activity contribute to the overall bacterial success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tsai and Coombes, 2019</xref>). Consistently, we found that the host changes the transcriptomic atlas of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> individual cells, and attenuates phenotypic heterogeneity of virulent factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–L</xref>). To date, transcriptional approaches – profiling the host, the pathogen, or both – have been employed to uncover substantial molecular details about the host and bacterial factors that underlie infection outcomes. During the interaction, the niche environment diversifies into 3D areas with varying degrees of growth conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koo and Yamada, 2016</xref>). In a single population, both in vitro and in vivo, <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> has been shown to display significant cell-to-cell variation in attributes such as growth rate, expression of virulence factors, and sensitivity to antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Claudi et al., 2014</xref>). With the development of this approach, it is possible to identify and modify the transcription of certain target bacterial cells with the expression of virulence factors in order to selectively treat human diseases in the gut microenvironment.</p><p>Utilizing the <italic>Drosophila</italic> model system, we revealed a natural ecological phenomenon whereby the host was a prerequisite for regulating the population size and lifecycle switch of indigenous bacteria. It’s of importance to understand the ecological and evolutionary processes that shape host-associated microbial communities. Little is known about the effect of the host on the commensal bacteria, and it would be also interesting to investigate whether the host and commensal bacteria could synergize to antagonize the pathogenicity of potential pathogens. Future studies that evaluate the molecular mechanism underlying the effect of the host on microbial communities would improve our understanding of host-symbiont co-evolution in nature.</p></sec><sec

In brief, to assess the expression levels of prodigiosin synthesis-related genes, extracellular polysaccharide production-related genes, and partial downregulated and upregulated genes, the cultures of different groups of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> were collected after 24 hr incubation. The collected cells were then subjected to total RNA extraction using a Bacteria RNA Extraction Kit (Vazyme, China). After treating the total bacterial RNA with DNase I (Vazyme, China), the concentration and quantity of the total bacterial RNA were determined using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific), and 0.6 μg of the total bacterial RNA was subjected to reverse transcription using the HiScript III All-in-one RT SuperMix Kit (Vazyme). The mixture was subjected to RT-qPCR analysis using the ChamQ Universal SYBR qPCR master mix kit (Vazyme) in a CFX96 Real-Time System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). RNA from three biological replicates were analyzed and four technical replicates were performed. The relative expression values were calculated using the following formula: ΔCt = Ct (target gene) - Ct (reference gene), and the relative expression was equal to 2<sup>-ΔCt</sup>. The 16S rRNA protein-encoding gene was used as an internal control.

Ice-cold 1× PBS (2 ml) was added to the vial for 5 min to suspend bacterial cells, and then suspended bacterial cells were removed food remainder by centrifugation (900 rpm, 3 min), washed twice in 1× PBS. Bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation (5000 rpm, 4 min) and washed twice in 1× PBS. The collected cells were then subjected to total RNA extraction using a Bacteria RNA Extraction Kit (Vazyme, China). The integrity, concentration, and quantity of the bacterial RNA were determined using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific) and a 1% agarose gel. 1 μg total RNA with RIN value above 7 was used for the following strand-specific library construction using VAHTS Universal V8 RNA-seq Library Prep Kit for Illumina (Vazyme, China). Library quality was evaluated using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. The sequences were sequenced and processed using Novaseq-PE150 by the company (Novogene, Beijing, China).</p><p>For annotation, the genome of <italic>S. marcescens FY</italic> was used as a reference. The significant DEGs were determined in different groups using the DESeq software (DESeq 2), with the standards of p-value≤0.05, and fold change |log2Ratio|≥1.2. KEGG KAAS database was used to annotate the genes with significantly differential expression based on their functions using the BLAST.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Metabolomics analysis</title><p>Untargeted metabolomics was performed using a modified version of a previously reported protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tsugawa et al., 2015</xref>). In brief, L-2-chlorophenylalanine (0.06 mg/ml) dissolved in methanol was taken as internal standard, the samples were performed to GC-MS analysis (Shanghai OE Biotech Co., Ltd). QC samples were prepared by mixing aliquots of all samples to be a pooled sample. Samples were analyzed on an Agilent 7890B gas chromatography system coupled to an Agilent 5977A MSD system (Agilent Technologies Inc, CA, USA). The temperature of the MS quadrupole and ion source (electron impact) was set to 150°C and 230°C, respectively. The collision energy was 70 eV. Mass spectrometric data were acquired in a full-scan mode (m/z 50–500). For data processing, MZmine 2 and MultiQuant software programs were used.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Bacterial single-cell RNA-seq and analysis</title><p>Bacterial single-cell RNA-seq was carried out on a commercially available platform (M20 Genomics Company) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xu et al., 2023</xref>). In brief, half a million <italic>S. marcescens</italic> cells were collected by centrifuging at 4°C. The supernatant was removed and cell pellets were resuspended with 2 ml ice-cold 4% formaldehyde (Sigma, 47608). The samples were incubated with shaking overnight at 4°C. The fixative was removed by centrifuging at 4000 rpm for 5 min at 4°C and cells were washed twice with 1 ml PBS-TRI (1× PBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween-20 and 0.1 U/ml Murine RNase inhibitor [Vazyme, R301]). The supernatant was removed and cells were resuspended in 200 μl PBS-TRI (1× PBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween-20 and 0.2 U/ml Murine RNase inhibitor [Vazyme, R 301]). The cell suspensions were counted with a Moxi cell counter and diluted according to the manufacturer’s instructions to obtain single cell.</p><p>The bacterial single-cell RNA-seq library was prepared according to the protocol of VITAPilote kit (M20 Genomics, R20114124). In situ reverse transcription of bacteria was performed with random primers and the resulting cDNA fragment was added with adaptor. The droplet barcoding for a single bacterium was performed on VITACruiser Single Cell Partitioning System (M20 Genomics, Hangzhou, China). Bacteria, DNA extension reaction mix, and hydrogel barcoded beads were encapsulated using the VITACruiser. The aqueous phase containing cDNAs was purified with magnetic beads. The cDNAs were amplified by PCR and purified with magnetic beads. All products were pooled to construct a standard sequencing library. Sequencing was done on a PE150 (Illumina), and raw reads were aligned against the <italic>S. marcescens FY</italic> genome and counted by StarSolo followed by secondary analysis in the Annotated Data Format. Sequencing data was further analyzed using Seurat (v.4.3.0.1 with default parameters except where indicated). Cells were filtered to retain only those with at least 100 genes. Genes were also screened to remove genes expressed only in fewer than five cells. Then, we first log-transformed the data using the NormalizeData function, and selected the 2000 most variable genes using FindVariableFeatures. Then, we z-scored these highly variable genes using ‘ScaleData’. Next, we performed linear dimensionality reduction using PCA down to 50 dimensions (‘RunPCA’). Points in this embedding were used to construct UMAP plots and find neighbors for clustering. FindClusters was used to run the Louvain clustering algorithm and generate clusters. We confirmed that the clusters highlighted in the main text appeared consistently for a range of resolutions from 0.5 to 1.5. DEG was performed using the FindMarkers function with a log-fold change cutoff of 0.25.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis is performed using GraphPad Prism 9.0 and indicated inside each figure legend. The layout of all figures used Adobe Illustrator 2022. Experimental flies were tested at the same condition, and all data are collected from at least two independent experiments. D’Agostino-Pearson normality test was used to verify the normal distribution of data. If normally distributed, a two-tailed Student’s t-test was used to compare two groups, and one-way ANOVA with two-stage step-up method of Benjamini, Krieger, and Yekutieli followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test was used for comparisons of multiple groups. If not normally distributed, a two-tailed Mann-Whitney U-test was performed to compare two groups of samples, while Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn’s multiple comparisons test was used for multiple comparisons among three or more groups.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Software, Formal analysis, Visualization, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Software, Formal analysis, Visualization, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Validation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Methodology, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Supervision, Methodology, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Supervision, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Supervision, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Resources, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Resources, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-96789-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Primers used for PCR experiments.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-96789-supp1-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>The list of genes with a significant change in bulk RNA-seq.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-96789-supp2-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>The list of metabolites with a signifcant change in metabolomics.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-96789-supp3-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp4"><label>Supplementary file 4.</label><caption><title>The single cell transcriptional profile of pathogenicity and bacterial propagation.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-96789-supp4-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>Sequencing data have been deposited in GEO under accession codes GSE232120 and GSE232484.

I do not fully agree with this statement. An alternative possibility could be that, since there are fewer S. marcescens in larvae-processed food, flies receive a lower pathogen load and consequently survive. Can the authors rule this out?</p><p>Also, the authors propose that <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae induce a transition from pathogenicity to commensalism in S. marcescens and provide nice phenotypic and transcriptomic data supporting this claim. However, is it driven only by transcriptional changes? Considering high mutation rates in bacteria, it is possible that S. marcescens during growth in the presence of larvae acquired mutations causing all the observed phenotypic and transcriptional changes. To test this possibility, the authors could check how long S. marcescens maintains the traits it acquires during growth with <italic>Drosophila</italic>. If these traits persist after reculturing isolated bacteria, it is very likely they are caused by genome alterations, if not - likely it is a phenotypic switch driven by transcriptional changes.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for providing a feasible method to distinguish the shift in transcriptional profile from genomic mutations. According to this valuable suggestion, we checked phenotypic and transcriptional changes after re-culturing the bacterium that had coexisted with larvae. We found that all phenotypes can be recovered after re-culturing. The new data supported our previous result that a phenotypic switch was driven by transcriptional changes rather than genome mutations. We now add these results to the text with figure supplement 3 (line 147-151, 192-194). Please see the following text.</p><p>“To rule out the possibility that phenotypic alterations could stem from genomic mutations, we examined the prodigiosin yield and CFUs of re-culturing <italic>S. marcescens</italic> that had coexisted with larvae. Our results showed that neither prodigiosin yield nor CFUs of re-culturing <italic>S. marcescens</italic> differed from the original strain (Figure 2-figure supplement 3A-C), suggesting that a phenotypic switch was driven primarily by transcriptional reprogramming.” “Consistent with the previous result that this phenotypic switch was driven by transcriptional changes, the expression of virulent and growth genes was recovered after re-culturing (Figure 3-figure supplement 3D, E).”</p><p>For the first question, we admit the possibility that the high morality of flies could result from the acquirement of a higher pathogen load, because of an increase in the bacterial load of single <italic>S. marcescens</italic>. However, host pathogenesis is normally determined by the virulence of pathogens rather than the number of bacteria. For example, hosts constantly harbor astonishing commensals in their guts, but remain healthy. This evidence suggests that it was the property (virulence) of a pathogen that is more important to affect the health status of the hosts. Moreover, an increase in virulence of single <italic>S. marcescens</italic> was verified by real-time PCR (Fig. 2F) and TE (Fig. 2G). Taken together, we could draw a conclusion that the impaired survival of flies challenged with single <italic>S. marcescens</italic> mainly arose from an increase in the virulence of <italic>S. marcescens</italic>. Thanks for your understanding!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>While many studies have explored the impacts of pathogens on hosts, the effect of hosts on pathogens has received less attention. In this manuscript, Wang et al. utilize <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and an opportunistic pathogen, Serratia marcescens, to explore how the host impacts pathogenicity. Beginning with an observation that larval presence and density impacted microbial growth in fly vials (which they assess qualitatively as the amount of 'slick' and quantitatively as microbial load/CFUs), the authors focus on the impact of axenic/germ-free larvae on an opportunistic pathogen S. marcescens. Similar to their observations with general microbial load, they find that larvae reduce the presence of a pinkish slick of Sm, indicative of its secondary metabolite prodigiosin. The presence of larvae alters prodigiosin production, pathogen load, pathogen cellular morphology, and virulence, and this effect is through transcriptional and metabolic changes in the pathogen. Overall, they observe a loss of virulence factors/pathways and an increase in pathways contributing to growth. Given the important role the host plays in this lifestyle shift, the authors then examined host features that might influence these effects, focusing on the role of antimicrobial peptides (Amps). The authors combine the use of synthetic Amps and an Amp-deficient fly line and conclude much of the larval inhibitory effect is due to their production of AMPs.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This is a very interesting question and the use of <italic>Drosophila</italic>-Serratia marcescens is a great model to explore these interactions and effects.</p><p>The authors have an interesting and compelling phenotype and are asking a unique question on the impact of the host on the pathogen. The use of microbial transcriptomics and metabolomics is a strength, especially in order to assess these impacts on the pathogen level and at the single-cell level to capture heterogeneity.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Overall, the writing style in the manuscript makes it difficult to fully understand and appreciate the data and its interpretation.</p><p>The data on the role of AMPs would benefit from strengthening. Some of the arguments in the text of that section are also counterintuitive. The authors show that △AMP larvae have a reduced impact on Sm as compared to wt larvae, but it seems less mild of an effect than that observed with wt excreta (assuming the same as secreta in Figures 7, should be corrected or harmonized). Higher doses of AMPs give a phenotype similar to wt larvae, but a lower dose (40 ng/ul) gives phenotypes more similar to controls. The authors argue that this data suggests AMPs are the factor responsible for much of the inhibition, but their data seems more to support that it's synergistic- you seem to still need larvae (or some not yet defined feature larvae make, although secreta/excreta was not sufficient) + AMPs to see similar effects as wt. Based on positioning and color scheme guessing that AMP 40ng/ul was used in Figures 7D-H, but could not find this detail in the text, methods, or figure legend and it should be indicated. This section does not seem to be well supported by the provided data, and this inconsistency greatly dampened this reviewer's enthusiasm for the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer’s valuable comments and suggestions. We admitted that some photos of the pinkish slick (prodigiosin) are counterintuitive in Figure 7 as well as figure supplement 2B. Here comes the reason. Single <italic>S. marcescens</italic> produced prodigiosin that only stayed on the surface of fly agar medium. As we know, larvae can agitate food and form a stratification of prodigiosin, even making higher prodigiosin yield inside food lighter than the surface slick of prodigiosin. We mentioned it in the previous manuscript line 166-168. This is why some photos treated with excreta and a lower dose of AMP seemed more intense than those with WT larvae. However, we precisely quantified the prodigiosin yield inside food with the spectrophotometer, so we provided a prodigiosin yield following the photos of the slick. Therefore, we drew our conclusions mainly relying on the quantification of the prodigiosin yield. We actually used cecropin A for our experiments, so we added this information in the text. We hope that our replies can reignite your enthusiasm for our manuscript, and thanks for your great support!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>In this study, Wang and coworkers established a model of <italic>Drosophila</italic>-S. marcescens interactions and thoroughly examined host-microbe bidirectional interactions.

However, several important questions remain unanswered. One such question is: What is the mechanism by which AMPs modulate the pathogen-to-commensal transition? One hypothesis suggests that antimicrobial activity may influence microbial physiology, subsequently modulating transcription for the transition from pathogen to commensal. In this context, it is imperative to test various antibiotics with different modes of action (e.g., targeting the cell wall, transcription, or translation) at sub-lethal concentrations to determine whether sub-lethal doses of antimicrobial activity are sufficient to induce the pathogen-to-commensal transition.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the important comments on our manuscript. We checked the effect of antibiotics (5 μg/μl kanamycin and 10 μg/μl ampicillin) on the virulence switch of <italic>S. marcescens</italic>. We found that the two antibiotics with the sub-lethal doses similarly resulted in a decrease in prodigiosin yield and virulence expression of <italic>S. marcescens</italic>. Intriguingly, the two antibiotics also resulted in a dramatic decline in the bacterial load and the expression of genes involved in cell growth. These results suggest that antibiotics reduced the virulence primarily through suppressing most activities of bacteria.</p><p>We found that larvae and AMPs at 40 μg/μl modestly resulted in a decrease in bacterial load and an increase in the relative level of genes involved in cellular proliferation, suggesting that AMPs could maintain the exponential phase of bacterial growth. This result is consistent that <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae can support the long-term persistence of commensals in the shared habitat (DOI: 10.1016/j.cmet.2017.11.011). The inhibition could prevent bacteria from rapidly exhausting their nutritional resources, and consequently maintain symbiosis. It is likely that AMPs could maintain <italic>S. marcescens</italic> at the exponential phase of cell growth and prevent bacteria from rapidly exhausting their nutritional resources.</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>(A) Representative images of surface slick with <italic>S. marcescens</italic> alone, with kanamycin (5 μg/μl) and ampicillin (10 μg/μl).

Virtually, there were no larvae inside the vials with single <italic>S. marcescens</italic>, so bacterial cells were not consumed. However, the numbers of CFUs of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> alone at the later stages were reduced (compared to the peak load at 48 h post-inoculation), so it was deterred that bacteria could undergo ecological suicide. Ecological suicide of the bacterial population was examined by recording the number of CFUs in the medium over time (Ratzke C, et al. Nat Ecol Evol. 2018.).

Moreover, TE was used to observe changes in the virulence of <italic>S.</italic> marcescens (DOI: 10.1093/nar/gkab1186).

In fact, food was agitated more heavily by glass sticks than by larvae, because larvae merely agitated the surface of food (about 0.5 cm-depth). If the decrease in bacterial load and color was related to the magnitude of agitation, larvae would confer a less decrease (from the decrease in stick agitation) in bacterial load than the sticks. Consequently, it would further support our result that biofactors more importantly confer the inhibition of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> than force.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Figure 4D: with this metabolome data, they mentioned, &quot;host suppresses differentiation of S. marcescens into the population with pathogenicity.&quot; What evidence supports the claim that downregulation of amino acid metabolism, phosphotransferase system, and ABC transporter directly correlates with decreased pathogenicity?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the comment. Earlier studies showed that amino acid-derived quorum sensing molecules are closely related to bacterial pathogenicity (Defoirdt T. PLoS Pathog. 2019; Wen J, et al. Microbiol Spectr. 2022). Moreover, the phosphotransferase system and ABC transporter can transport and/or produce virulence factors. Therefore, we claimed that downregulation of amino acid metabolism, phosphotransferase system, and ABC transporter directly were related to decreased pathogenicity. To support this claim, we add some references in the updated manuscript line 662-664, 827-830.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Serotonin: Does serotonin also reduce the virulence of S. marcescens?</p></disp-quote><p>Our primary result showed that serotonin indeed could reduce the virulence of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> (figure supplement 4), because the survival rate of adult flies was increased and the expression levels of virulence-related genes of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> alone in the case of serotonin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Figures 6D, E, H, I: The expression of key genes should be verified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), as scRNA-seq expression levels might not accurately reflect the true expression levels.</p></disp-quote><p>Bacterial single-cell RNA-seq can evaluate alterations in gene expression in the single-cell resolution.

Indeed, Delta AMP + AMP exhibited a stronger effect on the bacteria compared to AMP alone. We admitted that immune effectors other than AMP may be involved. Alternatively, mechanical force, to a less extent, accounted for the stronger effect on the bacteria (Explained by larvae agitation in figure supplement 2). To rule out this possibility, we examined the effect of total immune effectors on the bacterial load and the prodigiosin yield of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> using the IMD pathway mutant (<italic>RelE20</italic> larvae).
