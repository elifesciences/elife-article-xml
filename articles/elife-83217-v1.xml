neurons; Sema3F mediates dendritic spine pruning, whereas Sema3A promotes the elaboration of basal dendrites. Sema3F and Sema3A signal through distinct holoreceptors that include neuropilin-2 (Nrp2)/plexinA3 (PlexA3) and neuropilin-1 (Nrp1)/PlexA4, respectively. We find that Nrp2 and Nrp1 are S-palmitoylated in cortical neurons and that palmitoylation of select Nrp2 cysteines is required for its proper subcellular localization, cell surface clustering, and also for Sema3F/Nrp2-dependent dendritic spine pruning in cortical neurons, both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we show that the palmitoyl acyltransferase ZDHHC15 is required for Nrp2 palmitoylation and Sema3F/Nrp2-dependent dendritic spine pruning, but it is dispensable for Nrp1 palmitoylation and Sema3A/Nrp1-dependent basal dendritic elaboration. Therefore, palmitoyl acyltransferase-substrate specificity is essential for establishing compartmentalized neuronal structure and functional responses to extrinsic guidance cues.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neuropilins</kwd><kwd>neuropilin-2</kwd><kwd>Sema3F</kwd><kwd>palmitoylation</kwd><kwd>palmitoyl acyltransferases</kwd><kwd>cortical neurons</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH100024-Project #3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kolodkin</surname><given-names>Alex L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003447</institution-id><institution>State Scholarships Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Koropouli</surname><given-names>Eleftheria</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004117</institution-id><institution>A.G.

This is particularly prominent in laminated structures, including the cerebral cortex, where pyramidal neurons occupying different cortical layers acquire distinct morphologies and their processes exhibit subcellular compartmentalization that mediates distinct functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Spruston, 2008</xref>). For example, dendritic spines, which receive the vast majority of excitatory inputs, have specific subcellular distributions that directly impact electrical properties of neurons and subsequently the activity within neuronal circuits. Numerous studies highlight the physiological importance of dendritic spines, linking alterations in spine number and morphology to various neuropsychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Penzes et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>One class of proteins implicated in nervous system development are semaphorins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koropouli and Kolodkin, 2014</xref>). Class 3 secreted semaphorins semaphorin 3F (Sema3F) and semaphorin 3A (Sema3A) play critical roles in several aspects of neural development and function, including axon guidance, axon pruning, dendritic arborization, dendritic spine distribution, synaptic transmission, and homeostatic synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Danelon et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Demyanenko et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koropouli and Kolodkin, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Riccomagno et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sahay et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tran et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). In mammalian cortical neurons, Sema3F mediates pruning of excess dendritic spines along the apical dendrite of layer V cortical pyramidal neurons, whereas Sema3A promotes the elaboration of basal dendrites in the same neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tran et al., 2009</xref>). Sema3F and Sema3A bind distinct holoreceptor complexes that include neuropilin (Nrp) and plexin (Plex) transmembrane proteins; Sema3F exerts many of its effects via a holoreceptor complex that includes Nrp2/PlexA3, whereas Sema3A acts through a holoreceptor complex that includes Nrp1/PlexA4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yaron et al., 2005</xref>). Recent work provides insight into the signaling pathways that mediate Sema3F/Nrp2-dependent cytoskeletal rearrangements resulting in dendritic spine pruning in cortical neurons, including contributions by specific immunoglobin superfamily transmembrane proteins that mediate select responses to secreted semaphorins and proteins that regulate actin cytoskeleton dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Demyanenko et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Duncan et al., 2021</xref>). However, molecular mechanisms that regulate neuropilin subcellular localization and underlie divergent Sema3F and Sema3A functions in cortical neurons remain largely unknown.</p><p>The attachment of the fatty acid palmitate on thiol groups of cysteine residues, known as S-palmitoylation (hereafter referred to as palmitoylation), is a reversible posttranslational modification that dynamically regulates protein localization and function of a vast protein repertoire in different tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Linder and Deschenes, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Salaun et al., 2010</xref>). In the nervous system, palmitoylation is critically involved in all aspects of neural development and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fukata and Fukata, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kang et al., 2008</xref>), including axon outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tortosa et al., 2017</xref>), dendritic arborization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Takemoto-Kimura et al., 2007</xref>), spine formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">George et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kutzleb et al., 1998</xref>), synapse assembly, synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">El-Husseini et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hayashi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Keith et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sanders et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Thomas et al., 2012</xref>), and synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brigidi et al., 2014</xref>). Strikingly, there is an apparent interaction between palmitoylation and synaptic transmission since neuronal activity can regulate protein palmitoylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brigidi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hayashi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kang et al., 2008</xref>). Palmitoylation is catalyzed by palmitoyl acyltransferases (PATs), enzymes that harbor the catalytically active Asp-His-His-Cys (DHHC) signature motif (thereby, also referred to as DHHCs). Originally discovered in the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lobo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Roth et al., 2002</xref>)<italic>,</italic> thus far 23 DHHC enzymes are predicted to exist in humans and mice. PATs exhibit overlapping, yet distinct, specificities for their substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Roth et al., 2006</xref>). Despite systematic and extensive efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Roth et al., 2006</xref>), our knowledge of DHHC enzyme substrates remains very limited, hindering our understanding of the roles that PATs play in neuronal development and function.</p><p>Here, we show that both Nrp2 and Nrp1 are palmitoylated in cortical neurons in vitro and in vivo, and that palmitoylation of select Nrp2 cysteine residues is required for correct Nrp2 subcellular localization, cell surface clustering, and for Sema3F/Nrp2-dependent dendritic spine pruning both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings also reveal that the PAT ZDHHC15 is required for proper Nrp2 palmitoylation and Sema3F/Nrp2-dependent dendritic spine pruning in layer V cortical pyramidal neurons, but not for Nrp1 palmitoylation or for Sema3A/Nrp1-dependent basal dendrite elaboration in these same neurons. These results highlight the importance of guidance cue receptor posttranslational lipid modifications to regulate distinct aspects of cortical neuron morphology.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Nrp2 and Nrp1 exhibit distinct cell surface distribution patterns and global inhibition of palmitoylation leads to Nrp2 mislocalization</title><p>To understand the mechanisms by which Sema3F and Sema3A exert distinct effects on the development of layer V cortical pyramidal neurons, we investigated the localization and function of their obligate co-receptors, Nrp2 and Nrp1, respectively. First, we assessed the localization of Nrp2 and Nrp1 on the surface of COS-7 cells owing to the well-articulated plasma membrane and large circumference of these cells in culture. COS-7 cells transfected with flag-tagged wild-type Nrp2 or Nrp1 expression plasmids were subjected to surface staining with a flag antibody to visualize Nrp localization on the plasma membrane. We observed that Nrp2 is distributed on the COS-7 cell surface in a clustered pattern consisting of numerous discrete puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), whereas Nrp1 is evenly distributed over the entire plasma membrane with little evidence of clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Particle analysis (see Materials and methods) provides a quantitative assessment of protein clustering and reveals a marked difference between the membrane localization of Nrp2 and Nrp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This robust Nrp2 clustering is reminiscent of the cell surface clustering displayed by palmitoylated proteins in COS-7 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Webb et al., 2000</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Distinct cell surface localization patterns of neuropilin-2 (Nrp2) and Nrp1 are abolished by global inhibition of palmitoylation.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Surface localization of Nrp2 and Nrp1 in COS-7 cells expressing exogenous flag-tagged Nrp2 wild-type (WT) (<bold>A</bold>) or Nrp1 WT (<bold>B</bold>).

We treated COS-7 cells expressing flag-tagged wild-type Nrp2 (Nrp2<sup>WT</sup>) with 2-bromopalmitate, or a control solution, and visualized cell surface Nrp2. Following bath application of 2-bromopalmitate, Nrp2 was markedly redistributed compared to the control, displaying a diffuse localization on the cell surface similar to Nrp1, which is localized diffusely following either control or 2-bromopalmitate treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). 2-Bromopalmitate-induced Nrp2 dispersion is consistent with previous reports showing 2-bromopalmitate-induced diffusion of otherwise clustered palmitoylated proteins in non-neuronal cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Webb et al., 2000</xref>) and in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">El-Husseini et al., 2002</xref>).

Both Nrp2 and Nrp1 harbor cysteine residues in their transmembrane and membrane-proximal (juxtamembrane) domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, in red). Nrp2 also has a lone cysteine residue, C897 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, in red) carboxy-terminal (C-terminal) to the transmembrane domain and two adjacent C-terminal cysteine residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, in blue). These Nrp2 and Nrp1 cysteine residues are all highly phylogenetically conserved among vertebrate species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The location and conservation of these cysteine residues, coupled with the presence of palmitoyl acceptor amino acid residues predicted using CSS-Palm software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ren et al., 2008</xref>), suggested that these cysteine residues are palmitoyl acceptor sites. To explore this further, we used the acyl-biotin exchange (ABE) assay, a well-established biochemical approach for the detection of palmitoylation on thiol groups of cysteines (S-palmitoylation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Drisdel and Green, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Roth et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wan et al., 2007</xref>). In this assay, we used the postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) as a positive palmitoylation control because it is palmitoylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Topinka and Bredt, 1998</xref>), and synapse-associated protein 102 (SAP102) as a negative palmitoylation control because it is not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kang et al., 2008</xref>). We observed that both Nrp2 and Nrp1 are palmitoylated in adult mouse forebrain and in embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) mouse cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), as are both Nrps in cortical neurons 28 days in vitro (DIV) derived from E14.5 embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The detection of Nrp palmitoylation from early embryonic stages (E14.5) to adulthood raises the possibility that palmitoylation of these co-receptors is required throughout neural development and in the adult to regulate Nrp trafficking and function.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Neuropilins are palmitoylated in deep layer primary cortical neurons and in the mouse brain.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Amino acid sequence of transmembrane (underlined) and cytoplasmic domains of neuropilin-2 (Nrp2) and Nrp1, as predicted by Ensembl genome database.

Western blots show endogenous proteins that are detected with protein-specific antibodies. Hydroxylamine-treated (+HA) samples show palmitoylated protein, while -HA samples serve as a negative control. Separate inputs were taken from the samples that were then processed with +HA or -HA buffer; therefore ‘Input (+HA)’ represents the input of +HA sample and ‘Input (-HA)’ represents the input of -HA sample. Both Nrp2 and Nrp1 are palmitoylated in the adult mouse forebrain, in E14.5 cerebral cortex and in cortical neuron cultures, similar to postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) that serves as a positive palmitoylation control, as shown by the presence of signal in the +HA sample and the absence of signal in the -HA control sample. Synapse-associated protein 102 (SAP102), known not to be palmitoylated, serves as a negative control for palmitoylation and it is not palmitoylated. At E14.5, no PSD-95 or SAP102 are detected in the mouse cerebral cortex, apparently due to the very low expression of these synaptic markers at this stage of development.

We transfected cortical neurons with plasmids expressing pHluorin-tagged wild-type Nrp2 or various CS mutants and carried out live imaging. The pH-sensitive GFP variant pHluorin fluoresces robustly at neutral pH, and so the tagged protein is readily visualized when localized at the cell surface (see Materials and methods). These live imaging assessments of surface protein localization showed that Nrp2<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>) and Nrp2<sup>C922S/C923S</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>) exhibit a prominent punctate localization along the plasma membrane, consistent with their distribution in COS-7 cells.

Further, Golgi isolation experiments from mouse brain revealed Nrp2 enrichment in the GM130-positive Golgi fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>).</p><p>Next, we examined whether palmitoylated Nrp2 cysteine residues are required for the association between Nrp2 and the Golgi apparatus by performing immunofluorescence on <italic>Nrp2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cortical neurons transfected with either wild-type Nrp2 or various Nrp2 CS mutants. These experiments show that Nrp2<sup>WT</sup> and Nrp2<sup>C922S/C923S</sup> proteins display robust association with Golgi membranes, whereas the Nrp2<sup>TCS</sup> and Nrp2<sup>Full CS</sup> mutant proteins are significantly deficient in their association with the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C, D</xref>). The aberrant association of TCS and Full CS Nrp2 proteins with the Golgi apparatus could have major effects on their trafficking and plasma membrane insertion.</p><p>To investigate the role of palmitoylation in the spatial and temporal dynamics of Nrp2 trafficking, we focused on the role of transmembrane/juxtamembrane cysteines, which have the greatest effect on Nrp2 surface localization and Golgi association, performing fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) in cortical neurons expressing exogenous pHluorin-tagged Nrp2<sup>WT</sup> or Nrp2<sup>TCS</sup>. The fluorescent signal was bleached over a selected region of interest (ROI) and after photobleaching neurons were imaged for at least 15 min to visualize the recovery of fluorescence in the bleached area, which represents protein molecules either derived from nearby plasma membrane compartments or newly inserted in the cell membrane.

We treated wild-type cortical neurons with 5 nM Sema3F-AP, Sema3A-AP, or AP (control) and assessed palmitoylation of endogenous Nrp2 with the ABE assay. Interestingly, Sema3F application enhances Nrp2 palmitoylation in deep layer primary cortical neurons in culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>). This shows that Sema3F can upregulate Nrp2 palmitoylation, presumably at nearby subcellular domains and within dendritic spines, and it further suggests that Sema3F effects on cortical neurons are mediated by Nrp2 palmitoylation.</p><p>Next, we addressed whether Nrp2 cysteines C878, C885, and C887, which are required for rescuing the <italic>Nrp2</italic> mutant dendritic spine phenotype in cortical neurons in vitro, are also required for Sema3F/Nrp2-dependent dendritic spine pruning in vivo.

To assess the feasibility of this approach, we first carried out two control IUE experiments: one with an EGFP-expressing plasmid to visualize neuronal morphology (control) and a second using a combination of three plasmids: an <italic>EGFP</italic>-expressing plasmid, a <italic>Cre</italic>-expressing plasmid to excise the <italic>floxed Nrp2</italic> allele, and a <italic>LSL-tdTomato</italic>-expressing plasmid that serves as a reporter of Cre activity.

Importantly, a comparative analysis between Nrp2 and Nrp1 shows that PAT-substrate specificity contributes to the functional divergence and specification of Sema3F/Nrp2 as compared to Sema3A/Nrp1 signaling pathways in the CNS.</p><p>The discovery and functional characterization of neuropilin palmitoylation opens new avenues for investigating how these multifaceted neuronal cue receptors sculpt neuronal circuits. Despite Nrp2 and Nrp1 displaying similar palmitoylation patterns in their transmembrane and juxtamembrane segments, they exhibit critical differences with regard to their subcellular localization and function, and these can be partially ascribed to palmitoylation. Specifically, palmitoylation conveys upon Nrp2, a highly clustered localization pattern on the cell surface, whereas Nrp1 is diffusely localized on the plasma membrane regardless of its palmitoylation state. Further, our biochemical and phenotypic analyses of Sema3F/Nrp2-dependent cortical neuron dendritic spine pruning and Sema3A/Nrp1-dependent cortical neuron dendritic elaboration reveal that the PAT ZDHHC15 is required for Sema3F/Nrp2 function in cortical neurons, whereas it is not required for Sema3A/Nrp1 function in this same class of neuron. These observations show that palmitoylation endows Nrp2 and Nrp1 with distinct functional properties that allow these receptors to exert their well-defined and distinct effects on cortical layer V pyramidal neuron morphogenesis. This may be explained by palmitoylation events mediated by distinct PATs and/or palmitoylation at distinct subcellular sites being differentially important for protein localization and function. For example, palmitoylation close to the plasma membrane might regulate the targeting of a protein to dendritic spines and/or synapses, and these events may also include activity-dependent or ligand-dependent effects on protein trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brigidi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Noritake et al., 2009</xref>). Additional factors that may interact with palmitoylation signaling, including other posttranslational modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Salaun et al., 2010</xref>), sorting signals, and protein-protein interactions, may endow Nrp2 and Nrp1 with additional protein-specific localizing and functional properties.</p><p>Our finding that Nrp2 cysteines critically control Nrp2 localization, homo-multimerization, and function in cortical neurons raises the question as to whether these effects are mediated by palmitoylation per se, or they result from cysteine residue-dependent structural effects. Several lines of evidence presented here, including robust Nrp2 palmitoylation, the effect of 2-bromopalmitate on Nrp2 cell surface localization, the Sema3F-induced enhancement of Nrp2 palmitoylation, and the critical role of ZDHHC15 in Nrp2 function, provide strong support for a palmitoylation-dependent role for these cysteines. Interestingly, cysteine palmitoylation itself has been shown to impact protein dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bhattacharyya et al., 2016</xref>). Given its reversibility, palmitoylation could give rise to bidirectional transformation between a palmitoylated state and a non-palmitoylated state that takes part in disulfide-linked dimer formation. In addition, given the critical role of neuron-glial related cell adhesion molecule (NrCAM) in Sema3F-dependent dendritic spine pruning in cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Demyanenko et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Duncan et al., 2021</xref>), it will be of interest to investigate the role of Nrp2 palmitoylation in the physical and functional interactions between the Nrp2/PlexA3 holoreceptor complex and NrCAM.</p><p>We find that the C-terminal Nrp2 di-cysteine motif CCXXX<sub>*</sub> (‘<sub>*</sub>’ denotes a stop codon) does not appear to play essential roles in Nrp2 localization on Golgi membranes, cell surface compartmentalization, or dendritic spine pruning, though minor effects of these cysteines can be observed in certain localization assays. This C-terminal motif is also present in paralemmin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kutzleb et al., 1998</xref>) and RhoB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamson et al., 1992</xref>), proteins in which the upstream cysteine is palmitoylated and the downstream cysteine is prenylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamson et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fukata and Fukata, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kutzleb et al., 1998</xref>). It is likely that the Nrp2 C-terminal di-cysteine motif is important for other aspects of Nrp2 function such as axon guidance or axon pruning. Further, the similar cell surface distribution patterns of Nrp2<sup>TCS</sup> and Nrp2<sup>Full CS</sup> suggest that the juxtamembrane cysteines predominate over the C-terminal cysteines in regulating Nrp2 subcellular localization. Even within the juxtamembrane cysteine cluster there appears to be synergistic and/or dominant effects among the three cysteines, as revealed by the non-additive effects of different cysteine mutants on overall Nrp2 palmitoylation and by the ability of these different Nrp2 proteins to regulate dendritic spine pruning. However, with regard to effects on overall protein clustering, more extensive Nrp2 CS mutants (e.g. Nrp2<sup>TCS</sup>, Nrp2<sup>Full CS</sup>) display more severe deficits in protein localization as compared to single CS mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and data not shown). Overall, our observations favor a model whereby there is functional segregation within the Nrp2 transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains that is attributable in part to distinct roles in Nrp2 localization and function being imparted by distinct cysteine clusters, consistent with previous observations on palmitoylation effects on ionotropic receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hayashi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hayashi et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Our observation that Nrp2 distribution includes localization in the Golgi apparatus suggests that bulk Nrp2 palmitoylation occurs on Golgi membranes, and that palmitoylated Nrp2 enters the post-Golgi secretory pathway to undergo anterograde trafficking toward the plasma membrane. Interestingly, a significant fraction of Nrp2 protein is associated with Golgi membranes in dendrites of cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>), known as Golgi outposts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Horton et al., 2005</xref>). This suggests that Nrp2 may also be palmitoylated locally in response to stimuli including its ligand Sema3F, other signaling effectors or even neuronal activity, and that Nrp2 is then delivered to dendritic spines and synapses in response to these cues, as has been observed for other proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Noritake et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, the enhancement we observe of Nrp2 palmitoylation by exposure to exogenous Sema3F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>) may lead to rapid and/or controlled delivery of Nrp2 to synaptic sites. Moreover, Nrp2 and its ligand Sema3F are dynamically regulated in response to alterations in neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang et al., 2017</xref>); in the case of Nrp2 this may in part be controlled by rapid cycles of Nrp2 palmitoylation-depalmitoylation in the vicinity of individual dendritic spines, a mechanism that can confer both spatial and temporal precision of protein localization and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fivaz and Meyer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fukata et al., 2004</xref>). This idea is in line with studies demonstrating activity-dependent palmitoylation of synapse-associated proteins in neural tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brigidi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hayashi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Noritake et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The spatial and temporal organization of the palmitoylation network is largely governed by the precise spatiotemporal regulation of PATs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Greaves and Chamberlain, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Noritake et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ohno et al., 2006</xref>), rendering substrate specificity a major determinant of the functional specification of cues that can regulate neuronal architecture and polarity. However, the landscape of protein palmitoylation is further enriched by modulators of DHHC activity and the concurrent activity of depalmitoylating enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Salaun et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tortosa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yokoi et al., 2016</xref>). Of note, there is increasing evidence that palmitoylation deficits lead to altered neuronal excitability and aberrant neuronal phenotypes linked to neural diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mansouri et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Milnerwood et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mukai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mukai et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mukai et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pinner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Raymond et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Singaraja et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sutton et al., 2013</xref>). In particular ZDHHC15, shown here to play essential roles in Nrp2 palmitoylation and function, has been implicated in X-linked intellectual disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lewis et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mansouri et al., 2005</xref>), impairments in learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2015</xref>), hyperactivity associated with a novel environment and sensitivity to psychostimulants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mejias et al., 2021</xref>), and also dendritic outgrowth and formation of mature spines in hippocampal neurons in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shah et al., 2019</xref>). Intriguingly, Sema3F/Nrp2 signaling has been shown to play important roles in hippocampal circuit function, and its dysregulation may cause epileptic activity in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eisenberg et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sahay et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, neuropilins are key players in cancer growth and progression and response to antineoplastic therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Napolitano and Tamagnone, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rizzolio and Tamagnone, 2011</xref>), and they also play important roles in the function of the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kumanogoh and Kikutani, 2013</xref>) and the vascular system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Simons et al., 2016</xref>). Our experiments identify neuropilins as new members of the neuronal palmitoyl proteome, reveal new DHHC enzymatic substrates in the CNS, and define DHHC enzyme-substrate specificity as a novel mechanism specifying the functional identity of neuronal substrates. These results advance our understanding of CNS development and function and may prove invaluable for the development of targeted therapeutic approaches directed toward amelioration of neural disorders associated with aberrant function of palmitoylation signaling pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Animal procedures were carried out in conformity with the policies and guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC) of the Johns Hopkins University (protocol # MO20M48), which are established according to the US National Research Council’s Guide to the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act and Public Health Service Policy.

Briefly, the workflow of this assay involves four main steps: (1) Tissue is harvested and lysed in lysis buffer containing <italic>S</italic>-methyl methanethiosulfonate (Sigma, Cat no. 64306) to block free thiol groups (-SH). (2) Incubation with a buffer containing hydroxylamine (NH<sub>2</sub>OH, Fisher Scientific, Cat no. 26103) that cleaves cysteine-linked palmitate thioester bonds or with control buffer that instead of hydroxylamine contains Tris. (3) Samples are incubated with a buffer containing biotin-HPDP (Soltec Ventures, Cat no. B106) that attaches to newly exposed cysteine thiols. Both buffers (for hydroxylamine-treated and control-treated samples) contain biotin-HPDP. Between steps 1–3, protein was precipitated by incubation with –20°C-cold 80% acetone at –20°C overnight and protein pellet was washed several times with the same solution before proceeding to next step. (4) Biotinylated proteins are affinity-purified with streptavidin agarose resin (Thermo Scientific, Cat no. 20349). The use of neutravidin agarose resin yielded the same results. ABE samples obtained with this assay were resolved with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and immunoblotting with protein-specific antibodies. In this assay, the proteins detected in the plus hydroxylamine (+HA) sample but not in the minus hydroxylamine (-HA) sample (which serves as an internal negative control) represent palmitoylated proteins and collectively comprise the palmitoyl proteome. In all ABE experiments, for each tissue sample, both +HA and -HA samples were processed in parallel and the specificity of +HA signal was confirmed by the complete absence of signal in -HA sample in western blotting.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Western blotting and quantification</title><p>Samples were mixed with Laemmli sample buffer (Laemmli, Bio-Rad, Cat no. 1610747), boiled at 95°C for 5 min, stored at –20°C and analyzed with SDS-PAGE and western blotting.

Next, the image was selected and a mask of the signal was created. The ‘mask’ image was analyzed with the ‘Analyze Particles’ tool, with protein particles (or clusters) defined based on two parameters, size in μm<sup>2</sup> (0-infinity) and circularity (0.00–1.00). Among the parameters provided in the results table for each cell analyzed are the particle count, the total area of fluorescence and the average size (area) of measured particles. Based on these, we calculate the ratio Count/Total Area, presented as ‘number of particles per μm<sup>2</sup> of fluorescence area’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C, E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>), which represents the degree of protein clustering; the more punctate/clustered the protein, the higher the ratio. The mean size of particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>) is an alternative measure of protein clustering; a cell with punctate protein distribution gives a low average size of protein particles, while a cell with diffuse protein distribution gives a higher average size of protein particles. Although particle analysis provides an estimate of protein distribution, it tends to underestimate differences in protein localization observed by visual inspection because thresholding softens differences between small and large particles and distinct localization patterns between Nrp2 CS mutants are abated. Therefore, this approach has a low sensitivity for capturing protein localization differences observed in neurons that have a lot of thin processes and small cytoplasmic volumes; this is the reason why particle analysis is not shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Immunofluorescence</title><sec id="s4-10-1"><title>Immunofluorescence in vitro</title><p>Cells adherent on coverslips were fixed with ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, washed with PBS and blocked with 10% goat or donkey serum (depending on the primary antibody) and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 hr at room temperature.

This ratio was further normalized to the total Golgi area (A<sub>Golgi</sub>) to take into account differences in the abundance of Golgi membranes between neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12-3"><title>Golgi isolation</title><p>Performed on wild-type mouse whole brain according to <italic>Current Protocols in Cell Biology</italic> (Unit 3.9, Basic Protocol 2). Mouse brain was harvested and gently homogenized with a Potter-Elvehjem pestle to avoid Golgi stack fragmentation. Golgi stacks were isolated by flotation through a discontinuous sucrose gradient. Briefly, light mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in 2 ml buffer and mixed with 8 ml 2.0 M sucrose so that final sucrose concentration is about 1.55 M. Five ml of this mix was transferred to a 17 ml ultracentrifuge tube (Beckman) and overlayed with the following sucrose solutions: 4 ml 1.33 M sucrose, 2 ml 1.2 M sucrose, 2 ml 1.1 M sucrose, 2 ml 0.77 M sucrose, 0.25 M sucrose to fill the tube. Gradients were centrifuged at 100,000 × <italic>g</italic> at 4°C for 1 hr. The following fractions were collected: 1.55M, 1.55M/1.33M, 1.33M, 1.1M/1.2M, intervening fraction, 0.77M/1.1M. Samples were prepared and stored for SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Live imaging</title><p>Live imaging was performed to visualize cell surface localization of pHluorin-tagged Nrp2 in primary cortical neurons or Neuro-2a cells. The pHluorin epitope tag serves as a robust fluorescent reporter of protein expressed on the cell surface because of its sensitivity to pH. Cells were cultured in individual glass bottom dishes (MatTek Life Sciences, Cat no. P35G-0-14C) precoated with poly-D-lysine and transfected with appropriate plasmids. One or two days after transfection, they were imaged live at an inverted LSM700 confocal microscope (Zeiss) with a 40× oil lens. Imaging parameters were set prior to the start of these experiments, and were kept constant during image acquisition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP)</title><p>Wild-type cortical neurons were cultured and plated on glass bottom dishes precoated with poly-D-lysine. Between DIV5 and DIV8 neurons were transfected with the indicated <italic>pHluorin-Nrp2-ires-dsRED</italic> expression plasmids with the method of Lipofectamine. A few days later, they were imaged with an inverted LSM700 microscope (Zeiss) with an incubation chamber (PeCon) (temperature: 37°C, CO<sub>2</sub>: 5%), using a 63× NA1.4 oil immersion lens. For the performance of FRAP, we used the following protocol: a ROI containing the main dendritic process was selected for FRAP analysis. Images were acquired every 30 s; five images were acquired prior to bleaching (prebleach time: 2.5 min) and 31 additional images were acquired post-bleaching (total post-bleach time: 15.5 min). Analysis: Fluorescence intensity of time-lapse images was determined by measuring the fluorescence intensity within the ROI and correcting for fluorescence decay and for background fluorescence. Imaging parameters were set prior to image acquisition and were kept constant throughout the course of these experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Immunoprecipitation in heterologous cells</title><p>Cell growth medium was aspirated and lysis buffer (TNE buffer: NP-40, Tris, EDTA, NaCl, protease inhibitor cocktail) was added in cells in the culture plate. Cells were scraped off, mechanically lysed on ice by passage through 1 ml syringes and incubated with rotation at 4°C for 1 hr. Samples were precleared with protein A/G agarose resin (Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat no. 20421) at 4°C for 2 hr. Next, after the resin was discarded, a small fraction of each sample was kept as input and the remaining samples were incubated with the appropriate antibody at 4°C overnight. Next, samples were incubated with protein A/G agarose with end-over-end rotation at 4°C for 2 hr. Resin was washed twice with high-salt buffer (500 mM NaCl) and twice with low-salt buffer (150 mM NaCl). Proteins were eluted from resin with Laemmli sample buffer diluted in TNE buffer, boiled at 95°C for 5 min and analyzed with SDS-PAGE and western blotting.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Alkaline phosphatase-fused ligand production</title><p>Alkaline phosphatase (AP)-tagged Sema3A and Sema3F or AP expression plasmids were transfected into 293T cells with the method of Lipofectamine. Cells were allowed to secrete the ligand for 2–5 days. The culture supernatant was collected and transferred to a 50 ml MW filter tube (Centricon filters, Millipore) and was centrifuged at 35 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. A 50 K filter was used for AP concentration and a 100 K filter was used for concentration of Sema3A-AP or Sema3F-AP. The liquid above the filter was transferred to a new tube and ligand concentration was determined with a spectrophotometer by measuring AP activity by the change in absorbance at OD 405 nm. This figure was then converted to nM. The concentrated ligand was aliquoted and stored at –80°C. For each experiment, a new aliquot was thawed and used for culture treatment to avoid protein decay from thawing and refreezing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title><italic>Nrp2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> rescue experiments</title><p>For in vitro rescue, E14.5 <italic>Nrp2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> primary cortical neurons were transfected at DIV7 with the indicated plasmids.

Briefly, anesthesia was delivered with intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital and, upon anesthetization, a small vertical incision was made on the abdominal cavity and embryos were gently pulled out. DNA was microinjected in the lateral ventricle with a fine and polished glass capillary tube placed in a mouth-controlled pipette, followed by the administration of five electric pulses of 30–35 V and 50 ms each with inter-pulse interval 950 ms, by the use of forceps-type electrodes. Embryos were placed back in the mother’s abdomen, the incision was closed with silk sutures or surgical staples and the mouse was placed back in the cage on a slide warmer, with hydrogel next to it, and monitored until full recovery. After the surgery and until pup delivery the pregnant female was kept in the High Risk Mouse Room. Newborn mice were sacrificed on postnatal day 28 (P28) and brains were examined for direct fluorescence with a stereoscope. Electroporated brains were processed for immunofluorescence that included triple staining for EGFP, dsRED, and Ctip2; the latter to confirm that labeled neurons used for phenotypic analysis are Ctip2<sup>+</sup> (layer V pyramidal neurons).</p></sec><sec id="s4-18-2"><title>Genetic labeling</title><p>The <italic>Thy1-EGFP-m</italic> line was crossed to <italic>Zdhhc15</italic>-KO mice for labeling of layer V cortical pyramidal neurons. <italic>Zdhhc15<sup>+/-</sup>;Thy1-EGFP</italic> female mice were crossed to generate sex-matched wild-type and <italic>Zdhhc15</italic>-KO littermates expressing Thy1-EGFP.

PK401) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, brains were dissected and incubated with impregnation solution A+B for 12 days in darkness at room temperature (solution was replaced by fresh the second day). After 12 days, brains were incubated with solution C for 4 days in darkness at 4°C (solution C was replaced by fresh the second day). Brains were embedded in NEG-50 frozen section medium following regular procedures and sectioned with a cryostat (Leica) at the sagittal plane at 100 μm thickness. Sections were transferred on gelatin-coated superfrost plus slides, left to dry in the dark overnight and next day they were stained according to the protocol. Neurons were imaged with acquisition of stacks using a DIC at an inverted LSM700 confocal microscope (Zeiss), with a 20× lens for visualization of dendrites and a 63× oil lens for visualization of dendritic spines.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Phenotypic analysis</title><sec id="s4-19-1"><title>Dendritic spine assay and analysis</title><p>For dendritic spine assessment in vitro, neurons were cultured on glass coverslips until DIV21 to allow spine formation. Between DIV7 and DIV9 they were transfected with pCIG2-ires-EGFP-expressing plasmids and at DIV21 they were treated with 5 nM Sema3F-AP or 5 nM AP (control) in neuron growth medium for 6 hr in the tissue culture incubator (37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>). Subsequently, neurons were fixed with ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and subsequently subjected to EGFP immunofluorescence. For both in vitro and in vivo analysis, EGFP-expressing neurons were imaged with an upright laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM700, Zeiss) with a 63× oil lens by the acquisition of Z-stacks. Imaging parameters were kept constant during image acquisition across all samples. For spine analysis, the 3D projection was calculated and spines were counted along the proximal 50 μm of the apical dendrite (relative to the cell body). All subtypes of dendritic spines (stubby, mushroom, filopodia-like) were counted.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19-2"><title>Dendritic arborization assay and analysis</title><p>For dendritic arborization assessment in vitro, neurons were cultured on glass coverslips until DIV12 to allow dendritic elaboration. At DIV12 primary cortical neurons were treated with 5 nM Sema3A-AP or 5 nM AP (control) for 6 hr in neuron growth medium in the tissue culture incubator (37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>). After treatment, they were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and subjected to immunofluorescence with an antibody directed against the somatodendritic marker MAP2. For both in vitro and in vivo analysis, imaging was performed at an LSM700 upright confocal microscope (Zeiss) with a 40× oil lens with the acquisition of Z-stacks. Imaging parameters were kept constant during image acquisition across all samples. The calculated 3D projection was thresholded and any background fluorescence or neighboring neurons interfering with the analysis were erased with the paintbrush tool. The point selection was placed at the center of the cell body and Sholl analysis (ImageJ) was run to count the dendritic processes at various distances from the cell body, ranging from 0 to 100 μm or 150 μm.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Statistical analysis and software</title><p>Statistical significance and the size of samples analyzed are presented in figures and figure legends. Image analysis was performed using ImageJ software with appropriate plugins (Rasband, WS, ImageJ, U.S. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/">https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>, 1997–2016). The prediction of neuropilin palmitoylation sites was performed with the CSS-Palm 3.0 software, which is freely available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ren et al., 2008</xref>). Conservation analysis of Nrp2 and Nrp1 amino acid sequences across species was performed with the ClustalW software. Details for the analysis of individual biochemical and phenotypic experiments are provided in separate sections. Data were collected in Excel and GraphPad Prism. Generation of all graphs and statistical analyses were performed in GraphPad Prism. The GraphPad Prism software was purchased. Figure assembly and generation of schematics presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E and F</xref> have been performed in Adobe Illustrator. Statistical analysis tests include two-tailed t test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the appropriate post hoc test for multiple comparisons (as mentioned in figure legends). The choice of post hoc statistical tests was based on the appropriate comparison-biological question under study in each experiment. For example, when one condition is used as a control and all other conditions are compared with the control, which is the case in many of our experiments, Dunnett’s post hoc test is performed since it is the most appropriate test in these cases. For comparison of predefined pairs, such as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> where each Nrp2 protein is separately examined for its ability to respond to Sema3F, Sidak’s post hoc analysis is used since it assumes that each comparison is independent of the others, which is the case in this experiment. For comparison of every mean with every other mean, as it is the case in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, Tukey’s test is the most appropriate. Overall, besides selecting post hoc tests based on generally accepted determinations of appropriate statistical tests for the different experimental paradigms in this study, our post hoc test selection was also guided by GraphPad Prism, which provides, based on the particular biological question under study (i.e. sets of comparisons), recommended and non-recommended post hoc analysis methods. Statistical significance is defined as: *p&lt;0.05; **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001, ****p&lt;0.0001, ns: not significant. Exact p values are presented either on graphs or in figure legends.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>Randal Hand is affiliated with Prilenia Therapeutics Development LTD.

morphology of dendritic spines and dendritic arborization during development. In this manuscript, the authors found that the post-translational modification of S-palmitoylation dictates the subcellular localization and trafficking of Nrp2, but not Nrp1, and is required for Sema3F-dependent pruning of spines on the apical dendrites of layer V cortical neurons. The study provides important insights into how semaphorin signaling achieves spatial specificity on diverse downstream cellular events.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83217.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Yasuda</surname><given-names>Ryohei</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02rbfnr22</institution-id><institution>Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.10.28.514228">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.28.514228v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Catherine Dulac as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please address concerns about extremely low N or N not stated for some experiments.

While the authors count the number of cells/neurons measured as the n number in many of the quantifications throughout the paper, the number of &quot;independent culture experiments&quot; or the &quot;number of animals per genotype&quot; should really be used for the n number, and within each experiment/animal the (average or total) number of cells/neurons measures should be reported.</p><p>It is also standard to first perform a priori power analysis to determine the sample size for statistical significance. For example, the in vivo genetic interaction experiment between Nrp2 and DHHC15 (Figure 7C and 7D), only two brains per genotype were analyzed, while the number of neurons analyzed was used as the n number it is also well known that genetically modified animals can have a wide range of variability.</p><p>Also, why is several (at least 3-4) different type of multiple comparison tests being performed for similar quantifications?

This includes the following figures:</p><p>Figure 6A-C</p></disp-quote><p>For these ABE experiments in wild-type vs. <italic>ZDHHC15</italic>-KO primary cortical neurons, which include checking for intraexperimental reproducibility and control for potential differences in protein expression in input samples (endogenous protein), there are indeed 3 independent ABE assays for the <italic>Nrp-2</italic> condition, each with 3 biological replicas (neurons harvested from different animals/cultures) for each genotype, as shown in Figure 6A (I, II, III denote biological replicas). For Nrp-1, these data come from 2 independent ABE experiments, however, each experiment includes 3 biological replicas per genotype. This may have gone unnoticed but was included in Figure 6 legend; we clarify this further in our revised manuscript (lines 1697-1701).</p><p>We think that these results, owing to the number of replicas/experiment and the number of ABE assays, along with our observations that Sema3F/Nrp-2 signaling in <italic>ZDHHC15</italic>-KO neurons in vitro is affected (Figure 6D-F), whereas Sema3A/Nrp-1 is not (Figure 6G–I), together provide support for ZDHHC15 having an effect on Nrp-2 palmitoylation but no effect on Nrp-1 palmitoylation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6G-I (number of biological replicates not stated)</p></disp-quote><p>For this experiment there are 3 different experiments, each of which employed an independent mouse of the indicated genotype—this is described in the Figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 7 C-D</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed the most important point raised, in our view, and it was raised by both reviewers 1 and 2. The reviewers are correct—there are only 2 brains per genotype. Though it is no excuse, the reason behind this very low number of animals is that for our quantifications we only considered mice from the same litter. To obtain all four alleles (<italic>Nrp-2<sup>WT</sup></italic>, <italic>Nrp-2 knockout</italic>, <italic>ZDHHC15<sup>WT</sup></italic>, and Z<italic>DHHC15 knockout</italic>) in the three different configurations along with Thy1-GFP expression (genetic labeling of layer V neurons) within the same litter required many, many matings. This is further complicated by the fact that the <italic>ZDHHC15</italic> gene is located at the X chromosome – as clarified in the revised manuscript (lines 383-384) – which necessitates the study of genes’ dose-dependent effects in heterozygous females. Given all these limitations, in the end, these were the only animals/neurons we obtained. Though these are all littermate controls, which is a strength, we realize that the animal numbers are low.</p><p>One possibility is not to include this experiment in our manuscript. However, as suggested by the Reviewing Editor, we provide to the reviewers in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> additional graphs that break down these data for each of the two brains used for each of the three genotypes in this experiment, showing that there is no apparent difference in the distribution of data points between any 2 brains per genotype in these littermate pups.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-83217-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>However, we agree that our conclusions referring to this experiment, as suggested, must be softened, and we have moved this experiment from Figure 7C-D to Figure 7—figure supplement 1CD, indicating in the main text (lines 459-473) and supplemental figure legend the caveats associated with this experiment.We would like to point out that these experiments were performed some time ago, prior to the onset of the pandemic, and owing to issues relating to Covid 19-restrictions on experimentation and animal husbandry, we no longer have the mutants in our collection necessary for replication of these experiments to expand n’s. However, even if we did, it would take 6-9 months, at least, to obtain these same allele combinations, so in the end we are not able to increase the n’s for this experiment.</p><p>One could argue that genetic interactions of this sort are helpful but of course not definitive evidence of direct interactions between signaling pathway components, though over the years we have used this sort of argument in our work. In our current study there are also caveats associated with this sort of genetic interaction experiment, including that there are many other potential ZDHHC15 substrates besides neuropilin-2 (Nrp-2), and also that we cannot rule out with these data in hand, even if the n’s were substantially higher, haploinsufficiency issues in these genetic combinations which could mask the phenotypic effect of the tested genetic interaction (as shown previously for ZDHHC8)(Mukai et al., 2015, 2008, 2004). Moreover, given the location of <italic>ZDHHC15</italic> gene on the X chromosome, there could be phenotypic variability in <italic>ZDHHC15</italic> heterozygous females depending on random X-inactivation (lyonization).</p><p>We would also like to mention that in addition to this in vivo genetic interaction experiment, which suggests a direct interaction between Nrp-2 and ZDHHC15, there are other results in our manuscript that support a direct interaction between Nrp-2 and ZDHHC15 in cortical neurons:</p><p>1-Palmitoylation of Nrp-2 is reduced in <italic>ZDHHC15</italic>-KO cortical neurons in vitro</p><p><italic>2-ZDHHC15</italic>-KO neurons in vitro do not respond to Sema3F, but do respond to Sema3A</p><p>3<italic>-ZDHHC15</italic>-KO neurons in vivo do show the same dendritic spine phenotype as it is observed in <italic>Nrp-2</italic> mutants (and we present here n = 4 mice for use of EGFP to mark neuronal morphology, and further an additional n = 3 mice using Golgi staining). Note that in Figure 7A-B, we state n = 4 mice per genotype (WT vs <italic>ZDHHC15</italic>-KO with Thy1-GFP). This was a mistake on our part (in our original submission we stated n = 3 mice/genotype), and it has been corrected in the revised manuscript. All source data available is provided, as per <italic>eLife</italic> publication policy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>One major weakness for this study is the very low n number in several of the key experiments, indicated in the concerns (#1) in the Public Review.

These observations lead us to speculate about potential mechanisms that regulate Nrp-2 palmitoylation and function. Based on our experiments, it appears that the effect of mutating cysteine residues is not strictly additive; there seems to be a predominant role of select cysteine residues, e.g. C878, in regulating overall Nrp-2 palmitoylation. Similarly, single cysteine residues appear to be required for dendritic spine pruning to variable extents. The prevailing mechanism seems to be a dominant/synergistic effect among cysteine residues within the same cysteine cluster, such that when one cysteine residue is mutated there is a disproportional change in protein palmitoylation and function.</p><p>However, in our protein clustering assay, we did observe that the effect of cysteine mutations on Nrp-2 localization is roughly additive. Specifically, single cysteine mutants did not have any detectable deficit in our clustering assay (<italic>data not shown</italic>), whereas the TCS mutant invariably exhibited diffuse surface localization in both neurons and heterologous cell lines. We think that loss of clustering is a major deficit and assays that can reveal more specific effects on protein localization should be part of future studies in order to explain functional deficits of single cysteine mutants in the case of Nrp-2 and other palmitoylated proteins.</p><p>We have addressed this excellent point raised by this reviewer in our Discussion to explain these observations and models for Nrp-2 palmitoylation (lines 547-561).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is also standard to first perform a priori power analysis to determine the sample size for statistical significance.

There are several different post hoc tests, each appropriate for a different type of comparison. Therefore the appropriate post hoc test was chosen based on the desired comparison and the biological question being addressed; this is why we have used different tests for different experiments in this study. For example, when different categories are compared with a single control, as it is the case in many of our experiments, Dunnett’s post hoc test is the most appropriate; for comparison of predefined pairs, Bonferroni or Sidak’s are usually used. Moreover, in several cases two different post-hoc tests have been performed in order to look for consistency of the results regardless of the test used. For example, in Figure 4B, Dunnett’s and Bonferroni’s methods give the same degree of statistical significance; the same is true in Figure 4C with Sidak’s and Bonferroni’s methods. To clarify how we were guided in our choice of post hoc tests following ANOVA, and also all of the other statistical tests we use in this study, we have added a rationale statement in the Materials and methods–Statistical analysis and software subsection (lines 13201336).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>My main criticism is the N seems to be low (n=2) in several of the experiments, most importantly in the genetic interaction of Nrp2 and DHHC15, which is a highly important experiment for this paper.</p></disp-quote><p>The main criticism by this reviewer regarding the low Ns in the genetic interaction experiment between <italic>Nrp-2</italic> and <italic>ZDHHC15</italic>, presented in our former Figure 7C-D, is addressed in point #3 of the Essential Revisions presented above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.
