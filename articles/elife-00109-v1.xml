Here, we used a single vesicle–vesicle system with reconstituted SNARE and synaptotagmin-1 proteoliposomes to decipher the temporal sequence of membrane states upon Ca<sup>2+</sup>-injection at 250–500 μM on a 100-ms timescale. Furthermore, detailed membrane morphologies were imaged with cryo-electron microscopy before and after Ca<sup>2+</sup>-injection. We discovered a heterogeneous network of immediate and delayed fusion pathways. Remarkably, all instances of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered immediate fusion started from a membrane–membrane point-contact and proceeded to complete fusion without discernible hemifusion intermediates. In contrast, pathways that involved a stable hemifusion diaphragm only resulted in fusion after many seconds, if at all. When complexin was included, the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion network shifted towards the immediate pathway, effectively synchronizing fusion, especially at lower Ca<sup>2+</sup>-concentration. Synaptic proteins may have evolved to select this immediate pathway out of a heterogeneous network of possible membrane fusion pathways.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00109.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00109.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00109.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The central nervous system relies on electrical signals travelling along neurons and through synapses at high speeds. Signals often have to pass between two neurons, or from a neuron to a muscle fiber, and the nervous system relies on a process called membrane fusion to ensure that the neurotransmitter molecules that carry the signal across the synapses are released as quickly as possible. Membrane fusion is an important process in many areas of biology, including intracellular transport and fertilization, but it occurs much faster (millisecond time scale) in the nervous system than anywhere else in the body. The reasons for this have long been a mystery, although calcium ions are known to trigger the fusion process.</p><p>The fusion of two biological membranes is similar in many regards to the way that small soap bubbles merge together to form large bubbles. Just as soap bubbles can form a variety of discernible intermediate structures when they merge, so can biological membranes. This means that it is possible to produce a so-called hemifusion intermediate in which the outer layers of the membranes have merged, but the inner layers have not, so it is not possible for anything—such as serotonin, dopamine and other neurotransmitter molecules—to transfer from one membrane to the other.</p><p>Diao et al. have used a combination of advanced optical imaging and cryogenic electron microscopy to explore membrane fusion between synthetic membranes that contained reconstituted synaptic proteins, including synaptotagmin and a family of protein receptors called SNAREs. When calcium ions were injected into the synthetic system, the basic characteristics of neurotransmitter release—such as membrane fusion on a millisecond time scale—was observed. Contrary to some theories of membrane fusion, the fastest fusion events did not begin or proceed via a discernible hemifusion intermediate state. Rather, these events proceeded from a ‘point contact’ state in which the membranes were close to each other (just 1–5 nm apart) without being fused, and were ready to undergo fast fusion once the calcium ions had been injected. And when Diao et al. introduced a protein called complexin, which is known to be important for fast neurotransmitter release in vivo, they observed more immediate fusion events and fewer events that involved a hemifusion intermediate.</p><p>With a synthetic system it is possible to perform experiments that are currently not possible with live neurons, and this has allowed Diao et al. to clarify the roles of the individual components in the process of membrane fusion, and could prove useful in efforts to develop novel therapeutic treatments to combat neurological disorders.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00109.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00109.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>neurotransmitter release</kwd><kwd>synaptic vesicle fusion</kwd><kwd>SNARE</kwd><kwd>synaptotagmin</kwd><kwd>complexin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brunger</surname><given-names>Axel T</given-names></name><name><surname>Nogales</surname><given-names>Eva</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37-MH63105</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brunger</surname><given-names>Axel T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A combination of advanced optical imaging and cryogenic electron microscopy has been used to explore membrane fusion in a synthetic system and provide new insights into neurotransmitter release.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>There are many examples where protein-mediated membrane fusion plays a key role, such as entry of enveloped viruses, fertilization, development, carcinogenesis, intracellular trafficking, secretion, and neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rothman, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jahn et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jahn and Scheller, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harrison, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rizo and Rosenmund, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moreau et al., 2011</xref>). Among these biological processes, synaptic vesicle fusion is unique in that it is both regulated and fast, in the order of a millisecond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Meinrenken et al., 2003</xref>). Upon an action potential, at most one synaptic vesicle undergoes exocytosis in a synapse among the readily releasable pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dobrunz and Stevens, 1997</xref>), that is, only a small subset of docked synaptic vesicles undergo fusion. How synaptic proteins can achieve fast fusion in such a precisely regulated and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent fashion is a matter of intense investigation and considerable controversy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sørensen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Collins et al., 2012</xref>). In this context, reductionist in vitro systems play an important role in uncovering the mechanism of action since they allow manipulations and observations not possible in vivo, and they establish if a particular subset of factors represents a minimal system for promoting fast Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered release.</p><p>Protein-mediated fusion between biological membranes is thought to proceed from a pre-fusion contact to a fusion pore through one or more intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chernomordik and Kozlov, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jackson and Chapman, 2008</xref>). A hemifusion intermediate is defined as a membrane state where the outer leaflets of the two juxtaposed membranes exchange lipids; examples include an hourglass shaped ‘stalk’ and an elongated hemifusion diaphragm. Investigations of both protein-free and protein-mediated liposome fusion in model systems, along with macroscopic continuum models and atomistic computer simulations, revealed at least two pathways: a direct pathway from pre-fusion contact to complete fusion pore via a stalk, and the ‘classical’ pathway with a hemifusion diaphragm intermediate between the stalk and the fusion pore. The energetics and kinetics of these processes are dependent on many factors, including lipid composition and membrane curvature. Model calculations suggested that a hemifusion diaphragm is an energetically relatively stable, long-lived intermediate, and that the direct pathway from stalk to fusion pore may be faster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kuzmin et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Several key proteins cooperate in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered synaptic vesicle fusion, including the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Söllner et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sutton et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jahn and Scheller, 2006</xref>), the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor synaptotagmin 1, the activator/inhibitor complexin, and SM proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rizo and Rosenmund, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Südhof and Rothman, 2009</xref>). Exocytosis can proceed by full-collapse fusion, where the opening of a small pore continues to expand to a large pore, and ‘kiss-and-run’, where a small pore opens transiently but closes again as the vesicle stays associated with the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>). There are two macroscopic models for fusion pore formation: lipid-lined where the synaptic proteins act as scaffolds for pore formation and protein-lined where the transmembrane domains of some of the synaptic proteins play a more active role by lining the pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jackson and Chapman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ngatchou et al., 2010</xref>). However, atomistic computer simulations suggested that the molecular mechanism of pore formation is likely more complex than implied by simple macroscopic models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Risselada et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lindau et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>SNARE proteins can promote membrane fusion via hemifusion intermediates, as inferred from lipid-mixing studies with proteoliposomes where fluorescent labels measure the exchange of components between lipid bilayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Weber et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Reese and Mayer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Xu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schaub et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2008</xref>). However, it is content mixing, that is, the diffusion between compartments of small molecules with size comparable or slightly larger to that of neurotransmitter molecules that is the correlate for neurotransmitter release. Several previous studies implied that content mixing is not necessarily correlated with lipid mixing for biological membrane fusion: neuronal SNAREs alone do not produce much content mixing, although they readily induce lipid mixing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bowen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kyoung et al., 2011</xref>), influenza virus-induced fusion content mixing occurs seconds after initial lipid mixing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Floyd et al., 2008</xref>), and content mixing occurs with minutes delay after lipid mixing in vacuolar fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jun and Wickner, 2007</xref>). Even inner leaflet mixing can occur without content mixing when fusion is induced by DNA-zippering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chan et al., 2009</xref>), although this intriguing observation will require verification with synaptic-protein induced fusion. The results presented in this work reveal an even more striking example of the difference between content mixing and lipid mixing for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion with synaptic proteins.</p><p>Which pathway is used for fast synchronous neurotransmitter release? Is it the classical hemifusion diaphragm pathway or a more direct pathway? We investigated this fundamentally important question with our recently developed optical microscopy method that simultaneously monitors the temporal sequence of both content and lipid exchange upon Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggering between single pairs of donor and acceptor vesicles on a 100-ms time scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kyoung et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kyoung et al., 2012</xref>). Donor and acceptor vesicles mimicked synaptic vesicles and the plasma membrane, respectively. Our system can discriminate between docking, hemifusion, and complete fusion. After improvements in optical instrumentation as well as protein expression and purification, here we achieved a Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity in the 250–500 μM range. This Ca<sup>2+</sup> range is reasonably close to the physiological concentration range (starting at 10 μM and saturating at several 100 μM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heidelberger et al., 1994</xref>) and comparable to other recent in vitro experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hernandez et al., 2012</xref>). Our system mimics a stepwise Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration increase that acts on the readily-releasable pool of primed synaptic vesicles, and it is thus reminiscent to experiments with live neurons using photolysis of caged Ca<sup>2+</sup> compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schneggenburger and Neher, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sun et al., 2007</xref>). We anticipate that a different Ca<sup>2+</sup> delivery technique for our system will allow us to mimic the transient Ca<sup>2+</sup> pulses (or trains of such pulses) that are more typical for physiological neurotransmitter release.</p><p>We combined our optical microscopy experiments with cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) image analysis of mixtures of the same types of donor/acceptor vesicles before and after Ca<sup>2+</sup>-addition. We observed a variety of morphologies of membrane-membrane interfaces, as well as changes in the distribution of membrane–membrane interfaces upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition. Taken together, we deciphered the pathway that allows synaptic vesicles to fuse immediately upon Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggering. We found that all fast (immediate) fusion events start from a hemifusion-free state and proceed to full fusion upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> injection without discernible hemifusion intermediates. In contrast, stable, initially hemifused states are slow to fuse, if at all. Moreover, we found that complexin dramatically increases the number of immediate fusion events, with a more pronounced effect at lower Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration (250 μM).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion with SNAREs and synaptotagmin 1 at 500 μM</title><p>We modified our original single vesicle–vesicle microscopy system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kyoung et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kyoung et al., 2012</xref>) and improved protein quality in order to enable studies at 250–500 μM Ca<sup>2+</sup>-concentration (for details, see ‘Materials and methods’). As before, we used membrane compositions and protein number densities that mimic synaptic vesicles and the plasma membrane, respectively, and reconstituted full-length synaptotagmin 1 together with synaptobrevin (also referred to as VAMP, Vesicle Associated Membrane Protein), and syntaxin together with SNAP-25 into two separate populations of liposomes, termed donor and acceptor vesicles, respectively. We had previously established the homogeneity of our vesicle preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kyoung et al., 2011</xref>).

Overall, for this very minimal system consisting of only SNAREs and synaptotagmin 1, immediate fusion instances were in the minority, followed by delayed fusion instances, and then hemifusion-only instances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). As we had shown previously, Ca<sup>2+</sup> triggered fusion depended on the presence of both functional SNAREs and synaptotagmin 1, for example, mutation of one of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding sites of synaptotagmin 1 greatly reduced the amount of immediate fusion and disruption of SNARE complex formation prevented both docking and fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kyoung et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Imaging by cryo-electron microscopy</title><p>In order to correlate the temporal sequence of changes in membrane state observed by single vesicle–vesicle microscopy with membrane morphology, we imaged mixtures of the same types of donor/acceptor vesicles before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>) and approximately 35 s after addition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–F</xref>) by cryo-EM.

Both point contacts and hemifusion diaphragms are likely between donor and acceptor vesicles since we did not observe interactions between vesicles of the same type in previous cryo-EM experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kyoung et al., 2011</xref>). After Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition, besides point contacts and hemifusion diaphragms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>), we also observed a smaller number of ‘extended’ close contacts without hemifusion, defined as a triple-layered feature extending over more than 10 nm in length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Interestingly, similar extended close contacts were induced between liposomes by denatured Munc18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Xu et al., 2011</xref>), and by SNAREs alone when the membrane-proximal layer of the SNARE was disrupted by mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hernandez et al., 2012</xref>). Since we observed these hemifusion diaphragms and extended close contacts by cryo-EM imaging approximately 35 s after Ca<sup>2+</sup>-injection, such interfaces are expected to be part of ‘slow’, that is, delayed fusion pathways.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00109.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Imaging of donor/acceptor interface morphologies by cryo-EM before and after Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition.

As expected from our single-vesicle microscopy fusion experiments with identical vesicle preparations, some fusion occurred after Ca<sup>2+</sup>-addition, shifting the diameter distribution of vesicles observed in the cryo-EM images towards larger vesicles than before Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition, that is, there are fewer small vesicles and more larger vesicles than before Ca<sup>2+</sup>-addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). The mean diameter increased from 61.3 ± 18.6 (s.d.) nm to 65.1 ± 23.9 (s.d.) nm (a significant increase with 97% confidence from a Student's t-test), corresponding to an increase of mean volume from 1.6 × 10<sup>5</sup> nm<sup>3</sup> to 2.2 × 10<sup>5</sup> nm<sup>3</sup>. Moreover, the distribution of vesicle interfaces changed after Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>): the percentage of point contacts decreased from 55% to 40%, the percentage of hemifused diaphragms increased from 45% to 49%, and the percentage of extended interfaces jumped from zero to 11%.</p><p>We analyzed the image density of point contacts at zero Ca<sup>2+</sup>; two representative examples are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>.

The point contact is a special case since it is the only interface type where the proteins would be close to a putative transitory stalk to initiate fusion. Indeed, as mentioned above, quantitative analysis of all cryo-EM images revealed that the fraction of point contacts decreased upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Inspired by this relative decrease after addition of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, we hypothesized that some of these initial point contacts are the likely starting point for immediate fusion upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> injection; those that did not fuse might be ready to undergo fusion during subsequent pulses.</p><p>Our single vesicle–vesicle microscopy system provided the tool to test if point contacts are the starting points for immediate fusion events. With an extension of our system, we were able to deduce the initial state of the membrane interface (docked or hemifused) at the time of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-injection for each individual fusion event; a change in the single vesicle–vesicle membrane interface during the incubation period would result in a significant difference between the initial lipid dye fluorescence intensity and that after the incubation period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and ‘Materials and methods’). Remarkably, no significant lipid fluorescence intensity changes (i.e., changes larger than the noise level) were observed during the incubation period for ‘all’ instances of immediate fusion events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), in other words, these events did not start from a hemifused state. In contrast, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered content mixing rarely occurred during the observation period of 50 s when starting from a stable hemifused state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Since cryo-EM imaging of the membrane interfaces prior to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-addition indicated that there were only two classes, point contacts and hemifusion diaphragms, it follows that all immediate Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion events must start from point contacts that are not hemifused. The ability to characterize the initial membrane state and the temporal sequence of events upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> injection, along with the ability of controlling the constituents, is another illustration of the power of our single vesicle–vesicle microscopy system.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00109.007</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Upon Ca<sup>2+</sup>-injection, immediate fusion events start form hemifusion-free point contacts whereas initially hemifused states are slow to fuse.

Time point 0 indicates the instance of Ca<sup>2+</sup> injection at 500 μM (blue vertical lines).

However, few significant densities (greater than a factor of two above noise level) were actually visible near the point contacts, with some notable exceptions (e.g. red arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This lack of ubiquitous protein densities could be attributed to the low number of synaptic proteins that are expected to be involved in docking and exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">van den Bogaart and Jahn, 2011</xref>); proteins could also be overlapping with the interface in projection and be masked by the high-contrast lipids. To support the notion that the few observed instances of significant densities could be related to synaptic proteins, we overlaid two alternative models of the synaptotagmin 1 • SNARE complex to the image of a point contact with the highest contrast, assuming that the marked density is related to the globular synaptotagmin C2 domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). The apparent lack of density for the SNARE complex agrees with the notion of a partially folded <italic>trans</italic>-SNARE complex that is stabilized by repulsive forces between solvated membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gao et al., 2012</xref>), as approximately indicated in our models. The single molecule FRET efficiency data of the synaptotagmin 1 • SNARE complex indicated multiple binding modes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Choi et al., 2010</xref>), with the top solution shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>.

Both models predict that it is the C2B domain that interacts with the SNARE complex, although the exact interface and orientation between the molecules is different. While approximate, these conceptual models may serve as guide to speculate about the involvement of synaptic proteins in forming the point contact, and setting the stage for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion. For example, the position of synaptotagmin 1 in our models would enable Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered membrane juxtaposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Araç et al., 2006</xref>) and membrane bending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hui et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McMahon et al., 2010</xref>).

The content mixing histogram is related to the probability of fusion vs time, a mimic for evoked postsynaptic currents.

We used single vesicle–vesicle microscopy to discriminate and quantify the temporal sequence of changes in membrane state (docking, hemifusion, or fusion) on a 100-ms time scale. Our system starts from a meta-stable state of single docked donor/acceptor vesicles that is established by an incubation stage at zero Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration. Optical tweezer pulling experiments recently revealed a partially folded intermediate state of the SNARE complex under external force conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gao et al., 2012</xref>). This intermediate state likely facilitates the metastable state of interacting and largely unfused vesicles during the incubation stage at zero Ca<sup>2+</sup> at ambient (25°C) temperature that is the starting point for our system. On a more technical note, the incubation period at zero Ca<sup>2+</sup> should reduce <italic>cis</italic>-interactions between the C2 domains of synaptotagmin to its own membrane that otherwise might prevent proper <italic>trans</italic>-interactions with acceptor vesicles in assays that use a constant non-zero Ca<sup>2+</sup>-concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vennekate et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>With improvements to our optical apparatus and protein quality we obtained a Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity in the 250–500 μM range for our minimal system consisting of SNAREs, synaptotagmin 1, and complexin.

We combined our optical microscopy experiments with cryo-EM imaging of donor/acceptor vesicle mixtures before and after Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition. Taken together, we obtained for the first time quantitative information about membrane states before and after Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition, and their temporal changes.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>A striking example that lipid mixing does not imply content mixing</title><p>As mentioned in the ‘Introduction’, lipid mixing (exchange between membranes) is necessary for subsequent content mixing (complete fusion), but it is not sufficient. Moreover, it is content mixing that is relevant for neurotransmitter release, not lipid mixing. As a further demonstration of this principle, complexin had little effect on the lipid mixing histogram upon 500 μM Ca<sup>2+</sup> injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). In marked contrast, complexin had a large effect on the corresponding content mixing histograms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Likewise, at 250 μM Ca<sup>2</sup> the effect of complexin is more pronounced on the content mixing histogram compared to the lipid mixing histogram (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6 fig8">Figures 6b and 8b</xref>). This large difference in complexin-induced lipid mixing and content mixing effects greatly amplifies previous observations for biological membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bowen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jun and Wickner, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Floyd et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kyoung et al., 2011</xref>). Taken together, these observations, and especially the results presented in this work for Ca<sup>2+</sup> triggered fusion, call into question conclusions in the literature drawn from lipid-mixing assays when they were not validated by observations related to content mixing. It is thus essential that biological fusion experiments monitor a quantity that is directly related to content mixing in order to distinguish between different membrane states, such as docking, hemifusion, and full fusion.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Observation of a heterogenous network of fusion pathways</title><p>The combination of single vesicle–vesicle microscopy and cryo-EM imaging experiments allowed us to decipher fusion pathways that were induced by the combination of full-length SNAREs, full-length synaptotagmin 1, and, in some experiments, complexin.

It starts from a hemifusion-free point contact and proceeds to full fusion without discernible intermediates on the 100-ms time scale. This pathway is based on: (1) observation of only two membrane interface classes prior to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-injection by cryo-EM, point contacts and hemifusion diaphragms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>).

Taken together, it follows that all immediate fusion events started from hemifusion-free point contacts. It is of course possible that this immediate pathway proceeds from point contact to fusion pore via a transient stalk, however, the lifetime of such a transient stalk would have to be faster than the 100-ms time resolution of our instrument.

We confirmed this hypothesis by observing that complexin (in combination with SNAREs and synaptotagmin 1) favors this immediate fusion pathway upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> triggering, a result that correlates well with complexin's activating role in vivo for synchronous release upon an action potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maximov et al., 2009</xref>). Specifically, we observed that complexin significantly increased the number of immediate fusion events that occur right upon Ca<sup>2+</sup>-injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This effect is especially pronounced at the lowest Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration that we tested (250 μM). Thus, complexin suppresses the emergence of long-lived hemifusion intermediates, effectively leading to a higher probability of immediate fusion upon Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggering. Moreover, complexin was recently found to prevent spontaneous fusion in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in another model system with proteoliposomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Malsam et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>There are two distinct N-terminal sequence elements that required for complexin's activating role in vivo, one of which (the accessory α-helix) clamps SNARE complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krishnakumar et al., 2011</xref>).

Thus, biological membranes are poised to undergo fusion via a number of different pathways once they are brought into close proximity by the action of SNAREs. This variety of pathways could have provided a ‘noisy’ background for evolutionary selection of the immediate pathway that we discovered here. Factors such as complexin may have evolved to select this immediate pathway out of all possible pathways, and may have offered a distinct advantage for fast Ca<sup>2+</sup>-evoked release and efficient communication between neurons.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>Full-length rat proteins of syntaxin 1A, SNAP-25A, synaptobrevin 2, synaptotagmin 1, and complexin 1 were expressed and purified essentially as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kyoung et al., 2011</xref>).

Such phenomena may produce a large fluorescence intensity change that cannot easily be distinguished from genuine fusion. Another issue with commonly used lipid-mixing ensemble experiments is that they cannot distinguish between docking and hemifusion/fusion since the observed lipid-mixing signal depends on both processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cypionka et al., 2009</xref>). Even measuring content mixing in an ensemble experiment would not be able to discern effects caused by differences in docking and fusion since the ensemble-average fluorescence signal depends on both docking and complete fusion. On a different note, some of the first ensemble lipid mixing studies used an unreasonably high protein to lipid ratio (e.g., 1:10 for synaptobrevin-reconstituted vesicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Weber et al., 1998</xref>]); this is a concern since high protein concentrations are known to cause vesicle instabilities. Finally, ensemble measurements may obscure heterogeneous fusion pathways since they only observe averages rather than individual fusion events. This is indeed a problem for ensemble experiments since single-vesicle lipid-mixing experiments revealed multiple intermediates in SNARE-mediated fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yoon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Karatekin et al., 2010</xref>), and the single vesicle–vesicle content/lipid mixing results presented in this work uncovered heterogeneous fusion pathways for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion in the presence SNAREs, synaptotagmin, and complexin.</p><p>Even at a single vesicle level, lipid mixing is not necessarily indicative of content mixing, especially since it is often not possible to resolve two distinct lipid mixing events that would correspond to outer and inner leaflet mixing of a single interacting vesicle pair, respectively. Furthermore, many of these experiments were typically performed on mixtures of donor/acceptor vesicles in solution at a constant Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, rather than starting from the metastable state of interacting vesicle pairs at zero Ca<sup>2+</sup> used in our system (see below). This introduces the possibility of synaptotagmin C2 <italic>cis</italic>-interactions with its own membrane when Ca<sup>2+</sup> is present prior to docking of vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vennekate et al., 2012</xref>), and thereby reducing synaptotagmin <italic>trans</italic>-interactions with the acceptor vesicles. The single vesicle lipid mixing (that is, without content monitoring) experiments by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2010</xref>) are a case in point. In their experiments a paradoxical ‘decrease’ of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered lipid mixing from 10 to 100 μM was observed, assuming background level at 100 μM. In contrast, our system exhibits the more expected increase in fusion (content mixing) as the Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration is increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

The size of the soluble content dye sulforhodamine B is only slightly larger to that of certain neurotransmitters, such as glutamate or serotonin. For the content dye, dequenching may occur by content mixing, leakage, or photobleaching. Complete fusion is characterized by a rapid jump in content dye fluorescence followed by relatively steady fluorescence intensity. Leakage leads to a quick spike, followed by rapid disappearance of fluorescence intensity. Photobleaching leads to slow increases and then decreases of fluorescence intensity. Thus, events that do not lead to content mixing can be easily distinguished from leakage and photobleaching for each individual vesicle pair.</p><p>Our single vesicle–vesicle system starts from a metastable state of docked vesicle pairs that is established by an incubation period at zero Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration.

Images of both conditions were collected at a 50,000× magnification and 1.5 µm under-focus on a 2k × 2k Gatan UltraScan 1000 camera (Gatan Inc., Pleasanton, CA).</p><p>We observed many vesicle–vesicle interactions that were away from the holey carbon grid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Cryo-EM images of individual donor and acceptor vesicle populations (in Supplementary figure S3, panels A, B in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kyoung et al., 2011</xref>]) showed no pronounced interactions between same vesicles, so the grid has a negligible effect, if any, on vesicle interface formation.</p><p>Analyses were performed from a total of 16 (without Ca<sup>2+</sup>) and 21 (with Ca<sup>2+</sup>) cryo-EM micrographs with good contrast (selected images are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and all raw images are available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Measurement of vesicle diameters</title><p>Vesicle diameters were marked with two points for each vesicle using the ‘boxer’ feature in EMAN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ludtke et al., 1999</xref>). Diameters in nm were calculated from the pairs of coordinates using Spider (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frank et al., 1996</xref>). The vesicle diameter distribution histograms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>) were calculated with Matlab (MathWorks, Inc.) using 10 nm binning for all vesicles for which an entire section was visible in a particular image (a total of 228 and 237 vesicles in the images at zero Ca<sup>2+</sup> and after Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition, respectively). A Student's t-test was performed to assess the significance of the increase of the mean of the vesicle diameter distribution after Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Definitions used to classify vesicle interfaces observed in cryo-EM images</title><p>In the observed cryo-EM images the most prominent features of lipid membranes are the electron-dense head groups, rich in phosphorous atoms, which appear as high contrast dark lines when observed on end (along the direction of the electron beam—see for example [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tahara and Fujiyoshi, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lambert et al., 1997</xref>]). A liposome bilayer membrane appears as two parallel black lines at its circumference. Hence, contacts between liposomes can be classified depending on the number of dark lines and their respective distance at the interface. All types of interfaces in our data could be divided into four classes, defined as follows:</p><sec id="s4-12-1"><title>Point contact</title><p>Close apposition between two vesicles with a distance of 1–5 nm between bilayers, without merging or membrane deformation. The observed interface was typically ≤10 nm (along the membrane direction).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12-2"><title>Extended close contact</title><p>Contact characterized by a triple-line feature over distances ≥10 nm along the interface, with a denser (darker) middle line suggesting a close (&lt;1 nm) double-bilayer contact, accompanied by membrane deformation around the interface (flattening).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12-3"><title>Hemifusion diaphragm</title><p>Extended (&gt;10 nm along membrane) double-layer (two lines) contact between two vesicles, accompanied by flattening at the interface.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12-4"><title>Mixed interface</title><p>Transition between an extended close contact (characterized by three lines) and a hemifusion diaphragm (characterized by two lines) within a single vesicle–vesicle interface.</p><p>For the quantitative interface analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>), the interfaces were selected individually using ‘boxer’ in all good contrast micrographs showing clearly the lipid bilayers and interfaces. Interfaces were measured and selected according to the above classifications from cryo-EM images of both conditions (before and after Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition) using the ‘boxer’ feature in EMAN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ludtke et al., 1999</xref>), and their number calculated separately for both conditions. The analysis was performed from a total of 78 and 122 vesicle–vesicle interfaces before and after Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition, respectively. The bilayer–bilayer distances were measured using data processing in Spider (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frank et al., 1996</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Density profile analysis of cryo-EM images</title><p>For image density measurements, small 80 × 80 pixel images of vesicle interface regions were selected and cut out of micrographs using the ‘boxer’ feature in EMAN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ludtke et al., 1999</xref>), then processed in Spider (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frank et al., 1996</xref>) in order to generate average density profiles at selected points along the interface. Briefly, images were rotated so that the lipid bilayers at the interface were aligned with the Y axis, the contrast was flattened (using ramp removal) and inverted, and then average density was calculated over 10 pixel lines, corresponding to 2-nm thick sections perpendicular to the interface, to improve the signal to noise ratio. Average densities were plotted out as function of distance (nm) to measure the separation between lipid layers (maxima in density plots) of the vesicle interface regions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Overlay of models of the complex between synaptotagmin 1 and the SNARE complex</title><p>For the models presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5B,C</xref>, we assumed that the significant non-bilayer density feature corresponds to the C2 domains of synaptotagmin 1, that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding loops of synaptotagmin 1 are close to the bilayer, that the C-terminal end of the first α-helix of SNAP-25 is close to bilayer in order to allow interaction of the adjacent palmitoylated cysteine residues with the membrane, and that the transmembrane domains of syntaxin and synaptobrevin are close to the point contact between vesicles. These assumptions produced a reasonable overlay with the cryo-EM image. For the model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, we estimated that four α-helical turns would be able to bridge a 3.0 nm distance (<italic>R</italic><sub>rms</sub>) in a random coil conformation, using a persistence length <italic>l</italic><sub>p</sub> of 0.9 based on single molecule FRET experiments of synaptobrevin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Choi et al., 2011</xref>) (<italic>R</italic><sub>rms</sub><sup>2</sup> = 2<italic>l</italic><sub>p</sub><italic>n</italic> × 0.36 nm, where <italic>n</italic> is the number of residues which is 14 for two heptad coiled coil repeats). Thus, the last four C-terminal helical turns of synaptobrevin were modeled as a random coil in order to approximately account for the distance that a portion of the synaptobrevin polypeptide chain would have to extend in order to reach the vesicle membrane. For the model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, six C-terminal α-helical turns of synaptobrevin and one α-helical turn of syntaxin were modeled as a random coil in order to approximately account for the required extended linkers to the transmembrane domains.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Drs.

Your article has been evaluated by a Senior Editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of <italic>eLife's</italic> Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission want to reveal their identity: Jose Rizo-Ray and James Rothman.</p><p>The Reviewing Editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing Editor has assembled the following comments based on the reviewers' reports. Our goal is to provide the essential revision requirements as a single set of instructions, so that you have a clear view of the revisions that are necessary for us to publish your work.</p><p><bold>General assessment:</bold></p><p>The reviewers find that the paper describes a very interesting study of the mechanism of membrane fusion induced by the neuronal SNAREs syntaxin-1, synaptobrevin and SNAP-25, together with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor synaptotagmin-1 and the SNARE complex-binding protein complexin.</p><p><bold>Central conclusions:</bold></p><p>1. Calcium-triggered immediate fusion starts from a membrane-membrane point-contact and proceeds to complete fusion within “milliseconds”, without discernible intermediates.</p><p>2. Pathways that involve a stable hemifusion diaphragm only result in fusion after seconds.</p><p>3. Complexin shifts the fusion pathways towards the fast pathway.</p><p>4. Assays that only measure membrane component mixing, without content mixing measurements, may give misleading results.</p><p>The idea of multiple fusion pathways, fast fusion events with no discernible intermediates, and the slow hemi-fusion driven events is a novel concept. The strength of this work is the single vesicle-vesicle system, which is now functional under more physiological levels of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and provides a level of resolution that is unparalleled. The combination of the fusion assay with the cryoEM studies is a noted strength of the study.</p><p>The effect of CPX in increasing the probability of the immediate fusion events is in line with recent findings on the role of the CPX in synchronizing the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion, and quite nicely explains how the zig zag array in addition to clamping fusion might aid in the enhancing the rate of fusion itself and is quite appealing, but this could be explained more clearly in the manuscript.</p><p><bold>Required revisions:</bold></p><p>The reviewers raise a number of concerns that must be adequately addressed before the paper can be accepted. Some of the required revisions will likely require further experimentation within the framework of the presented studies and techniques.</p><p>1. An essential assumption for all of the work is that the two types of reconstituted vesicles (donor and acceptor) are homogeneous populations, all with the same make up of lipids and proteins. Significant heterogeneity in terms of protein constituents would completely invalidate the conclusions. Convincing evidence of high homogeneity, or a reference to a convincing study showing such, must be included.</p><p>2. The results are for the most part presented in a “semiquantitative” manner, without proper attention to definition of quantitative criteria for classification into the various classes of contacts in the EM and release patterns in the optical measurements. Additionally some of the conclusions are based only on very simple measurements or visual inspection of data, particularly the histograms in Figures 6 and 8. Presenting only the parameters of exponential fits is not adequate. Further treatment of the range of acceptable parameters is necessary. There is also inadequate statistical treatment of the data, even though the term &quot;significant: is often used to describe differences between data from different treatments.</p><p>3. The histograms in figure 6, and to a lesser extent figure 8, are very noisy and there are several time bins with no occurrences. The differences are not convincing with only this much data, especially given that the differences between both sets of histograms seem to depend only on the values in the first time bin. These histograms must include a greater number of entries to be convincing.</p><p>4. “We performed a quantitative analysis of all observed cryo-EM images” onwards: histograms should be shown for the diameter distributions mentioned, along with a description of classification criteria and statistical analysis.</p><p>5. It should be at least mentioned that changes in steady state calcium concentration for many minutes is quite different than the transient increases involved in calcium-dependent transmitter release.</p><p>6. The discussion section requires some revision – it is not very accessible and hard to understand at times.</p><p>7. Although not necessary, the paper would be greatly strengthened by CryoEM data with CPX.</p><p>8. The claimed millisecond time resolution seems inappropriate as the fastest sample interval seems to be 200 ms and 600 ms binning is often used.</p><p>9. Figure 4 presents a nice experiment, but numbers of occurrences, classification criteria, and statistics need to be included.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00109.013</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1.

Furthermore, for each experimental condition we performed multiple experiments from different protein preparations and reconstitutions to ensure that the results are not dependent on one particular preparation. We have updated the section “Vesicle reconstitution of full-length syntaxin, synaptobrevin, and synaptotagmin 1” in Materials and Methods.</p><p><italic>2.

Presenting only the parameters of exponential fits is not adequate. Further treatment of the range of acceptable parameters is necessary. There is also inadequate statistical treatment of the data, even though the term “significant” is often used to describe differences between data from different treatments</italic>.</p><p>We have more clearly defined the criteria to define the various vesicle interfaces in the observed cryo-EM images (section “Definitions used to classify vesicle interfaces observed in cryo-EM images” in Materials and Methods). We have also introduced a new section “Definition of jumps in fluorescence intensity time traces” that describes the statistical criterion to define “significant” jumps in the observed fluorescence intensity time traces. We have now performed fits with two models to all histograms in Figs. 6 and 8: one and a sum of two exponential functions. We have assessed the more likely model with the Akaike information criterion.</p><p><italic>3. The histograms in figure 6, and to a lesser extent figure 8, are very noisy and there are several time bins with no occurrences. The differences are not convincing with only this much data, especially given that the differences between both sets of histograms seem to depend only on the values in the first time bin. These histograms must include a greater number of entries to be convincing</italic>.</p><p>We have collected more data for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-injections at both 250 μM and 500 μM. We have updated the histograms in Figures 6 and 8 accordingly.</p><p><italic>4. “We performed a quantitative analysis of all observed cryo-EM images” onwards: histograms should be shown for the diameter distributions mentioned, along with a description of classification criteria and statistical analysis</italic>.</p><p>The diameter distributions are now shown in the new panel Fig. 2G. The significance of the increase in vesicle diameters in the distribution is significant as assessed with a Student's t-test to 97% confidence. The description of the classification criteria of the interfaces is now defined in the new section “Definitions used to classify vesicle interfaces observed in cryo-EM images” in Materials and Methods.</p><p><italic>5. It should be at least mentioned that changes in steady state calcium concentration for many minutes is quite different than the transient increases involved in calcium-dependent transmitter release</italic>.</p><p>We now more explicitly state in the Introduction that our system mimics Ca<sup>2+</sup> photolysis experiments in neurons, and that we are working on future extensions of our system to mimic the transient Ca<sup>2+</sup>-increases typical for physiological neurotransmitter release.</p><p><italic>6. Although not necessary, the paper would be greatly strengthened by CryoEM data with CPX</italic>.</p><p>We plan to do this in a follow-up study.</p><p><italic>7. The claimed millisecond time resolution seems inappropriate as the fastest sample interval seems to be 200 ms and 600 ms binning is often used</italic>.</p><p>We changed the wording to “hundred millisecond timescale” where applicable.</p><p><italic>8. Figure 4 presents a nice experiment, but numbers of occurrences, classification criteria, and statistics need to be included</italic>.</p><p>We have supplied the classification in the section “Definition of jumps in fluorescence intensity time traces” in Materials and Methods, and supplied statistics in the caption of Figure 4.</p></body></sub-article></article>
