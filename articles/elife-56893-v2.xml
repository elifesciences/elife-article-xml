The molecular and cellular mechanisms that govern tissue morphogenesis remain a central challenge in developmental cell biology. Extensive genetic and biochemical experiments have defined the factors required for many morphogenetic movements. Furthermore, methods for imaging and quantitatively describing cell shape changes are ever-improving. Despite this progress, questions remain. For example, how pliable are tissues before and while they are deforming? To what degree do existing cellular structures limit the ability of a tissue to deform, and to what extent and by what mechanism are shape changes of neighboring cells coordinated?</p><p>Ventral furrow formation in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo is one of the best studied examples of tissue morphogenesis; it is the first step in <italic>Drosophila</italic> gastrulation. Ventral furrow formation occurs when a rectangular zone of approximately 1000 cells, arranged in 18 rows, on the ventral surface of the embryonic epithelium apically constrict and invaginate into the embryo, ultimately giving rise to the embryonic mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Leptin and Grunewald, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sweeton et al., 1991</xref>). Many molecules required for ventral furrow formation have been identified: an extracellular serine protease cascade activates the transcription factor Dorsal which drives the expression of two additional transcription factors, Snail and Twist, in a subset of ventral cells, inducing them to adopt mesodermal fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Morisato and Anderson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ip et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jiang et al., 1991</xref>). Snail and Twist then induce the expression of secreted and cell surface molecules, including the ligand Fog, the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) Mist, and the transmembrane protein T48 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dawes-Hoang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Costa et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">KÃ¶lsch et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Manning et al., 2013</xref>). Together with Concertina, a maternally contributed GÎ± protein, and Smog, a maternally contributed GPCR, these factors recruit and activate RhoGEF2, a Rho1-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor, at the apical membrane of ventral cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Parks and Wieschaus, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">KÃ¶lsch et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nikolaidou and Barrett, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kerridge et al., 2016</xref>). RhoGEF2 then activates Rho1 to assemble a contractile actomyosin network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Martin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fox and Peifer, 2007</xref>); these networks within single cells are coupled through adherens junctions between neighboring cells into a supracellular actomyosin network that promotes robust ventral furrow formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yevick et al., 2019</xref>). Notably, both RhoGEF2 accumulation and Rho1 activation are pulsatile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mason et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The intracellular signaling cascade described above activates Rho1 within individual presumptive mesoderm cells. This could, in principle, account for ventral furrow formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gilmour et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ko and Martin, 2020</xref>). However, several features of the ventral furrow suggest that ventral cells exhibit a high degree of intercellular coupling, which may influence the outcome of the genetically encoded contractility. For example, ventral cell apical constriction is anisotropic, occurring more along the dorsal-ventral than the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sweeton et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martin et al., 2010</xref>). If individual ventral cells constrict and invaginate without being influenced by their neighbors, one would predict isotropic apical constriction. Additionally, the apical constriction of individual cells appears coordinated, with cells adjacent to constricting cells more likely to constrict than their more distant counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sweeton et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gao et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, multiple rows of cells lateral to the furrow bend toward it, indicating that forces are transmitted over long distances in the ventral epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rauzi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Costa et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Leptin et al., 1992</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, this wealth of previous results suggests that ventral furrow formation results from a combination of intracellular Rho1-mediated contractility and intercellular coupling of those contractile forces. In the simplest iteration of this model, an asymmetric zone of Rho1 activation is sufficient to recapitulate both the intra- and intercellular aspects of ventral furrow formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Doubrovinski et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, it was recently shown that an asymmetric zone of local Rho1 activation is sufficient to induce an ectopic furrow in the dorsal <italic>Drosophila</italic> epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Izquierdo et al., 2018</xref>). However, it remains unclear whether local Rho1 activation alone is sufficient to induce sustained tissue morphogenesis and recapitulate all aspects of ventral furrow formation. Alternatively, ventral-specific gene expression may endow ventral cells with factors that collaborate with active Rho1 to generate the observed cell shape changes. If this is the case, an asymmetric zone of Rho1 activity would yield distinct cell shape changes in the dorsal versus the ventral embryonic epithelium.</p><p>Addressing these and related questions necessitates the ability to activate Rho1 with high spatial and temporal precision without otherwise perturbing the embryo. Optogenetic techniques utilize photosensitive proteins to control protein localization and/or activity with light; these techniques are, therefore, well-suited to interrogate the basis for the anisotropic and coordinated nature of apical constriction during ventral furrow formation. Importantly, the ideal optogenetic approach will activate Rho1 in response to light alone.</p><p>Here, we use a LOV-domain-based optogenetic probe to acutely activate Rho1 in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. We demonstrate that this system expresses ubiquitously throughout <italic>Drosophila</italic> development and is well tolerated. Optogenetic activation of Rho1 induces ectopic deformations in both the dorsal and ventral embryonic epithelium during early embryogenesis. We find that ventral, but not dorsal, cells respond to ectopic Rho1 activation with aligned, anisotropic apical constriction. This ventral-specific response requires Dorsal and Twist expression. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the transmission of contractile forces over long distances is specific to the ventral epithelium.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A LOV-domain-based optogenetic system controls Rho1 activity in <italic>Drosophila</italic></title><p>To study the cellular consequences of acute Rho1 activation and probe the impact of Rho1 activation on cells neighboring the activation region, we adapted an optogenetic system for use in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. This two-component system consists of a membrane tethered LOV domain fused to the SsrA peptide and a cytoplasmic SspB protein fused to a protein of interest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guntas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Strickland et al., 2012</xref>).

LARG is a human RhoA-specific GEF; the DH domain of LARG has previously been used in a related optogenetic system to control RhoA activity in mammalian tissue culture cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wagner and Glotzer, 2016</xref>). We used the DH domain of LARG alone to ensure that the recruitable GEF's function is divorced from all endogenous regulation and only sensitive to optogenetic activation. Homozygous flies expressing the membrane localized LOVSsrA and PR-GEF from the ubiquitin promoter are viable and fertile, indicating that these transgenes are well tolerated. Global activation of the dorsal embryonic epithelium with blue light induces strong recruitment of PR-GEF to the plasma membrane within seconds, and this global PR-GEF recruitment induces cortical myosin accumulation within 1 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Myosin accumulates apically, both medially and junctionally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). OptogeneticallyÂ induced cortical myosin completely disappears within 3 min of cessation of photoactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Thus, using conventional microscopy, this optogenetic system rapidly, robustly, and reversibly activates Rho1 in the embryonic epithelium. This system also activates Rho1 in all <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissues tested, including the pupal notum, follicular epithelium, larval wing imaginal disc, and larval central nervous systemÂ (CNS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). In the larval wing peripodial epithelium, optogenetic activation of Rho1 can induce myosin accumulation with subcellular precision (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1c</xref>). Optogenetic activation of Rho1 is sensitive to light dosage; attenuating the activating light induced less myosin-Ch accumulation, indicating lower levels of Rho1 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Above a certain threshold of activating light, Rho1 becomes globally activated, despite precisely defined activation regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, this LOV domain-based optogenetic probe is capable of controlling Rho1 activation with high spatial and temporal resolution. Furthermore, the level of Rho1 activation can be tuned by modulating light dosage.</p><p>While this LOV domain-based optogenetic probe recovers to its dark state activity level within minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), some biological phenomena may require faster recovery kinetics. To increase the inactivation rate of our optogenetic probe, we introduced a previously identified point mutation, I427V, into the LOV domain, which increases the rate at which the LOV domain returns to the dark state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Christie et al., 2007</xref>). I427V increases the inactivation rate of the optogenetic system in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells expressing a membrane localized LOV domain containing this mutation and a cytoplasmic, recruitable tagRFP-SspB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3a,b</xref>). Increasing the recovery rate of the LOV domain also decreases the maximum recruitment of tagRFP-SspB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3a,b</xref>), demonstrating the trade off between rapid inactivation and total recruitment. Global activation of the rapid cycling LOV domain in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval brains induced robust Rho1 activation, as scored by accumulation of a Rho1 biosensor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3c</xref>); this Rho1 activity dissipated within a minute of cessation of global optogenetic activation. In contrast, Rho1 remained active a minute after global activation of the wild-type LOV domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3c</xref>). Thus, the cycling kinetics of the LOV domain are the primary determinant of the off rate of optogenetic-induced Rho1 activity. This emphasizes that there are rapid and robust mechanisms for shutting off Rho1 activity in vivo; furthermore, it suggests that cells continually activate Rho1 during cellular and developmental processes that require sustained Rho1 activation. The wild-type LOV domain is used for the remainder of the experiments presented, as the rapid recovery was not essential to address the questions answered here.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Quantitative baseline of ventral furrow formation in wildtype embryos</title><p>To establish a baseline for comparison of subsequent perturbation experiments, we quantitatively analyzed the progression of the endogenous ventral furrow in embryos expressing the optogenetic components and the membrane marker Gap43-mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>).

We quantified the anisotropy of the apical-most surfaces of cells at these same time intervals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aigouy et al., 2010</xref>).

This timing is consistent with previously published work, suggesting the optogenetic probe does not impair ventral furrow formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rauzi et al., 2015</xref>). Notably, the variance of apical cell areas increases as ventral furrow formation begins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). This reflects the fact that ventral cells do not constrict in unison, but rather in a salt-and-pepper fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sweeton et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gao et al., 2016</xref>). The apical constriction of ventral cells is anisotropic, occurring much more along the dorsal-ventral axis than the anterior-posterior axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). The magnitude and alignment of this anisotropy increases over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), but anisotropy does not correlate with the extent of apical constriction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Anisotropic, apical constrictions begin within 2Â min of the first detectable myosin accumulation in ventral cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Finally, we quantified the movement of the apical surfaces of cells neighboring the ventral midline. Specifically, we tracked the centroids of these cellsâ apical surface over time along the dorsal-ventral axis. The apical surfaces of cells that neighbor the central cells of the ventral furrow move substantially along the dorsal-ventral axis during ventral furrowing, reflecting their bending toward the invaginating furrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,e</xref>). These data confirm that our optogenetic probes are minimally perturbing and provide a standardized timeline along which cell shape changes occur during ventral furrow formation in this genetic background.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Morphometric analysis of ventral cells during ventral furrow formation.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Ventral epithelium of a <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo expressing the optogenetic components and Gap43-Ch but not exposed to activating light before, during, and after the onset of ventral furrow formation.

Several lines of evidence argue that the tissue-level shape changes and myosin accumulation observed in the ventral epithelium are light-dependent. First, these optogenetic experiments were performed in embryos with little to no detectable myosin accumulation in the ventral epithelium. Furthermore, the optogeneticallyÂ induced myosin accumulation in the ventral epithelium often dissipates before myosin accumulates in the endogenous ventral furrow, and, in some cases, the optogenetic furrow is offset from the eventual ventral midline, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>. Additionally, when Rho1 is optogenetically activated in a rectangular zone, perpendicular to the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo and the eventual ventral furrow, ectopic Myosin-Ch accumulation is induced both prior to and following the onset of endogenous ventral furrow formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Even when low levels of endogenous myosin are present in the presumptive ventral furrow, the majority of myosin-Ch accumulation within the photoactivated region is light-dependent, as it accumulates within the defined region and recovers to the pre-activation state following the cessation of photoactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Notably, ectopic myosin accumulation is restricted to the defined activation zone, suggesting that optogenetic activation of Rho1 in the ventral epithelium does not induce detectable non-cell autonomous myosin accumulation.</p><p>The ectopic furrows induced in either the dorsal or ventral epithelium recover to their pre-activation state within 4 min of cessation of optogenetic Rho1 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>). These recovery kinetics are slightly longer than the cycling kinetics of the WT LOV domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, while ectopic Rho1 activation induces ectopic deformations, the downstream consequences of optogenetic Rho1 activation are rapidly and robustly inactivated in the absence of continued photoactivation.</p><p>To characterize the molecular nature of these optogeneticallyÂ induced furrows, we assayed myosin accumulation along the apicobasal axis of dorsal or ventral cells following optogenetic activation of Rho1. Toward this end, we activated Rho1 in embryos depleted of RhoGEF2 to specifically assay optogeneticallyÂ induced myosin accumulation. Photoactivation-induced Myosin-Ch accumulation is restricted to the apical-most 3 or 4 Âµm of activated dorsal and ventral cells, and similar levels of myosin accumulation are induced in dorsal and ventral epitheliaÂ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3</xref>). This restricted accumulation of myosin along the apicobasal axis of activated cells suggest that lateral shortening along the length of the apicobasal axis is not a major contributor to the ectopic furrows induced by PR-GEF recruitment.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Rho1 activation induces distinct apical constriction in the dorsal and ventral epithelium</title><p>The previous results demonstrate that asymmetric zones of Rho1 activity are sufficient to induce ectopic furrows in both dorsal and ventral epithelia.

Local Rho1 activation in individual cells or in a group of cells in the dorsal embryonic epithelium induced apical constriction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4aâc</xref>).

Embryos for these photoactivation experiments in the ventral epithelium were chosen based on several criteria to ensure that the ventral cells were photoactivated prior to the onset of endogenous ventral furrow formation. First, embryos were selected to be in the final stages of cellularization, before they exhibited any overt signs of apical constriction. Post-experiment analysis of pre-activation cell areas confirmed that these experiments were performed prior to the onset of cell shape changes and endogenous ventral furrow formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>, compare red column with gray columns). Furthermore, the standard deviation of the areas of activated cells in each embryo prior to photoactivation further indicate that these ventral cells are photoactivated prior to the onset of endogenous ventral furrow formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>, compare red column with gray columns). Importantly, myosin accumulation immediately precedes cell shape changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that these optogenetic experiments begin before endogenous myosin accumulation commences.</p><p>Optogenetic activation of Rho1 in a collection of ventral cells also induced apical constriction within the zone of Rho1 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b,c</xref>). In contrast to dorsal cells, the apical surfaces of activated ventral cells were elongated, indicating anisotropic apical constriction. This anisotropy was strongly aligned with the anterior-posterior axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>Â -bottom right panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>), but, as in non-activated ventral tissue, this anisotropy does not correlate with amount of apical constriction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). This anisotropic apical constriction of ventral cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>) is induced by a 4-min activation protocol and is visible within the first 2 min of photoactivation. Given that these cells were photoactivated prior to the onset of ventral furrow formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b,c</xref>), this level of anisotropy is precocious relative to the endogenous ventral furrow. Furthermore, a smaller, asymmetric zone of Rho1 activation also induces anisotropic apical constriction in activated ventral cells but not their non-activated neighbors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3</xref>), confirming that our optogenetic experiments recapitulate the cell shape changes seen during endogenous ventral furrow but induce these cell shape changes to occur earlier and faster than they normally would. Thus, in contrast to the isotropic apical constriction induced in activated cells within the dorsal epithelium, optogenetic Rho1 activation in cells within the ventral epithelium induces precocious, anisotropic apical constriction that strongly resembles the anisotropic apical constrictions seen during endogenous ventral furrow formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Importantly, our analysis of myosin accumulation demonstrates that the optogenetic input of Rho1 activity is similar in both dorsal and ventral epithelia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3</xref>), ruling out the possibility that the differential behavior of dorsal and ventral cells is due to the optogenetic probes behaving distinctly in the two epithelia.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Genetic requirements for ventral-specific responses</title><p>The finding that an asymmetric zone of Rho1 activation induces differential responses in the dorsal and ventral epithelia suggests that ventral patterning may influence the response to Rho1 activation.

To test this hypothesis, we locally activated Rho1 in ventral cells lacking Dorsal protein, a factor required for ventral identity.

This suggests Twist plays a Rho1-independent role that influences the cell shape changes executed by cells of the ventral furrow.</p><p>We note that ventral cells lacking Twist exhibit more aligned apical constriction than ventral cells lacking Dorsal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>). These distinct responses suggest that there is a Twist-independent mechanism downstream of Dorsal that promotes aligned anisotropic apical constriction in response to Rho1 activation. We speculate that Snail is responsible for this Twist-independent behavior, but repeated attempts to combine a null <italic>snail</italic> allele with our optogenetic components failed, so we were not able to test this hypothesis.</p><p>Dorsal is required for and Twist promotes ventral cells to respond to ectopic Rho1 activation with strong, aligned anisotropic apical constriction. This may reflect that the transcriptional targets of Dorsal and Twist are required for Rho1 activation during endogenous ventral furrow formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Martin et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, to determine whether Dorsal and Twist contribute to anisotropic apical constriction by regulating the expression of Rho1 activators or by regulating the expression of factors that cooperate with Rho1 activators, we optogenetically activated Rho1 in ventral cells depleted of RhoGEF2, the endogenous activator of actomyosin contractility during ventral furrow formation. RhoGEF2 is required for proper organization of the actomyosin cytoskeleton during cellularization, and embryos lacking RhoGEF2 have some cellularization defects, contributing to irregularities in the epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Padash Barmchi et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, prior to optogenetic activation, a subset of cells depleted of RhoGEF2 are anisotropic, though randomly aligned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). Despite the non-uniformity in these epithelia, optogenetic activation of Rho1 in ventral cells depleted of RhoGEF2 increased the extent of aligned, anisotropic apical constriction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>).Â Optogenetic activation of Rho1 in dorsal cells depleted of RhoGEF2 does not induce the same amount of highly aligned and anisotropic apical constriction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>). These results suggest ventral cells can respond to optogenetic Rho1 activation with anisotropic apical constriction even when the level of endogenous Rho1 activity is greatly attenuated. However, elevated Rho1 levels may contribute to strong, aligned, anisotropic apical constriction during endogenous ventral furrow formation.</p><p>Interestingly, in contrast to the rapid reversion of ectopic deformations in wild-type tissues, ectopic furrows induced in the ventral or dorsal epithelium of embryos lacking RhoGEF2 failed to revert following cessation of optogenetic activation. This suggests Rho1 activity downstream of RhoGEF2 makes a significant contribution to the tension that provides a restorative force throughout these epithelia, likely through its role in organizing the actomyosin cytoskeleton.</p><p>Our experiments in the dorsal epithelium suggest that an asymmetric zone of Rho1 activation is not always sufficient to generate aligned, anisotropic apical constriction. However, an asymmetric zone of Rho1 activation might nevertheless contribute to the cell shape changes seen in ventral epithelial cells during ventral furrow formation. To address this question, we locally activated Rho1 in a square region in ventral cells before any obvious apical constriction. The area of the square activation zone was chosen so as to leave non-activated cells within the imaging field on either side of the activation zone.

To further explore this possibility, we generated ectopic zones of Rho1 activation and focused on the behavior of cells adjacent to these zones. In the ventral epithelium, we observed extensive bending of non-activated cells towards optogenetically-induced furrows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>, filled arrowheads). This bending is readily visualized in maximum intensity projections of the ventral surface post optogenetic activation, and it routinely extends several rows outside of the zone of photoactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>, filled arrowheads). In contrast, long-range bending toward the ectopic furrows is not observed in the dorsal epithelium. Rather, the cells immediately adjacent to ectopic dorsal furrows exhibit substantial stretching of their apical surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>, open arrowheads). Notably, cells flanking ectopic furrows exhibit a similar extent of bending as is seen during endogenous ventral furrow formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). However, these cells exhibit substantially less apical constriction than the cells that bend toward endogenous furrows, as this ectopic bending is induced precociously.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Non-activated cells bend towards ectopic furrows specifically in the ventral epithelium.</title><p>(<bold>aâb</bold>) Dorsal (<bold>a</bold>) and ventral (<bold>b</bold>) epithelium of embryos expressing the optogenetic components and Gap43-mCh before the onset of cell shape changes.

Consistent with our visual observations, the centroids of the apical surface of non-activated ventral cells move substantially during the deformation of the photoactivated region, while the centroids of the apical surface of non-activated dorsal cells exhibit little movement during the comparable time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>). Notably, dorsal cells neighboring ectopic furrows are strongly biased toward expanding their apical surfaces, while most ventral cells exhibit modest contraction of their apical surfaces. Thus, not only do activated ventral and dorsal cells respond distinctly to optogenetic activation of Rho1, but the non-activated ventral and dorsal cells neighboring these regions of ectopic Rho1 activation respond distinctly to ectopic furrows. These differential responses both within and adjacent to the activation zones suggest that cells within the two epithelia experience distinct forces that functionally modulate their behavior.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Experimental evidence and computational modeling suggest Rho1 activation could be the primary regulator of cell and tissue-level shape changes during ventral furrow formation. To test this model, we assessed whether an asymmetric zone of Rho1 activity is sufficient to induce this morphogenetic process in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo. While optogenetic activation of Rho1 in the dorsal epithelium can induce a furrow, it does not recapitulate all cell- and tissue-level aspects of ventral furrow formation. However, Rho1 activation in the ventral epithelium induces cell- and tissue-level shape changes highly reminiscent of endogenous ventral furrow formation. Importantly, these changes are induced to occur earlier and more rapidly than they normally would. We propose that this context-dependent response to ectopic Rho1 activation arises because cells within dorsal and ventral epithelia experience distinct extrinsic forces and transmit their intracellular contractility over different length scales.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>A robust, ubiquitously expressed optogenetic probe enables transient activation of Rho1 in <italic>Drosophila</italic></title><p>The LOV-domain-based optogenetic probe generated in this study is expressed ubiquitously throughout the <italic>Drosophila</italic> lifecycle. This ubiquitous and non-perturbing expression allows Rho1 activation to be readily controlled in any <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissue without the need to combine the probe with tissue-specific drivers. This probe acts rapidly, inducing Rho1 activity within a minute of photoactivation. Precise spatial control of Rho1 activation can be induced using a range of standard fluorescent imaging methods. Ectopic deformations induced by optogenetic Rho1 activation in the dorsal embryonic epithelium are limited to the zone of optogenetic Rho1 activation, and, in the wing peripodial epithelium, Rho1 can be activated with subcellular precision.</p><p>Using this optogenetic approach, we demonstrate that ectopic Rho1 activation is sufficient to induce ectopic, tissue-level shape changes throughout the embryonic epithelium just prior to and at the onset of gastrulation. The cell shape changes induced by optogenetic Rho1 activation in ventral cells closely mirror those seen during endogenous ventral furrow formation, and ectopic Rho1 activation can modulate endogenous ventral furrow formation. This suggests that the potency of optogenetic activation of Rho1 via the LOV probe is on par with endogenous Rho1 activation during ventral furrowing.</p><p>Deformations induced by optogenetic activation of Rho1 persist through the duration of optogenetic activation. However, the cells in these ectopic furrows rapidly revert to their pre-activation positions and expand their apical areas following cessation of photoactivation, concurrent with rapid dissipation of optogeneticallyÂ induced myosin. Similar reversibilty occurs in the other tissues we examined as well as in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wagner and Glotzer, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Oakes et al., 2017</xref>). This reveals the existence of potent, widespread mechanisms for inactivating Rho1 and its effectors. We infer that ventral furrow formation is driven by sustained Rho1 activation that overcomes this global inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>PR-GEF and RhoGEF2-CRY2 induce distinct cellular responses</title><p>Our results are partially consistent with previous work, which activated Rho1 via membrane recruitment of a light-responsive RhoGEF2-CRY2 fusion protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Izquierdo et al., 2018</xref>). Both optogenetic systems induce ectopic deformations in the dorsal embryonic epithelium, but only RhoGEF2-CRY2 induces pulsatile Rho1 activity and anisotropic apical constriction in the dorsal epithelium.</p><p>The two systems use different RhoA/Rho1-specific GEFs, and this may underlie the differing results; LOV recruits LARG(DH), whereas CRY2 is fused to RhoGEF2(DHPH). Despite LARG being an extremely potent RhoA activator in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jaiswal et al., 2013</xref>), the transgene expressing LARG(DH) is well tolerated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), suggesting this recruitable GEF is non-perturbing. To directly compare LARG and RhoGEF2, we generated flies expressing SspB-GFP-RhoGEF2(DHPH) from the same genomic location as PR-GEF. SspB-GFP-RhoGEF2(DHPH) does not readily homozygose, even in the absence of the LOVSsrA membrane anchor (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), suggesting it has significant light-independent activity. PH domains of the GEF subfamily that includes RhoGEF2 and LARG bind RhoA-GTP, and, in vitro, the interaction between the PH domain and membrane-bound RhoA-GTP potentiates GEF activity by up to 40-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Medina et al., 2013</xref>). Introducing two point mutations (F1044A, I1046E) into the PH domain of RhoGEF2, which are predicted to disrupt its binding to RhoA-GTP, allows the resultant transgene to readily homozygose (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). These observations are consistent with RhoGEF2-CRY2 acting via a feedforward mechanism where it can be recruited by Rho1-GTP via its PH domain and thereby amplify Rho1-GTP. The ability of RhoGEF2-CRY2 to amplify both endogenous and light-induced Rho1 activity would be predicted to be particularly potent when it is overexpressed from a UAS promoter via Gal4. Feedforward activation via RhoGEF2-CRY2 may combine with the aforementioned mechanisms for Rho1 inactivation to generate the pulsatile Rho1 activity observed with RhoGEF2-CRY2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Izquierdo et al., 2018</xref>). Amplification of endogenous Rho1 activity by RhoGEF2-CRY2 could also explain the anisotropic apical constrictions induced when this probe is optogenetically activated in the dorsal epithelium: Activated cells in this epithelium would need to deform against increased resistive forces exerted by their neighbors as a result of chronic Rho1 activation.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Recruitable GEF viability tests.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Cross scored</th><th valign="top">Possible genotype</th><th valign="top">Observed</th><th valign="top">Expected</th><th valign="top">Chi<italic><sup>2</sup></italic></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">SspB-GFP-LARG(DH)/CyO x <break/>SspB-GFP-LARG(DH)/CyO</td><td valign="top">1) LARG (DH)/CyO <break/>2) LARG(DH)/LARG(DH)</td><td valign="top">379 <break/>165</td><td valign="top">362.7 <break/>181.3</td><td valign="top">2.198</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">SspB-GFP-RhoGEF2(DHPH)/CyO x <break/>SspB-GFP-RhoGEF2(DHPH)/CyO</td><td valign="top">1) RhoGEF2(DHPH)/CyO <break/>2) RhoGEF2(DHPH)/RhoGEF2(DHPH)</td><td valign="top">318 <break/>54</td><td valign="top">248 <break/>124</td><td valign="top">59.27</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">SspB-GFP-RhoGEF2(DHPH-F1044A,I1046E)/CyO x <break/>SspB-GFP-RhoGEF2(DHPH-F1044A,I1046E)/CyO</td><td valign="top">1) RhoGEF2(DHPH*)/CyO <break/>2) RhoGEF2(DHPH*)/RhoGEF2(DHPH*)</td><td valign="top">430 <break/>192</td><td valign="top">414.7 <break/>207.3</td><td valign="top">1.694</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Although the GEF domain of RhoGEF2 is perturbing when over-expressed as an isolated domain, in the context of the full length protein, its ability to generate positive feedback via its PH domain may contribute to the Rho1 activity pulses observed during ventral furrow formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Martin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mason et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Endogenous and ectopic deformations involve a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic forces</title><p>The differences seen in the dorsal and ventral epithelium following optogenetic activation of Rho1 are not limited to the response of the activated cells.

Furthermore, optogenetic activation of Rho1 causes acceleration of the invagination of an already initiated ventral furrow that spreads rapidly, within seconds, beyond the zone of optogenetic activation. These results suggest that optogenetically-induced intrinsic forces are readily transmitted over several cell diameters within the ventral epithelium.</p><p>Cells of the endogenous ventral furrow do not deform in isolation, rather constricting ventral cells exert forces on, and experience forces from, other cells within and outside of the ventral furrow [see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lye and Sanson, 2011</xref>) for review]. This intercellular transmission of forces requires cell-cell coupling through junctional proteins, such as cadherins, junction-cytoskeletal linkages, such as those mediated by catenins, and the cytoskeleton itself. This set of molecular interactions, constitute a dynamic force transmission chain, that may be stabilized by force-mediated feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pinheiro and BellaÃ¯che, 2018</xref>).

Here, Twist promotes anisotropic apical constriction induced by sustained Rho1 activation. Although it is possible that these two defects result from loss of the expression of a single Twist target gene, Twist controls the expression of multiple genes, and several of these targets may make independent contributions to ventral furrow formation. As ventral cells lacking Twist exhibit weakly aligned, anisotropic apical constriction, a Twist-independent mechanism for generating aligned, anisotropic apical constriction must also exist; Snail is an excellent candidate for this role.</p><p>It is possible that Dorsal and/or Twist may be required for anisotropic apical constriction because each factor promotes Rho1 activation by RhoGEF2. However, results shown here suggest that elevated Rho1 activity alone does not explain this ventral-specific response. First, our experiments are performed prior to significant accumulation of endogenous myosin. Additionally, ventral cells depleted of RhoGEF2 exhibit an increase in magnitude and alignment of anisotropy following ectopic Rho1 activation, albeit to a lesser degree than wildtype ventral cells. Given the disorganization of the ventral epithelium following RhoGEF2 depletion, likely due to defects in cytoskeletal organization and cellularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Padash Barmchi et al., 2005</xref>), it is notable that cells in this epithelium still exhibit an increase in aligned, anisotropic apical constriction following optogenetic activation of Rho1.</p><p>Previous work has identified several molecular and cellular differences between dorsal and ventral cells during early embryogenesis. For example, as cellularization completes and before ventral furrow formation initiates, junctional myosin is detected specifically in ventral cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rauzi et al., 2015</xref>). Adherens junctions and adjacent clusters of the polarity protein Bazooka disassemble from a subapical position by a Snail-dependent and myosin-independent mechanism in ventral, but not dorsal, cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Weng and Wieschaus, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">KÃ¶lsch et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Weng and Wieschaus, 2017</xref>). As ventral furrow formation progresses, Rho1 is activated in a subset of ventral cells, driving apical-medial accumulation of myosin and actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rauzi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dawes-Hoang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fox and Peifer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nikolaidou and Barrett, 2004</xref>). In a myosin-dependent manner, dense clusters of adherens junction proteins accumulate apically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Weng and Wieschaus, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">KÃ¶lsch et al., 2007</xref>). Bazooka also reaccumulates apically shortly after the junctions reassemble (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Weng and Wieschaus, 2017</xref>). Rap1 and its GEF Dzy are required for proper anisotropic apical constriction and ventral furrowing, and these factors may regulate these junctional rearrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sawyer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Spahn et al., 2012</xref>). Ventral junctions also recruit the tension-sensitive protein Ajuba (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Winkelman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sun et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rauskolb et al., 2019</xref>). These results indicate that ventral cells undergo a number of changes that might alter their response to ectopic Rho1 activation. The experiments presented here directly test this prediction. Notably, of the aforementioned differences in dorsal and ventral cells, only Snail-dependent disassembly of adherens junctions and Bazooka occur before the onset of myosin-mediated contractility in the ventral epithelium. This Snail-dependent modulation of adherens junctions and associated proteins is a prime candidate to cooperate with Twist to modulate the differential responses of dorsal and ventral cells to optogenetic activation of Rho1.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The cellular behaviors observed during light-induced furrow formation in the ventral, but not dorsal, epithelium are remarkably similar to those that occur during endogenous ventral furrowing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Costa et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Leptin et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Leptin and Grunewald, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sweeton et al., 1991</xref>).

Embryos were dechorionated in 30% bleach for 1 min, rinsed in water, aligned on an apple juice agar pad, and mounted on a coverslip with embryo glue (adhesive from double sided tape dissolved in heptane). The imaged surface (dorsal or ventral) was mounted on the coverslip. This coverslip was affixed via petroleum jelly to a metal slide with a hole in the center.

Central nervous systems were imaged in a chamber comprising a coverslip affixed with petroleum jelly to a metal slide with a hole in the center. Following dissection, CNSs were mounted in the chamber such that their dorsal side contacted the coverslip. The chamber was flooded with Chan and Gerhingâs balanced solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chan and Gehring, 1971</xref>) to completely cover the CNS, and a gas-permeable membrane (YSI: 5793) was placed over the chamber to limit evaporation.

Images were captured on a Cascade 1K electron microscope (EM) CCD camera, a Cascade 512BT (Photometrics), or a Prime 95B (Photometrics) controlled by MetaMorph (Molecular Devices). Photoactivation was accomplished by illuminating the sample with 488 nm light for the indicated exposure times (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>).</p><p>Imaging of non-activated embryos and local activation experiments were performed on a inverted Zeiss LSM880 laser scanning confocal microscope with a 40X/1.4 numerical aperture (NA) objective. mCherry or mScarlet fluorescence was excited using the 561 nM solid state laser and was detected via a GaAsP spectral detector. Activation regions, indicated with yellow boxes throughout this manuscript, were defined in the 'Bleaching' module. Pixels within the defined activation zone were exposed to 488 nm light attenuated to 0.01 or 0.1 percent laser transmittance, using an Acousto-optic tunable filter, for 15 iterations every 20 s for the duration of the activation period. In general, we acquired a 'pre-activation' Z-Series of Gap43-mCh or Sqh-mCh, activated the defined region with 488 nm light in a single Z-plane, and acquired a 'post-activation' Z-Series of Gap43-mCh or Sqh-mCh.

TissueAnalyzer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aigouy et al., 2010</xref>), a FIJI plugin, was used to segment the embryonic epithelium and track cells for quantification of apical area, apical cell anisotropy, and apical cell centroid movement. 'Pre-â and 'Post-activationâ Z-stacks were tracked separately in TissueAnalyzerÂ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4âfigure supplement 4</xref>), and data for the apical area, angle and magnitude of cellular anisotropy, and apical cell centroid were extracted from each timepoint and concatenated into a master data-base. Percent area change of the apical cell surface was calculated as (EndArea - StartArea)/StartArea*100. TissueAnalyzer computes a traceless symmetric tensor by integrating over the area of each cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aigouy et al., 2010</xref>). The components of this tensor are used to derive the magnitude and orientation of anisotropy. These parameters are normalized to cell area. As a consequence, the magnitude of anisotropy ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 being isotropic and one being maximally anisotropic.</p><p>To quantify myosin accumulation in the ventral epithelium over time for comparison to apical cell area, we first binned Z-stacks of Myosin-Ch 3 Ã 3 to account for the heterogeneity of myosin signal. We then generated a maximum intensity projection, defined a region of interest, and extracted the mean intensity value for that region.</p><p>To quantify myosin accumulation along the apicobasal axis of the embryo before and after photoactivation, we first thresholded images to avoid inclusion of the signal from cytoplasmic myosin. We then defined ten distinct 75 px by 60 px regions that spanned the horizontal length of the activated region. The ten regions were defined to account for the non uniform depth of deformations along the anterior-posterior axis. Myosin intensity was calculated as the raw integrated density of each thresholded region for each slice along the apicobasal axis. The values for myosin intensity at the apical most plane of all ten regions were than plotted as a mean and standard deviation. This was done iteratively for each subsequent position along the apicobasal axis until all positions were plotted.</p><p>Data were plotted in RStudio with ggplot2.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Statistics</title><p>Kruskal-Wallis rank sum tests and Wilcoxon signed rank tests were used as noted.

Spatially and temporally orchestrated activation of Rho activation cause the activation of myosin contractility that drives the formation of these important furrows of the developing embryo.</p><p>At the cellular scale, apical myosin contractility is associated with apical cell constriction, tissue furrowing, and invagination. This manuscript adapt an existing optogenetic tool to spatio-temporally control myosin contractility in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The strategy uses a membrane targeted LOV-ssrA peptide fusion and an exogenous RhoA GEF domain fused to the SspB protein, which will be recruited by ssrA upon photoactivation, similar to but modified from earlier studies (Izquierdo et al., 2018; Krueger et al., 2018). The authors refine this tool to make it more responsive to levels of induction as well as reversibility. They activate RhoA and induce contractility on both the dorsal and ventral side of the embryo, which results in furrows at both locations.</p><p>They find that ventral cells have a greater propensity to constrict and do so anisotropically. They emphasize the importance of genetic context by showing that these regional differences are substantially reduced in Twist or Dorsal mutants. This might be thought to be a logical finding (given the role of these genes in ventral furrow formation), but it is valuable to have it tested directly. In addition, the authors show that there is more of a response from flanking cells to constriction on the ventral side, again suggesting a ventral-dorsal difference in behaviour.</p><p>However, all the reviewers had serious reservations about the origin of difference between the material properties of the two tissues. Specific points about the differences in the material properties of the doral and ventral sides relate to the involvement of active responses from the perturbations used (points 1, 2) as well as the origin of these differences (3-5). If this manuscript may be considered for a revised submission, the issues are listed below need to be addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors suggest that a key to this region specificity might lie in the mechanics of the two tissues. This is a plausible hypothesis, but one that is not explored further, and that rather limits the depth of the current manuscript. One striking observation is that ventral epithelial cells constrict their apical surfaces even outside the region of illumination, but dorsal cells do not. This suggests that there might be some active response at a distance that occurs specifically in the ventral epithelium. If so, this might give a clue to suggest that differences lie in active (rather than passive) mechanical responses of these two regions of the embryo â such as might arise from mechanosensitivity or mechanotransduction.</p><p>The authors could consider this with two sets of experiments:</p><p>a) Is Myosin II recruited to the cortex outside these regions of illumination; and is this different in ventral vs dorsal cells? (Here it will be important for the authors to exclude the possibility that this is an artefact of the experiment, as earlier they show that high illumination energies can activate myosin outside the illumination zone â at least in the larval wing peripodial epithelium.)</p><p>b) Is this regional difference affected in Dorsal or Twist embryos?</p><p>2) In Figure 2, the authors are inducing their optogenetic reagent while the endogenous pathway is apparently getting activated. That apical myosin is already accumulating during optogenetic stimulation is concerning because this endogenous activity will affect the measured response. The authors need to explicitly say which movies used during analysis had the endogenous RhoA response occurring. An alternative explanation for the differences between ventral and dorsal cells observed is that the normal ventral cell response adds to the optogenetic activation to give a different response. Conversely, the dorsal cells get stretched when ventral cells invaginate (Rauzi et al., 2015), which could lessen their apical constriction response. The timing of optogenetic activation on the dorsal side could therefore be critical. The authors should indicate the exact embryonic stage that the optogenetic activation was performed so that it is clear what other morphogenetic movements should be considered in the interpretation.</p><p>3) Another reason why dorsal cells may furrow with less apical constriction is that they are constricting via a different mechanism, such as by lateral shortening. Lateral shortening has been described to occur in the dorsal folds (Takeda et al. 2018). In Figure 2âfigure supplement 1, myosin is enriched at the apical surface of ventral cells, but myosin looks less apically restricted in dorsal cells. The authors should quantify the amount of apical vs. lateral myosin accumulation to determine if the level and localization of RhoA activation is the same in each cell type. This is important to clarify as it also affects the interpretation of later results (i.e. apical constriction amount and anisotropy).</p><p>It is also important to note that the confocal excitation used is likely to activate RhoA broadly along the optical axis (i.e., apical-basal axis). Showing a cross-sectional view of the whole depth of the epithelial layer to show whether cell height is constant and whether activation is confined to the apical surface in dorsal and ventral cells would be ideal. One concern is that different behaviors are due to different levels of basal myosin, which may be activated more in dorsal cells or the effects seen may be a consequence of the depth of confocal excitation convoluted with differential expression of Myosin? This should be clearly distinguished.</p><p>4) The authors also argue that the Dorsal and Ventral epithelium may have different mechanical properties because âventral-specific response occurs in less than a minute, a time scale that is consistent with mechanical, rather than mechanochemical, transmission of forces. Thus, cells within the ventral and dorsal epithelia may exhibit differential mechanical properties.â</p><p>Notably in Figure 3C,D: The authors argue that dorsal and ventral epithelia have different material properties, however, this assumes a uniform contractile response in the different tissues. The authors never compare the amount of myosin that is induced between ventral and dorsal cells, making it unclear whether the activation is the same. Furthermore, when comparing anisotropy, the analysis is not normalized for constriction. In addition, it is possible that the cytoskeletal networks equally are not attached to adherens junctions to the same extent. Without standardizing the input force and follow up experiments examining tissue prestress, it is impossible to compare the material properties, or make such defining statements.</p><p>5) They also show that activation of a rectangular region generates more anisotropic constriction than a square region in the ventral epithelium, but the rectangular region is not sufficient to induce an anisotropic constriction in the dorsal epithelium, again pointing to a material difference (Figure 3C versus Figure 4). However, they do not provide a clear description of how large was the square region and if this region were of the same area as the rectangle or a square with the same dimension as the long or small side of the rectangle. It would be important to examine contractility of the cells in the same regions where the rectangle is created, rather than over an entire square segment where myosin is also recruited, post RhoA activation. This relates to the experiment where they activate RhoA in an epithelium that is depleted of RhoGEF (Figure 4C). Here apical constrictions in the rectangle are even more anisotropic. Conversely, if RhoA were broadly activated throughout the epithelium, it is likely that the tissue would lose its anisotropy. Using the properties of the optogenetic tool, the authors have the capacity to test this, if they wish to claim differences in material properties. Further, they do not test the extent of anisotropy in the dorsal epithelium after depleting RhoGEF. It is likely that these data already exist with the authors and should be reported here.</p><p>6) Although the authors' study is a nice demonstration of using optogenetics to test cells' predisposition to apical constriction, which was not done before and will inform future optogenetic experiments at this stage. Classic and recent studies have demonstrated different behaviors in dorsal vs. ventral cells of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo, including different organization in adherens junctions, actin levels, basal myosin, microtubules, and polarity (Sweeton et al., 1991; Koelsch et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2012; Polyakov et al., 2014; Rauzi et al., 2015; Jodoin et al., 2015; Weng and Wieschaus, 2016; Weng and Wieschaus, 2017; Takeda et al., 2018). It is unclear how the authors' current results connect to these past studies and whether the authors are uncovering something that is fundamentally new. Thereâs no need for new experiments to justify these arguments, but a slightly broader review of possible differences between dorsal and ventral cells in the Discussion would make this better appreciated.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.56893.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors suggest that a key to this region specificity might lie in the mechanics of the two tissues.

To test whether the differential responses of dorsal and ventral cells arise from an active response to optogenetic Rho1 activation at a distance in the ventral, but not dorsal, epithelium, we optogenetically activated Rho1 in the ventral epithelium and assayed whether myosin accumulates outside of the defined activation region. In contrast to the activation patterns used in most of the manuscript, we activated Rho1 along the dorsal-ventral axis, perpendicular to the eventual ventral furrow, to ensure that we could compare the response of activated and non-activated ventral cells at identical positions along the dorsal-ventral axis. Optogenetically-induced Myosin-Ch accumulation was strictly limited to the defined region of activation, suggesting that optogenetically activated Rho1 does not induce active responses at a distance in the ventral epithelium and rules out this mechanism as an explanation of the observed differential responses of dorsal and ventral cells to optogenetic Rho1 activation. These results are presented in Figure 3âfigure supplement 1. While high light doses can result in diffuse activation, we strictly limited the laser dose in these experiments to prevent this from happening (the laser power was limited to 0.01% transmittance).</p><p>The quantitative analysis of anisotropy in <italic>dorsal</italic> and <italic>twist</italic> embryos suggest that these genes promote the ventral specific response (Figure 5). Furthermore, visual inspection of the cells neighboring optogenetic-induced deformations in embryos lacking Dorsal or Twist protein indicates there is no long-range bending of cells in the ventral epithelia of these mutants (see maximum intensity projections in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> and compare YZ projections in Figure 4B and Figure 5âfigure supplement 1).</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Maximum intensity projections of ventral epithelia of embryos lacking the Dorsal (left) or Twist (right) protein and expressing the optogenetic components and Gap43-Ch.</title><p>Rho1 was optogenetically activated in the yellow box.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-56893-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In Figure 2, the authors are inducing their optogenetic reagent while the endogenous pathway is apparently getting activated.

We also imaged embryos co-expressing Gap43-Ch and Myosin-GFP (and lacking the optogenetic components) to determine when Myosin accumulates relative to the start of apical constriction during ventral furrow formation (Figure 2âfigure supplement 1). These data show that myosin begins to detectably accumulate, at most, two minutes prior to the onset of apical constriction. Thus embryos that lack detectable myosin have not initiated cell shape changes and embryos that do not exhibit cell shape changes accumulate little if any myosin.</p><p>We emphasize that the presence of the LOV domain-based probe, which is activated by blue light, precludes the simultaneous use of Gap43-Ch, Myosin-GFP, and photoactivation. Thus, in the context of the optogenetic experiments, cell shape changes and myosin accumulation were necessarily analyzed in parallel. Nevertheless, we believe the addition of the above discussed timeline of endogenous ventral furrow formation helps to clarify the timing of our optogenetic experiments relative to early embryonic development.</p><p>In activation experiments in which we assayed cell shape in ventral cells with Gap43Ch, a comparison of the magnitude and variance of cell areas indicate that our optogenetic activations begin substantially before cell area changes (Figure 2C,D, pre-activation) and before signs of cellular anisotropy appear (cf. Figure 4D vs Figure 2B).</p><p>In activation experiments in which we assayed Myosin-Ch in ventral epithelia, we could directly assess when endogenous myosin accumulated. As the optogenetic zone of activation is somewhat narrower than the endogenous zone, we could readily identify if an embryo was initiating furrow formation before the activation protocol and we did not include such embryos in our analysis. Notably, in some cases, the optogenetically-induced furrow is displaced from the eventual ventral midline, resulting in the induced furrow being resolved from the endogenous furrow in both space and time (Figure 3B).</p><p>For experiments in dorsal epithelia, photoactivation was initiated before cephalic fold formation; a short delay separates the initiation of the ventral furrow and initiation of this fold. Our activations would be completed before the stretching of dorsal cells, which begins about 10 minutes after ventral furrow initiation (Rauzi, et al., 2015).</p><p>Additionally, in subsection âRho1 activation is sufficient to induce reversible furrows in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryonic epitheliumâ, we provide several lines of evidence that support the argument that the tissue-level shape changes and myosin accumulation observed in ventral epithelia are light-dependent.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Another reason why dorsal cells may furrow with less apical constriction is that they are constricting via a different mechanism, such as by lateral shortening.

This is important to clarify as it also affects the interpretation of later results (i.e. apical constriction amount and anisotropy).</p><p>It is also important to note that the confocal excitation used is likely to activate RhoA broadly along the optical axis (i.e., apical-basal axis). Showing a cross-sectional view of the whole depth of the epithelial layer to show whether cell height is constant and whether activation is confined to the apical surface in dorsal and ventral cells would be ideal. One concern is that different behaviors are due to different levels of basal myosin, which may be activated more in dorsal cells or the effects seen may be a consequence of the depth of confocal excitation convoluted with differential expression of Myosin? This should be clearly distinguished.</p><p>4) The authors also argue that the Dorsal and Ventral epithelium may have different mechanical properties because âventral-specific response occurs in less than a minute, a time scale that is consistent with mechanical, rather than mechanochemical, transmission of forces. Thus, cells within the ventral and dorsal epithelia may exhibit differential mechanical properties.â</p><p>Notably in Figure 3C,D: The authors argue that dorsal and ventral epithelia have different material properties, however, this assumes a uniform contractile response in the different tissues. The authors never compare the amount of myosin that is induced between ventral and dorsal cells, making it unclear whether the activation is the same.</p></disp-quote><p>To determine where, along the apicobasal axis of cells, myosin accumulates following optogenetic activation of Rho1, we photoactivated Rho1 in embryos expressing the optogenetic components and Myosin-Ch. To ensure that Myosin-Ch accumulation was light-dependent we depleted RhoGEF2 from these embryos. We quantified the average intensity of myosin-Ch at 1 micron intervals along the apicobasal axis of the embryo before and after photoactivation (see Figure 3âfigure supplement 3). Myosin accumulation is limited to the apical-most 3-4 microns of both dorsal and ventral epithelia; which is reasonable given the dimensions of a confocal point spread function in Z and the high sensitivity of the LOV domain. These results suggest that the optogenetic input is similar in the dorsal and ventral epithelium. Furthermore, the apically restricted localization of light-induced Myosin-Ch in both dorsal and ventral epithelia is inconsistent with lateral shortening occurring preferentially in either epithelium.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, when comparing anisotropy, the analysis is not normalized for constriction.</p></disp-quote><p>We used TissueAnalyzer, described in Aigouy et al., 2010, to measure cell elongation, which served as a proxy for anisotropy. This measurement of cell elongation does normalize for cell area, as stated in the Supplemental Theoretical Procedures (Aigouy et al., 2010).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, it is possible that the cytoskeletal networks equally are not attached to adherens junctions to the same extent. Without standardizing the input force and follow up experiments examining tissue prestress, it is impossible to compare the material properties, or make such defining statements.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above we removed references to the material properties of the tissue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) They also show that activation of a rectangular region generates more anisotropic constriction than a square region in the ventral epithelium, but the rectangular region is not sufficient to induce an anisotropic constriction in the dorsal epithelium, again pointing to a material difference (Figure 3C versus Figure 4). However, they do not provide a clear description of how large was the square region and if this region were of the same area as the rectangle or a square with the same dimension as the long or small side of the rectangle.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified the size of the square activation zone in two ways: (1) We now show an example of a square activation zone in Figure 5âfigure supplement1. We also state in the manuscript that the square activation zone is ~2/3 the area of the rectangular activation zone (subsection âGenetic requirements for ventral-specific responsesâ).</p><p>To be more specific, the rectangular zones of activation, such as those used in Figure 4 and Figure 5, were 914px long by 66px high, covering a total area of 60,423px2. The square zones of activation, such as those used in Figure 5, were 200px long by 200px high, covering a total area of 40,000px2. The dimensions of both the rectangular and square activation zones were chosen to leave visible cells bordering the activation zone so that the extent of ectopic invagination could be readily monitored in real time. We acknowledge that area, length, and height were not identical in these experiments, but we point out that a substantial number of cells remain activated by the square activation zone. Thus, we think the size of the square activation zone is sufficiently large to reveal cell and tissue level behaviors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be important to examine contractility of the cells in the same regions where the rectangle is created, rather than over an entire square segment where myosin is also recruited, post RhoA activation.</p></disp-quote><p>If we understand this comment correctly, the reviewers are suggesting that the analysis should be restricted to the cells that lie in the region that is shared between the âstandard rectangular activation regionâ and the âsquare activation regionâ. Presumably, the underlying concern is that by analyzing the entire square region we obscure a difference in the response of cells in the âshared regionâ. There are two reasons why we decided not to follow this suggestion. First, to restrict the analysis to cells in the âstandard rectangular activation regionâ, we would need to arbitrarily specify a rectangular region as there are no fiduciary marks that would enable this specification. Second, and more importantly, there are no systematic differences in responses of the cells in the square activation region.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This relates to the experiment where they activate RhoA in an epithelium that is depleted of RhoGEF (Figure 4C). Here apical constrictions in the rectangle are even more anisotropic.</p></disp-quote><p>Our data do not show that optogenetically-induced apical constructions are more anisotropic in RhoGEF2 depleted epithelia than in wildtype epithelia. For example, 27.4% of activated wildtype cells exhibit highly aligned, anisotropic apical constriction (Figure 4D) while only 10.9% of activated cells depleted of RhoGEF2 exhibit highly aligned, anisotropic apical constriction (Figure 5C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Conversely, if RhoA were broadly activated throughout the epithelium, it is likely that the tissue would lose its anisotropy. Using the properties of the optogenetic tool, the authors have the capacity to test this, if they wish to claim differences in material properties.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above we removed references to the material properties of the tissue. This is an interesting suggestion, but we have not had the opportunity to perform this experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further, they do not test the extent of anisotropy in the dorsal epithelium after depleting RhoGEF. It is likely that these data already exist with the authors and should be reported here.</p></disp-quote><p>These data are now shown in Figure 4âfigure supplement 1 and Figure 4âfigure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Although the authors' study is a nice demonstration of using optogenetics to test cells' predisposition to apical constriction, which was not done before and will inform future optogenetic experiments at this stage. Classic and recent studies have demonstrated different behaviors in dorsal vs. ventral cells of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo, including different organization in adherens junctions, actin levels, basal myosin, microtubules, and polarity (Sweeton et al., 1991; Koelsch et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2012; Polyakov et al., 2014; Rauzi et al., 2015; Jodoin et al., 2015; Weng and Wieschaus, 2016; Weng and Wieschaus, 2017; Takeda et al., 2018). It is unclear how the authors' current results connect to these past studies and whether the authors are uncovering something that is fundamentally new. Thereâs no need for new experiments to justify these arguments, but a slightly broader review of possible differences between dorsal and ventral cells in the Discussion would make this better appreciated.</p></disp-quote><p>We revised the Discussion to reflect that the differential responses of dorsal and ventral cells to optogenetic Rho1 activation may indeed result from previously identified cellular and molecular differences between these two populations of cells.</p></body></sub-article></article>
