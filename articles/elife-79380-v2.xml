It plays an essential role in modulating zygotic transcription and cell lineage specification of developing embryos. While the outcomes of many inductive signals have been described to require enzymatic activities of histone acetyltransferases and deacetylases (HDACs), the mechanisms by which HDACs confine the utilization of the zygotic genome remain to be elucidated. Here, we show that histone deacetylase 1 (Hdac1) progressively binds to the zygotic genome from mid-blastula and onward. The recruitment of Hdac1 to the genome at blastula is instructed maternally. <italic>Cis</italic>-regulatory modules (CRMs) bound by Hdac1 possess epigenetic signatures underlying distinct functions. We highlight a dual function model of Hdac1 where Hdac1 not only represses gene expression by sustaining a histone hypoacetylation state on inactive chromatin, but also maintains gene expression through participating in dynamic histone acetylation–deacetylation cycles on active chromatin. As a result, Hdac1 maintains differential histone acetylation states of bound CRMs between different germ layers and reinforces the transcriptional program underlying cell lineage identities, both in time and space. Taken together, our study reveals a comprehensive role for Hdac1 during early vertebrate embryogenesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Hdac1</kwd><kwd>histone acetylation</kwd><kwd>germ layer</kwd><kwd>epigenetics</kwd><kwd>zygotic genome activation</kwd><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM126395</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cho</surname><given-names>Ken WY</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM139617</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cho</surname><given-names>Ken WY</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1755214</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cho</surname><given-names>Ken WY</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM126048</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Wenqi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RSG-18-009-01-CCG</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Wenqi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Histone deacetylase 1 (Hdac1) plays a crucial role in maintaining differential histone acetylation states of enhancers in various germ layers and regulates the transcriptional program both temporally and spatially.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A fundamental question in early development is the mechanism of zygotic genome activation (ZGA), which requires the degradation of maternal mRNAs and the activation of embryonic transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blitz and Cho, 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tadros and Lipshitz, 2009</xref>). During ZGA, the embryonic genome undergoes a dramatic reprogramming of gene expression, which is also accompanied by remodeling of the embryonic epigenome. Post-translational modifications to histones are a major epigenetic regulation influencing chromatin structure and thus play a central role in ZGA. Histone acetylation appears during the onset of both minor and major ZGA waves in many species. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, histone acetylation occurs at mitotic cycle 8 on a few early zygotic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Li et al., 2014</xref>). miR430, the first zygotically active gene, is marked by H3K27ac in 64-cell staged zebrafish embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chan et al., 2019</xref>). Genome-wide H3K27ac is detected at mid-blastula shortly after the onset of ZGA in <italic>Xenopus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gupta et al., 2014</xref>). In mice, the zygotic genome is increasingly marked by H3K27ac from immature and metaphase II oocytes to 2-cell-stage embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dahl et al., 2016</xref>). Despite these findings, there remain several major questions. How is the interplay of enzymes regulating histone acetylation deployed in developing embryos? What is the role of observed histone acetylation on gene expression? How are the spatial and temporal patterns of histone acetylation established during ZGA?</p><p>Histone acetylation occurs on the ε-amino group of the lysine residues within N-terminal tails of all four core histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Inoue and Fujimoto, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Seto and Yoshida, 2014</xref>). Acetylation is a reversible process that is directly catalyzed by opposing activities of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs). In addition, HATs and HDACs can also regulate the acetylation of lysine residues on non-histone proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Choudhary et al., 2009</xref>). Histone acetylation is often associated with active gene transcription because the acyl groups neutralize the positive charge on the lysine residues, thereby reducing the affinity of histones to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson et al., 2001</xref>); it also serves as a binding platform for bromodomain (BRD) proteins which scaffold and stimulate the transcriptional machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hassan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Filippakopoulos et al., 2012</xref>). The balance between HATs and HDACs directly shapes histone acetylation landscapes and subsequently affects transcriptomes.</p><p>HDACs are critical epigenetic regulators because they reset chromatin states by returning acetylated lysine residues on histones to the basal state, which can subsequently be subjected to alternative modifications such as methylation. HDACs are grouped into four classes based on phylogenetic conservation. Class I (HDAC1, 2, 3, 8), Class II (HDAC4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10), and Class IV (HDAC11) HDACs are zinc dependent and are related to yeast Rpd3, Had1, and Hos3, respectively; Class III (SIRT1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) HDACs, also known as Sirtuins, are NAD<sup>+</sup> dependent and are related to yeast Sir2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gregoretti et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Milazzo et al., 2020</xref>). HDACs are well-characterized negative regulators of gene expression during development. For example, Hdac1 silences homeotic genes in cooperation with Polycomb group repressors in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chang et al., 2001</xref>). In zebrafish, Hdac1 represses Notch targets during neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cunliffe, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yamaguchi et al., 2005</xref>). In <italic>Xenopus</italic>, HDAC activity suppresses Vegt-induced ectopic mesoderm in ectoderm lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gao et al., 2016</xref>), represses multi-lineage marker genes at blastula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rao and LaBonne, 2018</xref>), and desensitizes dorsal Wnt signaling at late blastula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Esmaeili et al., 2020</xref>). Conversely, HDACs can also positively regulate gene expression. For instance, inhibition of HDAC activities rapidly down-regulates some genes in yeast, suggesting an activator function of HDACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bernstein et al., 2000</xref>). Genetic deletions or pharmacological application of HDAC inhibitors in cell lines results in both up- and down-regulation of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Reid et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zupkovitz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Meganathan et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, genome-wide studies showed that HDACs occupy genomic loci of active genes, and their binding correlates with gene activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kurdistani et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kidder and Palmer, 2012</xref>). These seemingly opposing functions of HDACs raise an important question as to the exact roles of HDACs on chromatin states and transcriptomes in developing embryos.</p><p>In this study, we focus on the role of Hdac1 in regulating the zygotic epigenome and transcriptome during <italic>Xenopus</italic> germ-layer specification coinciding with ZGA. Current evidence in <italic>Xenopus</italic> as well as in other non-mammalian systems suggests that the early embryonic genome is rather naive and that major chromatin modifications occur at or after ZGA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonn et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Vastenhouw et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gupta et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">van Heeringen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hontelez et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, the system allows us to probe the earliest establishment of histone acetylation and dissect the link between actions of Hdac1, the zygotic histone acetylome, and zygotic transcriptome during the first cell lineage segregation event. Here, we report that the major Hdac1 binding to the embryonic genome occurs at blastula; the binding of Hdac1 during this stage is dependent on maternal factors. We highlight a dual function model for Hdac1. First, Hdac1 keeps inactive chromatin free of histone acetylation, preventing gene misactivation in respective germ layers. Second, Hdac1 participates in dynamic histone acetylation–deacetylation cycles on active chromatin, sustaining the expression of genes that are enriched in respective germ layers. Taken together, our study reveals a coordinated spatial and temporal regulation by Hdac1 during ZGA.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Hdac1 binds to the genome progressively during blastula and onward</title><p>To identify the major functional candidates of HDACs during the early <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryogenesis, we examined the temporal RNA expression profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Owens et al., 2016</xref>) of HDAC family members (Class I, II, and III HDACs) from the zygote to the beginning of the neurula stage in <italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic>.

A set of high-confidence peaks at each stage were obtained using irreproducibility discovery rate (IDR) analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li et al., 2011</xref>) from two biologically independent samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Hdac1 binds to 1340 regions at the mid-blastula (st8), 5136 regions at the late blastula (st9), and 22,681 regions at the early gastrula (st10.5) stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Overall, a minority of Hdac1 peaks are unique to each of the blastula stages (Clusters a and b) and a majority of Hdac1 peaks are present across multiple stages (Cluster c) and at the early gastrula stage (Cluster d) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The expression levels of zygotic genes associated with Cluster c Hdac1 peaks are higher than those associated with Clusters a, b, and d, suggesting that the genes associated with sustained Hdac1 binding are more active during gastrulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Similarly, Hdac2 gradually accumulates on the embryonic genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Interestingly, 99% of Hdac1 peaks at stage 9 and 97% of Hdac1 peaks at stage 10.5 overlap with Hdac2 peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F, G</xref>). When the levels of Hdac2 peaks associated with Hdac1 were compared to Hdac2 peaks , Hdac1 peaks display a significantly higher Hdac2 peak enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>).

Since a majority of Hdac1-bound peaks are similarly bound by Hdac2, we focus on Hdac1 peaks in subsequent analyses.</p><p>To investigate the differences of Hdac1 genomic occupancy across early stages, we examined various genomic features of regions bound by Hdac1 at each stage. The majority of Hdac1 peaks are found in either intergenic or intronic regions; a minor fraction of Hdac1 peaks is present within exons or transcriptional termination sites. A notable observation is the increased Hdac1 binding to more promoter regions over developmental times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We then analyzed the distribution of Hdac1 across three stages along the gene bodies of genes bound by Hdac1. A higher enrichment of Hdac1 binding is located near the promoters of genes as development proceeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).

We thus compared the genomic binding profiles of Hdac1 to two maternal TFs, Foxh1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Charney et al., 2017</xref>) and Sox3. A majority of Hdac1-bound regions (Cluster 1) overlaps with both Foxh1- and Sox3-bound regions while only a small fraction of Hdac1-bound regions (Cluster 2) overlaps the binding of either Foxh1, or Sox3, or neither (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

Hdac1 binds to genomic regions mostly free of H3K9me2, H3K9me3, or H4K20me3. All three modifications are known to mark constitutive heterochromatin denoting gene-poor areas consisting of tandem repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Richards and Elgin, 2002</xref>).

These observations suggest that Hdac1 binds to facultative heterochromatic regions facilitating the repression of genes.</p><p>Since the majority of Hdac1 peaks (Clusters b–d) are marked by both active and repressive epigenetic signatures, we wonder how Hdac1 functions in epigenetically distinct genomic loci. We compared peaks between two functionally opposing histone modifications H3K27ac and H3K27me3 to Hdac1 peaks, then subdivided these Hdac1 peaks into four clusters representing functionally distinct CRM types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Cluster I denotes 3548 Hdac1 peaks marked by both H3K27ac and H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Given that both H3K27ac and H3K27me3 are modified on the same lysine residue, we speculate that these regions are differentially marked in space due to heterogeneous cell populations present in the whole embryo. Therefore, Hdac1 Cluster I peaks are referred to as heterogeneous CRMs. Cluster II denotes 1389 Hdac1 peaks marked by only H3K27me3 indicating that these regions are associated with inactive developmental genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Hdac1 Cluster II peaks represent repressive CRMs. Cluster III denotes 13,669 Hdac1 peaks marked by only H3K27ac, suggesting that these are active CRMs. Cluster IV denotes 4836 Hdac1 peaks with neither H3K27ac nor H3K27me3 modifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). At genomic loci marked with two distinct H3K27 modifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>), the expression levels of genes bound by Hdac1 (I, II, and III) are generally higher than that of genes unbound (I’, II’, and III’) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>), suggesting that Hdac1 binding correlates with transcriptional activity of the genes. Together, we show that Hdac1-bound CRMs are subject to distinct epigenetic modifications, which confer differential CRM activities.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>HDAC activity is required for differential germ-layer histone acetylomes</title><p>A major function of HDACs is to catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from histones. We hypothesize that Hdac1 differentially regulates histone acetylation of four different Hdac1 CRM Clusters (Clusters I–IV in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we treated embryos continuously with a widely used pan-HDAC inhibitor, Trichostatin A (TSA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yoshida et al., 1990</xref>) beginning at the 4-cell stage and followed the development up to tailbud stages. Embryos treated with TSA are developmentally arrested at gastrula (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We observed the presence of dorsal blastopore lip, suggesting that the progression but not the initiation of gastrulation is defective. A Class I HDAC inhibitor, valproic acid (VPA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Göttlicher et al., 2001</xref>), also produces a similar phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We first showed that protein levels of Hdac1 and Hdac2 are not affected by TSA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Next, Hdac1 ChIP-seq experiments display high Pearson correlations on embryos treated with solvent control or TSA at st9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and st10.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>), which is further supported by higher Pearson correlations upon TSA treatment than the batch effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E, F</xref>). Lastly, differential peak analysis on Hdac1 IDR peaks in embryos treated with solvent control or TSA showed barely any differential Hdac1 signals (0.1% peaks or less) at st9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G</xref>) and st10.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1H</xref>).

We performed pan-H3Kac ChIP-seq at early gastrula (st10.5) on dissected AC and VG explants from embryos treated with either TSA or solvent control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). A comparison of high-confidence peaks from each explant reveals that a majority (~75%) of pan-H3Kac are specifically marked in ectodermal (~37%) and endodermal (~38%) germ layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>).

To correlate the differential pan-H3Kac states and the differential gene expression profiles between the two germ layers, we assigned high enrichment pan-H3Kac peaks (~top 30%) to the nearest genes within 10 kb and compared the expression levels of these genes in each germ layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blitz et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, the expression level of genes enriched with AC-specific pan-H3Kac are higher in AC than VG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D</xref>), and the expression levels of genes enriched with VG-specific pan-H3Kac are higher in VG than AC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Well-known genes with germ-layer-specific expression exhibit localized pan-H3Kac signals between germ layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2F</xref>).

Consistent with H3K27 modifications, both heterogeneous CRMs (Cluster I, both H3K27ac and H3K27me3) and active CRMs (Cluster III, only H3K27ac), but not repressive CRMs (Cluster II, only H3K27me3), are marked by pan-H3Kac. Nearly half of pan-H3Kac marks on heterogeneous or active CRMs are localized either animally or vegetally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, D</xref>), suggesting that these CRMs are regionally active in specific germ layers. We then quantitatively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Egan et al., 2016</xref>) compared the levels of pan-H3Kac signals (read density) on each CRM within Hdac1 CRM Clusters I–IV with and without TSA treatment. A global increase of pan-H3Kac signals across all Hdac1 CRM Clusters is observed after TSA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>), which is consistent with the western blot data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). TSA-induced HDAC inhibition leads to elevated pan-H3Kac signals on both readily acetylated genomic loci (Cluster α of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B, C</xref>) and other genomic regions (Cluster β of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B, C</xref>). Interestingly, we found that CRMs of Hdac1 Clusters I–IV respond differently upon HDAC inhibition: repressive CRMs (Cluster II, only H3K27me3) show the highest fold increase of pan-H3Kac signals, while active CRMs (Cluster III, only H3K27ac) show the lowest fold increase of pan-H3Kac signals when compared to other clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3D</xref>). We also note that the increased amount of pan-H3Kac is very similar across different Hdac1 clusters, irrespective of CRMs being repressive or active CRMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3E, F</xref>). This suggests that HDACs catalytic activities are similar whether CRMs are repressive or active. In sum, upon HDAC inhibition, Hdac1-bound repressive CRMs are subject to histone hyperacetylation, while Hdac1-bound active CRMs exhibit a further increase of histone acetylation.</p><p>Lastly, we explored how Hdac1 CRM Clusters (Clusters I–IV in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) differentially respond to HDAC inhibition in specific germ layers. For heterogeneous CRMs (Cluster I, both H3K27ac and H3K27me3), the fold increase of pan-H3Kac signals after TSA treatment is examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3G</xref>). Interestingly, CRMs with low levels of histone acetylation tend to be more responsive to HDAC inhibition, than CRMs with high levels of histone acetylation. Next, heterogeneous CRMs were subdivided into three spatial categories, that are pan-H3Kac enriched animally (AC CRMs), vegetally (VG CRMs), and ubiquitous CRMs. The fold changes of pan-H3Kac signals of these CRMs were examined after TSA treatment. Germ-layer-specific AC and VG CRMs show the greater changes upon HDAC inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). AC CRMs show an increase in pan-H3Kac signals in VG but not in AC after HDAC inhibition. Similarly, VG CRMs acquire an increase of pan-H3Kac signals in AC but not in VG upon HDAC inhibition. A similar trend is also observed on active CRMs (Cluster III, only H3K27ac), emphasizing germ-layer-specific functions of this CRM cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3H, I</xref>). Taken together, these data demonstrate that Hdac1 activity is spatially regulated in development to maintain proper germ layer specific gene expression patterns.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>HDAC activity modulates developmental genes between germ layers</title><p>HDACs are considered as transcriptional corepressors because histone deacetylation is generally associated with transcriptional repression. To determine how Hdac1-bound CRM Clusters I–III (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) influence the activities of their corresponding genes, each CRM within a cluster was assigned to a nearest gene located within 10 kb and genes were placed into one of three classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

Interestingly, greater than 85% of Class 2 genes are prematurely activated during gastrulation upon HDAC inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), supporting the idea that Hdac1 temporally regulates the expression of Class 2 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1H</xref> ).

Furthermore, we observed that differentially regulated genes in Class 1 (CRMs are marked by a mixture of active H3K27ac and repressive H3K27me3) and Class 3 (whose CRMs are only marked by active H3K27ac) can be up- or down-regulated upon HDAC inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

Expression profiles of Class 1 genes revealed that genes normally expressed in the vegetal region (endoderm) are significantly up-regulated in AC upon HDAC inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, second bar). Coincidently, VG CRMs are hyperacetylated in AC upon HDAC inhibition (VG CRMs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>), which in turn leads to the misactivation of endodermal genes in AC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Surprisingly, we found that genes normally expressed in ectoderm and mesoderm are significantly down-regulated in AC upon HDAC inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, third bar) and genes normally expressed in mesoderm and endoderm are significantly down-regulated in VG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, fifth bar), upon HDAC inhibition. Contrary to the repressive role of Hdac1, this finding suggests that Hdac1 positively influences the transcription of active genes in each germ layer. We propose that the state of histone acetylation on CRMs associated with active genes is dynamic, and disruption to such equilibrium impairs normal transcription activities. Based on the quantitative analysis of pan-H3Kac profiles upon TSA treatment, we found that Hdac1-bound CRMs gain increased levels of pan-H3Kac globally including already acetylated CRMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>). This TSA-induced excessive histone acetylation on active CRMs may contribute to the attenuated expression of associated active genes in respective germ layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>). A similar trend is observed among TSA responsive Class 3 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>).

Class 1 genes display a higher variability in expression levels between different germ layers when compared to Class 3 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1G</xref>). This indicates that the expression of genes undergoing active H3K27me3 suppression is more intimately associated with germ-layer determination. Altogether, these results show that Hdac1 maintains the integrity of germ-layer genes both in time and space during gastrulation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we defined a critical role for Hdac1 during early <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryogenesis. Our findings demonstrate a close link between homeostasis of histone acetylation and transcriptional activities in developing embryos. Progressive binding of Hdac1 to the genome shapes the zygotic histone acetylome, thereby reinforcing a proper germ-layer-specific transcriptome, both in time and space. Thus, Hdac1 is an essential epigenetic regulator in the control of embryonic cell identity and lineage. We propose that TFs inducing differentiation programs exploit the activity of HDACs to confine the expression of zygotic genes.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Gradual binding of Hdac1 coincides with ZGA</title><p>The genome-wide binding of Hdac1 begins at mid-blastula and gradually accumulates at thousands of loci. Such progressive binding of Hdac1 around ZGA raises the question of whether Hdac1 recruitment requires zygotic factors during these stages. Surprisingly, ChIP-seq analyses of Hdac1 from α-amanitin-injected embryos show that zygotic transcription is dispensable for Hdac1 recruitment to the genome, at the very least, up to late blastula (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>). Recent work in yeast shows that active transcription is required to shape histone acetylation patterns largely due to a direct role of RNAPII in recruitment and activation of H4 HATs but not HDACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Martin et al., 2021</xref>). Our result agrees with the notion that Hdac1 recruitment is not directed by on-going transcription. We, therefore, speculate that maternal factors instruct early Hdac1 recruitment. Our results provide evidence that maternal Foxh1/Sox3 plays a role in Hdac1 genomic recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E, F</xref>), highlighting the importance of these two maternal TFs in early embryonic epigenome establishment. Though maternal TFs such as Foxh1, Vegt, and Otx1 are shown to bind the genome as early as the 32- to 64-cell stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Charney et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Paraiso et al., 2019</xref>), the genome-wide binding of Hdac1 likely begins at blastula and is not significantly widespread until early gastrula (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, G</xref>). It is also known that Hdac1 containing complexes bind to pre-existing epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation and H3K4me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wade et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, maternally instructed histone modifications may also play a role in Hdac1 recruitment.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Hdac1 functions differently on active versus inactive CRMs</title><p>One perplexing finding is that Hdac1 occupies both active and repressive genomic loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>). Hdac1 binds to repressive genomic regions that are facultative but not constitutive heterochromatin. Though histone modifications underlying constitutive heterochromatin have been shown to regulate developmental genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Riddle et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Methot et al., 2021</xref>), the profile of H3K27me3 is largely different (~90% non-overlapping peaks) from profiles of H3K9me2, 3, and H4K20me3 in early <italic>Xenopus</italic> development (data not shown, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">van Kruijsbergen et al., 2017</xref>). These observations suggest that Hdac1-mediated suppression is largely dictated by developmental programs. In contrast to commonly accepted repressor function of Hdac1, the binding of Hdac1 at active genomic regions is surprising. However, our findings are consistent with previous studies in yeast and mammalian cell culture emphasizing a dynamic equilibrium of histone acetylation at active loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kurdistani et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kidder and Palmer, 2012</xref>). Hence, we hypothesize that Hdac1 functions at both active and inactive CRMs in early embryos.</p><p>To test the in vivo function of HDACs, we blocked their endogenous activity using an inhibitor and quantitatively examined the changes of general H3 acetylation (pan-H3Kac) upon HDAC inhibition. First, an increase of pan-H3Kac (detecting acetylated forms of H3K9, K14, K18, and K27) is observed across Hdac1-bound CRMs, including active CRMs, consistent with the canonical enzymatic activity of Hdac1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Second, repressive CRMs marked by H3K27me3 undergo drastic H3 hyperacetylation compared to active CRMs marked by H3K27ac suggesting a HDAC-activity-dependent suppression of repressive CRMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3D</xref>). Third, germ-layer-specific pan-H3Kac profiles are disrupted indicating the importance of Hdac1 in defining spatial patterns of histone acetylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3I</xref>). Based on these results, we propose a dual function model for Hdac1. On the one hand, Hdac1 prevents histone acetylation at inactive CRMs, thereby preserving H3K27 as unacetylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Interestingly, H3K27me3 is not always imposed on inactive CRMs. For instance, active CRMs (Cluster III, only H3K27ac) are spatially modified with pan-H3Kac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) but are not subjected to H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3I</xref>). This suggests that HDAC-mediated histone deacetylation and Polycomb-mediated histone methylation are not coupled at inactive CRMs. On the other hand, Hdac1 participates in dynamic histone acetylation–deacetylation cycles at active CRMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). Although we did not directly test the co-binding of HATs and HDACs, CRMs may be simultaneously bound since (1) the binding profiles of Ep300 and Hdac1 mostly overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and (2) pan-H3Kac signals increase at all Hdac1 peaks including active CRMs, upon HDAC inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Presumably, active CRMs are maintained in a state of dynamic equilibrium. This model is in accordance with a previous study demonstrating that HATs and HDACs simultaneously participate in histone acetylation cycles, which initiate and reset chromatin between rounds of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wang et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Hdac1 safeguards misactivation of genes both in time and space</title><p>We attempted to correlate the activity of CRMs with the transcriptional activity of potential target genes. Genes associated with repressive CRMs (H3K27me3 only) are mainly inactive until neurula (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). More than 85% of these genes are prematurely activated upon HDAC inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), suggesting that Hdac1 maintains the state of histone hypoacetylation on repressive CRMs, thereby preventing premature expression of genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Moreover, genes associated with heterogeneous (both H3K27ac and H3K27me3) and active (H3K27ac only) CRMs are misactivated in different germ layers when HDAC activity is blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>).

However, a previous study showed that H3K27me3 is spatially deposited at late gastrula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akkers et al., 2009</xref>). We predict that heterogenous CRMs are differentially marked by opposing H3K27me3 or acetylation in different germ layers. In summary, Hdac1 preserves the histone hypoacetylation state of inactive CRMs resulting in gene suppression both in time and space, thus supporting the transcriptional corepressor role for Hdac1.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Cyclical histone acetylation sustains germ-layer gene transcription</title><p>Our study reveals an unexpected role for Hdac1 in sustaining active gene expression during germ-layer formation. Within both ectoderm and endoderm, the expression of HDAC inhibitor down-regulated genes associated with either active (H3K27ac only) or heterogeneous (H3K27ac and H3K27me3) CRMs are enriched in their respective germ layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>). This suggests a paradoxical activator role for Hdac1, which is also reported in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Vidal and Gaber, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zupkovitz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baltus et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hughes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rao and LaBonne, 2018</xref>). We speculate that utilization of HDAC activities at active genomic loci is a general mechanism, as seen in examples of <italic>Xenopus</italic> ectoderm and endoderm lineages, which deploy distinct gene regulatory networks. Based on our findings, we propose that a dynamic equilibrium between acetylation and deacetylation is essential to sustain gene transcription. The function of HDACs on active genomic regions has been elucidated in several contexts. In yeast, cotranscriptional methylation (H3K36me3 and H3K4me2) recruits HDAC containing complexes (Rpd3S and Set3C) to suppress intragenic transcription and delay induction of genes that overlap non-coding RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carrozza et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Keogh et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kim and Buratowski, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Heo et al., 2021</xref>). Genetic deletion of Set3C affects transcript levels only in altered growth conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lenstra et al., 2011</xref>), consistent with the notion that cyclical histone acetylation acts as a mechanism to regulate dynamics and fidelity of transcription. In metazoans HDAC1 can be targeted by Ep300 to transcribing genes through a direct interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Simone et al., 2004</xref>). Simultaneous binding of both HATs and HDACs at active genomic regions is shown in T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). Inhibition of both DNA methyltransferases and HDACs induces cryptic transcription in lung cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brocks et al., 2017</xref>). Down-regulated genes upon HDAC inhibition exhibit high levels of cryptic transcripts during mouse cardiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Milstone et al., 2020</xref>). These findings suggest a role for HDAC activity in transcriptional fidelity.</p><p>Why does excessive histone acetylation due to HDAC inhibition lead to reduced transcription instead of elevated transcription? We observed that active (H3K27ac only) and heterogeneous (both H3K27ac and H3K27me3) CRMs are excessively acetylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>) following HDAC inhibition, which results in the reduced expression of these CRM-associated genes within their respective germ layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>). This leads us to speculate that excessive histone acetylation interferes the activity of the transcriptional machinery. A recent study shows that excessive histone acetylation on chromatin induced by inhibition of HDAC1, 2, and 3 leads to increased aberrant contacts and reduced native contacts between super-enhancer loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gryder et al., 2019</xref>). This suggests that the excessive histone acetylation impairs active transcription by altering chromatin interactions. Alternatively, excessive histone acetylation can alter the binding of acetyl-histone readers. H4 polyacetylation induced by HDAC inhibition is shown to be preferentially bound by BRD proteins (such as BRD4), thereby sequestering these factors away from active genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Slaughter et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, HDACs safeguard the function of normal acetyl-histone readers. Further investigation of cyclical histone acetylation regulating developmental programs is needed in the context of germ-layer specification.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal model and subject details</title><p><italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic> embryos were obtained by in vitro fertilization according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ogino et al., 2006</xref> and staged according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nieuwkoop and Faber, 1994</xref>.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers highlighted a number of novel features of your study. This includes uncovering dual positive and negative roles for HDACs in cell fate specification in the early embryo and identifying a key contribution of HDACs to germ layer cell lineage integrity. Inhibition of deacetylation causes dysregulation of specificity of spatial boundaries in the gastrula, with mesendoderm misexpressed in animal cap cells. Additionally, you demonstrate progressive binding of HDAC1 to the genome with ChIP-seq and find correlative patterns of promoter occupancy relative to other repressive and activating histone epigenetic marks and ChIP-seq peaks for maternal transcription factors, FoxH1 and Sox3. On the whole, this work advances our understanding of HDACs and control of chromatin acetylation and gene expression tied to early cell fate specificity in a vertebrate embryo.</p><p>However, the manuscript is not acceptable in its current format and will require major experimental revisions for consideration. Referees brought up a number of concerns.</p><p>1) Direct versus indirect effects of deacetylation inhibition. Specifically, whether H3-acetylation peaks and gene expression changes from deacetylase inhibition can be directly assigned to HDAC1 activity. One reviewer suggested a knockdown of HDAC1 would be useful, as performed in a previous study by Rao and Labonne, Development 2018. Additionally, because the authors primarily performed their experiments with TSA, rather than HDAC1-specific VPA, it is suggested that they expand the comparison, at least for RNA-seq, and also consider directly comparing the effects on histone to separately assign chromatin binding and gene regulation individually to HDAC1 versus HDAC2.</p><p>2) Lack of evidence that HDAC1 recruitment is likely dependent on maternal factors. The authors relied on the correlation of HDAC1 ChIP-seq peaks from this manuscript to FoxH1 and Sox3 peaks in published ChIP-seq datasets. Although the correlation is supportive, reviewers felt that the conclusion lacked experimental support. They proffer two suggestions: (1) to temporally analyze when HDAC1 binding begins in the egg or early gastrula, or (2) to knockdown maternal FoxH1 and Sox3 and characterize the loss of HDAC1 peaks from ChIP-seq.</p><p>3) There are a number of comments from reviewer 2 about improving manuscript clarity, and specific notes from reviewer 3 about analyses and figures. These should be addressed as well. Reviewer 1 suggested highlighting further that TSA causes more extensive gene expression dysregulation in AC versus VG, and to specifically plot mis-expression of endoderm VG genes in AC.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This study provides a number of new insights on the role of histone acetylation-deacetylation in spatial regulation of gene expression that contributes to cell lineage regulation as germ layers begin to form in the gastrula embryos. The work is important and interesting to the field. However, my enthusiasm is partly limited by the correlative nature of the experiments and some missing analyses. My comments to the author are below, formatted as ways to improve the manuscript.</p><p>1. Extent of mis-regulation of germ layer-specific genes upon TSA and VPA expression. The authors provide volcano plots in Figure S5B, and differential gene expression analysis spatially within AC and VG in Figure 4F. They find that up-regulation of H3Kac peaks tends to occur for opposite lineage, ie. VG genes are misexpressed in AC. Further, that downregulated genes tend to be more lineage constrained. It would be helpful if they could also plot a smaller subset of the data for ectoderm and endoderm-specific gene lists. Based on Figure 4F, one would expect that a large fraction of endoderm-specific genes would be inappropriately upregulated in the AC, and a large fraction of ectoderm-specific genes upregulated in the VG. To what extent is this true.</p><p>I also think the authors should highlight and discuss that TSA treatment has a much more profound effect on gene expression dysregulation in the AC compared to the VG (Figure S5B). There are many more genes up and downregulated in the AC. This is quite a novel and interesting result. Can the authors comment on why?</p><p>2. Timing of HDAC1 binding to the genome. It is interesting that HDAC1 peaks are widespread in the genome by Stage 8, presumably during zygotic genome activation, and that these peaks largely strengthen over time into the early gastrula. This however begs the question of when HDAC1 begins to bind to the genome. Is it already bound in the egg, or upon fertilization, or are peaks only detectable starting around the time of genome activation? Given that the protein is present in the egg and throughout cleavage stages (Figure 1A), and that the authors propose FoxH1 and Sox3 may be contributing to recruitment, the manuscript would be strengthened by characterization of the time of recruitment.</p><p>3. Differential role for HDAC1 and HDAC2 in lineage maintenance? The TSA treatment makes it difficult to disentangle specific subsets of genes modulated by promoter-proximal deacetylation. Can the authors contrast TSA vs. VPA inhibition experiments to identify peaks that could likely be attributed to HDAC2 rather than HDAC1, and perform GO analyses? Alternatively, can the authors provide direct binding data with ChIP-seq of HDAC2 in blastula and gastrula.</p><p>4. Direct evidence that HDAC1/2 binding contributes to gene expression regulation. The authors utilize inhibition of deacetylation (TSA) or HDAC1 specifically (VPA) to analyze changes to pan-H3K-acetylation and gene expression, regionally within the AC and VG. In general, I like this line of experiments, however, I wonder whether the TSA inhibition might be affecting other deacetylase enzymes, and what the effect would be of MO knockdown of the HDACs (or their recruitment via FoxH1, Sox3). Other groups have found that HAT-HDAC binding to promoters and enhancers does not always correlate to gene expression regulation. Extending this notion here, I worry that the authors may not be directly analyzing the downstream function of HDACs. Can the authors compare their differential expression data to existing gene profiling studies in embryos that have knockdown of FoxH1, Sox3, or HDAC1/2 to demonstrate similar profiles of dysregulation?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>As a general reader, I do not know enough of the background knowledge in the field to know how novel the observations are, and it seems that most of these specific comparisons are made in the discussion, and it is not explicit what observations are really new, or whether the importance of the paper is in the documentation. The authors need to draw this out more clearly. Also, as a general reader without the ingrained knowledge of the activating or inhibitory functions of the different histone modifications, I initially found it impossible to hold onto the threads of the arguments but was able to do so by color coding the modification types as activating, inhibitory, or heterochromatin in the text. I would hope that modern journals might be able to use colored text to enable readers to read and evaluate the text more readily. Similarly, it is hard to hold on to the nature of different classes of response, so I suggest more descriptive names for the classes. Without these, the manuscript is very tough going for the general reader. Indeed, as a detailed examination of chromatin modification, it is inevitably dense. Again as a general reader, I would find it more useful to present the specific genes that convey the arguments in the main text and figures, so that there is something to get one's teeth into and move the venn diagrams and stacked bar graphs and violin plots, which I find uninformative for the specific arguments, but which are necessary for the generality of the claims, to the supplement. But these are suggestions to make the manuscript more accessible to the general reader. If the target audience is the specialized field of chromatin organization or detailed regulation of gene expression in developing animals (without going beyond inhibitor studies to the sequences responsible for the DNA recruitment or the enzymatic activity of the protein), then the paper would probably be more appropriate for a more focused journal. But if there are new insights that can be more clearly articulated, then the manuscript could be appropriate to <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Major points, in no particular order.</p><p>1. While the Hdac genes are shown for mRNA it would be useful to see whether this matches the protein databases. Are they detectable, and does mRNA translate to protein abundance?</p><p>2. Line 140- were Vegt peaks found to be enriched in the maternal motifs? (Gentsch?)</p><p>Indeed, Was there enrichment of other motifs associated with transcriptional activation as found by Gentsch et al? (POU-SOX (Pou5f3-Sox3 heterodimer), Krüppel-like zinc finger (ZF; Sp1 and several Klf), POU (Pou5f3), SOX (Sox3), bZIP (Max), FOXH (Foxh1), ETS (Ets2), NFY (NFYa/b/c), SMAD (Smad1/2), VegT (mVegT)), A lack of enrichment would illustrate a strong difference in recruitment and be informative.</p><p>3. &quot;Consistent with the overlapping binding of Ep300, Hdac1 peaks display a moderate level of H3K9ac (Cluster c and d), high levels of 164 H3K18ac (Cluster b, c, and d), H3K27ac (Cluster b, c, and d), and pan-H3 lysine acetylation (pan-H3Kac).&quot;</p><p>Why is this consistent (ref required?) is Ep300 always an activating signal? The next section discusses activating signals, so maybe so, but it does not say so. What is the current understanding of Ep300? General enhancer binding? I fear that the paper is exceedingly hard to follow unless one has these identities imprinted in one's own brain, which I don't. Indeed, for people not in the immediate field, the nomenclature, with its acetylations, and multiple methylations is all too easy to forget. For ease of reviewing, I color-coded the histone marks according to Wikipedia. It made the manuscript much easier to follow, though I am sure my simplistic green or red color code is too simple. The color coding of the figures in the manuscript is more nuanced, and presumably reflects some deeper understanding. It would be useful to share this with the reader. Otherwise, the activating (green) repressive (red), and heterochromatin (brown, blue?- what are these?) and the main text should also match an informative color coding, which should be trivial in these days of digital typesetting.</p><p>4. &quot;we speculate that these regions are differentially marked in space due to heterogeneous cell populations present in the whole embryo. Hdac1 Cluster I peaks are referred to as heterogeneous CRMs.&quot;</p><p>Surely the authors can give explicit examples here for some known heterogeneously expressed genes to reduce the speculative nature of this group? (though they do eventually show up in the supplements- but why not progress the argument from the specific to the general?).</p><p>5. Ideally, the figures and legends should be interpretable independent of the text, for example, when wondering what abcd are in figures 1 and 3, one should not have to search in the text for the relevant explanation.</p><p>&quot;Overall, a minority of Hdac1 peaks are unique to each of the blastula stages (Cluster a and b) while a majority of Hdac1 peaks are present across multiple stages (Cluster c) and at the early gastrula stage (Cluster d) (Figure 1C, S1D).”</p><p>And in reading this, &quot;unique to each blastula stage&quot;, could be expressed more clearly to indicate their uniqueness- ie at stage 8 (cluster a, likely driven by maternal factors?) and stage 9, (cluster b, likely driven by newly expressed zygotic factors or signals?).</p><p>Re the italics – where are the genes known to be in these classes? Ie the Nodals, vs genes driven by zygotically activated signals like Smad2? It is important for a simple argument to give the general reader some specific biological context.</p><p>6. Likewise &quot;These observations suggest that Hdac1-mediated suppression is largely dictated by developmental programs&quot; – perhaps the authors might give some examples in the text.</p><p>7. &quot;First, an increase of pan-H3Kac is observed across Hdac1-bound CRMs, including active CRMs, consistent with the canonical enzymatic activity of Hdac1&quot; remind us what H3 Kac is for – it seems to be in the purple, brown and red categories. Is it associated with transcription start sites? It's not clear what antibody was used. It seems it must be a pan H3Kac antibody?</p><p>8. What are the effects of Hdac inhibitors on the transcriptome? Seems that this is an essential piece of information to interpret the results on chromatin? Seems there is a lot of literature on this, and so far as I can tell it is not cited until the discussion. It would be nice to have a digested understanding to compare to the chromatin results in the Results section (some of this appears eventually, but late enough to leave the reader frustrated when the topic comes up).</p><p>9. I had great difficulty understanding the paragraph that begins &quot;Given that Hdac1 CRM clusters (Clusters I-IV in Figure 3C) are subjected to both active and repressive epigenetic modifications presumably in different germ layers, we compared the general status of H3 acetylome (pan-H3Kac) between two distinct germ layers&quot; I think that all of this is VPA and TSA independent information? But in the end, isn't it all circular? Ie higher enrichment of pan H3Kac associated with higher expression?</p><p>10. &quot;Taken together, these data demonstrate that Hdac1 maintains differential H3 acetylation states between germ layers through its catalytic activity.&quot; Is a rather bland statement after trudging through the paragraph. I think that one can make the general statement that upon inhibition of HDAC, repressed genes have a larger increase in their pan H3Kac than do active genes. And is there evidence that it is through the catalytic activity rather than its binding?</p><p>&quot;we found that the fold increases of pan-H3Kac signals after TSA treatment are negatively correlated with the levels of endogenous pan-H3Kac signals in both AC and VG explants&quot; This is an unnecessarily complicated sentence. It's already hard to figure out the direction things are going in without having to think about what negative correlation means in these contexts. But I think it means what I just suggested?</p><p>11. I ask that the authors consider how much time would be spent by the reader looking back to see what Class1,2 and 3 genes are. Could they not be more readily described as &quot;selectively activated&quot;, &quot;constitutively repressed&quot; and &quot;Constitutively activated&quot; if these were designated SA, CR, and CA that might be easier to remember/interpret, especially for me who can't remember class I and 2 from one paragraph to the next. Or consider the value of spelling them out each time, at least for the reviewer. Once accepted, one can return to uninformative abbreviations and let the reader suffer.</p><p>12. What is the mechanism of Hdac inhibition by VPA and TSA? Does the Hdac dissociate from chromatin, allowing access to acetylases? Or does it stay on the chromatin in an inactive form, suggesting a more complex mechanism of the differential effects of inactivation? What do the data say about the potential mechanism?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>My general concern regarding this work is that most of the conclusions come from indirect evidences:</p><p>– Maternal TF involvement is only supported by motif enrichment.</p><p>– Spatial difference in H3K27ac/me and HDAC1 marking between AC/V part of embryos based on whole embryos data.</p><p>– Functional test of HDAC1 requirement carried out through the use of broad HDAC inhibitor. Here I find that the authors investigate in great detail the behaviour of HDAC1-associated regions but do not provide evidence that these regions are preferentially affected by TSA treatment. HDAC1 knockdown would be a much more straightforward assay to interpret in my view.</p><p>Specific points</p><p>Figure 1</p><p>1C: St101/2 or stage 9-specific HDAC1 peaks seem to already show signal at stage 8. (Difficult to grasp relative level as no indication of what the blue scale is….). In any case, is this low level at stage 8 meaningful (how does it look in all enhancer peaks for example).</p><p>What is the temporal expression (early blastula to neurula stages for example) of the a-d set of HDAC1-associated genes? Any correlation between stage-specific binding and expression pattern would strengthen the proposed involvement of HDAC1 in the epigenetic regulation of genes around ZGA.</p><p>Figure 2:</p><p>2B What are the enriched motifs in stage 8 and stage 10 specific peaks?</p><p>2C: How does the HDAC1 peak intensity look if you integrate the HDAC1 chip a-amanitin data in the map from 1C (in complement to S2B).</p><p>Charney et al. document binding of TF pre/post ZGA.</p><p>To support the ID that TF binding is associated with HDAC1 binding it would be important to check if stage-specific binding of HDAC1 is associated with stage-specific binding of TF.</p><p>The title &quot;HDAC1 binding is instructed maternally&quot; is not appropriate. Interference with maternal TFs would be needed to go beyond correlation.

Additionally, because the authors primarily performed their experiments with TSA, rather than HDAC1-specific VPA, it is suggested that they expand the comparison, at least for RNA-seq, and also consider directly comparing the effects on histone to separately assign chromatin binding and gene regulation individually to HDAC1 versus HDAC2.</p></disp-quote><p>We followed the advice and examined the effect of inhibiting Hdac activities using both TSA and VPA (Figure S4.1-3 Figure 5F, Figure S5A-F). Additionally, we also performed Hdac2 ChIP-seq to compare the chromatin binding behavior of Hdac1 and Hdac2 (Figure S1E-H).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Lack of evidence that HDAC1 recruitment is likely dependent on maternal factors. The authors relied on the correlation of HDAC1 ChIP-seq peaks from this manuscript to FoxH1 and Sox3 peaks in published ChIP-seq datasets. Although the correlation is supportive, reviewers felt that the conclusion lacked experimental support. They proffer two suggestions: (1) to temporally analyze when HDAC1 binding begins in the egg or early gastrula, or (2) to knockdown maternal FoxH1 and Sox3 and characterize the loss of HDAC1 peaks from ChIP-seq.</p></disp-quote><p>Inhibition of zygotic transcription using a-amanitin injection showed that the genomic binding profile of Hdac1 is largely unchanged at the late blastula stage. This inhibition of zygotic gene expression provides strong evidence supporting the conclusion that zygotic factors are not required for Hdac1 binding at this stage, implicating maternal recruitment. Additionally, we now include the ChIP-qPCR analysis of Hdac1 binding around Foxh1/Sox3 cobound regions in Foxh1 or Sox3 morphants. We found that Hdac1 binding is reduced, but not abolished in these morphants, suggesting that, in addition to Foxh1 and Sox3, other maternal TFs are likely to be involved in the Hdac1 recruitment to DNA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There are a number of comments from reviewer 2 about improving manuscript clarity, and specific notes from reviewer 3 about analyses and figures. These should be addressed as well. Reviewer 1 suggested highlighting further that TSA causes more extensive gene expression dysregulation in AC versus VG, and to specifically plot mis-expression of endoderm VG genes in AC.</p></disp-quote><p>We incorporated all suggestions raised by reviewers and also included additional gene expression dysregulation in AC vs VG (Figure S5E, Table S3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This study provides a number of new insights on the role of histone acetylation-deacetylation in spatial regulation of gene expression that contributes to cell lineage regulation as germ layers begin to form in the gastrula embryos. The work is important and interesting to the field. However, my enthusiasm is partly limited by the correlative nature of the experiments and some missing analyses. My comments to the author are below, formatted as ways to improve the manuscript.</p><p>1. Extent of mis-regulation of germ layer-specific genes upon TSA and VPA expression. The authors provide volcano plots in Figure S5B, and differential gene expression analysis spatially within AC and VG in Figure 4F. They find that up-regulation of H3Kac peaks tends to occur for opposite lineage, ie. VG genes are misexpressed in AC. Further, that downregulated genes tend to be more lineage constrained. It would be helpful if they could also plot a smaller subset of the data for ectoderm and endoderm-specific gene lists.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a heatmap showing the germ layer specific gene expression changes upon HDAC inhibition by TSA and VPA (Figure S5E). Table S3 lists functions of these genes and their PubMed references.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Based on Figure 4F, one would expect that a large fraction of endoderm-specific genes would be inappropriately upregulated in the AC, and a large fraction of ectoderm-specific genes upregulated in the VG. To what extent is this true.</p></disp-quote><p>Figures 5F and S5F support the notion that a large fraction of endoderm-specific genes are inappropriately upregulated in the AC, whereas a large fraction of ectoderm-specific genes are upregulated in the VG upon HDAC inhibition.</p><p>To determine whether endodermal genes are preferentially upregulated in ectodermal cells upon TSA treatment (Figure 5F), we compared the following genomic data sets: (1) a list of genes preferentially expressed in ectodermal cells upon HDAC inhibition, (2) a list of endodermal genes based on dissected gastrula RNA-seq data (Blitz et al., 2017). We used Fisher’s exact test to determine genes are upregulated in ectodermal lineage cells upon HDAC inhibition.</p><p>The parameters to assign genes to spatial expression patterns is described in Materials and methods under Categorical Analyses. Genes associated with low expression levels (&lt;1 TPM) are categorized as not expressed (NE), genes whose coefficient of variation is less than 10% among the 3 germ layers are considered expression not localized (NL), genes expressed highest in animal caps (ectoderm) are classified as animal cap enriched genes (AC), genes expressed highest in marginal zone (mesoderm) explants are classified as marginal zone enriched genes (MZ), and genes expressed highest in vegetal mass (endoderm) explants are classified as vegetal mass enriched genes (VG). For instance, the expression level of foxi1 is 107 TPM in the animal cap, 10.6 TPM in the marginal zone, and 1.2 TPM in vegetal mass. Since Foxi1 expression is highest in AC, it is assigned as an animal cap enriched (AC) gene. This assignment is not perfect but practical.</p><p>We also examined whether the mis-regulation of the ectodermal genes in endoderm, or endodermal genes in ectoderm is statistically significant using Fisher’s exact test. For instance, the first bar in Figure 5F indicates that 6,170 genes among 28,850 annotated genes are endodermal genes (VG, colored in green), which is 21.4%. The second bar shows that 43 out of 92 genes upregulated after HDAC inhibition in ectoderm (AC) are endodermal genes (VG, green), which is 46.7%. Fisher’s exact test indicates that the difference is statistically significant (p-value &lt; 6.1e-8). Similar analysis showed that ectodermal genes are preferentially upregulated in the endoderm. We suggest that HDAC activity is required to safeguard the misactivation of “inappropriate” germ layer genes in each region of the embryo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I also think the authors should highlight and discuss that TSA treatment has a much more profound effect on gene expression dysregulation in the AC compared to the VG (Figure S5B). There are many more genes up and downregulated in the AC. This is quite a novel and interesting result. Can the authors comment on why?</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed HDAC inhibition analysis using two HDAC inhibitors, TSA and VPA, and noticed that TSA does induce many more genes in AC than VG cells when the data are compared to each other (Figure S5B). We speculate that this may be a TSA-specific effect because TSA is known to inhibit non-Class 1 HDACs. Therefore, we focused on the genes that are affected by both TSA and VPA. However, even with this analysis, we still found many more genes to be affected in AC than VG. Perhaps, this is due to the large-scale difference in timing of zygotic gene activation occurring earlier in AC than VG (Chen and Good, 2022, PMID: 36007528). Since this is largely a speculation, we simply report on the finding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Timing of HDAC1 binding to the genome. It is interesting that HDAC1 peaks are widespread in the genome by Stage 8, presumably during zygotic genome activation, and that these peaks largely strengthen over time into the early gastrula. This however begs the question of when HDAC1 begins to bind to the genome. Is it already bound in the egg, or upon fertilization, or are peaks only detectable starting around the time of genome activation? Given that the protein is present in the egg and throughout cleavage stages (Figure 1A), and that the authors propose FoxH1 and Sox3 may be contributing to recruitment, the manuscript would be strengthened by characterization of the time of recruitment.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed a time-course ChIP-qPCR analysis of selected regions, representing 9 identified Hdac1 bound regions, and 2 negative control regions. Figure 1G suggests that Hdac1 does not bind to the genome prior to st8 (ZGA).</p><p>We also note that the number of Hdac1 binding sites at st8 is low (n=1,340) compared to those of Foxh1 (Charney et al., 2017, n=28,611), Sox3 (Gentsch et al., 2019, n=8,368), Vegt (Paraiso et al., 2019, n=21,711), and Foxi2 (unpublished, n=13,158) at the same stage. Additionally, Hdac1 binding strength also seems to be weak (Figure 1F) at st8. Based on this evidence, we suggest that the timing of genomic engagement of Hdac1 differs from that of the maternal transcription factors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Differential role for HDAC1 and HDAC2 in lineage maintenance? The TSA treatment makes it difficult to disentangle specific subsets of genes modulated by promoter-proximal deacetylation. Can the authors contrast TSA vs. VPA inhibition experiments to identify peaks that could likely be attributed to HDAC2 rather than HDAC1, and perform GO analyses? Alternatively, can the authors provide direct binding data with ChIP-seq of HDAC2 in blastula and gastrula.</p></disp-quote><p>New Hdac2 ChIP-seq results are summarized in Figure S1E-H. Since we performed</p><p>Hdac2 ChIP-seq experiment once, the peak numbers of Hdac2 are greater than that of Hdac1, which underwent IDR analysis. Despite this, overall, Hdac2 binding is observed in the regions where Hdac1 binds. Importantly, Hdac2 binding is notably stronger around Hdac1-Hdac2 co-bound peaks than around Hdac2 lone peaks (Figure S1H). This finding is consistent with the previous findings that Hdac1 and Hdac2 can assemble into the same HDAC complexes (Seto and Yoshida, 2014, PMID: 24691964; Milazzo et al., 2020, PMID: 32429325).</p><p>We attempted Hdac1 MO knockdown (see Source Data), but were only able to reduce the Hdac1 protein level in st9 and st10.5 embryos, but not in st8 embryos, which is likely due to the timing of degradation of stores of maternally deposited Hdac1 protein (https://www.xenbase.org/entry/gene/geneExpressionChart.do?method=drawProtein&amp;g eneId=865283&amp;geneSymbol=hdac1.S&amp;addProteins=hdac1) in the early embryo. Therefore, we are unable to address the specificity difference between Hdac1 and 2 at present time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Direct evidence that HDAC1/2 binding contributes to gene expression regulation. The authors utilize inhibition of deacetylation (TSA) or HDAC1 specifically (VPA) to analyze changes to pan-H3K-acetylation and gene expression, regionally within the AC and VG. In general, I like this line of experiments, however, I wonder whether the TSA inhibition might be affecting other deacetylase enzymes, and what the effect would be of MO knockdown of the HDACs (or their recruitment via FoxH1, Sox3). Other groups have found that HAT-HDAC binding to promoters and enhancers does not always correlate to gene expression regulation. Extending this notion here, I worry that the authors may not be directly analyzing the downstream function of HDACs. Can the authors compare their differential expression data to existing gene profiling studies in embryos that have knockdown of FoxH1, Sox3, or HDAC1/2 to demonstrate similar profiles of dysregulation?</p></disp-quote><p>At present, Sox3 knockdown RNA-seq data is not available. Therefore, our analysis is focused on Foxh1 KD data. We compared the differentially expressed genes in Foxh1 knockdown and TSA-treated animal cap explants (Zhou et al., 2022, PMID: 35848281), and found that only a small subset of genes are co-regulated by Hdac1 (defined by TSA sensitive and Hdac1 genomic binding) and Foxh1. However, we found that Sox3 and Foxh1 double MO KD results on modest reduction (~2 to 3 fold on average) of Hdac1 binding (Figure 2F). Therefore, the recruitment of HDACs to individual genomic regions is likely to be complex, involving multiple maternal TFs. The result is not surprising as there could be multiple TFs that recruit Hdacs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>As a general reader, I do not know enough of the background knowledge in the field to know how novel the observations are, and it seems that most of these specific comparisons are made in the discussion, and it is not explicit what observations are really new, or whether the importance of the paper is in the documentation. The authors need to draw this out more clearly. Also, as a general reader without the ingrained knowledge of the activating or inhibitory functions of the different histone modifications, I initially found it impossible to hold onto the threads of the arguments but was able to do so by color coding the modification types as activating, inhibitory, or heterochromatin in the text. I would hope that modern journals might be able to use colored text to enable readers to read and evaluate the text more readily. Similarly, it is hard to hold on to the nature of different classes of response, so I suggest more descriptive names for the classes. Without these, the manuscript is very tough going for the general reader. Indeed, as a detailed examination of chromatin modification, it is inevitably dense. Again as a general reader, I would find it more useful to present the specific genes that convey the arguments in the main text and figures, so that there is something to get one's teeth into and move the venn diagrams and stacked bar graphs and violin plots, which I find uninformative for the specific arguments, but which are necessary for the generality of the claims, to the supplement. But these are suggestions to make the manuscript more accessible to the general reader. If the target audience is the specialized field of chromatin organization or detailed regulation of gene expression in developing animals (without going beyond inhibitor studies to the sequences responsible for the DNA recruitment or the enzymatic activity of the protein), then the paper would probably be more appropriate for a more focused journal. But if there are new insights that can be more clearly articulated, then the manuscript could be appropriate to eLife.</p></disp-quote><p>We have incorporated the suggested changes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major points, in no particular order.</p><p>1.

While mass spectrometry datasets (Peshkin et al., 2019; Nguyen et al., 2022) available in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> are quantitative, the data for each protein is relative abundance over developmental time points and doesn’t permit comparisons between the levels of different HADC proteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

At st9, SOX, POU, POU-SOX, and FOX motifs are highly enriched. ZIC (including a few KLF) and HOX motifs are also detected, but ranked below the top 100 enriched motifs. T-box (Eomes) motifs are captured below the top 200. At st10, FOX motifs are rare.</p><p>Instead, ZIC motifs (including ZIC, KLF, and SP) are highly enriched. SMAD, SOX and T-box (Eomes) are present within the top 150 enriched motifs. ETS, MAX, and NFY motifs are present below the top 200. The appearance of new motifs such as ZIC, Tbox, and ETS, and the disappearance of POU and FOX motifs at the later developmental stages is consistent with the model that different TFs dynamically recruit Hdac1 to the genome.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. &quot;Consistent with the overlapping binding of Ep300, Hdac1 peaks display a moderate level of H3K9ac (Cluster c and d), high levels of 164 H3K18ac (Cluster b, c, and d), H3K27ac (Cluster b, c, and d), and pan-H3 lysine acetylation (pan-H3Kac).&quot;</p><p>Why is this consistent (ref required?) is Ep300 always an activating signal?

Therefore, the presence of Ep300 is consistent with the presence of histone acetylation. In general, Ep300 is highly correlated with active enhancers, and so is histone acetylation (Heintzman et al., 2007, PMID: 17277777; Ong and Corces, 2011, PMID: 21358745).

For ease of reviewing, I color-coded the histone marks according to Wikipedia. It made the manuscript much easier to follow, though I am sure my simplistic green or red color code is too simple. The color coding of the figures in the manuscript is more nuanced, and presumably reflects some deeper understanding. It would be useful to share this with the reader. Otherwise, the activating (green) repressive (red), and heterochromatin (brown, blue? - what are these?) and the main text should also match an informative color coding, which should be trivial in these days of digital typesetting.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion.

Lysine 27 can be either acetylated or methylated, but cannot accommodate both modifications simultaneously on the same histone polypeptide. However, we found a cluster (cluster I) of regions marked with both modifications. For instance, Figure S3C shows that the surrounding regions of ectodermally expressed lhx5 (Houston and Wylie, 2003, PMID: 12736213) are marked with both active H3K27ac and repressive H3K27me3. Our hypothesis is that lhx5 is marked by active H3K27ac in the ectoderm cells, but lhx5 in endoderm cells is marked by repressive H3K27me3. This ensures that lhx5 is specifically expressed in ectoderm, but not in endoderm. This hypothesis is confirmed by the analysis of active pan-H3Kac data using dissected AC and VG explants (Figure S4.2F). CRMs of lhx5, kcdt15, and foxi1 are acetylated (pan-H3Kac) in AC tissue, but not in VG tissue. We also find foxa4, mixer, sox17a, vegt are acetylated in VG, but not in AC.

VPA has been shown to block the interaction between Sp1/Sp3 zinc finger TFs and Hdac1/2 (Davie 2003, PMID: 12840228), and to induce ubiquitin-mediated Hdac2 proteolytic degradation (Kramer et al., 2003, PMID: 12840003).

Cluster c associated genes are typically activated between 4-5 hpf.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2:</p><p>2B What are the enriched motifs in stage 8 and stage 10 specific peaks?</p></disp-quote><p>We now include a list of the top 50 motifs (ranked by p-value) found in stages 8, 9 and 10.5 (see the source data).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2C: How does the HDAC1 peak intensity look if you integrate the HDAC1 chip a-amanitin data in the map from 1C (in complement to S2B).</p></disp-quote><p>Pearson correlation analysis comparing Hdac1 peak intensity between uninjected control and a-amanitin injected embryo shows that there is no significant difference between these samples (Figure 2A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Charney et al. document binding of TF pre/post ZGA.</p><p>To support the ID that TF binding is associated with HDAC1 binding it would be important to check if stage-specific binding of HDAC1 is associated with stage-specific binding of TF.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure S2I shows heatmaps of the Hdac1 peaks at stage 8, 9 and 10.5 with Foxh1 and</p><p>Sox3 peaks.

Interference with maternal TFs would be needed to go beyond correlation. HDAC1 binding after foxh1MO (as in Charney et al) will indicate if HDAc1 binding depends on the presence of this maternal TF.</p></disp-quote><p>Here we provide two pieces of evidence that support the statement. First, inhibition of RNA pol II activity by a-amanitin proves that Hdac1 binding to the genome at blastula stage is independent of zygotic factors (Figure 2A, Figure S2A-C), and therefore its recruitment to the DNA must be instructed by factors supplied in the egg/embryo maternally. Based on this evidence alone, we think the current heading of this section is appropriate. Second, Hdac1 binding after Foxh1 and/or Sox3 MO injection is reduced in foxh1 and sox3 morphants (Figure 1F). The partial knockdown of Hdac1 recruitment in the absence of maternal Foxh1 and Sox3 is consistent with the model but additional TFs are likely involved in its genomic recruitment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3</p><p>&quot;moderate&quot; level of K9ac etc….moderate compared to what???

Are the signal anti-correlated in cluster I?</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding the deposition patterns and density of H3K27me3 and H3K27ac being different, we offer the following explanation. First, H3K27ac peaks are called using a NarrowPeak format, which identifies narrow sharp peaks resembling those of transcription factors. On the other hand, H3K27me3 marks are found using a BroadPeak format because methylation signal on H3K27 is generally broader (Zhou et al., 2011, PMID: 21116306). The difference in peak calling will impact both the peak position and the overall peak intensity of H3K27ac and H3K27me3. This may result in peaks that look different in the heatmap. However, when these regions are examined (Figure S3C), the overlapping regions are readily visible (see response below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>S3C K27ac and me do not seem to overlap much.

First, we observed that the change of pan-H3Kac is lower in randomized regions than that of Hdac1 peaks (Figure 4E, S4.3A). We next examined the levels of pan H3Kac across clusters (Figure S4.3E, S4.3F) as well as fold changes of pan-H3Kac after TSA treatment (Figure 4F, S4.3D). TSA affected Hdac1 bound regions more than randomized genomic regions in both cases. Based on these analyses, we conclude that TSA preferentially targets Hdac1-bound regions to alter the levels of pan-H3Kac.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4A/B</p><p>Can the author use a TSA control experiment where TSA is applied only prior to ZGA or only around ZGA??

What could be the reason for such a difference?</p></disp-quote><p>We are a bit confused with this question. If this referee refers to the intensity difference, yes he/she is correct to notice that. Consistently, the common cluster (cluster A) displayed a stronger H3K9ac and H3K27ac signal density than the germ layer specific clusters B and C. We also found that genes associated with cluster A are expressed significantly higher (p&lt; 2.2e-16) than genes associated with germ layer specific clusters B and C, shown in Figure S4.2C. This is consistent with the observation that histone acetylation levels generally positively correlate with gene expression levels. We briefly state this observation in the text (p 12, line 555). Perhaps, the genes belonging to cluster A have higher acetylation density because these genes need to be expressed at high levels. A scale bar is now added to Figure 4C. Alternatively, if the referee is asking why the AC and VG intensities, presumably in cluster A, are significantly weaker that in whole embryos, we do not know the reason why this is the case. Additionally, this is not a major point of this paper, and we prefer not to comment on this issue in the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4E FC I assume is FC TSA / control.</p></disp-quote><p>You are correct, and the heading of Fig4F is better labeled now.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig4E and S4G</p><p>Global increase in acetylation in embryos (4D) – immediate question whether acetylation on the genome disproportionately affects HDAC1 binding sites?</p><p>This is critical since the authors assume that TSA effect indeed reflects the effect on HDAC1 activity.

Compared to randomized genomic regions, Hdac1 all peaks displayed a much higher level of differences in pan-H3Kac, suggesting that TSA inhibition does not lead to a homogenous increase of histone acetylation level genome-wide; instead, it had a more profound effect at genomic regions bound by Hdac1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5</p><p>When excluding genes with maternal transcripts how many genes are left in each category?</p></disp-quote><p>We added the numbers of genes examined in both Figures 5B and 5C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How do sets of genes with the same epigenetic configuration but HDAC- compare (i.e genes that are K27me3/K27ac but without HDAC1?).</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question, but somewhat difficult to execute because a large number of genes bear multiple CRMs, of which each CRMs can have different epigenetic signatures. Therefore, we first excluded genes that have multiple CRMs bearing various epigenetic signatures (e.g., H3K27me3 and H3K27ac), and examined the expression of the remaining genes.

For example, are endodermally expressed genes preferentially upregulated in ectodermal lineage cells upon TSA treatment? To tackle this question, three components are needed: a list of genes classified as upregulated in ectodermal cells upon TSA treatment (Up in AC in Figure 5F), a list of genes expressed in endoderm (labeled as VG) in normal embryos (based on Blitz et al., 2017), a list of genes that are preferentially expressed in AC or VG (see the description of statistical treatment below).</p><p>The method of assigning genes to spatial expression patterns was published previously</p><p>(Paraiso et. al 2019; PMID: 31167141) and also described in Materials and methods- Categorical Analyses. Briefly, genes expressed less than 1 TPM are categorized as not expressed (NE), genes whose coefficient of variation is less than 10% among 3 germ layers are considered not locally expressed (NL), genes whose expression is highest in animal cap (ectoderm) explants are classified as animal cap enriched genes (AC), genes whose expression is highest in marginal zone (mesoderm) explants are classified as marginal zone enriched genes (MZ), and genes whose expression is highest in vegetal mass (endoderm) explants are classified as vegetal mass enriched genes (VG). For instance, the expression level of foxi1 is 107 TPM in the animal cap, 10.6 TPM in the marginal zone, and 1.2 TPM in vegetal mass. Hence, foxi1 is an animal cap enriched (AC) gene (and is in the salmon red area in Figure 5F). This assignment is not perfect, but practical as foxi1 is a known regulator for ectoderm specification (MatsuoTakasaki et al., 2005, PMID: 16079156; Mir et al., 2007, PMID: 17229765).</p><p>We applied Fisher’s exact test to examine the proportional significance between two groups of genes. For instance, the first bar (All genes) of Figure 5F shows among 28,850 annotated genes, 6,170 genes (VG, 21.4%) are endodermally expressed genes at this stage of development. The second bar shows among 155 genes that are upregulated after TSA treatment, 71 genes (VG, 45.8%) are endodermal specific genes (VG). Fisher’s exact test shows that the enrichment of endodermal gene upregulation in anima cap (ectodermal cells), that is 45.8% (test group), is statistically significant over that from all annotated genes (21.4%, reference group), resulting in a p-value of 1.32e11. We conclude that endodermal genes are preferentially upregulated in the animal cap cells upon HDAC inhibition, and the data is consistent with the view that HDAC activity is required to safeguard misactivation of spatially restricted genes.</p></body></sub-article></article>
