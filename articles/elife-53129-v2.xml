substantial innervation to the dentate gyrus (DG). It remains unknown how the SuM and DG coordinate their activities at the circuit level to regulate spatial memory. Additionally, SuM co-releases GABA and glutamate to the DG, but the relative role of GABA versus glutamate in regulating spatial memory remains unknown. Here we report that SuM-DG Ca<sup>2+</sup> activities are highly correlated during spatial memory retrieval as compared to the moderate correlation during memory encoding when mice are performing a location discrimination task. Supporting this evidence, we demonstrate that the activity of SuM neurons or SuM-DG projections is required for spatial memory retrieval. Furthermore, we show that SuM glutamate transmission is necessary for both spatial memory retrieval and highly-correlated SuM-DG activities during spatial memory retrieval. Our studies identify a long-range SuM-DG circuit linking two highly correlated subcortical regions to regulate spatial memory retrieval through SuM glutamate release.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>SuM-DG correlation</kwd><kwd>memory encoding</kwd><kwd>memory retrieval</kwd><kwd>calcium imaging</kwd><kwd>fiber photometry</kwd><kwd>SuM glutamate transmission</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH111773</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Quintanilla</surname><given-names>Luis</given-names></name><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>Juan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG058160</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>Juan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS104530</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>Juan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH122692</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>Juan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000957</institution-id><institution>Alzheimer's Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>Juan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Multi-fiber photometry recording and circuit-based manipulation in vivo identify a long-range SuM-DG circuit linking two highly correlated subcortical regions to regulate spatial memory retrieval through SuM glutamate transmission.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The hippocampus mediates certain forms of learning and memory, such as spatial information processing and pattern separation. The dentate gyrus (DG) is the first input region of the hippocampus, in which DG granule cells (GCs) receive major excitatory inputs from the entorhinal cortex (EC) and send excitatory outputs to CA3 through mossy fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bao and Song, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Knierim and Neunuebel, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Treves et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vivar and van Praag, 2013</xref>). GCs are the principal neurons in the DG that exhibit sparse firing, thus establishing sparse GC-CA3 connectivity to contribute to spatial information processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Knierim and Neunuebel, 2016</xref>). Besides the major cortical inputs from EC, the DG also receives inputs from subcortical regions, such as the medial <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/septum">septum</ext-link> and the supramammillary nucleus (SuM) of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/hypothalamus">hypothalamus</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Leranth and Hajszan, 2007</xref>). It has been well established that these subcortical regions play critical roles in regulating hippocampal <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/theta-rhythm">theta rhythm</ext-link>, which is widely known to be important for spatial information processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kocsis and Vertes, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pan and McNaughton, 2004</xref>). Therefore, it is critical to understand how the DG integrates synaptic inputs from the subcortical regions to modulate hippocampal-dependent learning and memory process.</p><p>In this study, we focus on the SuM inputs to the DG, based on the dense projections from SuM to DG GCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berger et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pedersen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Soussi et al., 2010</xref>). Both SuM and DG have been implicated in hippocampal-dependent spatial memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ito et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vertes, 2015</xref>), but how SuM and DG coordinate their activities during distinct stages of the memory process and ultimately regulate this process is unknown. In addition, the precise neural circuit that regulates the spatial memory process remains to be determined. Furthermore, recent studies demonstrated that SuM-DG axonal terminals co-release glutamate and GABA to the DG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hashimotodani et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Root et al., 2018</xref>). However, the relative role of GABA versus glutamate released from SuM neurons in regulating the spatial memory process remains to be established.</p><p>Here we applied an in vivo multi-fiber photometry system to simultaneously record the Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity from both the SuM and DG. We demonstrated that activities of SuM and DG neurons become significantly higher and correlated during the spatial memory retrieval than those during the spatial memory encoding in a hippocampal-dependent behavioral test. Furthermore, we employed circuit-based approaches and showed that the activity of both SuM neurons and SuM-DG projections are required for spatial memory retrieval. Finally, we used the viral-mediated genetic knockdown approach and showed that glutamate (but not GABA) release from SuM is necessary for both spatial memory retrieval and highly correlated SuM-DG Ca<sup>2+</sup> activities during spatial memory retrieval.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ca<sup>2+</sup> activities of SuM and DG are increased and highly correlated during spatial memory retrieval</title><p>While long-range anatomical connections enable multiregional interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bullmore and Sporns, 2009</xref>), such interactions must be dynamic to cope with changing behavioral demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ito et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, we sought to examine the inter-regional correlation between the SuM and the DG neuronal activity at baseline and during distinct phases of the spatial memory process. We first assessed whether neuronal activity in the SuM is functionally correlated with that in the DG at baseline. For this purpose, we simultaneously recorded spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics from SuM neurons and DG GCs labeled with CaMKII-GCaMP6f in freely moving mice using a customized in vivo fiber photometry recording system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Inoue et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Meng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Correlation analysis based on frequency spectrums showed that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> events from the SuM and DG neurons are correlated in the range of 0.1–0.5 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–I</xref>). Therefore, we extracted the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals from this frequency range, and found that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> events from these two brain regions were moderately correlated (R = 0.4, p&lt;0.001) at baseline when mice were placed at their home cages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Ca<sup>2+</sup> activities of the SuM and DG at home cage and during the spatial memory test.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental diagram of the DG and SuM calcium recording at the home cage.

During the NPR test, mice were familiarized with the relative locations of two objects (spatial memory encoding phase) followed by a test phase to identify an object placed in a novel location (spatial memory retrieval phase). Consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sawangjit et al., 2018</xref>), we found that during spatial memory encoding (familiarization phase), mice spent equal amount of time exploring both objects; while during spatial memory retrieval (test phase), mice spent significantly more time exploring the object associated with the new location than that associated with the old location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Interestingly, during memory encoding, when mice were investigating objects at their relative locations, Ca<sup>2+</sup> activities in the SuM and DG were moderately increased from the baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H–J</xref>) and were moderately correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>, R = 0.54, p = 0.01). Strikingly, during spatial memory retrieval when mice were trying to recall the objects/locations, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> activities in the SuM and DG were significantly increased from the baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L–N</xref>), and Ca<sup>2+</sup> events were highly correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1O</xref>, R = 0.92, p&lt;0.0001). Higher correlation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> activities between the SuM and DG during spatial memory retrieval appeared to be due to synchronized increase of SuM and DG activity, which was not observed during memory encoding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K,O</xref>). While Ca<sup>2+</sup> activities in the SuM and DG were increased during both spatial memory encoding and retrieval, they were significantly higher in both SuM and DG during memory retrieval than encoding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1P–Q</xref>).</p><p>To further explore whether increased correlation of the SuM and DG activity during spatial memory retrieval is unique to these two brain regions, we simultaneously recorded Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics from DG GCs and glutamatergic neurons in layer II of the lateral EC when mice were at their home cage or performing the NPR test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). EC is known to be highly involved in spatial memory and layer II neurons form synapses with DG GCs via the perforant pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Montchal et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Reagh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Roy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Valeeva et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, despite that EC and DG are highly connected anatomically, their Ca<sup>2+</sup> activities exhibit low correlation when mice were at their home cage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C–D</xref>, R = 0.22, p &gt; 0.05). Importantly, although both the DG and EC activities were increased during spatial memory retrieval in the NPR test, the correlation of their Ca<sup>2+</sup> activities was not significantly altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E–H</xref>, R = 0.21, p&gt;0.05). These results indicate that the high correlation of DG and EC activities may not be related to spatial memory retrieval.</p><p>Taken together, these data suggest that activities in the SuM and DG and the level of correlation between these subcortical regions are dependent on distinct phases of the spatial memory process. Specifically, activities of the SuM and DG become significantly higher and correlated during spatial memory retrieval than those during spatial memory encoding.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>SuM activity is required for regulating spatial memory retrieval</title><p>Having identified that the activities of both SuM neurons and DG GCs are increased during spatial memory retrieval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L–N</xref>), we next sought to address whether SuM activity is required for modulating the activity of DG GCs and spatial memory retrieval. It has been suggested that there are two distinct pathways from the SuM to DG with distinct neurotransmitter systems. One pathway originates from the lateral SuM (SuML) expressing markers for both GABA (Vgat: vesicular GABA transporter) and glutamate (Vglut2: vesicular glutamate transporter 2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pedersen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Soussi et al., 2010</xref>). The other pathway originates from the medial SuM (SuMM) mainly expressing VGLUT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vertes, 2015</xref>). In the current study, we mainly targeted SuML based on our rabies-based monosynaptic retrograde tracing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A-G</xref>). Specifically, our rabies tracing revealed that major inputs from SuM to DG GCs are located in the SuML (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A-E</xref>), and nearly 80% of DG-projecting SuML neurons are positive for GABA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F-G</xref>). By contrast, the input neurons labeled in the SuMM is sparse. These data support SuML inputs as the major inputs to DG GCs. Therefore, we specifically target SuML by injecting AAVs to the SuML using Vgat-Cre mice. By doing this, we are able to preferentially manipulate the activity of Vgat+/Vglut2+ neurons in the SuML. Supporting the retrograde tracing data, our anterograde tracing of SuML Vgat+ (SuML<sup>Vgat</sup>) neurons confirmed that SuML<sup>Vgat</sup> neurons send dense projections to the granule cell layer of the DG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1H-J</xref>).</p><p>To address the role of SuML neurons in regulating dentate GC activities, we took a chemogenetic approach by delivering AAVs expressing excitatory DREADDs (AAV-DIO-hM3Dq) or inhibitory DREADDs (AAV-DIO-hM4Di) to the SuML of Vgat-Cre mice to activate or inhibit the SuML<sup>Vgat</sup> neurons, respectively, through CNO administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Interestingly, we found that activation or inhibition of SuML<sup>Vgat</sup> neurons increases or decreases the density of c-Fos+ GCs, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–E</xref>). To validate the c-Fos data, we recorded Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics of DG GCs labeled with GCaMP6f upon chemogenetic activation of SuML neurons using in vivo fiber photometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Consistent with increased density of cFos+ GCs, we found increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in DG GCs upon chemogenetic activation of SuML neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G–I</xref>). These results suggest that the SuML<sup>Vgat</sup> activity is required for modulating GC activity through the excitatory glutamate component.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>SuM activity is required for spatial memory retrieval.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental scheme.

We took an optogenetic approach to precisely manipulate the activity of SuML<sup>Vgat</sup>-DG projections during spatial memory encoding or retrieval. First, we sought to address whether the SuML-DG circuit activity is sufficient to regulate spatial memory retrieval by delivering AAV-DIO-ChR2-mCherry to the SuML of Vgat-Cre mice to activate SuML<sup>Vgat</sup>-DG projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Our slice electrophysiology confirmed the efficacy of ChR2 expression in the SuML<sup>Vgat</sup>-DG projections for inducing monosynaptic responses in dentate GCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–G</xref>). Importantly, optogenetic activation of the SuML<sup>Vgat</sup>-DG projections induced both glutamatergic excitatory postsynaptic currents (oEPSCs, holding at −60 mV) and GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (oIPSCs, holding at +5 mV) in 70.6% of recorded cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–D</xref>). These data support the co-release of GABA and glutamate from SuML<sup>Vgat</sup> neurons to DG GCs. Interestingly, we found that the mean amplitude of oEPSCs is significantly higher than oIPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–F</xref>). In addition, 17.8% of recorded cells exhibited solo oEPSCs, and no recorded cells exhibited solo oIPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). These data support a dominant effect of glutamatergic transmission on GCs. Supporting this notion, we found a significant increase in the density of cFos+ GCs upon optogenetic activation of SuML<sup>Vgat</sup>-DG projections in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H–J</xref>). Furthermore, optogenetic activation of SuML<sup>Vgat</sup>-DG projections specifically during spatial memory encoding had no significant effects on the discrimination ratio of the mice in the NPR test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>).

First, the SuM sends dense projections to the DG, but how the SuM and DG coordinate their activities during distinct phases of the spatial memory process remains unknown. Using an in vivo multi-fiber photometry system to simultaneously record the Ca<sup>2+</sup> activities of both the SuM and DG, we provide the first evidence that activities of the SuM and DG become significantly higher and correlated during spatial memory retrieval than those during the encoding phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Such high-level interregional synchronization was not observed during spatial memory encoding, suggesting that interregional synchrony is highly dependent on distinct behavioral states. Importantly, selective knockdown of SuM glutamate transmission disrupts the correlation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> activities between the SuM and DG during spatial memory retrieval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Together, these findings suggest that synchronized SuML-DG activity maybe essential for spatial memory retrieval. Second, previous studies implicated a role for the SuM in spatial learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hashimotodani et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ito et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Root et al., 2018</xref>), but the precise neural circuits that regulate such hippocampal-dependent spatial behavior remains unknown. Using circuit-based chemogenetic and optogenetic approaches to specifically manipulate the activity of SuML neurons and SuML-DG projections, we identified that the activity of both SuML neurons and SuML<sup>Vgat</sup>-DG projections are required for spatial memory retrieval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Third, it has been well established that SuML neurons co-release GABA and glutamate to the DG, but the relative role of GABA versus glutamate transmission from SuML neurons in regulating spatial memory process remains to be determined. Using a genetic approach to selectively knockdown GABA or glutamate release from SuML neurons, we identified that SuML glutamate (but not GABA) release from SuML neurons plays a critical role in regulating spatial memory retrieval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Summary model of a long-range SuM-DG circuit linking two highly correlated subcortical regions to regulate spatial memory retrieval through SuM glutamate tranmission.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Correlation of the SuM and DG Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity is increased during spatial memory retrieval.

Moreover, the activities from both the SuML and DG increased significantly more during memory retrieval than those during memory encoding, as compared to the baseline activity. These results suggest that the combination of high SuML-DG synchrony and high activity in these brain regions maybe required to promote memory retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Frankland et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast to the significant increase in activity and correlation between the SuML and DG during spatial memory retrieval, the activity and correlation between the SuML and DG only slightly increased during spatial memory encoding. These results suggest that SuML and DG activity and correlation may play a relatively minor role in regulating memory encoding. Supporting this, our optogenetic experiments showed that the activity of the SuML<sup>Vgat</sup>-DG pathway during spatial memory retrieval (but not encoding) is both sufficient and necessary in regulating spatial memory performance during the NPR test. We speculate that other major inputs to DG maybe more heavily involved in regulating memory encoding. Indeed, the cholinergic inputs from the medial septum and diagonal band have been shown to be critical for spatial memory encoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barry et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hasselmo, 2006</xref>).</p><p>In our study, we observed that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> events from the SuML and DG neurons are highly correlated in the range of 0.1–0.5 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1H</xref>). It remains to be determined whether the slow 0.1–0.5 Hz Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity is associated with the hippocampal theta rhythm known to be critical for spatial learning and memory. This is mainly due to the technical limitations associated with currently available Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators that do not fully recapitulate the spiking patterns of the neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kwan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Looger et al., 2003</xref>). Ongoing efforts towards developing fast Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators that can recapitulate the actual firing pattern of neurons will allow the field to address the correlation of the power spectrum between Ca<sup>2+</sup> and electrical signals.</p><p>It was recently shown that optogenetic activation of SuML-DG projections excites dentate interneurons (IN), and both monosynaptic and polysynaptic GABAergic inputs have been identified in dentate GCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hashimotodani et al., 2018</xref>). Despite that GCs receive both GABAergic and glutamatergic inputs, we found that stimulation of SuML neurons or SuML<sup>Vgat</sup>-DG projections promotes memory retrieval. Furthermore, we demonstrated that inhibiting the activity of SuML neurons and SuML-DG projections or reducing glutamate release from SuML neurons leads to impaired spatial memory retrieval. These results suggest that monosynaptic SuML glutamatergic inputs to GCs play a dominant role in regulating memory retrieval processes. It is worth mentioning that our results are based on the NPR test during which encoding and retrieval phases are relatively short (5 min at each phase). It is possible that the monosynaptic SuML GABAergic inputs or polysynaptic SuML-IN mediated GABAergic inputs play a role in regulating long-term memory or other episodic memory processes, such as contextual memory.</p><p>Together, our findings provide novel information on a novel long-range circuit involving two highly synchronized subcortical brain regions in regulating distinct phases of the spatial memory process. Accumulating evidence has suggested that long-range anatomical connections enable multiregional interactions, and such interactions dynamically cope with changing behavioral demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ito et al., 2018</xref>). Neuronal correlation/synchrony has been thought to be critical for behavior-dependent functional coupling of neural circuits through spike-time coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ito et al., 2018</xref>). Supporting this view, Ito et al. recorded the local field potentials of SuM and CA1 and found a significant increase of SuM-CA1 coherence in the theta frequency band during the T-maze test, suggesting that the correlation of SuM and CA1 theta rhythm is increased during spatial memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ito et al., 2018</xref>). Aligning with this idea, our data suggest that highly synchronized SuM-DG activity is critical for spatial memory retrieval. A recent study showed that SuM inputs to DG GCs are weak, therefore, they are not sufficient to drive <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/action-potential">action potentials</ext-link> in GCs by themselves; instead, they can facilitate GC firing elicited by stimulating the perforant pathway (PP) projected from EC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hashimotodani et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, the SuM can potentially modulate the cortical inputs to the DG and influence DG information processing during the spatial memory process. The high SuM-DG synchrony may play a critical role in ensuring the spike-timing precision of the modulatory action of the SuM on PP-GC synapses during the spatial memory process. Ample studies have shown that aberrant neuronal synchronization is associated with Alzheimer’s disease, which may in part contribute to the cognitive deficits seen in this disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Palop and Mucke, 2016</xref>). It has been well established that EC and hippocampus are impaired during early AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Harris et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hyman et al., 1986</xref>), therefore, our findings may guide novel therapeutic strategies to treat AD-associated memory deficits by targeting SuM inputs to enhance SuM-DG synchrony and modulate EC inputs onto GCs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus, C57BL6/J</italic>)</td><td>Slc32a1<sup>tm2(cre)Lowl</sup>/J, (Bl6)</td><td>Jackson laboratory</td><td>JAX: 016962</td><td>All sexes used</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus, C57BL6/J</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Mouse: C57BL/6J</td><td valign="top">Jackson laboratory</td><td>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:000664">IMSR_JAX:000664</ext-link></td><td>All sexes used</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (adeno-associated virus)</td><td valign="top">AAV5-EF1α-FLEX-TVA-mCherry</td><td valign="top">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Dr. Ian R.

Mice were handled daily for five consecutive days for 5 min. From day 1 to day 3, mice were placed into an empty open field environment (45 cm × 45 cm × 45 cm constructed of grey PVC) for 5 min. After the habituation phase, the encoding phase of the memory task started on day 4. The encoding phases were identical for the novel position recognition (NPR) task and the novel object recognition (NOR) task and comprised a 5 min interval during which the mice were allowed to explore two identical objects in the open field. After the encoding phase, mice spent 6 hr to allow memory consolidation. To test retrieval in the NOR task, one of the two objects from the encoding phase was replaced by a novel object. To test retrieval in the NPR task, one of the two objects from the encoding phase was moved to a different location. At each test, mice had 5 min to explore the arena. Noise-generator provided a masking 40 dB background noise. Through the open upper side of the arena, the mouse could perceive distal cues. Objects for exploration were were glass cylinders or cube shaped wood (height: 4 cm; base diameter: 1.5 cm), and were stuck to the arena floor to prevent the mouse from moving them. Objects were positioned at least 5 cm equidistant from the walls and at least 25 cm between each other to ensure that corner perferences did not bias exploration times. The mice showed no preference for objects in the encoding phase and the locations of objects were randomized across mice during the encoding and retrieval phases.</p><p>For DREADD experiments, CNO at 1 mg/kg was i.p. injected 1 hr before retrieval tests. For optogenetic activation experiments, mice were connected to the optic cable for five mins habituation sessions for 3 days. A 10 Hz, 5 ms duration, 473 nm blue light stimulation paradigm was given for 5 min during the familiarization phase (spatial memory encoding) or test phases (spatial memory retrieval). For optogenetic inhibition experiments, 561 nm green light was continuously given for 5 min. All mice were only used once in each test. Laser power was adjusted to a final optical fiber output of 7 ~ 10 mW. Bilateral patch cables were connected to a rotary commutator (Doric) to avoid twisting. After each phase, the apparatus and objects were cleaned with water containing 70% ethanol to remove any scent from the previous animal.</p><p>Analysis of memory performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sawangjit et al., 2018</xref>). Exploration behavior was monitored by a video camera and manually analyzed by an experienced researcher blinded to mouse groups. Object exploration was considered whenever the mouse sniffed the object or touched the object while looking at it (when the distance between the nose and the object was less than 1 cm). Climbing onto the object (unless the mouse sniffed the object it had climbed on) did not qualify as exploration. For each task, times were converted into a discrimination ratio according to the general formula: (time at novel − time at old)/(time at old + time at novel), where ‘novel’ on the NOR task refers to the novel object and on the NPR task refers to the novel position object. A value of zero indicates no exploration preference, whereas a positive value indicates preferential exploration of the novel configuration, thus indicating memory of the familiar configuration. Any mouse that did not reach the criterion or did not explore the objects at all (explored both objects less than three times or did not explore one objects at all) was excluded from the analysis. Running speed was analyzed by EthoVision XT (Noldus, Netherlands).</p><p>Open field test (OFT) was used to evaluate locomotion after activation and inhibition of SuM neurons. The OFT apparatus was the same box used in the NPR test. Mice were gently placed in the center of the field 1 hr after CNO injection and the movement was recorded for 5 min with a video tracking system. The arena was cleaned with a 70% ethanol solution before and after each test. All behavior experiments were performed in a dim light room (~60 lux) with 40 dB background noise.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Fiber photometry system</title><p>The multi-fiber photometry system was used as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Luo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Meng et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, the system consisted of a 488 nm excitation laser, a fluorescence cube and a spectrometer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The 488 nm laser beams first launched into the fluorescence cube, then launched into the optical fibers. The GCaMP and tdTomato emission fluorescence collected from the fiber probe traveled back to the spectrometer. Only animals with strong GCaMP and tdTomato expression were included in the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Spectral data was acquired by OceanView software (Ocean Optics, Inc, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) at 10 Hz and was synchronized to a 20 Hz video recording system to acquire the animal behavior.</p><p>The in vivo recordings were carried out in an open-top home cage (21.6 × 17.8 × 12.7 cm) or in the open field, for the NPR in the 30 Lux red light environment. Laser power was adjusted to a final optical fiber output of 30 mW. Photometry data were exported to MATLAB R2014b for analysis. Coefficients of GCaMP6f and tdTomato were unmixed by a customized script by fitting spectrum signals to standard emission curves. GCaMP6f signals were normalized by tdTomato signals for motion correction. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The fluorescence bleaching was corrected by a 0.1 Hz high-pass filter. Photometry signals (∆F/F) were derived by calculating (F–F<sub>0</sub>)/F<sub>0</sub>, where F<sub>0</sub> is the median of the fluorescence signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). For the home cage analysis, we recorded data for 5 min per mouse and calculated the ∆F/F for further analyze the correlation of SuM and DG signals in raw data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Preprocessed GCaMP6 signal from SuM and DG were analyzed by Morlet wavelet with customized MATLAB scripts and segmented into frequency bands between 0.05–2 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F–H</xref>). We selected the correlation of SuM and DG signals in the low frequency spectrum 0.1–0.5 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I</xref>) because the main frequency band was at 0.1–0.5 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F–G</xref>). We also found the calcium activity of the SuM and DG to highly correlate at this frequency band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>) Correlation matrices across various frequencies were measured by Pearson's Linear Correlation Coefficient function ‘corr’ in MATLAB. To analyze GCaMP signals in NPR behaviors, we defined the exploration start time as 0 s (based on the video) and aligned ∆F/F to a ± 3 s window around the exploration point and further calculated GCaMP activity. GCaMP activity was further divided into a 2 s window for three periods as pre-exploring (−3 ~ −1 s), exploring (−1 ~ 1 s) and post-exploring (1 ~ 3 s) for cumulative activity analysis. Cumulative activity = ∆F/F × Time. Correlation of average SuM and DG activities in raw data was analyzed by Pearson's Linear Correlation Coefficient function ‘corr’ in MATLAB. To analyze the GCaMP signals in the DREADD experiments, the average of the top 20 peaks of ∆F/F during 5 min of baseline and 40 min after CNO treatment were calculated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Luo et al., 2018</xref>).

Brains were rapidly removed, and acute coronal slices (280 μm) containing the SuM or hippocampus were cut using a vibratome (VT1200, Leica, Germany).

Signals were filtered at 1 kHz and sampled at 10 kHz using the Digidata 1440A (Axon Instruments), data acquisition was performed using pClamp 10.3 (Axon Instruments). For circuit mapping experiments, patch-clamp recordings were made from granule cells in the dentate gyrus of the dorsal hippocampus using a Cs-based intracellular solution (containing in mM: 127.5 CH<sub>3</sub>O<sub>3</sub>SCs, 7.5 CsCl, 2.5 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.6 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 4 ATP-Na<sub>2</sub>, 0.4 GTP-Na<sub>3</sub>, 10 phosphocreatine-Na (pH 7.25, 290 mOsm). Under this condition, where the reversal potential of Cl<sup>-</sup> is nearly −60 mV, it is possible to detect outward GABAergic (at +5 mV) and inward glutamatergic currents (at −60 mV). Functional synaptic connectivity to SuM neurons was determined by optogenetic stimulation of CHR2<sup>+</sup> terminals in the DG brain sections. The 473 nm LED (Thorlabs, Canada), at 3–5 mWs, provided optical stimulation through the 40X objective. Light-evoked currents in granule cells were obtained by applying 5 ms, 10 Hz light pulses for 2 s every 20 s. Light-evoked postsynaptic current amplitudes were calculated at the peak of the first response after light pulses. Latencies were calculated as the delays from the onset of light pulses to the onset of oEPSCs or oIPSCs. To block GABAergic or glutamatergic components, 50 μM d-(−)−2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (d-APV), 10 μM 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (NBQX), or 20 μM bicuculline (BIC) were added to block NMDA, AMPA, and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, respectively. Chemicals were obtained from Sigma or Tocris. Series resistance (Rs) was monitored throughout all experiments and cells with Rs changes over 20% were discarded. To label the recorded cells, 0.2% biocytin was included in the recording pipette. After whole-cell recordings, slices were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 12 hr, then washed thoroughly with PBS.

The manuscript includes two major observations; 1) calcium signals measured by fiber photometry are correlated between SuM and DG in the range of frequency from 0.1 to 0.5 Hz during memory retrieval of object locations. 2) the manipulation of the SuM activity by the DREADDs, optogenetics, or shRNAs resulted in impairment of memory about object locations. Based on these observations, the authors conclude that glutamatergic inputs from SuM to DG are responsible for the correlated and elevated activity in DG, which supports retrieval of spatial memory.</p><p>All reviewers agreed that the methods are comprehensive and the main conclusions are well supported by the results and analyses in general. However, the reviewers raised several concerns and suggestions for further analyses and clarification to support the main conclusions. The essential revisions suggested by the reviewers are listed below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is imperative to include actual histological sections from DG and SUM showing the locations of the various probes (or AAV constructs) to verify locations in respective sites. For instance, in this regard, the authors are obviously aware that there are two populations of SUM neurons projecting to DG: GABA/GLUT fibers of the lateral SUM and only GLUT+ cells/fibers from the medial SUM (Soussi et al., 2010). Did they attempt to selectively activate (or inhibit) these two systems? If done selectively for the medial GLUT system, this could further support their claim of a SUM GLUT involvement in retrieval. In addition, it seems that some of their manipulations (e.g., DREADDs) could have differentially affected one or the other system and if more the medial than the lateral system, this could be the basis for the greater GLUT behavioral effect?</p><p>2) Although the DREADD-induced SUM activation or inhibition differentially affected the DG (c-fos labeled cells and other), this does not necessarily mean that this connection (SUM-DG) was responsible for the DREADD-induced behavioral effects they obtained on the NPR test. The SUM projects to other sites that could affect this behavior, notably to the medial septum and CA2 of the hippocampus. Similarly, optogenetic activation of SUM Vgat fibers obviously affects the DG – is this the only site, possibly also CA2? Also, the large differences in discrimination ratios with optogenetic stimulation for retrieval vs. encoding are not apparent when examining Figures 3K and L. These points should be clarified.</p><p>3) The SuM-DG synchrony at 0.1-0.5 Hz may be related to a particular behavior, as oscillatory activity in the brain largely depends on the animal's behavioral state, especially running speed in rodents (e.g. Omar and Mehta, 2012; Long et al., 2014). One possibility of the observed higher synchrony between SUM and DG may thus be due to lower running speed, for example, by spending more time to check the objects. The authors should thus examine if the animal's running speed affects the degree of synchrony.</p><p>4) While several manipulations of neural activity were performed by using DREADDs, optogenetics, and shRNAs, their influence on animals' behaviors is not investigated carefully, except for open field experiments in Figure 2–figure supplement 2. The authors should check if these manipulations affect the general activity of the animals during the NPR tests, such as running speed or time spent at each object as in Figure 1H.</p><p>5) Several analyses and statistics of fiber photometry experiments are not clearly described. For example, in Figure 1D, how were correlation coefficients calculated? Is this correlation of power or phase? (If this is a plot of phase-phase correlations, it cannot have high correlations between different frequencies.) In Figure 1E and F, only single R value and P value are described in the text, and it is not clear which statistical test was implemented, how many animals were used, and how correlation values were acquired from individual animals and trials.</p><p>6) It is not clear why the authors only measured &quot;peaks&quot; of ΔF/F for DG and SuM in Figure 2H. Couldn't the authors find any differences in average ΔF/F signals? Or does CNO influence only sporadic synchronous activity in the regions, which may be reflected as peaks? In a similar plot in Figure 6C, the authors instead plotted &quot;Calcium activity&quot; (not clear what this means), and the authors should provide the rationale of these plots. Also, as the authors claim the importance of correlative activity via direct SuM-DG projections, additional correlation analysis between SuM and DG signals would be necessary to exclude a possibility of indirect influence of SuM to DG. Furthermore, did the authors observe any time lag between the two signals from SUM and DG, which could suggest the direction of influence?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.53129.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is imperative to include actual histological sections from DG and SUM showing the locations of the various probes (or AAV constructs) to verify locations in respective sites.

Indeed, as the reviewer mentioned, it has been suggested that there are two distinct pathways from the SuM to DG with distinct neurotransmitter systems. One pathway originates from the lateral SuM (SuML) expressing markers for both GABA and glutamate(Pedersen et al., 2017; Soussi et al., 2010). The other pathway originates from the medial SuM (SuMM) mainly expressing VGLUT2 (Vertes, 2015). In the current study, we mainly targeted SuML based on our rabies-based monosynaptic retrograde tracing (Figure 2–figure supplement 1). Specifically, our rabies tracing revealed that major inputs from SuM to DG GCs are located in the SuML, and nearly 80% of DG-projecting SuML neurons are positive for GABA. By contrast, the input neurons labeled in the SuMM is sparse. These data support SuML inputs as the major inputs to DG GCs. Therefore, we specifically target SuML by injecting AAVs to the lateral SuM using VGAT-Cre mice. By doing this, we preferentially manipulated the activity of Vgat+ Vglut2+ neurons in the SuML and demonstrated that SuM glutamate transmission is necessary for spatial memory retrieval during the NPR test. We have included the images from both DG and SuM in multiple places throughout the manuscript (Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 6, Figure 2–figure supplement 1, Figure 2–figure supplement 3, Figure 3–figure supplement 1), as well as fiber placement in relation to those brain regions in Figure 1 and Figure 6. For scientific rigor and reproducibility, we have excluded the animals with off-target injection and fiber implantation from our analysis after post-hoc examination of the injection/implantation sites. To clarify our targeting of lateral SuM, we have modified the terms from &quot;SuM&quot; to &quot;SuML&quot; throughout the manuscript.</p><p>To further address whether SuMM neurons impact spatial memory retrieval, we attempted to selectively target SuMM neurons by injecting a reduced volume of AAV5-CaMKII-hM3Dq-mCherry (150 ÂµL) to SuMM (Figure 2–figure supplement 3A). As a result, we found that chemogenetic activation of SuMM neurons does not significantly increase the discrimination ratio in the NPR test (Figure 2–figure supplement 3C). These results indicate that SuML neurons, but not SuMM neurons, regulate spatial memory retrieval in the NPR test. We have modified the text accordingly to reflect this added component (subsection &quot;SuM activity is required for regulating spatial memory retrieval&quot;, last paragraph, and Figure 2–figure supplement 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Although the DREADD-induced SUM activation or inhibition differentially affected the DG (c-fos labeled cells and other), this does not necessarily mean that this connection (SUM-DG) was responsible for the DREADD-induced behavioral effects they obtained on the NPR test. The SUM projects to other sites that could affect this behavior, notably to the medial septum and CA2 of the hippocampus. Similarly, optogenetic activation of SUM Vgat fibers obviously affects the DG – is this the only site, possibly also CA2? Also, the large differences in discrimination ratios with optogenetic stimulation for retrieval vs. encoding are not apparent when examining Figures 3K and 3L. These points should be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that DREADD-mediated activation or inhibition of the SuM neurons does not necessarily mean that the SuM-DG projections are responsible for the behavioral effects. This is why we performed optogenetic experiment to specifically manipulate the SuM-DG projections (Figure 3). By doing so, we showed that optogenetic activation of SuM-DG projections during spatial memory retrieval is sufficient to improve memory performance during the NPR test. During revision, we added optogenetic inhibition experiment by inhibiting the activity of the SuM-DG projections to further support the requirement of SuM-DG pathway during memory retrieval (Figure 3M-N). Specifically, we found that optogenetic inhibition of SuM<sup>Vgat</sup>-DG projections during memory retrieval significantly decreased the discrimination ratio in the NPR test (Figure 3N). In contrast, optogenetic inhibition of SuM<sup>Vgat</sup>-DG projections during memory encoding did not alter the discrimination ratio (Figure 3M-N). Together with the results from optogenetic activation of the SuM<sup>Vgat</sup>-DG pathway, we provide bi-directional evidence that the activity of SuM<sup>Vgat</sup>-DG pathway during memory retrieval is both sufficient and necessary in regulating spatial memory retrieval during the NPR test. Please see the second paragraph of the subsection &quot;SuM-DG circuit activity is required for spatial memory retrieval (but not encoding)&quot; and Figure 3M-N for added data.</p><p>As the reviewer pointed out, our anterograde tracing also revealed SuM projections to other hippocampal structures, such as CA2 (Figure 2–figure supplement 1A-C). To address whether SuM-CA2 pathway is involved in spatial memory retrieval during the NPR test, we injected AAV5-DIO-ChR2 to the SuM in Vgat-Cre mice and bilaterally implanted optic fibers above CA2. As a result, we found that optogenetic activation of SuM<sup>Vgat</sup>-CA2 projection did not significantly alter the discrimination ratio in the NPR test (Figure 3–figure supplement 2), indicating that SuM<sup>Vgat</sup>-CA2 projections are not sufficient to regulate spatial memory retrieval during the NPR test. Please see the last paragraph of the aforementioned subsection and Figure 3–figure supplement 2 for added data.</p><p>To address the reviewer's comments on the discrimination ratio when the SuM-DG circuit was stimulated during spatial memory retrieval versus encoding, it is worth mentioning that Figure 3K and L are from two separate groups of mice with their own littermate controls with slightly different baselines. Our results showed that optogenetic activation of the SuM-DG pathway during spatial memory retrieval (but not encoding) is sufficient to improve memory performance (Figure 3K-L). Furthermore, we obtained additional support from optogenetic inhibition experiment, and demonstrated that the discrimination ratio is significantly reduced when the SuM-DG circuit is inhibited during spatial memory retrieval, as compared to that when the SuM-DG circuit is inhibited during spatial memory encoding (Figure 3M-N).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The SuM-DG synchrony at 0.1-0.5 Hz may be related to a particular behavior, as oscillatory activity in the brain largely depends on the animal's behavioral state, especially running speed in rodents (e.g. Omar and Mehta, 2012; Long et al., 2014). One possibility of the observed higher synchrony between SUM and DG may thus be due to lower running speed, for example, by spending more time to check the objects. The authors should thus examine if the animal's running speed affects the degree of synchrony.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point raised by the reviewer. We believe that the high correlation of the calcium activity between SuM and DG is not due to the low running speed based on the following evidence. (1) During both memory encoding and retrieval in the NPR test, mice exhibited very low running speed because they have to slow down or even stop in order to explore the objects, and this time point was assigned as &quot;0&quot; in the plots of Figure 1J and N. However, the correlation of the SuM and DG calcium activity was only slightly increased during the encoding phase (Figure 1J), while it significantly increased during the retrieval phase (Figure 1N), suggesting that the low running speed is independent of the high SuM-DG calcium correlation. (2) During memory retrieval, mice spent less time in exploring the object A (old location) than object B (new location). However, the correlation between the SuM and DG calcium activity was similar, thus suggesting that increased SuM-DG calcium correlation during memory retrieval is independent of the time mice spent in exploring the objects/locations. (3) An additional supporting evidence comes from the measurement of the correlation between the EC and DG calcium activity (Figure 1–figure supplement 2). In this experiment, we demonstrated that the correlation between the EC and DG calcium activity is significantly lower than that between the SuM and DG during spatial memory retrieval in the NPR test, suggesting that low running speed does not necessarily lead to the high correlation of two anatomically highly connected brain regions, such as EC and DG.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) While several manipulations of neural activity were performed by using DREADDs, optogenetics, and shRNAs, their influence on animals' behaviors is not investigated carefully, except for open field experiments in the Figure 2–figure supplement 2. The authors should check if these manipulations affect the general activity of the animals during the NPR tests, such as running speed or time spent at each object as in Figure 1H.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer on this point. As suggested by the reviewer, here we provide the measurements of the running speed from chemogenetic and optogenetic activation experiments (Figure 2—figure supplement 2E-H). Our results showed chemogenetic activation of SuML<sup>Vgat</sup> neurons or optogenetic activation of SuML<sup>Vgat</sup>-DG projections did not increase the average running speed of the mice in the NPR test. These results suggest that the general activity of the mice does not contribute to the increased discrimination ratio observed in the NPR test.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Several analyses and statistics of fiber photometry experiments are not clearly described. For example, in Figure 1D, how were correlation coefficients calculated? Is this correlation of power or phase? (If this is a plot of phase-phase correlations, it cannot have high correlations between different frequencies.) In Figure 1E and F, only single R value and P value are described in the text, and it is not clear which statistical test was implemented, how many animals were used, and how correlation values were acquired from individual animals and trials.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 1D, the heatmap matrix showed the power correlation of different frequency bands. Specifically, preprocessed GCaMP6f signals from SuM and DG were analyzed by Morlet wavelet with customized MATLAB scripts and segmented into frequency bands between 0.05-2 Hz. Frequency range were selected based on power spectral density (Figure 1–figure supplement 1E-H). Then, correlation matrix across various frequencies were measured by Pearson's Linear Correlation Coefficient function &quot;corr&quot; in MATLAB.</p><p>In Figure 1E and F, 10 mice were included. The correlation values (R) were acquired from the 5 min traces of SuM and DG calcium activities (ΔF/F). Same correlation function &quot;corr&quot; was applied and returned the correlation coefficient along with probability value testing two-tailed null hypothesis. In Figure 1E, both R and P value was from one single animal corresponding to the sample trace shown. In Figure 1F, correlation of SuM and DG were measured individually from 10 mice and described in mean value in the text. The P value represents the statistical significance of each R value. Combined P value was measured by Fisher's P-value in MATLAB.</p><p>The information mentioned above has been incorporated into the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) It is not clear why the authors only measured &quot;peaks&quot; of ΔF/F for DG and SuM in Figure 2H. Couldn't the authors find any differences in average ΔF/F signals? Or does CNO influence only sporadic synchronous activity in the regions, which may be reflected as peaks? In a similar plot in Figure 6C, the authors instead plotted &quot;Calcium activity&quot; (not clear what this means), and the authors should provide the rationale of these plots. Also, as the authors claim the importance of correlative activity via direct SuM-DG projections, additional correlation analysis between SuM and DG signals would be necessary to exclude a possibility of indirect influence of SuM to DG. Furthermore, did the authors observe any time lag between the two signals from SUM and DG, which could suggest the direction of influence?</p></disp-quote><p>The average ΔF/F signals were not significantly changed in 5-min home cage recording. The photometry signal (ΔF/F) was calculated from (F–F0)/F0, where F0 is the median of the fluorescence signal. There is no significant difference between different groups in averaged activity. Therefore, we adjusted the threshold for event detection to 3 x standard deviation (3SD), and only ΔF/F signals over the threshold are considered as &quot;neuronal activity&quot;. In Figure 6C, the &quot;calcium activity&quot; indicates &quot;neuronal activity (percentage of ΔF/F above threshold)&quot;. To clarify it, we have modified the label in Figure 6C.</p><p>We compared the calcium activity of mCherry control and hM3Dq mice by sorting the highest 20 peaks of 5-min ΔF/F traces recorded in the home cage and calculated mean ΔF/F of the 20 peaks as a dot in the Figure 2H and 2I. We found that after CNO activation of SuM neurons, the peaks of ΔF/F traces were increased in hM3Dq mice, indicating that the calcium activity was increased. These analyses are based on the method of our previous study (Luo et al., 2018) and are adapted from several previous publications (Beier et al., 2017; Calipari et al., 2016).</p><p>The time lag between SuM and DG was measured by cross correlation &quot;xcorr&quot; function in MATLAB (reviewer only Figure 2). Specifically, during the encoding phase, the SuM appears to respond to the object/location 0.5 seconds ahead of the DG. During the retrieval phase, the time lag between the SuM and DG is 0. These data are consistent with the Pearson's correlation in Figure 1L and P, thus supporting the leading role of SuM during memory encoding of the NPR test. However, it is worth mentioning the technical limitations in the current study. For fiber photometry recording, the acquisition rate of GCaMP6 signals by spectrometer was 10 Hz (Meng et al., 2018), which may miss some of the calcium events during the interval and underestimate the lag time. Future studies using in vivo multi-channel electrophysiological recording may help validate the lag time between these two brain regions.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>The time lag between the SuM and DG calcium activities.</title><p>(A) Scaled color plot of the SuM and DG calcium activity.
