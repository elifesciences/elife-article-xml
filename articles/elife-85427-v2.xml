operating both at home and in academia, can affect research productivity. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on research productivity has been the subject of a number of studies, including studies based on surveys and studies based on numbers of articles submitted to and/or published in journals. Here, we combine the results of 55 studies that compared the impact of the pandemic on the research productivity of men and women; 17 of the studies were based on surveys, 38 were based on article counts, and the total number of effect sizes was 130. We find that the gender gap in research productivity increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the largest changes occurring in the social sciences and medicine, and the changes in the biological sciences and TEMCP (technology, engineering, mathematics, chemistry and physics) being much smaller.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>meta-research</kwd><kwd>COVID-19 pandemic</kwd><kwd>women in science</kwd><kwd>gender disparity</kwd><kwd>research productivity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>No external funding was received for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A systematic review and meta-analysis of 55 articles about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on researchers confirms that the pandemic increased the gender gap in research productivity.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Template</meta-name><meta-value>5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Research productivity, defined as the number of manuscripts or publications, is a widely used, but flawed, metric for evaluating academic merit because it biases against individuals according to socio-demographic circumstances. Women are disadvantaged compared to men when success is measured using traditional metrics of research productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Astegiano et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Huang et al., 2020</xref>), despite no actual differences in contribution and impact of research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">van den Besselaar and Sandström, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">van den Besselaar and Sandström, 2017</xref>). Additionally, during the COVID-19 pandemic, novel living and working conditions worsened the research productivity of many women worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Anwer, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Boncori, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Guy and Arthur, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Herman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altan‐Olcay and Bergeron, 2022</xref>).</p><p>Multiple factors are likely to contribute to gendered changes in research productivity during a pandemic. First, women generally perform more unpaid caregiving and domestic work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Schiebinger et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Schiebinger and Gilmartin, 2010</xref>). Social-distancing and facility closures during the pandemic increased caregiving and domestic work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Carli, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Carlson et al., 2020</xref>) with reduced community help from nurseries, schools, care homes, house cleaners, laundrettes, nannies, babysitters and family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Myers et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Barber et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Breuning et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Deryugina et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Shalaby et al., 2021</xref>). As these tasks have disproportionately fallen on women, time and space for academic research during “work-from-home” conditions was difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdellatif and Gatto, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Boncori, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Guy and Arthur, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Second, the distribution of work within academic institutions is often gendered. Women undertake more ‘non-promotable’ tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Babcock et al., 2022</xref>) such as administrative, supportive and mentoring roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Porter, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Mitchell and Hesli, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Babcock et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Guarino and Borden, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">O’Meara et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">O’Meara et al., 2017b</xref>). Changes in teaching and administration in response to the pandemic were therefore more likely to be facilitated by women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Docka‐Filipek and Stone, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Minello et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Third, labour roles contributing towards publication are also gendered. Women generally perform more technical work such as generating data, whilst men assume more core tasks in conceptualisation, analysis, writing and publishing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Macaluso et al., 2016</xref>). Pandemic closures to research institutions would therefore likely impact women authorship from technical roles stronger than men. Additionally, the surge in publications during the pandemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Else, 2020</xref>) could have reduced the quality of peer review, with evaluation being more influenced by cognitive shortcuts. These shortcuts are often associated with biases tending to operate against women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kaatz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Reuben et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Carli, 2020</xref>) resulting in lower success getting submissions accepted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Fox and Paine, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Murray et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Day et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Hagan et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The role of these factors shaping the gender gap in research productivity during the pandemic might differ across research fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Madsen et al., 2022</xref>). One possibility is that research fields that were already more gender-disparate may have experienced the most exacerbated gender gaps during the pandemic. In fields that were already traditionally more gender-disparate, less support may have been available to women to balance the effects of the pandemic. Male-dominated fields often lack viewpoints of female colleagues, and might therefore be less likely to identify and support paid care work or extended leave options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Clark, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Nash and Churchill, 2020</xref>). An alternative possibility is that the pandemic might have eroded the support structures that existed in more gender balanced fields. The pandemic may also have exacerbated a gender gap in authorship position (first, middle or last) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">King and Frederickson, 2021</xref>) if additional service, teaching, caregiving, and domestic roles taken up by female academics during the pandemic may limit their abilities to perform research (as first authors) or lead research (as last authors) but not in supporting research (as middle authors).</p><p>Here, we quantitatively calculated by meta-analysis the mean effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the gender gap in research productivity and predicted the gap increased compared to the period just prior to the pandemic, such that male academic productivity saw even further increases. We assume that the pandemic might have influenced the multiple aspects that jointly affect gender inequality in research productivity, and our estimate reflects whether on average these effects have increased or decreased gender inequality.</p><p>First, as studies differ in the type of research productivity measured, between individual survey responses, numbers of submissions and numbers of publications, we investigated the influence this might have on the gender gap increase observed during the pandemic, but with no expectation of any differences.</p><p>Second, we explored variation in the gender gap increase across research fields and then explored the effect of research field according to the previous degree of gender disparity. We predicted the gender gap is exacerbated in fields that already had a previously greater gender gap, as according to the proportion of female authors, because of less support available to women to balance the effects of the pandemic.</p><p>Third, we explored whether the disparity in favourable authorship positions has increased. We predicted the gender gap has increased more in first and last, rather than middle authorship positions because female academics have been especially more limited in undertaking leading, but not supportive research roles in lockdown conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Our systematic literature review identified 55 studies that met the inclusion criteria (for details on the procedure please see the Methods section). All of the identified studies only compared women to men (see Limitations). We extracted and calculated 130 effect sizes from these studies and performed a meta-analysis and meta-regression to test our three hypotheses and related predictions. Out of 130 effect sizes, 23 are based on survey responses (survey studies), and 107 are studies that measure the number of submitted or published articles (article studies).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Has the pandemic increased the gender gap in research productivity?</title><p>Across the full dataset (N=130), after controlling for multiple effect sizes from the same study, we found the relative productivity of women to men decreased during the pandemic by –0.071 compared to before the pandemic (95% CI=−0.099 to −0.043, SE = 0.0144, p &lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This indicates that the relative productivity of women compared to men is 7% lower than what it was prior to the pandemic, meaning that in cases where men and women were estimated to be equally productive, the productivity of women now is only 93% that of men.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Overall effect of the pandemic on the gender gap in research productivity.</title><p>Orchard plot showing all 130 effect sizes (points), and the precision with which they were measured (point size).

These findings are consistent with the notion that novel social conditions induced by the pandemic have disadvantaged women in academia even more than before. Overall, the studies summarised in our meta-analysis suggest that gender gaps in research productivity within academia increased on average by 7% relative to the gender gaps that existed before the pandemic. We found no evidence of a publication bias in the studies investigating changes in the gender gap.</p><p>There is high heterogeneity in the effect sizes reported from different studies, arising from the type of research productivity measured. When measuring research productivity as the number of published or submitted articles, we find a slightly smaller increase in the gap of around 5%. This corresponds to the proportion of authors on submitted or published articles who are women declining from an average of 33.2% pre-pandemic to 31.4% during the pandemic (–0.05 * 33.2%=–1.7%). Such a change might reflect lower submission and acceptance rates of articles by women compared to their male colleagues or an increased drop-out of woman from academia caused by the pandemic. When measured by surveys, productivity reduction was 19% higher than in men. Future studies might therefore detect different effects of the pandemic on gender disparity in productivity, depending on the outcomes they assess and the timeframe over which these changes are analysed. As our data and analytical codes are open, and the literature on pandemic effects is increasing, we hope our work can form a first step in a living systematic review on the topic.</p><p>Our study likely underestimates the pandemic effect on article productivity in women because writing and publishing can take a long time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Powell, 2016</xref>). Many of the articles submitted or published during the pandemic were likely started and at least partially completed prior to the pandemic, given that most research grants span multiple years. Most of the studies in our sample obtained their data relatively soon after when the WHO officially declared a pandemic (median of 7 months after January 2020). With restricted access to laboratories, field sites and collaborators, many new projects have been delayed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Corbera et al., 2020</xref>). It is likely that the article studies we could include in our study underestimates the long-term effects of the pandemic, which might span over many years. However, the exact time dynamics are difficult to predict as adjustments and changes in conditions might lead to a normalising in production patterns over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Clark, 2023</xref>). In support of this view, we find some indication for a larger, real-time effect from the effect sizes based on survey responses, which indicate a much stronger negative effect of the pandemic on women’s productivity compared to men’s (effect size = –0.192). This signals that women are nearly one fifth more likely than men to indicate that the pandemic has negatively affected their academic activities, which may stem from a combination of women on average feeling a larger strain, and a larger proportion of women being severely affected by the pandemic. In the literature used within our meta-analysis, five of six survey studies report evidence of a negative interaction effect of being both female and a parent on research productivity during the pandemic, presumably because of increased caregiving demands.</p><p>Our analysis suggests the pandemic may have differentially impacted female researchers across research fields, with increases in gender gaps particularly visible in research fields that were nearest to being gender-equal before the pandemic. Social sciences and medicine were two fields closest to gender equality that experienced the most significant decrease in female authors. Female researchers working in fields with previously gender-equitable environments may have experienced new, difficult research conditions induced by the pandemic, whereas in gender-biased fields, these difficulties might already have been present. Alternatively, social sciences and medicine are fields that could have had the greatest surge in COVID-19 and pandemic-related research. Women in social sciences and medicine potentially had less opportunities to pursue this new pandemic-related research because of extra work performed in gender roles, or because women already had relatively smaller collaborative networks, fewer senior positions, and less funding. Additionally, many medical journals sped up the publication process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Horbach, 2020</xref>), so the real-time effect of the pandemic on research productivity in women versus men may be reflected more in papers submitted and published in medicine than in other fields.</p><p>We found that the pandemic increased the gender gap particularly among first authors, potentially suggesting that women were particularly more restricted in the time they had available to write papers. However, we cannot exclude that other authorship positions underwent a similar increase in the gender gap because the samples were uneven, with half of effect sizes focussed on first authorship roles. Additionally, not all fields have the same authorship order norms making comparisons difficult.</p><p>It seems unlikely that this change in the gender gap during the pandemic simply represents a normal temporal fluctuation. The survey results, which report the strongest effects, specifically focused on the influence of the pandemic above and beyond the pressures researchers might already normally experience. The 5% decline in the proportion of authors who are women also likely indicates the extraordinary circumstances of the pandemic. This decline is steep relative to a study comparing the change in the proportion of female authors between 1945 and 2005 that showed a steady increase from 14% of all authors being women to 35%, with no apparent year-on-year decline since at least 1990 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Huang et al., 2020</xref>). Other studies that explore mechanisms affecting gender equality during the pandemic may offer insight into the trend of reduced relative research productivity of women to men that we find in this study. These mechanisms are likely to be a combination of gender inequalities that affect all women during the pandemic such as changes in carer roles and financial stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Collins et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Fisher and Ryan, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Flor et al., 2022</xref>), and those specifically affecting women working in academia such as changes in the potential to start new projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Malisch et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Herman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Pereira, 2021</xref>) and changes in research topics and publication processes to cover new topics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Viglione, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Clark, 2023</xref>).</p><p>Our study has several limitations, which are fully outlined in the Limitations section of the methods and summarised here. Causes of the increased gender disparity in research productivity during the pandemic are not identified. Gender is investigated only as a binary variable, mostly using first-name prediction tools, with no investigation into non-binary or transgender. Geographic regions are not investigated, limiting generalisability as our samples are not equally representative of all geographic regions. All studies are to some extent unique by combined differences in sampling method and analyses performed. Survey studies may unintentionally sample respondents with extreme opinions and can suffer from recall limitations and self-serving bias. This diversity in approaches does however offer future studies the potential to investigate which specific mechanisms might have interacted to shape the overall increase in the gender gap we observe.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Overall, our study highlights exacerbated gender gaps in academic research productivity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the heterogeneity in our sample with regards to different outcome measures reflecting research productivity and different approaches to estimate effects, we overall find that most studies performed to date indicate that the gender gap in research productivity has increased during the pandemic. This finding suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic has likely influenced many of the processes that contribute to differences in the achieved research productivity of women compared to men. This gender gap was exacerbated more in social sciences and medicine, which are fields that were previously less gender-disparate and may represent regression in progress made towards gender equality.</p><p>Our study cannot speak to the potential mechanisms that might have led to changes in gender inequality during the pandemic and is therefore limited in deriving suggestions for potential interventions to potentially ameliorate unfair differential productivity besides indicating that such inequalities appear pervasive. Academic institutions should acknowledge and carefully accommodate the pandemic period when using research productivity to evaluate female academics for career progression in the coming years. For example, tenure-clock extensions designed to accommodate pandemic disruption may inadvertently exacerbate the gender gap by extending the period that advantaged individuals can outperform. More emphasis must be placed evaluating academic merit using more holistic measures and on an individual basis. We recommend future studies to investigate potential mechanisms of the increased gender gap in academic productivity, to continue monitoring the gendered disparity of academic productivity, and to investigate any long-term implications that can arise from reduced productivity of women.</p></sec><sec id="s5" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s5-1"><title>Search process</title><p>We carried out a systematic review to identify, select and critically evaluate relevant research through data collection and analysis. We reported it following PRISMA guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Moher et al., 2009</xref>). We carried out the literature search process in three steps: (1) a scoping search, (2) an initial search with pre-selected author terms, and (3) a refined search using terms as recommended by the litsearchR 1.0.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Grames et al., 2019</xref>). All searches were filtered for texts from 2020 onwards. We initially performed a scoping search to determine if there were over ten texts with primary research investigating differences by gender in academic productivity before and during the pandemic. The scoping search was conducted on 30/06/2021 by Google searching combinations of synonyms for: (1) the COVID-19 pandemic, (2) gender, (3) academia, (4) inequality and (5) productivity. The scoping search identified 21 original research publications with quantitative metrics investigating differences in academic productivity by gender before and during the pandemic (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, “Scoping search” sheet). Of these 21 studies (scoped texts), 14 were indexed by Web of Science, and 17 (including the same 14 from Web of Science) were indexed by Scopus.</p><p>Terms for the initial search were selected by scanning the title, abstract and keywords of scoped texts. We constructed an initial Boolean search string according to the PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome) framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Livoreil et al., 2017</xref>). Population was represented by “academia”, Intervention by “pandemic”, Comparator by “gender” and Outcome by “inequality” and “productivity” (see Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). A sixth concept group contained terms used to exclude irrelevant studies that did not investigate studies in hypothesis one. Terms within concept groups were connected by the Boolean OR operator, and the concept groups were connected by the AND or AND NOT operators, enabling searches for any combination that includes one term from each of the six concept groups. Terms in the initial search were selected by scanning the title, abstract and keywords of scoped texts. The initial search in Scopus generated 722 texts, including 13/17 (76.5%) of scoped texts indexed by Scopus.</p><p>To improve the 13/722 (1.8%) efficiency of finding scoped texts from our initial search, we imported all 722 texts into R and used litsearchR. Using litsearchR, potential key terms were extracted from the title, abstract and keywords of texts using the Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction algorithm. A ranked list of important terms was then created from building a key term co-occurrence network (see Table S2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Six high-strength terms within the key term co-occurrence matrix, describing research not relevant to our study, such as those of an epidemiological or experimental nature, were added to the AND NOT operator concept group to exclude texts mentioning these terms. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> describes terms of the refined Boolean search string and their respective concept groups. We performed the refined search on 27/07/2021 and generated 700 total texts combined from Scopus (126 texts, including 13/17 studies found in the scoping search), the Web of Science core collection (199 texts), EBSCO (276 texts and Proquest (99 texts)) from 2020 onwards. The final search hit rate had an efficiency of 10.3% (13/126) on Scopus. After removing duplicates, 580 texts remained to enter the study screening stage.

We included any text returned by the database, of any publication status, including grey literature in any language, though all texts had abstracts with an English version. To ensure repeatability of the screening process, we used Rayyan.ai (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Ouzzani et al., 2016</xref>) to blind the inclusion or exclusion of 420 randomly selected studies by two reviewers (KGLL and DL). The agreement rate between reviewers was 97%, with 49 studies that both authors agreed to include, 357 studies which both excluded, ten studies one reviewer included but the other excluded, and four studies only included by the other reviewer.

Full-text screening was conducted by recording which, if any of the four qualifiers were missing for each text in an excel spreadsheet and only performed by KGLL.

For 10 effect sizes which did not have data available to calculate our own effect sizes, we used already calculated percentage changes in the gender gap in academic productivity as predicted from lasso regression (N=2), Somers’ delta (N=2), ordered logistic regression (N=1) and mixed-effect models (N=5). For 120 effect sizes, we entered summary data (N=117) or simple statistical tests (N=3) into Campbell collaboration’s effect size calculator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Wilson, 2019</xref>) to calculate a standardised mean difference (d) effect size. For effect sizes calculated using summary data, 99 relied on the proportion of raw numbers of female and male authors before and after the pandemic, and 18 on the mean changes and standard deviations or standard errors in research productivity changes during the pandemic for female and male researchers. For effect sizes calculated from reported simple statistical tests, one converted the f-test statistic and sample size from a general linear model investigating the effect of gender on perceived work production, one converted the chi-square comparing proportions of female and male academics that experienced productivity changes due to the pandemic, and one converted the p-values from a t-test comparing mean changes in research time due to the pandemic. 10 effect sizes were calculated by obtaining raw numbers from graphs, estimated using Adobe Acrobat’s measure tool (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, “Calculations” sheet). Two effect sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Jemielniak et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Stenson et al., 2022</xref>) were calculated using sample sizes obtained by personal correspondence with the article authors. Six studies investigated numbers of articles at different time points during the course of the pandemic. From these studies, we calculated 30 effect sizes using numbers of articles across the entire pandemic period. We calculated multiple effect sizes from one study if they were referring to different research fields or authorship positions. We set the sign for effect sizes as negative if the pandemic had reduced relative research productivity of women (increased gender gap) and positive if the pandemic had increased the relative research productivity of women (reduced gender gap). A subset of 59 effect sizes were double-checked by A.C., A.M. and D.L and inconsistencies were discussed to ensure repeatability. K.L. then extracted the remaining 71 effect sizes.</p></sec><sec id="s5-5-2"><title>Variance</title><p>Of 10 effect sizes already calculated in the original studies, 7 provided variance as the standard error, which we squared to obtain the variance; and 3 provided the variance as 95% confidence intervals, which we divided by 1.96 and then squared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Nakagawa et al., 2022</xref>). For the other 120 effect sizes, variance was estimated in the Campbell collaboration calculator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Wilson, 2019</xref>) when calculating effect sizes.</p></sec><sec id="s5-5-3"><title>Research productivity measure</title><p>We first recorded whether the change in research productivity was measured from survey responses (survey studies, N=23 effect sizes) or from the number of articles submitted or published (article studies, N=107 effect sizes). Survey studies measured change in research productivity during the pandemic for each gender based on academics self-reporting their gender and change in general productivity (N=11 effect sizes), number of submissions (N=5 effect sizes), research time (N=4 effect sizes), number of projects (N=1 effect sizes), burn-out (N=1 effect sizes), or job loss (N=1 effect sizes). As 5 survey studies measured research productivity in the number of submissions, we included these studies in the articles submitted and published category. This resulted in 18 effect sizes from surveys measuring some aspect of research productivity, 64 effect sizes measuring numbers of article submissions, and 48 effect sizes measuring numbers of publications.</p></sec><sec id="s5-5-4"><title>Research field</title><p>For the article studies (N=107 effect sizes), we recorded the research field sampled based on the description in the original studies as either Medicine (N=44 effect sizes), Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, Chemistry and Physics (N=20 effect sizes), Social sciences (N=16 effect sizes), Biological sciences (N=17 effect sizes), or Multidisciplinary (N=10 effect sizes), following the classification scheme of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Astegiano et al., 2019</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s5-5-5"><title>Previous gender disparity</title><p>For the article studies with available data (N=99 effect sizes), we recorded the number of female and male authors before the pandemic, as defined by the time-period sampled in the respective study and use this ratio as a proxy for size of the previous gender disparity in that population sampled.</p></sec><sec id="s5-5-6"><title>Authorship position</title><p>For the article studies (N=107 effect sizes), we recorded whether first (N=54 effect sizes), middle (N=3 effect sizes), last (N=21 effect sizes), corresponding (N=15 effect sizes), or any (N=14 effect sizes) authorship positions were studied.

We used the ‘metafor’ package 3.0.2 to fit models, and build funnel and forest plots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Viechtbauer, 2010</xref>). We used ‘orchaRd’ 0.0.0.9000 to build orchard plots to visualise distribution of effect sizes (points) and their precision (point size), calculated as a function of standard error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Nakagawa et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>We fitted separate models for each prediction. All models included the identity of the article the effect size was extracted from as a random effect to control for dependency in effect sizes obtained from the same study. Models that include moderators use an omnibus test of parameters reported as a QM metric, which tests the null hypothesis that all moderator effect sizes are equal and is significant when at least two moderators are different. We tested prediction 1 a in a model investigating the overall effect size and we displayed this as an orchard plot. We then tested prediction 1b in a model investigating the method of measuring research productivity (survey responses, number of submissions and number of publications) as a moderator of effect size and displayed this as an orchard plot. We included the outlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Jemielniak et al., 2021</xref>) in the funnel plot of article studies because this effect size was obtained by personal correspondence clarifying the sample sizes used in the study, which we assume was verified. We tested prediction 2 a in a model investigating research field as a moderator of effect size for article studies in a model and displayed this as an orchard plot. We tested prediction 2b in a model investigating how previous gender disparity in research productivity before the pandemic, as measured by the proportion of female authors, influenced effect size and displayed this as a line graph, grouped by research field. To test prediction 3 a, we tested in a model authorship position as a moderator on effect size for publication studies. We tested for publication bias by performing a multilevel regression model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Nakagawa et al., 2022</xref>) which investigates whether small studies have large effect sizes, including research productivity measure as a moderator because of differences in sample size between article studies and survey studies. We display this relationship in funnel plots. We tested for total heterogeneity (<italic>I<sup>2</sup></italic>) using the ‘i2_ml’ function in ‘orchaRd’. We applied a sensitivity analysis testing prediction 1 a (overall pandemic effect on gender gap) and prediction 1b (method of research productivity effect on pandemic gender gap) excluding seven effect sizes using four measures of productivity from survey-based studies that are less directly comparable: research time (N=4), job-loss (N=1), burnout (N=1) and the number of projects (N=1). We also performed a leave-one-out analysis using the ‘leave1out’ function in ‘metafor’. This performed a meta-analysis on survey studies, leaving out exactly one study at a time to see the effect of individual studies on the overall estimate for survey studies. A full PRISMA checklist is found in Table S4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s5-7"><title>Limitations</title><p>Our focus is on comparing the effect of the pandemic on women relative to men. We recognize that gender extends beyond this comparison, and that biases are even more likely to target individuals whose identities are less represented and often ignored. These biases also reflect in a lack of studies of the full diversity of gender. While several of the surveys we include had the option for respondents to identify beyond the binary women/men, none of these studies report on these individuals, presumably because of the respective small samples. In addition, studies using numbers of submissions or publications (38 out of 55) to measure research productivity used automatic approaches that are more likely to mis-gender individuals as they inferred binary gender based on first names. While these approaches seemingly offer the potential to identify trends in larger samples, they themselves introduce and reinforce biases in relation to gender that are hard to assess, intersecting with biases in ethnicity as these approaches are often restricted to names common in English speaking countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Mihaljević et al., 2019</xref>). For survey studies, only 18 effect sizes were used. These had a large heterogeneity in effect sizes, possibly reflecting subtle differences in the measure of research productivity asked in the survey. Surveys sample limited numbers of respondents, potentially biased towards sampling those holding extreme opinions of the pandemic. Subjectivity in survey responses could skew the estimate because of recall limitations and self-serving bias. We do not include grey literature databases in our searches, which may bias our samples to studies with positive effects. We did not perform forwards or backwards searches, meaning we may have missed some relevant studies. However, we expect the literature on the topic to grow, and hope that further work will build on our study and add these new effect sizes to our dataset. Most studies explored academic populations worldwide (N=99 effect sizes), or from Western (N=28 effect sizes) regions, but not the Global South (N=3 effect sizes) limiting investigation of interaction effects between geographic regions. Although 22/130 effect sizes from 8/55 studies held data subdivided between geographic regions, we did not extract separate effect sizes as they differed in the scale of geographic region sampled, which limited our ability to make geographic comparisons. Conclusions from survey studies are also limited to North American and Western European, since 18/23 studies are exclusive to or have the majority of respondents from these regions. We recognise there are differences between article- studies in the length of time considered as before the pandemic (mean = 11 months, standard deviation = 10 months, range = 1–50 months) and during the pandemic (mean = 7 months, standard deviation = 5 months, range = 1–17 months). Survey studies were fielded at different times, (mean = 21/08/2020, standard deviation = 99 days, range = 20/04/2020 – 28/02/21) which potentially affects participants’ beliefs of productivity changes. Investigating research field and authorship position effects is limited by the unequal and sometimes small sample sizes of variables that are compared. We used raw data to calculate effect sizes using the same modelling techniques wherever possible. This was not possible in 10 studies, where we consequently used effect size as provided in the study. We recognize that their different modelling techniques may have contributed to the estimated effect sizes. The patterns we describe should be seen as a potential indication that biases exist, but alternative approaches are needed to speculate about potential underlying causes and remedies.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s6"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing

on the gender gap in research productivity within academia&quot; to <italic>eLife</italic> for consideration as a Feature Article. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a member of the <italic>eLife</italic> Features Team (Peter Rodgers). The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Emil Bargmann Madsen.</p><p>The reviewers and editors have discussed the reviews and we have drafted this decision letter to help you prepare a revised submission. The points that need to be addressed in a revised version are listed below. As you will see, there are quite a few points that need to be addressed.</p><p>Summary</p><p>This study provides fundamental evidence substantially advancing our understanding of the gender-specific impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on academic research productivity. However, there are a number of concerns that need to be addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions</p><p>1) I am concerned about the use of the included studies for a formal meta-analysis. Firstly, it is clear from the authors well-structured description in the methods section that many studies are not measuring the same outcome.</p><p>Many studies use number of submitted or published articles, which may be a fairly comparable metric, but many of the survey studies use very different measures of productivity:</p><p>a. Research time (N = 4), job-loss (N = 1), burnout (N = 1), and number of projects (N = 1).</p><p>b. These are highly different outcomes, and should not be analysed as comparable.</p><p>2) Secondly, it is not clear how the studies differ in their use of the pandemic as an &quot;intervention&quot;.</p><p>a. Some studies will ask respondents to compare their productivity before and after, while some studies will provide actual comparisons of productivity before and after. Both methods will have their share of drawbacks, but I do not think they are comparable.</p><p>b. The different survey studies will also have been fielded at different times, making the &quot;intervention&quot; (the pandemic) very different. Perhaps the loss of research time is most acute in the beginning, before academics have had time to adapt? Or later, because of burn-out?</p><p>3) Thirdly, the diversity of research design and modelling techniques makes it hard to conduct formal comparisons of effect estimates.</p><p>None of the included studies are randomised controlled experiments. In fact, the research design (and modelling techniques) differs immensely across included studies. Therefore:</p><p>a. We do not know to what degree individual, and thus by extension, individual gender gap estimates can be causally interpreted. This should be more explicitly acknowledged in the article.</p><p>b. Different estimates may be relatively closer to a causal effect, depending on the research design. By treating all designs equally, the authors gloss over these crucial differences in what we can gleam from each study.</p><p>c. It is not clear what &quot;estimand&quot; we get from the meta-analytical model. Some studies are cross-sectional, and will give us the average between-subject difference in productivity. Other studies, longitudinal ones, may give us the &quot;difference in differences&quot;, i.e. the average difference in within-subject publication productivity trend. These are fundamentally two different answers to the question: Has the pandemic exacerbated the gender gap in research?</p><p>d. The guidance from e.g. Cochrane is to use a random effects model to account for variation in what effect is estimated. The authors seem to use a random effects model to account for dependency between effects extracted, but I think they should also be more explicit in leveraging this for accounting for variation in what effect is estimated.</p><p>e. Each included paper will have different modelling strategies. E.g. the Myers et al. 2020 paper uses regularised regression (Lasso), while the Andersen et al. (2020) used a hierarchical logit model. These differences may contribute to differences in estimated gender gaps in ways we don't know or lead to overfitting.</p><p>When 49 % of variation is explained, simply, by the data employed (survey, publication, or submission, see p. 5 of manuscript), it makes me wonder how much is simply explained by differences in research design or modeling strategy.</p><p>4) Another concern is the conclusions drawn from the differences in meta-analytic effect drawn from figure 2. To me, the arguments of survey estimates being more &quot;true&quot; to the actual effect, because they are closer to the real-time events (p. 17) could easily be turned on its head.</p><p>Those estimates are also self-reported, and only a snapshot at one point.</p><p>a. People are bad at judging changes.</p><p>b. Productivity may have been severely hampered early on, when surveys were fielded, and then normalised over time.</p><p>c. Survey estimates are around 4.2 and 4.9 times larger than estimates from publication data (0.193/0.046) and submission data (0.193/0.039) (p. 7), but also has the smallest sample sizes (I think from looking at 1/SE in figure 2). Couldn't this easily be an effect of higher degrees of noise and lower power in this data?</p><p>d. Often, large-scale international surveys of researcher suffer from very low response rates and often mostly cover few countries (North American and Western Europe). At best, it makes it hard to generalise beyond these areas, and at worst this bias the results.</p><p>I appreciate a discussion of why survey estimates differ so much from publication- or submission-based studies, but this discussion is currently one-sided. The authors should consider if perhaps survey data suffers from other problems that could inflate estimates.</p><p>5) The authors seem to conflate gender inequality with gender bias throughout the paper (e.g. on line 55 or 281). In science studies, one would often denote a difference in outcome as a bias only if there is a provable mechanism of discrimination or differential treatment of women in e.g. journal accept rates, grant funding, etc. Instead, an indirect or structural difference could be a disparity or inequality brought on by other factors (e.g. women being disproportionally allotted more teaching load, domestic work, not being promoted to equal degree, etc.).</p><p>a. There is a great working paper by Traag and Waltman with a discussion of these, and I suggest the authors use some of their clarification (doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2207.13665).</p><p>b. I think this is important, not because I want to downplay potential bias, but because it matters for possible interventions. What we should do to ameliorate unfair differential productivity differs according to the causal mechanism at work.</p><p>6) How was &quot;before &quot; and &quot;during&quot; pandemic defined? – this is not specified in the inclusion criteria, nor in how the data was extracted.</p><p>Lines 456-457: unclear how you define &quot;before the pandemic&quot; and form where you get the data on the numbers. E.g., my first impression was that you analysed yourself all publications for a given discipline as your baseline. Please clarify.</p><p>7) Screening</p><p>– Study screening section: the inclusion criteria are too vague to be reproducible. It is also incomplete. Was publication status used to exclude evidence? How about publication language and full text availability? Was there a limitation on the geographical scope or targeted career stages for the included studies and was this information coded in any way?</p><p>– Line 360: why not all articles were double-screened to avoid errors? It would not add much work.</p><p>– Line 368 and 382: no details provided how full-text articles were screened, e.g., in terms of the used software, also it is not specified if they were double-screened.</p><p>– Table 1 header: first and only mention that articles were screened from 2020 only – this is a first mention on having such a limit on publication searches – this should be in the search strategy description.</p><p>– The authors should describe whether some quality weighting was used or quality assessment played a part in the inclusion criteria.</p><p>8) Data and meta-data</p><p>– Extracting variables section: please refer the reader to a proper meta-data SI file describing in detail all extracted variables, at a level that enables replication of the data extraction and fully informed data reuse (the &quot;meta-data&quot; file archived on Zenodo does not provide such information in sufficient detail and some of the variables in the provided raw data file are quite cryptic).</p><p>– A data file is needed including a list of articles at the full-text screening stage, with individual reasons for exclusion.</p><p>– A meta-data file is needed describing in detail all extracted variables, at a level that enables replication of the data extraction and fully informed data reuse (the &quot;meta-data&quot; file archived on Zenodo does not provide such information in sufficient detail and some of the variables in the provided raw data file are quite cryptic).</p><p>9) Lines 324-327: Only 17 out of 21 eligible articles were included in the extracted data set – what happened with the remaining 4? Why were they not included in the dataset? From the data files available on Zenodo I can see these were not published as journals articles, however inclusion criteria do not state that only grey literature should be excluded.</p><p>10) Line 339-352: The search string used had only 14/17 sensitivity (82%). However, the next step of search strategy refined did not improve the sensitivity and just removed some of the irrelevant studies to reduce the screening effort.</p><p>Given the limited sample size, and limited scope of the searches, it is of concern that a significant proportion of potentially available evidence has been missed (at least 20%). The main reason for using &quot;test set&quot; (benchmarking) articles is to improve search sensitivity, with search precision being less important. Since it is hard to get 100% sensitivity in database searches, additional search strategies should be used to locate potentially missed articles, for example by collecting and screening articles that were cited by or cited already included articles (after the main database searching and screening is completed). Also, grey literature should have been searched.</p><p>11) Lines 350-251: the recommended 10% hit rate should be calculated from pilot screening round not from how many &quot;test set&quot; articles have been captured by the search string.</p><p>12) Lines 411-413: regression models per se are not effect sizes, please specify which estimates from these models were used as effect sizes and how they were combined with other effect sizes.</p><p>13) Analyses section: no description of any sensitivity analyses (e.g., doing analyses leaving out outliers or leaving-one-study-out approach).</p><p>14) Limitations section: there are many potential limitations of this study that are not mentioned here. For example, limitations of the search conducted to find the evidence – not searching grey literature, no other additional searches, not searching in languages other than English. This potentially resulted in biased evidence as well as limited the sample size. Also, some statistical analyses are less reliable due to small numbers of effect sizes within some of the levels of categorical variables tested.</p><p>15) Table S4 item 20d: Figures 2, 3, 5 show meta-regression results testing secondary hypotheses. Those are not sensitivity analyses.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85427.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions</p><p>1) I am concerned about the use of the included studies for a formal meta-analysis.

We now mention the sensitivity analysis in the main text:</p><p>“Our results changed little when we conducted a sensitivity analysis that excluded seven effect sizes using four measures of productivity from survey-based studies that are less directly comparable: research time (N = 4), job-loss (N = 1), burnout (N = 1) and the number of projects (N = 1). When excluding these effect sizes, the overall estimate is -0.063, 95% CI = [-0.0892- -0.0372] , SE = 0.0133, p &lt; 0.001 and the estimate for survey studies only is -0.239, 95% CI = [-0.3419- -0.1352], SE = 0.0527, p &lt; 0.001.”</p><p>We include all the studies in the main analysis because although they are not directly the same as productivity output in terms of submissions and publications, they are relevant to an academic’s productivity and likely reflect the overall change in the gender bias in academic productivity that our article aims to assess.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Secondly, it is not clear how the studies differ in their use of the pandemic as an &quot;intervention&quot;.</p><p>a.

In addition, we recognize that none of our studies measure actual comparisons of individual-level productivity before and after the start of the pandemic. As we mention in the discussion, in the first submission, the findings of the studies comparing publication patterns:</p><p>“might reflect lower submission and acceptance rates of articles by women compared to their male colleagues or an increased drop-out of women from academia caused by the pandemic.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. The different survey studies will also have been fielded at different times, making the &quot;intervention&quot; (the pandemic) very different. Perhaps the loss of research time is most acute in the beginning, before academics have had time to adapt? Or later, because of burn-out?</p></disp-quote><p>We now include this point in the ‘Limitations’ section:</p><p>“We recognise there are differences between article studies in the length of time sampled before the pandemic (mean = 11 months, standard deviation = 10 months, range = 1-50 months) and during the pandemic (mean = 7 months, standard deviation = 5 months, range = 1-17 months). Survey studies were fielded at different times, (mean = 21/08/2020, standard deviation = 99 days, range = 20/04/2020 – 28/02/21) which potentially affects participants’ feelings of productivity changes.”</p><p>In addition, we mention in the discussion:</p><p>“It is likely that the article studies we could include in our study underestimates the long-term effects of the pandemic, which might span over many years.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Thirdly, the diversity of research design and modelling techniques makes it hard to conduct formal comparisons of effect estimates.</p></disp-quote><p>Diversity in research designs is common in most fields as there are generally no set of standards on how to conduct a certain type of a study. This is why there is commonly a very large difference in between study heterogeneity in effect sizes. However, a part of the heterogeneity will be explained by certain common features of the studies, and we have tried to capture these in our analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>None of the included studies are randomised controlled experiments. In fact, the research design (and modelling techniques) differs immensely across included studies. Therefore:</p><p>a. We do not know to what degree individual, and thus by extension, individual gender gap estimates can be causally interpreted. This should be more explicitly acknowledged in the article.</p></disp-quote><p>We now include the following sentence in the ‘Limitations’ of the ‘Methods’:</p><p>“The patterns we describe should be seen as a potential indication that biases exist, but alternative approaches are needed to speculate about potential underlying causes and remedies.”</p><p>Our finding that the gender gap has increased in academic productivity, is contextualised around evidence in other studies that the pandemic has enhanced gendered work roles and disadvantaging women. We start the final paragraph of the discussion with:</p><p>“Our study has several limitations, which are outlined in the Limitations of the methods and summarised here. Causes of the increased gender disparity in research productivity during the pandemic are not identified.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. Different estimates may be relatively closer to a causal effect, depending on the research design. By treating all designs equally, the authors gloss over these crucial differences in what we can gleam from each study.</p></disp-quote><p>Unlike medical meta-analyses, our approach does not assume that there is one causal effect that is being estimated by all studies. Rather, we assume that there can be multiple effects that all shape the gender inequality in academic productivity. Our question is to assess whether overall, these effects have changed during the pandemic such that also the gender inequality has either generally increased or decreased. The summary statements we provide reflect the average effect rather than our estimate of the true effect. We now clarify this in the introduction:</p><p>“We assume that the pandemic might have influenced the multiple aspects that jointly affect gender inequality in research productivity, and our estimate reflects whether on average these effects have increased or decreased gender inequality.”</p><p>and in the discussion:</p><p>“Future studies might therefore detect different effects of the pandemic on gender disparity in productivity, depending on the outcomes they assess and the time-frame over which these changes are analysed.”</p><p>and:</p><p>“Despite the heterogeneity in our sample, with regards to different outcome measures reflecting research productivity and different approaches to estimate effects, we overall find that the majority of studies performed to date indicate that the gender gap in research productivity has increased during the pandemic. This finding suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic has likely influenced many of the processes that contribute to differences in the achieved research productivity of women compared to men.”</p><p>The most fundamental difference in research design of studies is between studies that assess productivity by numbers of male and female authors before and during the pandemic, and those that use surveys to assess productivity differences of individuals. We separate these studies in prediction 1b and Figure 2, and then subsequently only use measures of numbers of submissions and publications in downstream analyses investigating effects of research field, size of previous gender gap and authorship position. Finally, while Risk of Bias is commonly a part of meta-analysis in medicine, and sometimes in environmental evidence, it is almost never done in other fields. While we agree that this is an important component of meta-analysis, unfortunately there are no Risk of Bias standards or tools for the kind of studies we have used.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. It is not clear what &quot;estimand&quot; we get from the meta-analytical model. Some studies are cross-sectional, and will give us the average between-subject difference in productivity. Other studies, longitudinal ones, may give us the &quot;difference in differences&quot;, i.e. the average difference in within-subject publication productivity trend. These are fundamentally two different answers to the question: Has the pandemic exacerbated the gender gap in research?</p></disp-quote><p>We referred to the difference between cross-sectional and longitudinal studies in our discussion, acknowledging that for cross-sectional studies selective disappearance may occur:</p><p>“Such a change might reflect lower submission and acceptance rates of articles by women compared to their male colleagues or an increased drop-out of women from academia caused by the pandemic.”</p><p>All the included studies investigating productivity before and during the pandemic were cross-sectional. The ‘publishing’ studies aggregate data across individuals, and the surveys were only conducted at a single time point, asking people whether they thought the pandemic had affected their productivity. We also clarify in the ‘Extracting variables’ sub-section on ‘Effect sizes’ that:</p><p>“Six studies investigated numbers of articles at different time points during the course of the pandemic. From these studies, we calculated 30 effect sizes using numbers of articles across the entire pandemic period.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d. The guidance from e.g. Cochrane is to use a random effects model to account for variation in what effect is estimated. The authors seem to use a random effects model to account for dependency between effects extracted, but I think they should also be more explicit in leveraging this for accounting for variation in what effect is estimated.</p></disp-quote><p>We are limited in using such an approach, because, as also pointed out by the reviewers, given the diverse factors shaping academic productivity we can only estimate the potential average effect of the pandemic on gender biases in research productivity rather than one true effect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e. Each included paper will have different modelling strategies. E.g. the Myers et al. 2020 paper uses regularised regression (Lasso), while the Andersen et al. (2020) used a hierarchical logit model. These differences may contribute to differences in estimated gender gaps in ways we don't know or lead to overfitting.</p><p>When 49 % of variation is explained, simply, by the data employed (survey, publication, or submission, see p. 5 of manuscript), it makes me wonder how much is simply explained by differences in research design or modeling strategy.</p></disp-quote><p>We include the following in the ‘Limitations’ sections of the ‘Methods’:</p><p>“We used raw data to calculate effect sizes using the same modelling techniques wherever possible. This was not possible in 10 studies, where we consequently used effect size as provided in the study. We recognize that their different modelling techniques may have contributed to the estimated effect sizes.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Another concern is the conclusions drawn from the differences in meta-analytic effect drawn from figure 2. To me, the arguments of survey estimates being more &quot;true&quot; to the actual effect, because they are closer to the real-time events (p. 17) could easily be turned on its head.</p><p>Those estimates are also self-reported, and only a snapshot at one point.</p><p>a. People are bad at judging changes.</p></disp-quote><p>We include the following at the end of the second paragraph of the Discussion:</p><p>“As with any survey study, survey data are prone to subjectivity and suffer from limited numbers of respondents sampled which may influence the overall estimate.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. Productivity may have been severely hampered early on, when surveys were fielded, and then normalised over time.</p></disp-quote><p>In our data, surveys were not fielded earlier (or later) compared to when the data collection for the publication studies occurred (both occurred at a median of 6-7 months into the pandemic). In addition, the reports we had found mostly indicated that research projects take longer between conception and final publication than the duration of the pandemic, suggesting that the effect of the pandemic on publication rates might persist for extended periods of time. However, the patterns over time are indeed difficult to predict, and we have therefore amended our statement in the discussion:</p><p>“It is likely that the article studies we could include in our study underestimate the long-term effects of the pandemic, which might span over many years.. However, the exact time dynamics are difficult to predict as adjustments and changes in conditions might lead to a normalising in production patterns over time (Clark 2023).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. Survey estimates are around 4.2 and 4.9 times larger than estimates from publication data (0.193/0.046) and submission data (0.193/0.039) (p. 7), but also has the smallest sample sizes (I think from looking at 1/SE in figure 2). Couldn't this easily be an effect of higher degrees of noise and lower power in this data?</p></disp-quote><p>We include a leave-one-out sensitivity analysis for survey studies only. We did not detect evidence of publication bias that might have substantially shifted the values up, but with the small sample there could be relatively high uncertainty around the mean effect estimate of the survey studies. The results of this are described:</p><p>“Overly large effect sizes did not change the results in a leave-one-out analysis, which repeatedly fitted the overall model as in prediction 1a, but for survey studies only, leaving out one effect size at a time to see the effect on the overall survey-study estimate (Figure S2). Leaving out the most influential effect size, the overall estimate was -0.183, 95% CI = [-0.270 - -0.096] , SE = 0.045, p &lt; 0.001.”</p><p>and methods outlined:</p><p>“We also performed a leave-one-out analysis using the ‘leave1out’ function in ‘metafor’. This was a meta-analysis on survey studies, leaving out exactly one study at a time to see the effect of individual studies on the overall survey-study estimate.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d. Often, large-scale international surveys of researcher suffer from very low response rates and often mostly cover few countries (North American and Western Europe). At best, it makes it hard to generalise beyond these areas, and at worst this bias the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We include the following in the ‘Limitations’ section of the ‘Methods’:</p><p>“Conclusions from survey studies are also limited to North American and Western European, since 18/23 studies are exclusive to or dominated by respondents from these regions.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I appreciate a discussion of why survey estimates differ so much from publication- or submission-based studies, but this discussion is currently one-sided. The authors should consider if perhaps survey data suffers from other problems that could inflate estimates.</p></disp-quote><p>We have balanced the discussion for survey data following Comment 4 as in the preceding comments and corresponding author action/responses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors seem to conflate gender inequality with gender bias throughout the paper (e.g. on line 55 or 281). In science studies, one would often denote a difference in outcome as a bias only if there is a provable mechanism of discrimination or differential treatment of women in e.g. journal accept rates, grant funding, etc. Instead, an indirect or structural difference could be a disparity or inequality brought on by other factors (e.g. women being disproportionally allotted more teaching load, domestic work, not being promoted to equal degree, etc.).</p><p>a. There is a great working paper by Traag and Waltman with a discussion of these, and I suggest the authors use some of their clarification (doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2207.13665).</p></disp-quote><p>We have revisited where we express “bias” and now avoid use of the word unless in context of mechanisms at play.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. I think this is important, not because I want to downplay potential bias, but because it matters for possible interventions. What we should do to ameliorate unfair differential productivity differs according to the causal mechanism at work.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a sentence to our ‘Conclusions’:</p><p>“Our study cannot speak to the potential mechanisms that might have led to changes in gender inequality during the pandemic and is therefore limited in deriving suggestions for potential interventions to potentially ameliorate unfair differential productivity besides indicating that such inequalities appear pervasive.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) How was &quot;before &quot; and &quot;during&quot; pandemic defined? – this is not specified in the inclusion criteria, nor in how the data was extracted.</p><p>Lines 456-457: unclear how you define &quot;before the pandemic&quot; and form where you get the data on the numbers. E.g., my first impression was that you analysed yourself all publications for a given discipline as your baseline. Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>We specify in the ‘Methods’ for inclusion criteria for the full-text screen that time periods for before and after the pandemic are chosen according to the authors’ discretion:</p><p>“Full texts were then screened to identify articles that had included four qualifiers: (1) both genders, (2) some quantifiable metric of academic productivity measured, and (3) compared a time period before the pandemic with a time period during the pandemic (time periods chosen according to the authors’ discretion), (4) primary data.”</p><p>We remind readers of this in the ‘Methods’:</p><p>“Effect size: We extracted values needed to calculate 130 effect sizes from 55 articles investigating the effect of the pandemic on academic research productivity of both genders, comparing the productivity before and during the pandemic, using time periods chosen according to authors’ discretion”</p><p>and:</p><p>“Previous gender disparity: For the article studies with available data (N=99 effect sizes), we recorded the number of female and male authors before the pandemic, as defined by the time-period sampled in the respective study and use this ratio as a proxy for size of the previous gender disparity in that population sampled.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Screening</p><p>– Study screening section: the inclusion criteria are too vague to be reproducible.

Conclusions from survey studies are also limited to North American and Western European, since 18/23 studies are exclusive to, or have the majority of respondents from these regions. Additionally, we recognise there are differences between article studies in the length of time considered as before the pandemic (mean = 11 months, standard deviation = 10 months, range = 1-50 months) and during the pandemic (mean = 6.6 months, standard deviation = 5 months, range = 1-17 months).

Since it is hard to get 100% sensitivity in database searches, additional search strategies should be used to locate potentially missed articles, for example by collecting and screening articles that were cited by or cited already included articles (after the main database searching and screening is completed).

Additionally, given the research topic is so new, we will consistently be finding new articles if we performed backwards and forwards searches and so we chose to not perform these.

For example, limitations of the search conducted to find the evidence – not searching grey literature, no other additional searches, not searching in languages other than English. This potentially resulted in biased evidence as well as limited the sample size. Also, some statistical analyses are less reliable due to small numbers of effect sizes within some of the levels of categorical variables tested.</p></disp-quote><p>We have considerably expanded our ‘Limitations’ section in the ‘Methods’, including all the examples given by the reviewer:</p><p>“Our focus is on comparing the effect of the pandemic on women relative to men. We recognize that gender extends beyond this comparison, and that biases are even more likely to target individuals whose identities are less represented and often ignored. These biases also reflect in a lack of studies of the full diversity of gender. While several of the surveys we include had the option for respondents to identify beyond the binary women/men, none of these studies report on these individuals, presumably because of the respective small samples. In addition, all studies using numbers of submissions or publications (38 out of 55) to measure research productivity used automatic approaches that are more likely to mis-gender individuals as they inferred binary gender based on first names. While these approaches seemingly offer the potential to identify trends in larger samples, they themselves introduce and reinforce biases in relation to gender that are hard to assess, intersecting with biases in ethnicity as these approaches are often restricted to names common in English speaking countries (Mihaljević et al., 2019). We do not include grey literature databases in our searches, which may bias our samples to studies with positive effects. We did not perform forwards or backwards searches, meaning we may have missed some relevant studies. However, we expect the literature on the topic to grow, and hope that further work will build on our study and add these new effect sizes to our dataset. Most studies explored academic populations worldwide (N = 99 effect sizes), or from Western (N = 28 effect sizes), regions, but not the Global South (N = 3 effect sizes), limiting investigation of interaction effects between geographic regions. Although 22/130 effect sizes from 8/55 studies held data subdivided between geographic regions, we did not extract separate effect sizes as they differed in the scale of geographic region sampled, which limited our ability to make geographic comparisons. Conclusions from survey studies are also limited to North American and Western European, since 18/23 studies are exclusive to or have the majority of respondents from these regions. We recognise there are differences between article studies in the length of time considered as before the pandemic (mean = 11 months, standard deviation = 10 months, range = 1-50 months) and during the pandemic (mean = 7 months, standard deviation = 5 months, range = 1-17 months). Survey studies were fielded at different times, (mean = 21/08/2020, standard deviation = 99 days, range = 20/04/2020 – 28/02/21) which potentially affects participants’ beliefs of productivity changes. Investigating research field and authorship position effects is limited by the unequal and sometimes small sample sizes of variables that are compared. We use 10 studies that provide effect sizes without raw data available to calculate our own effect size and recognise their differing modelling techniques may contribute to the estimated effect sizes. The patterns we describe should be seen as a potential indication that biases exist, but alternative approaches are needed to speculate about potential underlying causes and remedies.”</p><p>We also close the ‘Discussion’ with a summary of limitations:</p><p>“Our study has several limitations, which are outlined in the Limitations section of the methods and summarised here. Causes of the increased gender disparity in research productivity during the pandemic are not identified. Gender is investigated only as a binary variable, mostly using first-name prediction tools, with no investigation into non-binary or transgender. Geographic regions are not investigated, limiting generalisability as our samples are not equally representative of all geographic regions. All studies are to some extent unique by combined differences in sampling method and analyses performed.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) Table S4 item 20d: Figures 2, 3, 5 show meta-regression results testing secondary hypotheses.
