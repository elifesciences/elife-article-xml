If not properly treated these infections cause complications and exacerbate antimicrobial resistance. Catheter use elicits bladder inflammation, releasing host serum proteins, including fibrinogen (Fg), into the bladder, which deposit on the urinary catheter. <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> uses Fg as a scaffold to bind and persist in the bladder despite antibiotic treatments. Inhibition of Fg–pathogen interaction significantly reduces infection. Here, we show deposited Fg is advantageous for uropathogens <italic>E. faecalis</italic>, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>, <italic>A. baumannii</italic>, and <italic>C. albicans</italic>, suggesting that targeting catheter protein deposition may reduce colonization creating an effective intervention for catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs). In a mouse model of CAUTI, host-protein deposition was reduced, using liquid-infused silicone catheters, resulting in decreased colonization on catheters, in bladders, and dissemination in vivo. Furthermore, proteomics revealed a significant decrease in deposition of host-secreted proteins on liquid-infused catheter surfaces. Our findings suggest targeting microbial-binding scaffolds may be an effective antibiotic-sparing intervention for use against CAUTIs and other medical device infections.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>fibrinogen</kwd><kwd>CAUTI</kwd><kwd>slippery liquid-infused porous surface</kwd><kwd>urinary catheter</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>uropathogen</kwd><kwd>liquid-infused polymer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>E. faecalis</kwd><kwd>C. albicans</kwd><kwd>P. aeruginosa</kwd><kwd>A. baumannii</kwd><kwd>K. pneumoniae</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-DK128805</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Flores-Mireles</surname><given-names>Ana L</given-names></name><name><surname>Molesan</surname><given-names>Alex</given-names></name><name><surname>Andersen</surname><given-names>Marissa Jeme</given-names></name><name><surname>Fong</surname><given-names>ChunKi</given-names></name><name><surname>Howell</surname><given-names>Caitlin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000146</institution-id><institution>Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CBET-2029378</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fong</surname><given-names>ChunKi</given-names></name><name><surname>Howell</surname><given-names>Caitlin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008109</institution-id><institution>University of Notre Dame</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FY19SEED6</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Andersen</surname><given-names>Marissa Jeme</given-names></name><name><surname>Flores-Mireles</surname><given-names>Ana L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008982</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CBET-2029378</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Howell</surname><given-names>Caitlin</given-names></name><name><surname>Fong</surname><given-names>ChunKi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The use of liquid-infused catheters results in significant reduction of bladder and catheter colonization, systemic dissemination, and bladder inflammation in a clinically relevant mouse model of CAUTI by targeting host-protein deposition on the urinary catheter.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Urinary catheters drain patient’s bladders during surgical sedation and recovery in addition to being used in treatment for a variety of chronic conditions, making it an exceedingly common procedure in healthcare facilities. Despite the benefits urinary catheters provide for patients, catheterization causes adverse effects including infections and bladder stones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen and Flores-Mireles, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feneley et al., 2015</xref>). The most common complication is catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), which accounts for 40% of all hospital-acquired infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen and Flores-Mireles, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feneley et al., 2015</xref>). Unfortunately, CAUTIs often lead to bloodstream infections and systemic dissemination with a 30% mortality rate, causing significant financial burdens for hospitals and patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen and Flores-Mireles, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feneley et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>New and current management guidelines for CAUTIs have resulted in moderate reductions in incidences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Assadi, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Meddings et al., 2014</xref>). The standard treatment for patients with symptomatic CAUTI is catheter removal and replacement and an antibiotic regiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Assadi, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Flores-Mireles et al., 2019</xref>). However, this approach is not effective because biofilms on the catheter surface and bladder wall protect microbes against antibiotics and the immune system and creates the potential development of antimicrobial resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Flores-Mireles et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Trautner and Darouiche, 2004</xref>). Many ongoing efforts to prevent biofilms on catheters are focused on developing surface modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen and Flores-Mireles, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Faustino et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Singha et al., 2017</xref>). Catheters impregnated with antimicrobials, such as metal ions and antibiotics, have become popular and are now commercialized due to promising in vitro work but, in clinical trials these catheters have shown, at best, mixed results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen and Flores-Mireles, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Singha et al., 2017</xref>). Importantly, there is concern that this approach may not be a long-term solution given that the presence of antimicrobial compounds may drive development of resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Singha et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Westfall et al., 2019</xref>). Especially when considering the host factors that coat urinary catheters, which could potentially inhibit or decrease pathogen interaction with antimicrobials.</p><p>Recent findings in mouse and human urinary catheterization have unveiled the importance of the host clotting factor 1, fibrinogen (Fg), for surface adhesion and subsequent establishment of biofilms and persistence of CAUTIs in <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Flores-Mireles et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Flores-Mireles et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Flores-Mireles et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flores-Mireles et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gaston et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Klein and Hultgren, 2020</xref>). Fg is continuously released into the bladder lumen in response to mechanical damage to the urothelial lining caused by catheterization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Flores-Mireles et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Flores-Mireles et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Flores-Mireles et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Klein and Hultgren, 2020</xref>). Once in the lumen, Fg is deposited on the catheter, providing a scaffold for these incoming uropathogens to bind and establish infection in human and mouse CAUTI. When blocking the interaction between Fg and <italic>E. faecalis</italic> using antibodies, the pathogen is not able to effectively colonize the bladder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Di Venanzio et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Flores-Mireles et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Flores-Mireles et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gaston et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Walker et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Thus, we hypothesized that reducing availability of binding scaffolds, in this case Fg, would decrease microbial colonization in a catheterized bladder. To test our hypothesis, we used a mouse model of CAUTI and a diverse panel of uropathogens, including <italic>E. faecalis</italic>, <italic>C. albicans</italic>, uropathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, <italic>A. baumannii</italic>, and <italic>Klebsiella pneumonia</italic>, which we found all bind more extensively to catheters with Fg present. To resolve the deposition of Fg, we focus on antifouling modifications, specifically, liquid-infused silicone (LIS). LIS is more simple to make, more stable, and more cost effective than other antifouling polymer modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen and Flores-Mireles, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Campoccia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Homeyer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Howell et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chamy, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Singha et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sotiri et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Villegas et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, LIS has shown to reduce clotting in central lines and infection in skin implants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Leslie et al., 2014</xref>). We show that our LIS-catheters reduced Fg deposition and microbial binding not only in vitro but also in vivo. Furthermore, LIS-catheters significantly decrease host-protein deposition when compared to unmodified (UM)-catheters as well as reducing catheter-induced inflammation. These findings suggest that targeting host-protein deposition on catheter surfaces and the use of LIS-catheters are plausible strategies for reducing instances of CAUTI.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Uropathogens interact with Fg during CAUTI</title><p>Due to the understood interaction between Fg and some uropathogens and Fg accumulation on catheters over time in human and mice, we assessed potential interaction of <italic>E. faecalis</italic> OG1RF (positive control) uropathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> UTI89, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1, <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> TOP52, <italic>A. baumannii</italic> UPAB1, and <italic>C. albicans</italic> SC5314 with Fg in vivo, using a CAUTI mouse model, which recapitulates human CAUTI pathophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Flores-Mireles et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Flores-Mireles et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Flores-Mireles et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flores-Mireles et al., 2016b</xref>).

Binding to Fg is critical for efficient bladder colonization and biofilm formation on the catheter via protein–protein interaction using EbpA and ClfB adhesins, respectively, and their disruption hinders colonization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Flores-Mireles et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Walker et al., 2017</xref>).

While interaction of <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> with Fg during CAUTI has not been described previously, pathogenesis during urinary tract infection (UTI) (no catheterization) has been extensively studied. These studies show that type 1 pili, a chaperone–usher pathway (CUP) pili, allows them to colonize the bladder urothelium by binding to mannosylated receptors on the urothelial surface through the tip adhesin FimH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Klein and Hultgren, 2020</xref>). Furthermore, other CUP pili including the P pili, important for pyelonephritis, and the Fml pilus, important for colonizing inflamed bladder urothelium, bind specifically to sugar residues Galα1–4Gal in glycolipids and Gal(β1–3)GalNAc in glycoproteins, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Campoccia et al., 2013</xref>).

Furthermore, <italic>C. albicans</italic> has several adhesins, ALS1, ALS3, and ALS9, which have a conserved peptide-binding cavity shown to bind to Fg γ-chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hoyer and Cota, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Inhibition of initial uropathogen binding is crucial to reduce colonization and biofilm formation on urinary catheter surfaces and prevent subsequent CAUTI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Flores-Mireles et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flores-Mireles et al., 2016b</xref>). To prevent surface binding, a variety of modified surfaces impregnated with antimicrobial or bacteriostatic compounds have been generated, and have proven to reduce microbial-binding in vitro but not in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen and Flores-Mireles, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Singha et al., 2017</xref>). It is possible that in vitro studies do not efficiently mimic the complexities of the in vivo environment, for example; (1) Growth media: the majority of in vitro studies use laboratory rich or defined culture media, and it has been shown that laboratory media do not recapitulate the catheterized bladder environment that pathogens encounter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Colomer-Winter et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Xu et al., 2017</xref>). Specifically, urine culture conditions have shown to activate different bacterial transcriptional profiles than when cultures are grown in defined media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Conover et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Xu et al., 2017</xref>), which may affect microbial persistence and survival. (2) Host factors: host-secreted proteins are released into the bladder due to catheter-induced physical damage and subsequent inflammation. These proteins are deposited on the catheter surface and may hinder the release of antimicrobials or block interaction of antimicrobials with the pathogen if the antimicrobials are tethered to the surface. As has been observed with Fg deposition on human and mouse catheters, that host-protein deposition is not uniform, which may lead to antimicrobial release or pathogen–antimicrobial agent interaction at a subinhibitory concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Di Venanzio et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Flores-Mireles et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Flores-Mireles et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Walker et al., 2017</xref>). Consequently, these interactions can contribute to the development of multidrug resistance among uropathogens (‘Antibiotic resistance threats in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antibiotic resistance threats in the United States, 2019</xref>', 2019).</p><p>Based on the role of deposited host proteins in promoting microbial colonization and presence in human CAUTI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Flores-Mireles et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flores-Mireles et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Walker et al., 2017</xref>), antifouling catheter coatings present a better approach to decreasing CAUTI prevalence rather than using biocidal or biostatic compounds, such as antibiotics, that promote resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Campoccia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Singha et al., 2017</xref>). Antifouling coatings made from polymers have shown resistance to protein deposition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">He et al., 2016</xref>; however, these coatings can become unstable over time and be difficult to produce requiring extensive wet chemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Singha et al., 2017</xref>). Most reports on the use of purely antifouling coatings to combat CAUTI have shown a successful reduction in bacterial colonization in vitro yet have not been successfully tested in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen and Flores-Mireles, 2019</xref>). This may be partly explained by the fact that many of the antifouling coatings are optimized to target bacterial adhesion, as it is understood that the first stage of biofilm development is bacterial attachment to a surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Faustino et al., 2020</xref>). However, in a complex environment such as the in vivo bladder, the first change to the catheter surface is the adhesion of a complex set of host-generated proteins and biological molecules, generally referred to as a conditioning film, which can mask the surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Faustino et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gaston et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Scotland et al., 2020</xref>). Yet studies on catheter coatings to-date have rarely focused on the role of the host in infection establishment; namely, the host-secreted proteins. The data we present here suggest that this missing element may at least partly explain the differing results seen for most antifouling catheter treatments in vitro vs in vivo.</p><p>This study used clinically relevant silicone oil to create a simple to make LIS that was not only microbial resistant but also protein resistant, filling in the missing link between in vitro and in vivo work, the conditioning film. Interestingly, despite the increased weight, length, inner diameter, and outer diameterof the LIS mouse catheter by full silicone infusion, the LIS-catheters did not exacerbated the inflammation response. This findings are consistent with previous a in vivo work showing reduced fibrous capsule formation in implants coated with a liquid layer, suggesting that the use of a liquid surface may convey additional anti-inflammatory benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Our mouse model of CAUTI has shown to faithfully recapitulate the pathophysiology of human CAUTI, showing urinary catheterization induces inflammation and contribution of Fg to biofilm formation on catheters recovered from humans suffering of CAUTI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Delnay et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Flores-Mireles et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Flores-Mireles et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flores-Mireles et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Glahn et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Peychl and Zalud, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Walker et al., 2017</xref>). This suggests that our findings have the potential to be translated for prevention and management of human CAUTI. However, for successful translation of this technology into humans, we need to further understand the effects of silicone oil on the immune response to infection as well as bladder tissue and better understand the impact the swelling of the material will have on manufacturing these catheters.</p><p>A deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of CAUTI is critical to moving beyond current developmental roadblocks and create more efficient intervention strategies. Here, we have shown that that infusion of silicone with an immiscible liquid coating significantly decreases Fg deposition and microbial binding by using in vitro conditions that more thoroughly recapitulate the catheterized bladder environment. Importantly, our in vitro results were confirmed in vivo using our established mouse model of CAUTI. Our data showed that LIS-catheters are refractory to bacterial colonization without targeting microbial survival, which often leads to antimicrobial resistance. This study has found that protein deposition on urinary catheters is the Achilles heel of CAUTI pathogens, disrupting pathogen–Fg interaction represent a vulnerability that could be exploited. Thus, LIS-catheters hold tremendous potential for the development of lasting and effective CAUTI treatments. These types of technologies are desperately needed to achieve better public health by decreasing healthcare-associated infections and promoting long-term wellness.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

purchased from Jackson Laboratory and The National Institute of Cancer Research. Mice were subjected to transurethral implantation and inoculated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Conover et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, mice were anesthetized by inhalation of isoflurane and implanted with a 6-mm-long UM-silicone or LIS-catheter. Mice were infected immediately following catheter implantation with 50 μl of ~2 × 10<sup>7</sup> CFU/ml in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) introduced into the bladder lumen by transurethral inoculation (unless otherwise noted [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>]). For all mouse experiments microbes were grown in their corresponding media (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). To harvest the catheters and organs, mice were sacrificed at 24 hpi by cervical dislocation after anesthesia inhalation; the silicone catheter, bladder, kidneys, heart, and spleen were aseptically harvested. Catheters were either subjected to sonication (Branson, Ultrasonic Bath) for CFU enumeration analysis, fixed for imaging via standard IF described below, or sent for proteomic analysis as described below using nonimplanted catheters as controls for all assays. Bladders for IF and histology were fixed and processed as described below. Kidneys, spleens, and hearts were all used for CFU analysis. The University of Notre Dame Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all mouse infections and procedures as part of protocol number 18-08-4792MD. All animal care was consistent with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals from the National Research Council.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Bladder Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and H&amp;E staining of mouse bladders</title><p>Mouse bladders were fixed in 10% neutralized formalin (Leica) overnight, before being processed and sectioned by ND CORE. Staining was done as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Walker et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, bladder sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and rinsed with water. Antigen retrieval was accomplished by boiling the samples in Na-citrate, washing in water, and then incubating in PBS three times. Sections were then blocked (1× PBS, 1.5% BSA, 0.1% sodium azide), washed in PBS, and incubated with appropriate primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. Next, sections were washed with PBS, incubated with secondary antibodies for 2 hr at RT, and washed once more in PBS prior to Hoechst dye staining. H&amp;E stain for light microscopy was done by the CORE facilities at the University of Notre Dame (ND CORE). All imaging was done using a Zeiss inverted light microscope (Carl Zeiss, Axio Observer).

Weight of the tubes prior to infusion were measured with an analytical balance (AL204, Analytical Balance, Mettler Toledo, Germany). After the measurement of the initial weights, the tubes were submerged in silicone oil (DMS-T15, polydimethylsiloxane, trimethylsiloxy, 50 cSt, GelestSInc, USA) and weighed at designated time points. For each time point, tubes were removed from the oil with forceps and held vertically for 30 s for the excess silicone oil to flow out of the tube. The bottoms of the tubes were then gently dabbed with Kimwipes (Kimwipe, Kimberly-Clark Corp., USA). After measurement, the tubes were again submerged in silicone oil until the next time point. Tubes were measured every 3 hr for the first 2 days; every 6 hr from days 3 to 6; and every 24 hr from day 6 and onwards. Measurements were taken until data showed no significant increase, and that the plateau trendline consist of at least three data points. Based on these data, for all the protein- and microbial-binding assays, silicone catheters were submerged in silicone oil for 5 days prior to use to ensure full infusion.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Mouse catheter infusion</title><p>Five samples of 20-cm mouse catheter (SIL 025, RenaSil Silicone Rubber Tubing, Braintree Scientific, Inc, USA) were utilized in weight measurement. Weight of the tubes prior to infusion were measured with an analytical balance. After the measurement of the initial weights, the tubes were submerged in silicone oil for different time points. For each time point, catheters were removed from the oil with forceps and a Kimwipes was immediately pressed against the bottom of the catheters to remove the excess silicone oil via capillary action. After the excess oil was drained, catheters were weighed and placed back into silicone oil to continue with the infusion until the next time point. Catheters were measured every 1 min for the first 5 min of the experiment; every 2 min from 5 to 15 min; and every 5 min from 15 min and onwards.

I learned a lot from it and I am very curious to where this will lead. I have some general issues and some textual issues.</p><p>General issues:</p><p>I think the readability and comprehension can be improved by adding something of a graphical abstract illustrating the steps of your research. Especially for the fast reader, this offers the possibility to understand the study results and implications in a short time.</p><p>Regarding the third step: it is insufficiently clear how the LIS catheter that was used for the mice experiments is manufactured exactly. Is this catheter drained in silicone oil before insertion and for how long? And why is the gain in weight over time so important to register? What can you deduce from this?

I learned a lot from it and I am very curious to where this will lead. I have some general issues and some textual issues.</p><p>General issues:</p><p>I think the readability and comprehension can be improved by adding something of a graphical abstract illustrating the steps of your research. Especially for the fast reader, this offers the possibility to understand the study results and implications in a short time.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this suggestion. We agree with the Reviewer that a graphical abstract will help to convey our findings. We have added it as Figure 7 (lines 539-546), we will leave to the discretion of the editor to keep it in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding the third step: it is insufficiently clear how the LIS catheter that was used for the mice experiments is manufactured exactly. Is this catheter drained in silicone oil before insertion and for how long? And why is the gain in weight over time so important to register? What can you deduce from this?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for pointing out the lack of details on our part. We have added this information in the results (Lines 134-145) and material and methods (Lines 437-449) sections to explain our use of this data further on in later assays. Silicone infusion was done by submerging the catheter in the silicone oil to achieve full saturation as seen by a plateau in the weight of the tube over time (Figure S2 and Figure S2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>And speaking of the change of dimensions; what could be the impact of this on the development of CA-UTIs?

Understanding how much swelling is happening will allow us to predict what dimensions we would need from the beginning of the process to understand the dimensions desired after infusion. The data we have provided in this paper is the beginning of understanding the dimension changes. Furthermore, material flexibility and rigidity compared to current urinary catheter requirements should be assessed. A more in-depth analysis will be done in later publications (Lines 292-293). Importantly, full infusion and thus increased size of the mouse catheters did not exacerbated inflammation and did not promote microbial colonization (Lines 278-285).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I think the discussion should focus on what the next steps are in research/development of the LIS catheter, towards its use in clinical practice</p></disp-quote><p>We truly appreciate the reviewer’s feedback to improve our manuscript.
