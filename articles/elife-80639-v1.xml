For example, the inherent long lifespan and low-throughput nature of mice prohibit iterative genetics and exploration of vertebrate biology. The African turquoise killifish <italic>Nothobranchius furzeri</italic> (hereafter killifish) has emerged as a powerful model to overcome this challenge and accelerate discovery due to its rapid timeline for sexual maturity (3–4 weeks post hatching) and naturally compressed lifespan (4–6 months) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hu and Brunet, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). The killifish has the shortest generation time of a vertebrate model system bred in the laboratory (2 months) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hu and Brunet, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Polačik et al., 2016</xref>), making rapid vertebrate genetics possible. Tools to advance genetic interrogation of the killifish have been developed, including a sequenced genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reichwald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Valenzano et al., 2015</xref>), Tol2 transgenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allard et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hartmann and Englert, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Valenzano et al., 2011</xref>), CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harel et al., 2015</xref>), and CRISPR/Cas13-mediated knock-down (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kushawah et al., 2020</xref>).

They enable precise mutations in key genes for mechanistic studies and human disease modeling. Knock-in technologies also allow the insertion of molecular tags or reporters at specific genomic loci. Combined with self-cleaving peptides, a knock-in approach can be leveraged to drive cell-type- and tissue-specific expression of ectopic genes (e.g. genes of interest, recombinases) or probes (e.g. fluorescent reporters, calcium indicators). Thus, developing a method to precisely insert large genes and allow the efficient generation of stable lines with germline transmission is critical for establishing the killifish as a system for genetic engineering at scale.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in in killifish allows efficient tissue-specific expression of fluorescent reporters</title><p>To achieve precise integration of genes of interest at endogenous target loci, we developed a method based on CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homology-directed repair (HDR). CRISPR/Cas9-mediated HDR is often associated with issues of low efficiency and multicopy insertion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Auer et al., 2014</xref>). To overcome these issues, we injected killifish embryos with a cocktail composed of (1) recombinant Cas9 protein, (2) synthetic guide RNAs (gRNAs), (3) a chemically-modified linear double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) HDR template, and (4) a small molecule HDR enhancer which inhibits non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">DiNapoli et al., 2020</xref>) (see Methods; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We designed the dsDNA HDR template with 150–200 bp homology arms flanking the site of insertion at the target locus (in this case, the stop codon of a specific gene) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The length of homology arms was selected based on IDT’s recommendations for longer (&gt;200 bp) insertions (see Materials and methods). The target site for genomic insertion was designed within 2–7 bp of the Cas9 cut sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). To rapidly assess the efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in, we included the following sequences in the dsDNA HDR template: a <italic>T2A</italic> sequence [encoding the T2A self-cleaving peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Szymczak et al., 2004</xref>)] and the fluorescent protein Venus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nagai et al., 2002</xref>). Use of the T2A self-cleaving peptide avoids direct fusion of the fluorescent protein to the targeted gene’s protein product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). The modified dsDNA HDR template and gRNAs can all be directly ordered (see Materials and methods), which alleviates the need for cloning, PCR, or <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription. With successful insertion, the expression of Venus should be controlled by the endogenous regulatory elements (e.g. promoter, enhancers) of the target gene, which could be leveraged for cell-type- or tissue-specific expression.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Efficient homology directed repair for precise knock-in at different genomic locations in killifish.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of <italic>T2A-Venus</italic> insertion at the <italic>ELAVL3</italic> locus.

These three loci are known to have brain-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahrens et al., 2012</xref>), lens-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Posner et al., 2017</xref>), and ubiquitous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gutierrez-Triana et al., 2018</xref>) expression, respectively, in teleost fish (including zebrafish and medaka). After injection of CRISPR/Cas9 reagents into one-cell stage killifish embryos, we waited 14–21 days for the embryos to develop and visually screened embryos for Venus fluorescence – indicative of protein expression and suggestive of successful CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in. We observed Venus fluorescent protein expression in the expected tissues: developing brain for <italic>ELAVL3-</italic>targeted embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), lens of the eye for <italic>CRYAA-</italic>targeted embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), and in all cells of the embryo for <italic>ACTB2</italic>-targeted embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In all embryos screened, we did not observe Venus expression in a tissue that was not specifically targeted.</p><p>For all three targeted loci, we observed Venus fluorescence (suggestive of successful CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in) in over 40% of developed embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). For the <italic>ELAVL3</italic> locus, we achieved the highest CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in efficiency using both a chemically modified dsDNA HDR template (i.e. IDT’s Alt-R HDR Donor Blocks, see Methods) and a small molecule HDR enhancer as compared to an unmodified dsDNA HDR template (i.e. IDT’s gBlocks, see Methods) and no small molecule HDR enhancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). We therefore used the former approach for all subsequent constructs and loci. We did not observe significant differences in the lethality of embryos injected with CRISPR/Cas9 knock-in reagents (including chemically modified dsDNA HDR template and/or small molecule HDR enhancer) compared to non-injected wildtype embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B, C</xref>). In general, the lethality of killifish embryos, whether injected or not, was variable in the first two weeks of development (dependent on breeders and clutch; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B, C</xref>). Thus, to ensure successful generation of transgenic animals that survive past development, we recommend injecting ~100 embryos per line.</p><p>Importantly, we confirmed that the genomic knock-in occurred at the expected genomic locus by PCR genotyping of DNA extracted from tail clips of the injected individuals (F0 founders) using 3 primers, 2 surrounding the insertion site for each gene and 1 in the <italic>Venus</italic> transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>; see below for sequencing confirmation in the F1 generation). Knock-in at the <italic>ACTB2</italic> locus resulted in Venus positive embryos that did not survive hatching, consistent with what has been observed for <italic>ACTB2</italic> knock-in in medaka (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gutierrez-Triana et al., 2018</xref>) and perhaps due to the sensitivity of actin assembly to any perturbation (e.g. additional amino acids due to cleavage of the P2A peptide). Thus, to genotype Venus positive embryos targeting the <italic>ACTB2</italic> locus, DNA was extracted from whole embryos (not tail clips). Genotyping injected animals using this 3-primer PCR strategy enables a rough estimate of the level of heterozygosity and mosaicism in each animal. This estimate is helpful in selecting highly edited F0 founders for generating stable lines, especially in cases where the introduced insertion does not contain a fluorescent reporter and thereby cannot be visually selected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Hence, this CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in method allows for precise and efficient editing at several loci, including tissue-specific ones; however, it may be more difficult to use this knock-in approach to generate stable lines targeting essential genes encoding proteins involved in sensitive assemblies such as <italic>ACTB2</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Germline transmission of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in and generation of stable lines</title><p>A key aspect of genome editing is germline transmission to allow the generation of genetically modified lines. To determine if the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated insertion can be transmitted to the next generation, we evaluated the efficiency of germline transmission using transgenic <italic>ELAVL3-T2A-Venus</italic> founders (F0s). Sixty-seven percent of F0 founders, when crossed with wildtype fish, produced Venus-positive F1 progeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). Given the high efficiency of germline transmission and the rapid generation time of killifish, we tested if it was possible to directly generate homozygous F1 animals by inter-crossing genetically modified F0 individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). As an example, we used one Venus-positive F0 male (F0 #1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and one Venus-positive F0 female (F0 #2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), both of which produced a large fraction of Venus-positive progeny when crossed with wildtype fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Upon inter-crossing these founders, we found that 85% of the resulting F1 Venus-positive progeny were homozygous for the insertion at the <italic>ELAVL3</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). PCR amplification and genotyping by Sanger sequencing of homozygous F1 animals confirmed that the <italic>T2A-Venus</italic> integration at the <italic>ELAVL3</italic> locus was as designed—single copy and in frame, with no observed mutations within 1 kb around the insertion site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, C and D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This accelerated inter-crossing approach could enable rapid testing of homozygous F1 lines if desired. However, we also note that directly generating homozygous F1 lines may also increase the risk of propagating silent mutations from F0 animals (e.g. off-target genome editing in F0s), which might in turn lead to phenotypes independent of the introduced transgene. We formally tested for potential off-target insertions/mutations upon CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in for <italic>ELAVL3</italic> targeting. PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing of homozygous F1 <italic>ELAVL3-T2A-Venus</italic> animals at the three most likely off-target sites [predicted by CHOPCHOP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Labun et al., 2019</xref>)] showed no off-target editing at these sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Nevertheless, to limit the risk of off-target editing, we recommend backcrossing founders to wildtype animals.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Rapid generation of stable knock-in lines in the killifish.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of generating a stable knock-in line by either crossing F0 X WT (left) or F0 X F0 (right), with timelines to verified heterozygous or homozygous animals.

Thus, in this case (and likely in other cases), use of heterozygous animals with edited alleles may be more conservative to preserve robust expression of the endogenous locus. The observation that the expression pattern of Venus recapitulates that of the targeted endogenous gene for all genes targeted here also supports the notion that in-frame off-target insertions are rare with this method. The generation of these lines serves as proof of principle that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in is a powerful method in killifish to drive cell-type-specific expression. These neuron-specific lines should also help the development of the killifish for systems neuroscience studies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we establish an efficient and versatile method for rapid and precise genome engineering of the short-lived African turquoise killifish. This CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in method can be leveraged for cell-type- and tissue-specific expression of ectopic genes and reporters to study complex phenotypes at scale. We observe CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in of large inserts at five distinct genomic loci (<italic>ELAVL3</italic>, <italic>CRYAA</italic>, <italic>ACTB2</italic>, <italic>NPY</italic>, and <italic>HCRT</italic>), with &gt;40% efficiency at tested loci (<italic>ELAVL3</italic>, <italic>CRYAA</italic>, and <italic>ACTB2</italic>). With this CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in approach, we observe a &gt;65% germline transmission rate for knock-in at the <italic>ELAVL3</italic> locus. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in efficiency and germline transmission rates may vary depending on the genomic locus being targeted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hsu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Labun et al., 2019</xref>), which might be due to the chromatin accessibility of that locus. We have generated four stable knock-in lines in this work: <italic>ELAVL3-T2A-Venus</italic>, <italic>ELAVL3-T2A-Venus-P2A-H2B-oScarlet</italic>, <italic>NPY-T2A-Venus</italic>, and <italic>HCRT-T2A-Venus</italic>. The high efficiency of germline transmission we observe in killifish may be due to the relatively slow rate of early cell division after fertilization in the African turquoise killifish (~4 times slower in this species relative to non-annual teleost fishes; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dolfi et al., 2014</xref>). The killifish model, with hundreds of embryos produced at a given time (for example using harem breeding), allows for easy and high-throughput injection of genome-editing machinery into embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hu and Brunet, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Polačik et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, the killifish has the shortest generation time of any vertebrate model bred in captivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hu and Brunet, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). The development of rapid and efficient knock-in establishes the killifish as a system for precise genetic engineering at scale, which has been challenging so far in vertebrates.</p><p>There has been promising progress in CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in in killifish. Knock-in was first reported for short insertions (~8 bp; though germline transmission of these inserts was not achieved) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harel et al., 2015</xref>). More recently, longer CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in insertions (~1 kb) were achieved in killifish (in F0 individuals) with 18–30% efficiency, though germline transmission was not shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Oginuma et al., 2022</xref>). Moreover, knock-in of a long (1.5 kb) insertion was achieved for a specific locus with ~11% efficiency and successful germline transmission (germline transmission rate not shown) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Krug et al., 2023</xref>). Our approach for CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in in killifish allows long insertions (up to 2 kb), has &gt;40% efficiency, and high germline transmission rates. The knock-in method developed here uses reagents that are commercially available, eliminating the need for cloning and PCR and making this method easy to adopt. Together, the steps described here could serve as a blueprint for knock-in approaches in other emerging model organisms.</p><p>Previous studies have developed different CRISPR/Cas9-mediated long insertion knock-in approaches not only in killifish but also in other teleost species, such as zebrafish and medaka (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gutierrez-Triana et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Krug et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Oginuma et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Seleit et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wierson et al., 2020</xref>). Key points of difference between these approaches include (1) type of donor repair template – plasmid donor (with <italic>in vivo</italic> linearization) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Oginuma et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wierson et al., 2020</xref>), dsDNA PCR amplification product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gutierrez-Triana et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Krug et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Seleit et al., 2021</xref>), or cloning-free synthetic dsDNA (as reported here), (2) use of chemical modification on linear dsDNA HDR repair template to prevent unwanted integration events (e.g. concatemerization) and boost HDR efficiency – biotin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gutierrez-Triana et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Krug et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Seleit et al., 2021</xref>), or IDT’s proprietary modification available with Alt-R HDR Donor Block (as reported here), and (3) length of the homology arms – short (24–40 bp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Seleit et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wierson et al., 2020</xref>), middle-range (150–200 bp; as reported here), or long (300–900 bp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gutierrez-Triana et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Krug et al., 2023</xref>). While it is difficult without side-by-side experiments to compare each knock-in approach, high insertion efficiencies (&gt;40%) and germline transmission have been achieved with different methods, for example, in zebrafish using plasmid donors with <italic>in vivo</italic> linearization and short homology arms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wierson et al., 2020</xref>), in medaka using dsDNA PCR product donors, biotin modification and short homology arms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Seleit et al., 2021</xref>), and (reported here) in killifish using synthetic dsDNA donors, IDT’s proprietary modification (Alt-R HDR Donor Block) and middle-range length (150–200 bp) homology arms. Thus, a variety of approaches for CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in have been successful in teleost fish, expanding the toolkit that can be used in these species.</p><p>Beyond knock-in efficiency, there are also advantages and limitations of our reported method. Our method uses synthetic, chemically-modified repair templates with ~150–200 bp homology arms, which has the advantage of being easily adoptable without expertise in molecular biology techniques (cloning or PCR). In addition, there is no preparation required for reagents (e.g. cloning or amplification with cleanup steps), which helps save hands-on time. Finally, the use of synthetic reagents that are sequenced and quality-controlled reduces the likelihood of mutations in the HDR template. However, the use of synthetic HDR templates does have limitations: (1) there is a limit on the total length (≤3000 bp) and complexity of dsDNA HDR templates that can be synthesized (e.g. sequence containing repetitive elements), (2) there is a wait time to receive the synthesized template, and (3) synthesis of large templates can be expensive. A major point of consideration in choosing a particular approach may be the number of lines being generated. If generating a few CRISPR/Cas9 knock-in lines, a purely synthetic approach would likely require the least amount of hands-on work and start-up time. In contrast, if one is planning to design many lines, a modular cloning/PCR based approach may be most cost effective.</p><p>The CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in approach we developed should allow the establishment of versatile strategies to probe complex phenotypes, including development, ‘suspended animation’ (embryonic diapause), regeneration, aging, and age-related diseases. Given the potential of the African killifish for modeling human aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hu and Brunet, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Van Houcke et al., 2021a</xref>), this knock-in method should also allow the generation of human disease models that can be studied longitudinally, over an entire lifespan. For example, this CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in could be used to introduce human neurodegenerative disease variants into conserved endogenous killifish loci (e.g. amyloid precursor protein [<italic>APP</italic>] for Alzheimer’s disease) or to drive neurodegenerative disease variants using a pan-neuronal promoter such as <italic>ELAVL3</italic> (though we have not examined how the expression level of <italic>ELAVL3</italic> changes with age in this study). Human disease variant models in mice have been critical to understand disease mechanisms and treatment strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dawson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fisher and Bannerman, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jankowsky and Zheng, 2017</xref>). Generating human disease models that are scalable and integrate both genetics and age as risk factors has the potential to identify new strategies to treat these diseases.</p><p>This study highlights the power of knock-in, combined with self-cleaving peptides, to drive cell-type-specific expression of ectopic genes such as molecular reporters (e.g. fluorescent reporters, calcium indicators), recombinases (e.g. Cre), and optogenetic tools (e.g. light sensitive ion channels such as channelrhodopsin). The cell-type resolution of this genetic tool should open studies in a variety of fields, including systems neuroscience. Additional variations, such as the use of ‘landing pads’ (i.e. genetic loci that support stable long-term expression of transgenes such as <italic>ROSA26</italic> in mice; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Soriano, 1999</xref>) and inducible promoters (either endogenous or ectopic; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gossen and Bujard, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gossen et al., 1995</xref>), could be further developed to complete this toolkit. Overall, this knock-in method should accelerate the use of the killifish as a scalable vertebrate model and allow discoveries in several fields, including regeneration, neuroscience, aging, and disease, with conserved implications for humans.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>African turquoise killifish care and husbandry</title><p>African turquoise killifish (GRZ strain) were maintained according to established guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Astre et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bedbrook et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nath et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Reichard et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Žák et al., 2020</xref>).

Adult fish (&gt;1 month of age) were fed dry fish food (Otohime fish diet, Reed Mariculture, Otohime C1) while young fish (&lt;1 month of age) were fed freshly hatched brine shrimp (Brine Shrimp Direct, BSEP6LB). Killifish embryos were raised in Ringer’s solution (Millipore, 96724), with two tablets per liter of RO water and 0.01% methylene blue (i.e. embryo solution) at 26–27 °C in 60 mm x 15 mm petri dishes (Fisher Scientific, 07-000-328) at a density of &lt;100 embryos per plate.

The necessity of a PAM site near the target insertion site is a constraint of a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in approach. The Cas9 cut sites were between 2 and 7 bp from the target insertion site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).

In this work, we used the two-part synthetic tracrRNA and crRNA purchased from IDT to generate a functional gRNA.

The length of homology arms was selected based on IDT’s recommendations for the Alt-R HDR Donor Block product, which is the dsDNA donor used for most experiments in the paper (see below). IDT reports that 100–300bp homology arms resulted in efficient knock-in for insertions between 0.5 and 2kb for K562 cells in culture. We selected a length on the shorter end of that scale such that the dsDNA HDR template was less expensive for synthesis. Homology arms began within 2–7 bp of the Cas9 cut site.

All dsDNA HDR templates were synthesized from IDT (0.25–10 μg). Unless otherwise noted, dsDNA HDR templates contained chemical modification that prevent unwanted integration events (e.g. non-homologous integration resulting in homology arm duplication or concatemerization) and boost HDR efficiency. These chemically modified templates can be purchased from IDT and are referred to as Alt-R HDR Donor Blocks. In this study, we tested knock-in efficiency comparing dsDNA HDR templates without chemical modification (i.e. IDT’s standard gBlocks) to dsDNA HDR templates with two different proprietary chemical modifications. Of the two chemical modifications tested, only one is commercially available (the one in Alt-R HDR Donor Blocks) while the other early version of the chemical modification is not. In our experience, the Alt-R HDR Donor Blocks had the highest knock-in efficiency, and we used Alt-R HDR Donor Blocks for the majority of the HDR templates used in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Lieve Moons as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Phil Abitua, PhD (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Although the reported data are of major interest and relevance to the field, they are as yet not sufficiently supporting all conclusions made. The manuscript would benefit from the inclusion of a more detailed material and methods section, more rigorous validation of the KI lines that were generated, an elaboration on (morphometrical) expression data, and a more critical discussion.</p><p>Specifically</p><p>1. More detailed information is needed in the material and methods section, such as more information on the chemical modification of the repair template (reveal the modification or use the appropriate IDT reference number), and a complete description of the used solution recipes. Although full disclosure of the methodology might not be possible, as it is described now, it does not allow replication.</p><p>2. The authors should perform extra co-stainings that link endogenous expression to the reporter fluorescence (co-localization of GFP with HCR for the targeted genes), preferably for all lines, and determine whether the KI affects the endogenous expression level of the targeted genes.</p><p>3. The authors should add figures (e.g., in supplement) that reveal the expression of all studied genes, at minimum in larval fish.</p><p>4. The authors should insert a (supplemental) table that clearly outlines the initial number of eggs injected, the number of surviving embryos, the number of positive embryos, etc. for all lines displayed in the paper. They are encouraged to include for some of the lines a larger number of animals for the quantifications of the targeting efficiency and embryo survival. As these are now based on rather limited numbers for some lines and the analysis of germline TM has only been shown for 1 line, the claims made seem too strong, and should be rephrased/tempered where needed. As an example: &quot;We observe efficient CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in of large inserts (&gt;40% efficiency) with germline transmission rates over 65%&quot; is an overinterpretation if it is just based on ELAVL.</p><p>5. The authors are encouraged to strengthen their discussion by including a more detailed comparison of their method to other CRISPR-based KI methods in more typical model species, by putting the work in context with the GeneWeld paper from Wierson et al. 2020 and the method described by Seleit et al. 2022, and by contrasting the advantages and disadvantages of the used methodology.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The data are of major interest and relevance to the scientific community. Although the manuscript does not report on thrilling innovative findings, it provides an efficient and amendable knock-in approach that paves the way for future studies in the killifish animal model system.</p><p>The following issues could be addressed:</p><p>– Although all components of the method can be ordered at IDT, there is a big lack in the transparency of the kind of modification that is used and the composition of the HDR-enhanced buffer. As the composition of the HDR-enhanced buffer will never be disclosed by IDT, it might be useful to share a mode of action on how this blocks non-homologous end joining (NHEJ).</p><p>– The conclusion that modification #3 in combination with HDC enhancer results in the most optimal efficiency seems rather premature. To make this statement, preferably more technical repeats should be conducted (lines 88 – 93). A similar comment can be made for the survival rate where only two technical replicates were used. Moreover, the number of embryos evaluated per experiment differs from 10 to 105. This gap is too large and therefore it should at least be mentioned where or for which constructs only 10 embryos were scored.</p><p>– One other interesting experiment would be to see if the efficiency of germline transmission is promotor (region) dependent. Here, a general conclusion is made that germline transmission using the described technique is high, but it might be lower in heterochromatin regions. This point should at minimum be discussed.</p><p>– A &quot;successful&quot; attempt was made to create homozygous F1s (using 1 pair of F0 fish). However, how the F0s for this homozygous crossing were chosen is not disclosed. Moreover, silent mutations might be selected without backcrossing, thereby downscaling the use of F1 homozygotes. Although briefly acknowledged by the authors later in the manuscript, a more elaborate discussion of the benefits and risks should be provided.</p><p>– Correct expression of transgenes in the larval stage is only shown for ELAVL3-T2A-Venus, it would be nice to also see it for the other constructs, also as this should enable direct comparison to zebrafish work. Preferably, although not really needed in this paper, also the expression in the adult fish should be reported/shown, also as to reveal the activity of the promotors in the adult fish.</p><p>– During the insertion of a long (1.8kb) construct the nuclear localization signal (NLS) from histone 2B is used to target oScarlet to the nucleus. Authors could disclose whether the sequence is derived from killifish or zebrafish/medaka? In the final manuscript, the repair templates should be annotated as well, instead of just providing the sequence (homology arms, self-cleaving peptides, fluorophores, localization sequences).</p><p>– To evaluate if the insertion of the longer construct is as efficient as the shorter construct more technical replicates seem needed. Moreover, survival rates of injected embryos with the long construct next to non-injected embryos should preferably be disclosed within the manuscript itself to evaluate construct toxicity.</p><p>– The authors indicate that expression of ELAVL3-T2A-Venus-P2A-H2B-oScarlet is likely limited to neurons (line 147). This can easily be confirmed by doing staining for HuC/D on these transgenic fish, which is required if authors want to claim that neuronal-specific labeling is possible using this technique (line 154). Also, based on the DAPI staining, it is clear that not all cells (neurons) are labeled. It would thus be interesting to know the percentage of neurons labeled and compare it to Elav labeling in adult zebrafish?</p><p>– Would it be possible to also show Elav expression in the adult eye/retina and/or spinal cord?</p><p>– Throughout the manuscript, the effect of insertion on endogenous protein expression levels is not evaluated. Here, the authors could perform qPCR or Western blotting for the endogenous proteins (e.g. Npy, Hcrt, Elavl3, ….) to compare expression levels between WT and transgenic fish.</p><p>– In lines 46 and 203, the authors say that this method can &quot;allow the establishment of versatile strategies to probe complex phenotypes, including development, 'suspended animation', regeneration, aging, and age-related diseases.&quot; Authors should maybe briefly specify what they mean by &quot;suspended animation&quot;. Another word that should be explained is &quot;landing pad&quot; (line 219).</p><p>– gRNA is composed of tracrRNA and crRNA, however, many experts in the field are using sgRNA's. What is the advantage of using tracrRNA and crRNA over sgRNA's? Have sgRNA's been evaluated as well? A short discussion on this topic would be appreciated.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>RE &quot;a more rigorous validation of the KI lines that were generated&quot;.</p><p>It is important to measure whether the edit, which is done at the 3' end, disrupts gene regulation and potentially endogenous gene expression levels. Is the endogenous expression changed by the insertion of the fluorescent tag? Often HDR is accompanied by additional small edits around the targeted site. Did the authors check for these small edits in the 3'UTR or the wider non-coding region?</p><p>Regarding ectopic expression, the authors mention that &quot;In all embryos screened, we did not observe Venus expression in a tissue that was not specifically targeted.&quot; The drawback of screening killifish eggs during development is that only larger misexpression can be detected because of the chorion of the egg that is not fully transparent. Did the authors perform a more extensive screen of the faithfulness of expression in F1 or F2 (homozygous) animals? In Figure 2, please add images for other strains (CRYAA and ACTB) to demonstrate the specificity of expression.</p><p>Figure 1D shows that wt and ki bands are detected in the F0 animal, which could be a sign of heterozygosity or mosaicism. Can the authors distinguish and potentially estimate the percentage of mosaicism?</p><p>To prove that the targeted promotor faithfully reflects gene expression, a co-staining of the reporter with endogenous gene expression should be done. For the moment, the HCRs shown in Figure4-suppl2 do not have a lot of added value and should be performed in the KI lines.</p><p>Regarding &quot;rather limited numbers of animals&quot;</p><p>This reviewer found it difficult to get a full view of the experimental flow with regard to animal numbers, as information related to efficiency and lethality was spread out in different places. I would recommend making a merged supplemental table displaying the initial number of eggs injected, the number of surviving embryos, the number of positive embryos, etc. for all lines displayed in the paper. This will give a better view of the experimental setup and the efficiency of the method. The number of animals should be larger (minimally 50 surviving) to strengthen the efficiency claim. Germline TM was only shown for 1 line. Did the other lines go germline as well? Does the KI have an effect on fertility?</p><p>Lethality is high; at what stage did the authors lose the embryos?</p><p>Regarding &quot; Figures of the manuscript contain information that is not discussed in the main text&quot;</p><p>Figure 1D: bands seem to suggest that some F0 are homozygous? What is the percentage of ho in F0? 85% of the fish are homozygous after crossing 2 different F0: these percentages suggest that the F0 might already be edited on both alleles. Editing on both alleles might also have created different additional small edits that, when combined, have a potentially larger effect on gene expression. Have the authors seen such effects in the combined F1 generation?</p><p>Figure 2E: green signal apparent in WT in the somites? This is not apparent in all pictures, but I think the authors might have an explanation for this green signal.</p><p>Figure3D/E: ELAVL3 is expected to drive expression in all postmitotic neurons. Expression is expected to be similar in all postmitotic neurons, however distinct non-expressing stripes can be observed. This seems to indicate a mosaic situation with some (clonally related?) cells not expressing ELAVL3, but it is unclear how this can appear in an F1 animal (D). Do the authors have an explanation for this phenomenon?</p><p>Figure 3E Expression in brain hemispheres is not identical is some regions; This is an F0 animal that could have mosaicism; can this be repeated in F1 or F2? Why the different ages? Can the age of the animal have an effect on the expression levels of ELAVL3?</p><p>Regarding: &quot;Full disclosure of methods&quot;</p><p>The authors mention chemical modifications of the templates #1 and #3 but no more information was given. The IDT website does not mention these modification options, so it will be advisable to reveal the modification or use the appropriate IDT reference number. Used solution recipes should be complete.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I recommend this manuscript for publication but have a few questions/comments after reading the paper.</p><p>1) I think the paper would benefit from putting the work in context with the GeneWeld paper from Wierson et al. 2020 and the method described by Seleit et al. 2022. Contrasting the advantages and disadvantages of this work with theirs would be helpful.</p><p>2) Can the authors comment on why they used 150-200 bp homology arms?</p><p>3) I am left wondering how much of the efficiency reported in this paper is due to the locus being targeted. The presence of a PAM sequence near the endogenous stop codon is a limitation of the technique. Are their ways of circumventing this or alternative strategies? This would be a good discussion point.</p><p>4) On a related note, are the distances between the Cas9 cut sites and target insertion sites reported in the paper?</p><p>5) It is difficult to interpret supplemental figure 1A since two chemical modifications are used. It would be nice if the panel included modification #3 without HDR enhancer.</p><p>6) 1XPBS should have a space. 1X PBS?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80639.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

As suggested, we have now included a step-by-step protocol with all reagents and recipes including the IDT reference number (when available) and product names (new Supplementary File 1). We have also included additional details in the material and methods section. Furthermore, to avoid confusion about reagent information, we no longer refer to the chemical modification on the HDR template as “modification #3”, as this is not the term used for the commercially available product. We now refer to it throughout the revised manuscript as “Alt-R HDR Donor Block” from IDT (while this product does not have a specific catalog number because they are customized, we provide the IDT URL for ordering this type of HDR template from IDT). We now also provide the catalog number for the HDR enhancer from IDT. We believe that our revised material and method section and the inclusion of a step-by-step protocol with all the commercially available reagents greatly improves our manuscript. We thank the Reviewers for these suggestions, as we agree that it will help replication (and indeed this method has now been successfully used by all 4 members of the Brunet lab who have tried it and 1 member from another lab).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors should perform extra co-stainings that link endogenous expression to the reporter fluorescence (co-localization of GFP with HCR for the targeted genes), preferably for all lines, and determine whether the KI affects the endogenous expression level of the targeted genes.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewers that these are important experiments. We have now performed staining to test co-expression of fluorescent reporter transcript (<italic>Venus</italic>) and the transcript of the target loci (e.g., <italic>ELAVL3, CRYAA</italic>, <italic>NPY</italic>, and <italic>HCRT</italic>) via <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization using hybridization chain reaction (HCR) (new Figure 2F, Figure 4C, Figure 4E, and Figure 1— figure supplement 1). We observe that the <italic>Venus</italic> reporter recapitulates the expression pattern of the endogenous target transcript in the knock-in lines <italic>ELAVL3-T2A-Venus, NPYT2A-Venus</italic>, and <italic>HCRT-T2A-Venus</italic> (in heterozygous animals for all lines). The <italic>Venus</italic> reporter also recapitulates the expression pattern of the target transcript in Venus positive F0 animals targeting the CRYAA locus. We also find that <italic>Venus</italic> expression in each transgenic is similar to the expression of the target gene in the context of wildtype individuals for <italic>ELAVL3</italic> and <italic>CRYAA</italic> (new Figure 2G and Figure 1—figure supplement 1), which we had previously verified for <italic>NPY</italic> and <italic>HCRT</italic> (Figure 4—figure supplement 2). Together, these results indicate that the Venus reporter recapitulates the expression of the endogenous genes, and they also suggest that the endogenous allele is not grossly disrupted.</p><p>To examine in more depth the impact of the transgene on the endogenous allele, we also used a more quantitative RT-qPCR approach to compare <italic>Venus</italic> transcript expression and endogenous target expression for two stable lines generated in the paper (<italic>ELAVL3-T2AVenus</italic> and <italic>NPY-T2A-Venus</italic>) (new Figure 2—figure supplement 3 and Figure 4—figure supplement 3). We compared expression in wildtype, heterozygous, and homozygous siblings (generated by crossing heterozygous animals). We find that, as expected, Venus expression is only observed in heterozygous and homozygous animals in both lines (with increased expression in homozygous). Expression of endogenous <italic>ELAVL3</italic> was not affected by the presence of the transgene in the <italic>ELAVL3-T2A-Venus</italic>, whether homozygous or heterozygous (although there was a small non-significant decrease in homozygous) (new Figure 2—figure supplement 3). Expression of endogenous <italic>NPY</italic> was not affected by the presence of the transgene in the <italic>NPY-T2A-Venus</italic> in heterozygous individuals, but it was slightly and significantly decreased in homozygous individuals (new Figure 4—figure supplement 3). This indicates that the presence of the transgene can decrease the expression at homozygous level. We have included these new experiments in the revised manuscript, and we also include recommendations to generate and use such stable lines as heterozygous.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors should add figures (e.g., in supplement) that reveal the expression of all studied genes, at minimum in larval fish.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewers for this suggestion. We have now done additional HCR experiments for key endogenous target genes (<italic>ELAVL3</italic>, <italic>CRYAA</italic>, <italic>NPY</italic>, and <italic>HCRT</italic>) in both wildtype animals (new Figure 2G and Figure 1—figure supplement 1) and knock-in lines (new Figure 2F, Figure 4C, Figure 4E, and Figure 1—figure supplement 1). Unfortunately, we were not able to do HCR experiments for <italic>ACTB2</italic> in the knock-in line, because the knock-in targeting <italic>ACTB2</italic> was lethal at the F0 stage [consistent with what has been observed in Medaka (Gutierrez-Triana et al., 2018)]. We have now indicated this clearly in the revised manuscript. We have included the new staining in Figure 2F–G, Figure 4C, Figure 4E, and Figure 1— figure supplement 1 in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

We have now done the following experiments to address the Reviewers’ suggestions:</p><p>1. We have now performed additional rounds of injections for all injection conditions quantified in the paper (with the exception of <italic>ACTB2-T2A-Venus</italic> knock-in as they did not survive hatching in F0s). For each injection condition, we preformed between 3–6 independent replicate rounds of injection. In total, we performed &gt;30 separate rounds of injections and injected &gt;3000 embryos. With the additional replicates, we have a total of between 43–156 developed embryos per injection condition.

We also note that while we do see a significant boost in efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9mediated knock-in using chemically modified HDR templates and IDT’s small molecule HDR enhancer, we still observe reasonably good knock-in efficiency without (Figure 1C).

Moreover, the number of embryos evaluated per experiment differs from 10 to 105. This gap is too large and therefore it should at least be mentioned where or for which constructs only 10 embryos were scored.</p></disp-quote><p>The Reviewer’s feedback is well taken.</p><p>As suggested, we have now performed additional rounds of injections for all injection conditions quantified in the paper (with the exception of <italic>ACTB2-T2A-Venus</italic> knock-in as they did not survive hatching in F0s).

Although briefly acknowledged by the authors later in the manuscript, a more elaborate discussion of the benefits and risks should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>The Reviewer has another great point. We used one Venus-positive F0 male (F0 #1; Figure 2B) and one Venus-positive F0 female (F0 #2; Figure 2B), both of which produced a large fraction of Venus-positive progeny when crossed with wildtype fish (Figure 2B). We had multiple Venus-positive F0 males that produced many Venus-positive progeny. We randomly selected from those males. We have now better phrased this in the revised manuscript. We have also expanded on the discussion of the risks/benefits of this approach in the main text, emphasizing that this could lead to passing down of silent mutations and highlighting that the best practice would be to backcross F0 founders to wildtype (GRZ) animals.</p><p>“This accelerated inter-crossing approach could enable rapid testing of homozygous F1 lines if desired.

This is not apparent in all pictures, but I think the authors might have an explanation for this green signal.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. Unfortunately, we do not know the identity of this green signal. This signal is visible in both the wildtype and the <italic>ELAVL3-T2A-Venus</italic> images in Figure 2E but clearer in wildtype. We believe this difference is due to slight differences in the sagittal section depth of the <italic>ELAVL3-T2A-Venus</italic> animal vs the wildtype. With the small size of the larval killifish, it is difficult to get identically placed sagittal sections. We feel confident that the green signal seen in the transgenic animal is Venus fluorescence given the strength of the signal relative to wildtype. We have now indicated more clearly the green signal in figure legend and indicate that we believe this is autofluorescence:</p><p>“In both <italic>ELAVL3-T2A</italic>-<italic>Venus</italic> and wildtype individuals, we observe background green signal for example in the intestine and ventral to the spinal cord. This background signal is not identical between <italic>ELAVL3-T2A</italic>-<italic>Venus</italic> and wildtype samples likely due to slight differences in depth of the sagittal slice.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure3D/E: ELAVL3 is expected to drive expression in all postmitotic neurons. Expression is expected to be similar in all postmitotic neurons, however distinct non-expressing stripes can be observed. This seems to indicate a mosaic situation with some (clonally related?) cells not expressing ELAVL3, but it is unclear how this can appear in an F1 animal (D). Do the authors have an explanation for this phenomenon?</p><p>Figure 3E Expression in brain hemispheres is not identical is some regions; This is an F0 animal that could have mosaicism; can this be repeated in F1 or F2? Why the different ages? Can the age of the animal have an effect on the expression levels of ELAVL3?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for their very insightful observation. We believe these “non-expressing strips” observed in the Figure 3 are due to mosaicism in F0 animals, with clonal expansion of progenitor cells not expressing <italic>Venus</italic> or <italic>oScarlet</italic>. We have added the following text to the figure legend:</p><p>“Strips in the PGZ that appear to lack oScarlet expression could be due to mosaicism of the F0 individual.”</p><p>This observation is difficult to understand in the F1 animal shown in Figure 3D. Thus, we double checked our records for this slice and found that in fact the Reviewer was completely correct—this slice is actually from an F0 animal and we had made a mistake in the paper. We have corrected this mistake throughout the paper. We have also double checked all other images to ensure they are annotated correctly. In addition, we have now included additional staining of F3 animals for the same <italic>ELAVL3</italic> locus with the <italic>ELAVL3-T2A-Venus</italic> knock-in line for both <italic>Venus</italic> and <italic>ELAVL3</italic> (new Figure 2F). We do not observe strips of non-expressing cells in these stable lines. So again, we believe this is further evidence suggesting the nonexpressing strips observed on Figure 3 are due to mosaicism of the F0 individual.</p><p>In Figure 3E, the three-dimensional rendering makes regions of the brain in the foreground partially obstruct regions in the background to give the appearance of volume. Therefore, some brain hemispheres look dimmer because of the 3D rendering. We included z-slices of select regions to combat this, but feel it is valuable to keep the 3D volume as it still provides information about the distribution of neurons throughout the brain.</p><p>We have not done a detailed study of the effect of age on the expression of <italic>ELAVL3</italic>. While this would be very interesting, we believe this is beyond the scope of the knock-in method that we are presenting in this paper. We have indicated in the discussion:</p><p>“However we have not examined if the expression level of <italic>ELAVL3</italic> changes with age in this study”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding: &quot;Full disclosure of methods&quot;</p><p>The authors mention chemical modifications of the templates #1 and #3 but no more information was given. The IDT website does not mention these modification options, so it will be advisable to reveal the modification or use the appropriate IDT reference number. Used solution recipes should be complete.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the feedback. We have now included a step-by-step protocol with all reagents and recipes including the IDT reference number (when available) and product names (new Supplementary File 1). We have also included additional details in the material and methods section. Furthermore, to avoid confusion about reagent information, we no longer refer to the chemical modification on the HDR template as “modification #3”, as this is not the term used for the commercially available product. We now refer to it throughout the revised manuscript as “Alt-R HDR Donor Block” from IDT (and we provide the URL for ordering this type of HDR template from IDT). We now also provide the catalog number for the small molecule HDR enhancer from IDT.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I recommend this manuscript for publication but have a few questions/comments after reading the paper.</p><p>1) I think the paper would benefit from putting the work in context with the GeneWeld paper from Wierson et al. 2020 and the method described by Seleit et al. 2022. Contrasting the advantages and disadvantages of this work with theirs would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this helpful suggestion. We agree that this is a valuable addition to the paper. We have expanded the discussion to include details of advantages and disadvantages of our presented method in the context of these key papers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Can the authors comment on why they used 150-200 bp homology arms?</p></disp-quote><p>This is another great suggestion. We selected homology arm length based on IDT recommendations (https://www.idtdna.com/pages/products/crispr-genome-editing/alt-r-hdrdonor-blocks). IDT recommend a range of lengths 100–300 bp for Alt-R HDR Donor Blocks. We selected a length on the shorter end of that scale such that the dsDNA HDR template was shorter and thus less expensive for synthesis. We have now included this information in both the main text and the material and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) I am left wondering how much of the efficiency reported in this paper is due to the locus being targeted. The presence of a PAM sequence near the endogenous stop codon is a limitation of the technique. Are their ways of circumventing this or alternative strategies? This would be a good discussion point.</p></disp-quote><p>The Reviewer brings up an important limitation of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing approaches. We now more explicitly mention the constraint to the main text:</p><p>“The target site for genomic insertion was designed within 2–7 bps of the Cas9 cut sites (Supplementary File 3).”</p><p>We added a discussion of this in the methods section of the paper:</p><p>“Guide sequences were only selected if followed by the PAM site (5’-NGG-3’) for <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> Cas9. The necessity of a PAM site near the target insertion site is a constraint of a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in approach. The Cas9 cut sites were between 2–7 bp from the target insertion site (Supplementary File 3).”</p><p>To provide more detail on the flexibility of the knock-in design that is possible within this constraint, we have included the distance between the Cas9 cut site and insertion site for all designs in this paper in Supplementary File 3. We have successfully used gRNAs with cut sites up to 7 bp away from the insertion site (for the <italic>NPY-T2A-Venus</italic> design).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) On a related note, are the distances between the Cas9 cut sites and target insertion sites reported in the paper?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree this would be helpful. We have included the distance between Cas9 cut site and the target insertion site in Supplementary File 3 in the ‘Guides’ tab.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It is difficult to interpret supplemental figure 1A since two chemical modifications are used. It would be nice if the panel included modification #3 without HDR enhancer.</p></disp-quote><p>The Reviewer is correct that we have not tested modification #3 (now termed “Alt-R HDR Donor Block (IDT)” in the revised manuscript) without the small molecule HDR enhancer. We did not prioritize testing the impact of adding/removing the HDR enhancer because we found that addition of HDR enhancer + modification #3 was better (with statistical significance with additional replicates) than without both, and we continued with the latter condition (revised Figure 1C). That being said, the knock-in efficiency without modification #3 and without the small molecule HDR enhancer is still reasonably good. We have now indicated this more specifically in the Materials and methods and figure legend for Figure 1—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) 1XPBS should have a space. 1X PBS?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you!
