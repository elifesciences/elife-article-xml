interacts with atypical cadherin Flamingo (Fmi) to direct R8 photoreceptor axons in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> visual system. However, the precise mechanisms underlying Gogo regulation during columnar- and layer-specific R8 axon targeting are unknown. Our studies demonstrated that the insulin secreted from surface and cortex glia switches the phosphorylation status of Gogo, thereby regulating its two distinct functions. Non-phosphorylated Gogo mediates the initial recognition of the glial protrusion in the center of the medulla column, whereas phosphorylated Gogo suppresses radial filopodia extension by counteracting Flamingo to maintain a one axon-to-one column ratio. Later, Gogo expression ceases during the midpupal stage, thus allowing R8 filopodia to extend vertically into the M3 layer. These results demonstrate that the long- and short-range signaling between the glia and R8 axon growth cones regulates growth cone dynamics in a stepwise manner, and thus shapes the entire organization of the visual system.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>axon guidance</kwd><kwd>visual system</kwd><kwd>developmental

are formed in the brain between specific neurons to facilitate higher-order information processing. Synapses are often arranged into structures that reflect the functional organization of synaptic contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huberman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Luo and Flanagan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sanes and Yamagata, 2009</xref>). Each brain layer receives discrete axonal inputs that carry specific information. Therefore, external inputs dissolve into distinct modules in the brain. In the visual system, photoreceptors connect to columns located around the target region, thereby preserving the spatial relationships between the visual world and its representation in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huberman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sanes and Zipursky, 2010</xref>). Layers separate the brain into horizontal planes, whereas columnar units group the axons into bundles that are perpendicular to the layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clandinin and Zipursky, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mountcastle, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sanes and Zipursky, 2010</xref>). The integration of the individual column and layer processes enables the modular processing of perceived information. Thus, specific layer-column axonal targeting to unique synaptic partners is a fundamental step in the complex formation of functional neuronal networks inside the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huberman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Luo and Flanagan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Millard and Pecot, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">NÃ©riec and Desplan, 2016</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> visual system is an attractive model for studying the formation of the functional organization of synaptic connections because its optic ganglion has a layered and columnar structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hadjieconomou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Millard and Pecot, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sanes and Zipursky, 2010</xref>). The visual system of the adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> consists of the compound eye and four optic ganglia (in order: lamina, medulla, and lobula complex). The compound eye is composed of an array of approximately 800 ommatidia, each containing eight photoreceptor cells (R cells, R1âR8) arranged in a stereotypic pattern. R7 and R8 axons project to the second optic ganglion, namely, the medulla. The medulla is subdivided into columnar units and 10 distinct layers. R7, R8, and Mi1 axons elongate into the medulla at the earliest stage. They function as the pioneering axons during the formation of the medulla columns, which are comprised of approximately 100 different axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Trush et al., 2019</xref>). R8 extends its axon to a single medulla column, followed by a single R7 axon. Eventually, R8 targets the M3 layer of the medulla, whereas R7 targets the M6 layer. Across development, the R8 neurons undergo three stages of axonal targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akin and Zipursky, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hadjieconomou et al., 2011</xref>). First, single R8 axons project to a single column and form a horseshoe-shaped terminal that encircles the medulla columnar center (phase 1: third instar larva). Second, the R8 axons remain at the medulla neuropil surface without bundling with each other (phase 2: 24%Â APF [<underline>A</underline>fter <underline>P</underline>uparium <underline>F</underline>ormation]). Third, R8 axons extend filopodia to target the M3 layer (phase 3: 48%Â APF). Many studies have detailed the molecular mechanisms that underlie the layer-specific targeting of R neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akin and Zipursky, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hadjieconomou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hakeda-Suzuki and Suzuki, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hakeda-Suzuki et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kulkarni et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mencarelli and Pichaud, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Millard and Pecot, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ãzel et al., 2015</xref>). However, little is known about the formation of the medulla columnar structure.</p><p>Previous work in our lab identified a single transmembrane protein, Golden goal (Gogo), by a large-scale screen to search for genes that control R axon pathfinding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berger et al., 2008</xref>). Functional studies have revealed that Gogo, with the atypical cadherin Flamingo (Fmi), guides R8 axons to the M3 layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hakeda-Suzuki et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Senti et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tomasi et al., 2008</xref>). Gogo and Fmi colocalization is essential for this function. The R8 axons of <italic>gogo</italic> or <italic>fmi</italic> single mutants exhibit similar phenotypes, including defects in the axonal array due to the irregular distances between axons and the difficulty in targeting the M3 layer. Furthermore, the dephosphorylated state of a triplet Tyr-Tyr-Asp (YYD) motif in the Gogo cytoplasmic domain is important for R8 axon targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mann et al., 2012</xref>). However, when the YYD motif is phosphorylated, Gogo appears to interfere with the ability of the R8 axon to target the M3 layer. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> insulin receptor (DInR), a tyrosine kinase receptor, is one of the kinases that phosphorylate the YYD motif of Gogo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mann et al., 2012</xref>). A growing number of recent studies have revealed the functional involvement of DInR in nervous system development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fernandes et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rossi and Fernandes, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Song et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, DInR may be one mechanism through which Gogo and Fmi regulate R8 axon pathfinding. Because Gogo and Fmi are conserved across <italic>C. elegans</italic> to humans, elucidating their role in development in <italic>Drosophila</italic> can greatly enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of development in higher-order species.</p><p>The current study was able to examine stepwise R8 axonal targeting events across development by following protein localization and by specifically controlling Gogo and Fmi levels in R8 axons. In phase 1, Gogo and Fmi cooperated in guiding the R8 growth cone to its correct place inside the column (<italic>gogo</italic> function 1). In phase 2, Gogo was phosphorylated by the glial insulin signal and began to counteract Fmi to repress filopodia extension (<italic>gogo</italic> function 2). In phase 3, R8 axons only expressed Fmi, which directed them to the M3 layer (no <italic>gogo</italic> function). These results indicate that the glial insulin signal controls Gogo phosphorylation, thereby regulating growth cone dynamics, including the formation of the horseshoe shape and filopodia extension. Overall, this regulates axon-column and axon-axon interactions. Gogo possesses an interesting property wherein the phosphorylation states maintain two separate axon pathfinding functions. This is an economical strategy for increasing protein functions when there are a limited number of genes. As a result, this mechanism maintains the regular distance between R8 axons and enables the ordered R8 axonal targeting of the column.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Gogo expression, but not Fmi expression, ceases around the midpupal stage</title><p>During development, Gogo and Fmi proteins are expressed broadly and dynamically in photoreceptors and the optic lobe. To monitor the precise expression and localization patterns of Gogo and Fmi proteins during R8 axonal targeting, knock-in flies that tag the desired proteins in a cell-specific manner with GFP or mCherry were generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kondo and Ueda, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sander and Joung, 2014</xref>). The use of these flies allowed the observation of endogenous R8 axon-specific Gogo and Fmi localization across the developmental stages between the third instar larvae and adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Gogo protein was strongly expressed in the tip of R8 axons during developmental phases 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1CâE</xref>). Contrary to previous hypotheses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hakeda-Suzuki et al., 2011</xref>), Gogo protein was not present during phase 3, when R8 axons filopodia elongate toward the deeper medulla layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Conversely, Fmi-mCherry expression in R8 axons was observed throughout the development stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1HâK</xref>). Fmi was localized in the R8 axon tip, including thin filopodia structures during phase 3, when Gogo expression was not present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). Gogo and Fmi protein localization in the R8 axon tip during phase 1 essentially overlapped, although there were several characteristic differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1MâP</xref>). Gogo-GFP signal was relatively weak in the filopodia, but accumulated at the rim of the horseshoe-shaped axon terminal that encircled the medulla columnar center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Mâ, N</xref>). On the other hand, Fmi-mCherry signal was widely distributed in the R8 axon terminal, including filopodia-like protrusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Mâ, N</xref>). These protein localization data indicate that Gogo and Fmi functionally cooperate, so that R8 axons recognize the center of the medulla column during phase 1. The results indicate that Fmi alone promotes vertical filopodia elongation into the M3 layer during phase 3.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>R8-specific labeling of Gogo and Fmi.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematics of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> visual system in the third instar larva and the adult.

In this knockdowns, R8 axon Fmi localization was weaker in the filopodia tips and accumulated in the axon termini stalk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F and G</xref>). R8 axon Gogo localization was more diffuse throughout the entire termini structure, including the filopodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H and I</xref>). These localization changes indicate that Gogo and Fmi relocate from the R8 axon horseshoe rim to other regions when R8 axon Fmi cannot bind to glial Fmi. These results also indicate that the in trans interaction between glial Fmi and R8 Gogo/Fmi mediates precise R8 axon recognition of the medulla columnar center, including the formation of a horseshoe structure. Therefore, the phenotypes described here may be the consequence of the specific interruption of function 1, but not function 2 of Gogo. In other words, this glial Fmi and R8 Gogo interaction is mediated by non-phosphorylated Gogo, and later the phosphorylation of Gogo switches the Gogo/Fmi function from âcollaborativeâ (function 1) to âantagonisticâ (function 2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these results suggest that the glial insulin signal controls the phosphorylation status of Gogo, which regulates the growth cone dynamics of R8 and mediates axon-glia and axon-axon interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

During phase 2, Gogo is phosphorylated by the insulin signal derived from the surface and cortex glia. Phosphorylated Gogo antagonizes Fmi via Hts (adducin) to suppress filopodia extension. During phase 3, Gogo is no longer expressed in R8 axons; therefore, Fmi alone navigates R8 axons to the M3 layer.

Moreover, the RNAi knockdown of components that are thought to regulate the dendrite formation downstream of Fmi, such as PCP complexes and G alpha proteins, did not result in defective R8 axon targeting phenotypes (data not shown). Functionally, the deletion of the intracellular domain of Fmi can promote filopodia elongation but does not mediate column center encircling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1GâI</xref>). Given that the Gogo cytoplasmic domain is also required for column center encircling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), the Gogo/Fmi interaction in phase 1 may send signals via both Gogo and Fmi cytoplasmic domains.</p><p>Previous studies have reported that Gogo/Fmi co-overexpression in R7 axons redirects them to the M3 layer. This occurs when GogoFFD, but not GogoDDD, is expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mann et al., 2012</xref>).

This indicates that Gogo/Fmi co-overexpression does not form a code for M3 targeting but promotes cytoskeletal reorganization, which might lead to R7 axon retraction. Consistent with this idea, R7 retraction was recapitulated by overexpressing Rho by using GMR-Rho1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1F</xref>).

This cytoskeletal reorganization mediated by GogoFFD might regulate the cytoskeleton in a similar manner when R8 axon Gogo/Fmi interact with glial Fmi to form the horseshoe structure during phase 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>).

These observations suggest that Gogo/Fmi is not only interacting with glial Fmi, but the Gogo ligand (factor X) exists on the glial membrane and interacts with Gogo as Gogo/factor X, in addition to the Fmi/Fmi interaction. The functional role of factor X on glial cells is unknown. Therefore, it is important to identify the role of factor X to reveal the functional significance of glial-derived signaling during phase 1 of R8 axon targeting.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Temporal and spatial regulation of Gogo phosphorylation status by glia</title><p>In phase 1, R8 axons interact with Fmi on glialÂ cells.

However, insulin expression started at the transcriptional level during phase 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1H and I</xref>); therefore, the temporal relationship of Gogo phosphorylation and insulin expression onset does not match apparently.</p><p>One explanation is that it is regulated via changes in the relative position between the glia and medulla during development. Glial position changes across phases 1 to 2 as the entire brain structure changes. There is a huge distance between glia and the medulla neuropil during phase 1 that drastically shrinks by phase 2. This physical distance between glia and R8 axon termini might influence the reception efficiency of insulin.</p><p>The second explanation is that there might be a slow transition between the non-phosphorylated state to the phosphorylated state. Gogo coexists as two phosphorylated states in the tip of R8 axons when R8 axons reach the medulla column. Only the microlocalization of the two phosphorylated states might be differently regulated. The shape of the growth cone was shown to be different between GogoFFD rescue and wildÂ type rescue in the <italic>gogo</italic> mutant during phase 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and D</xref>). This difference might be due to Gogo phosphorylation and may occur even in wildÂ type overexpression that gained the ability to suppress filopodia extension in phase 1.</p><p>The transition of total Gogo protein levels in the R8 axons also appeared to be slow. This is based on the observation that <italic>gogo</italic>-Gal4 strain, in which Gal4 is knocked into the <italic>gogo</italic> intron locus by using the MiMIC system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Venken et al., 2011</xref>), loses GFP protein levels (monitored by UAS-mCD8GFP, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>) gradually, similar to the gradual decrease of Gogo-GFP fusion protein during the midpupal stages. This indicates that Gogo protein perdurance is similar to mCD8GFP and is not actively degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. In summary, in contrast to the stepwise regulation of R8 axon extension that occurs in precise temporal phases, the slow transition of Gogo phosphorylation and the protein level decrease seem not to be the only regulatory signals that determine whether R8 axons are extended or not.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Gogo acts antagonistically against Fmi in R8 axon-axon interactions in function 2 (phase 2)</title><p>Filopodia are formed by actin polymerization.

The overexpression of Hts in R8 axons alone did not prevent R8 filopodia extension, thus suggesting that phosphorylated Gogo is required. However, a previous cell culture study demonstrated that physical Gogo/Hts interactions take place regardless of the phosphorylation status of the YYD motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mann et al., 2012</xref>). This suggests that phosphorylated Gogo regulates Hts enzymatic activity rather than binding.

This type of Ser/Thr kinase activation might occur in conjunction with the activation of the Tyr kinase that phosphorylates the Gogo YYD motif.

Few proteins have two distinct functions that are independently assigned to phosphorylation status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2018</xref>), and the current study demonstrates that Gogo is one of them. This mechanism is of great interest from a genomic economy point of view, where the animal genome takes an economical strategy to maximize protein functions and networks with a limited number of genes. The genomic economical strategy was likely important in the establishment of complex functional neuronal circuits during the evolution of higher-order species. Therefore, this mechanism is highly likely to be conserved across species.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly strains and genetics</title><p>Flies were kept in standard <italic>Drosophila</italic> media at 25Â°C unless otherwise indicated.

to our understanding of how neurons and glia interact during <italic>Drosophila</italic> optic lobe development. It makes the remarkable finding that the cell adhesion protein, Gogo, that interacts with an atypical cadherin, Fmi, switches from cooperating with Fmi to opposing it during development. This switch in function appears to be controlled by Gogo phosphorylation by the insulin receptor in response to a signal from glial cells.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editorsâ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Glial insulin regulates cooperative or antagonistic Golden goal/Flamingo interactions during photoreceptor axon guidance&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by a Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Thomas Hummel (Reviewer #1); Franck Pichaud (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. As you know, this is a critical and unique part of the <italic>eLife</italic> process and allows the reviewers to discuss their opinion, to realize things they might have missed or to correct opinions. Based on an intense discussion on your paper and on the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers did find the topic to be of significant interest but several serious issues preclude publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, if you were able on the future to address these concerns, we would be happy to receive a new submission that could be processed fairly quickly.</p><p>The main issues are as follows:</p><p>- The evidence supporting a switch in function for Gogo with respect to Fmi is not strong enough. The main evidence is based on genetic interactions and it is not clear that the three step mechanism can explain pathfinding.</p><p>The reviewers were all concerned about step 2 and would have liked to see better arguments to support and explain what this step two is, and how one specific step is affected by another.</p><p>- Although the role of Insulin-induced phopshorylation and that fact that Gogo function is regulated by the insulin pathway are an exciting phenomenon, this was already published in your own paper in 2012 and is thus not totally new, even though the source of the signal was now identified.</p><p>- The paper lacks quantification and some of the manipulations that are not specific enough to lead to strong conclusions (eg hobbit).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The study by Suzuki and colleagues addresses the developmental assembly of afferent axons into columnar circuit units, a highly conserved structural feature throughout nervous systems. Previous work has identified a close functional interaction between the two transmembrane proteins FMI and GOGO in <italic>Drosophila</italic> columnar photoreceptor targeting and the current study provides novel insights in the temporal dynamics and cellular interactions of this molecular cross talk. Based on gene expression analysis, genetic interaction studies and cell type specific manipulations the authors could show that GOGO modulates FMI activity in specific developmental steps and that glial cells play in important role in neuronal GOGO-FMI modulation.</p><p>The manuscript is well written and the presented data are of high quality. The generation of novel sophisticated genetic tools allows a detailed analysis of the sequential cellular interaction and provides a new level of understanding about the complexity and hierarchy of neuronal connectivity development. However, regarding the proposed mechanism, the manuscript could be more convincing by addressing some issues regarding the function of GOGO in the second step of axon targeting and the role of insulin signaling and FMI adhesion in axon-glia interaction.</p><p>While the localization of the synergistic role of GOGO in supporting FMI adhesion is convincing and in is in line of what has been demonstrated before, the proposed subsequent antagonistic activity seems less clear. First of all, regarding the subdivision of R cell targeting into 3 consecutive steps, step1 â axon targeting â and step 3 â axon vertical extension â are well justified as distinct morphological processes but what is happening at step 2? The manuscript makes different statements about step 2, like R8 axons remain at the medulla neuropil surface in the introduction or proper filopodia extension in the phenotype description. The failure to suppress inappropriate horizontal filopodia extensions in GOGO mutants seems a direct consequence of the axon-glia adhesion defects in step 1, which later result in multi-axon columns. Therefore if step 2 is better defined as a developmental process, the importance of the proposed antagonistic GOGO function will become more logical. Alternatively, without step 2 a simplified model with a singular function of GOGO in supporting FMI-mediated axon-glia interaction at step 1, which is then followed by the GOGO downregulation due to glia-induced DILR signaling seems equally likely. In addition, as there is no GOGO expression at step3, it doesn't make sense to investigate the role of Gogo during step3 or conclude that Gogo and Fmi function in opposing manners during step 3 of R8 axon targeting. The fact that prolonged GOGO expression stabilizes the initial axon targeting step is in lines with a mechanisms which simply removes GOGO from the FMI-mediated axon-glia contact thereby allowing further axon extension.</p><p>Regarding the functional activity of GOGO at step 2, the main data supporting a switch from cooperation into an antogonistic function are derived from different sets of genetic interaction studies, with double knock down are only analyzed for step 1 indicating synergistic interactions and combined OE and KD are only shown for step 2 concluding antagonistic effects of GOGO on FMI. To exclude a different effect of the genetic manipulation and further support of a stage-specific change in GOGO activity, the modulation of the FMI GOF phenotype should be analyzed in step 1 and the single gene and double knock down could be targeted to stage 2 using the Gal80ts method. Similarly, in the localization of phosphorylated GOGO, a direct comparison of mutant rescue in step 1 and GOF modification for step 2 is problematic to conclude a differential requirement. Here the same experiments should be conducted for all developmental time points. In addition, as there is no direct result provided that the phosphorylation status of GOGO changes in step2, this central statement by the authors is only built on the genetic interaction studies and needs additional experimental data.</p><p>The role of insulin signaling by glial cells in controlling axon targeting is a key aspect of the manuscript and clearly the main conceptual novelty. Covered by the last two paragraphs, the analysis largely relies on phenotypic similarities and no functional interactions. More importantly, the fact that no candidate signal could be identified makes the main conclusion regarding the non-autonomous regulation problematic at this point and should be analyzed further.</p><p>As glial cells support R cell axon guidance from the initial outgrowth all the way into the optic lobes, the R8 axons connectivity phenotypes induced by the different genetic manipulation of the insulin pathway and FMI adhesion might be an indirect consequence of earlier disturbances, like the disruption of the precise temporal ingrowth or selective axon fasciculation. Here, a more in-depth developmental analysis would be further strengthened the main conclusion of the manuscript.</p><p>First, for all gene disruption experiments and glia cell manipulation, phenotype analysis should be extended to late third instar and early pupal stages, to support the sequential activity of FMI and Insulin signaling in axon columnar connectivity. In addition, experiments could be targeted specifically to the pupal stage leaving the initial axon targeting unaffected. Second, as little is known about the role of glial cells at this stage, it would be very helpful to provide more insights into the developmental profile of glial cell morphology and the sequence of axon glia interactions. When do glial cell processes enter the medulla column? What is the spatial organization of growth cone and glial processes. How dynamic is glial cell morphology from initial axon targeting to vertical extension?

In WT, R8 do not extend filopodia till after 36h APF and they do not stabilize and elongate till after 46h APF (Orkun and Zipursky, 2016).

For eg. In Figure 5âfigure supplement panel F: authors refer to fmi- + fmiÏC as non-rescue, where I think there is rescue. Increase in the gain of the green R cell channel obscures the horse-shoe shape of R8 and thus looks like there is no rescue when actually there is (compare the 1st and the 3rd panel in this set).</p><p>5) M1 and M3 layers should be marked in all image panels.</p><p>6) Instead of referring as step1, 2 etc â it is hard to follow the various steps especially since the main data points are at L3, 24h APF and 48h APF.

Don't understand what is happening in H. Do those axons stop at M3? If Gogo OE gives an Fmi mutant like phenotype with stopping at M1, shouldn't Fmi+Gogo OE give the same?

It seems like fmi overexpression might alter R8 morphology resulting in altered Gogo localization as a secondary consequence.</p><p>b) Panels A-H: Gogo and Fmi localization in the mutants vs overexpression in L3: it is hard to understand when the authors call Fmi/Gogo is mislocalized vs unaltered b/c there is no quantitation or obvious differences to make that determination.</p><p>c) Panels I-J: Since there is an increase in filopodial extension at 24h APF in Fmi overexpression only in R8 axons, authors should quantitate that R8 overexpression phenotype (as measured by % columns with Gogo-containing filopodia going past correct layer.</p><p>Figure 5:</p><p>a) Panels A-F: This is informative data regarding structure-function analysis of Gogo protein in defining R8 morphology in L3, but WT control is missing in panel F graph (and should be shown for reference).</p><p>b) Panels G-L: Effect on R8 premature filopodial extension at 24h APF when Gogo variants are overexpressed in all PRs: Interesting data, but needs wild-type control.</p><p>c) Panels M-P: do these get fixed at later developmental stages in gogo mutant?

This is why I do not suggest additional experiments..</p><p>This is an interesting study by a group that are experts in studying how the transmembrane proteins Gogo and Fmi regulate targeting of the R8 axon in the fly visual system. The present work builds upon previous studies from the lab. Overall the data quality is excellent. The key observation here is that the phosphorylation status of Gogo seems to act as a switch and is required during distinct phases of R8 projection. Secretion from glial cells, and also Fmi expression in these cells, is required for proper R8 projection. These observations are interesting. However, the study suffers from significant draw backs that unfortunately prevent me from supporting it for publication at this stage.</p><p>Firstly, this study presents significant overlap with a previous paper from the lab (Mann, 2012) that reported Gogo phosphorylation/dephosphorylation regulation by the insulin pathway, and showed that this is required for proper R8 projection in the fly visual system. While the present work looks at how these phenotypes develop through time, the idea that phosphorylation of Gogo might be regulated by Dilps and that it might change Gogo's function during R8 pathfinding is not new.</p><p>I also think that there is a need to better define and present the evidence for a switch in function for Gogo with respect to Fmi. Similarly, the authors should also make it clearer the extent to which Steps 1-3 are interdependent (or not). Isn't it possible that if step 1 fails, then 2 and 3 will also fail as a consequence? This is important because the authors tend to present these steps as relatively independent, but it is not made clear why they hold that view.</p><p>The work also feels very qualitative, especially Figure 1, and Figure 4. The authors conclusion would be greatly strengthened by providing quantifications next to the panels. I feel that given this is a relatively well-studied model system, the authors should try to come up with a better way to quantify the shape and location of the R8 termini. This would make it convincing and could even reveal new interesting features of the phenotype (and wild type).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.66718.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editorsâ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration. What follows is the authorsâ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The study by Suzuki and colleagues addresses the developmental assembly of afferent axons into columnar circuit units, a highly conserved structural feature throughout nervous systems. Previous work has identified a close functional interaction between the two transmembrane proteins FMI and GOGO in Drosophila columnar photoreceptor targeting and the current study provides novel insights in the temporal dynamics and cellular interactions of this molecular cross talk. Based on gene expression analysis, genetic interaction studies and cell type specific manipulations the authors could show that GOGO modulates FMI activity in specific developmental steps and that glial cells play in important role in neuronal GOGO-FMI modulation.</p><p>The manuscript is well written and the presented data are of high quality. The generation of novel sophisticated genetic tools allows a detailed analysis of the sequential cellular interaction and provides a new level of understanding about the complexity and hierarchy of neuronal connectivity development. However, regarding the proposed mechanism, the manuscript could be more convincing by addressing some issues regarding the function of GOGO in the second step of axon targeting and the role of insulin signaling and FMI adhesion in axon-glia interaction.</p><p>While the localization of the synergistic role of GOGO in supporting FMI adhesion is convincing and in is in line of what has been demonstrated before, the proposed subsequent antagonistic activity seems less clear. First of all, regarding the subdivision of R cell targeting into 3 consecutive steps, step1 â axon targeting â and step 3 â axon vertical extension â are well justified as distinct morphological processes but what is happening at step 2? The manuscript makes different statements about step 2, like R8 axons remain at the medulla neuropil surface in the introduction or proper filopodia extension in the phenotype description. The failure to suppress inappropriate horizontal filopodia extensions in GOGO mutants seems a direct consequence of the axon-glia adhesion defects in step 1, which later result in multi-axon columns. Therefore if step 2 is better defined as a developmental process, the importance of the proposed antagonistic GOGO function will become more logical. Alternatively, without step 2 a simplified model with a singular function of GOGO in supporting FMI-mediated axon-glia interaction at step 1, which is then followed by the GOGO downregulation due to glia-induced DILR signaling seems equally likely. In addition, as there is no GOGO expression at step3, it doesn't make sense to investigate the role of Gogo during step3 or conclude that Gogo and Fmi function in opposing manners during step 3 of R8 axon targeting. The fact that prolonged GOGO expression stabilizes the initial axon targeting step is in lines with a mechanisms which simply removes GOGO from the FMI-mediated axon-glia contact thereby allowing further axon extension.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comments. While we fully understand the reviewer's point, we still believe that step (phase) 2 exists, and that it is required for normal R8 axon targeting. For that, we have the following 4 lines of evidence:</p><p>1) Glial <italic>fmi</italic> loss-of-function mutation disrupted the horseshoe shape at phase 1, but not bundling at phase 2. We have added this data to Figure 7Câ and Dâ.</p><p>2) The nonphosphorylated GogoFFD rescue was not perfect, and there was still some axonal bundling, shown in Figure 5O.</p><p>3) We also added an experiment as suggested below by the reviewer: the phase 2-specific <italic>gogo</italic> RNAi knockdown experiment using Gal80<sup>ts</sup>. As we anticipated, the <italic>gogo</italic> LOF phenotype characterized by longer filopodia in more radial directions, was also observed in the phase 2-specific <italic>gogo</italic> knockdown, suggesting that the defects of Gogo LOF in phase 2 are independent of phase 1. We described these results in Figure 2O-P''.</p><p>4) The DInR LOF mutant does not have defects in phase 1 (horseshoe shape), but exhibits a bundling phenotype in phase 2 (Figure 6A and Figure 6B, respectively). Therefore, there exists a signaling molecule that specifically regulates only phase 2, but not phase 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding the functional activity of GOGO at step 2, the main data supporting a switch from cooperation into an antogonistic function are derived from different sets of genetic interaction studies, with double knock down are only analyzed for step 1 indicating synergistic interactions and combined OE and KD are only shown for step 2 concluding antagonistic effects of GOGO on FMI.</p></disp-quote><p>We have already included &quot;combined OE and KD in phase 1<italic>â</italic> in Figure 3-figure supplement 1I-L).</p><p>Images of phase 2 in the double knockdown mutants have also been added to Figure 3-figure supplement 1H). Here we demonstrate that <italic>fmi</italic> LOF can suppress the bundling phenotype of <italic>gogo</italic> LOF in phase 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To exclude a different effect of the genetic manipulation and further support of a stage-specific change in GOGO activity, the modulation of the FMI GOF phenotype should be analyzed in step 1.</p></disp-quote><p>These data were included in Figure 3âfigure supplement 1I and K in the previous version. Here we showed that, during phase 1, Fmi OE &amp; <italic>gogo</italic> LOF showed much greater filopodia extension with a disrupted horseshoe shape compared to mere Fmi OE. We believe the reason why the filopodia are affected even in phase 1 is because the function of <italic>gogo</italic> cannot be separated perfectly with phases or time, but rather the shift may happen gradually, and species in either phase might coexist or be loosely separated in a spatial manner (e.g. from the growth cone rim at the column center to the filopodia towards outside) at certain time points between phase 1 and phase 2. We discuss this issue in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â¦and the single gene and double knock down could be targeted to stage 2 using the Gal80ts method.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their helpful suggestions. As mentioned above, we have addressed the question of âwhat is step 2? &quot; by adding additional characterization data. We added an experiment conducting a stage-specific <italic>gogo</italic> knockdown experiment using Gal80<sup>ts</sup>. As we anticipated, the <italic>gogo</italic> LOF phenotype characterized by longer filopodia in more radial directions was also observed in step 2-specific <italic>gogo</italic> knockdowns, suggesting that step 2 is independent of step 1. These results are displayed in Figure 2O-P''.</p><p>We observed that adding <italic>fmi</italic> LOF suppressed the <italic>gogo</italic> LOF bundling phenotype, as shown in Figure 3âfigure supplement 1F-H. We could not conduct double LOF Gal80<sup>ts</sup> experiments as it was prohibitively highly technically demanding to transfect Gal80<sup>ts</sup> on top of a double LOF. We believe that it is sufficient to show the antagonistic effect in phase 2 in double LOF mutants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, in the localization of phosphorylated GOGO, a direct comparison of mutant rescue in step 1 and GOF modification for step 2 is problematic to conclude a differential requirement. Here the same experiments should be conducted for all developmental time points.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the DDD rescue in phase 2 to Figure 5P, and FFD DDD OE in phase 1 to Figure 5âfigure supplement 1F in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, as there is no direct result provided that the phosphorylation status of GOGO changes in step2, this central statement by the authors is only built on the genetic interaction studies and needs additional experimental data.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that there is no direct result showing the change in phosphorylation status in phase 2. In spite of our efforts to generate phospho-specific Gogo antibodies, we could not observe staining in tissue samples. We only could show that the phosphorylated form existed in larval eye discs, as in our previous paper (Mann et al., 2012). As we argued in the Discussion section, the change in phosphorylation status can be very slow, or does not necessarily even happen, as spatial separation throughout the phases can also theoretically achieve the proper R8 targeting.</p><p>Similarly, when we overexpressed Gogo in phase 1 in a <italic>fmi</italic> LOF background, we observed filopodia suppression, which is the Gogo function normally seen in phase 1 (Figure 3âfigure supplement 1J-L). Again, we believe that the function of Gogo cannot be separated perfectly by phase or by time, but rather we think that the shift happens gradually, and both species may co-exist at certain time points. We discuss this issue further in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The role of insulin signaling by glial cells in controlling axon targeting is a key aspect of the manuscript and clearly the main conceptual novelty. Covered by the last two paragraphs, the analysis largely relies on phenotypic similarities and no functional interactions. More importantly, the fact that no candidate signal could be identified makes the main conclusion regarding the non-autonomous regulation problematic at this point and should be analyzed further.</p></disp-quote><p>We determined a genetic interaction between <italic>dilp6</italic> and <italic>fmi</italic> in a glia-specific manner, indicating that <italic>dilp6</italic> is at least indirectly involved in this signal. The details of the experiments are explained below, and the additional data has been added to Figure 6N-Q.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As glial cells support R cell axon guidance from the initial outgrowth all the way into the optic lobes, the R8 axons connectivity phenotypes induced by the different genetic manipulation of the insulin pathway and FMI adhesion might be an indirect consequence of earlier disturbances, like the disruption of the precise temporal ingrowth or selective axon fasciculation. Here, a more in-depth developmental analysis would be further strengthened the main conclusion of the manuscript.</p><p>First, for all gene disruption experiments and glia cell manipulation, phenotype analysis should be extended to late third instar and early pupal stages, to support the sequential activity of FMI and Insulin signaling in axon columnar connectivity. In addition, experiments could be targeted specifically to the pupal stage leaving the initial axon targeting unaffected.</p></disp-quote><p>First, we would like to point out that the glia that guide R8 axons to the center of the column (Figure 7B, C; phase 1) and the glia that mediate insulin secretion (Figure 6âfigure supplement 1H and I; phase 1- 2) are different population of cells. Therefore, we respectfully disagree with the reviewer that the initial defect in glia population 1 can result in the defects in glia population 2.</p><p>To clarify this point, as pointed out by the reviewer, we have added images of glial-specific <italic>fmi</italic> LOF mutants at APF24% and DInR R8 LOF mutants at third instar (horseshoe morphology) to Figures6 and Figure 7.</p><p>Glial-specific <italic>fmi</italic> LOF mutation disrupted the horseshoe shape in phase 1, but phase 2 appeared perfectly normal, while DInR R8 LOF mutants at the third instar showed normal phase 1 but disrupted phase 2 morphology (bundling). Since these two genes (<italic>fmi</italic> and InR) showed very different LOF phenotypes in different phases, we do not believe that the first defect (Fmi) can be the source of the other defects observed later in the system.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, as little is known about the role of glial cells at this stage, it would be very helpful to provide more insights into the developmental profile of glial cell morphology and the sequence of axon glia interactions. When do glial cell processes enter the medulla column? What is the spatial organization of growth cone and glial processes. How dynamic is glial cell morphology from initial axon targeting to vertical extension?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this encouraging comment. We have shown the sequential organization in Figure 7A, since the medulla contains a relatively wide span of R8 axons of different ages. We also added the text below to explain when the glial process enters the column in the Results section. In the oldest glia column, the glia extension appears to have begun retracting (Figure 7A, yellow arrow). We also added an image of APF24% Loco-Gal4 UAS-mCD8::GFP to observe the development of these glia. The column-center glia were retracted at least to the M1 layer (this description was added to the Results section). After that time point, we are not confident about what happens to the column-center glia, due to the lack of specific promoter drivers to follow.</p><p>We added the following text to the result section:</p><p>âThe glial protrusion seems to extend into the medulla layers as early as the R8 growth cone enters (arrowhead in Figure 7A). The protrusion passes the R8 growth cone and extends deeply to the medulla layers. However, it starts to retracts towards the latest period of third instar larvae (yellow arrow in Figure 7A), and completely retracted from the medullar layers in APF24% (phase 2) (Figure 7Câ).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, to further test for putative redundant dilp gene function, combined gene knock down experiments and genetic interaction studies, e.g. in an GOGO-FMI sensitized background could be performed. Are dilp mutants available?</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned in the text, the <italic>dilp6</italic> mutant alone does not display any defects in R8 axon targeting. However, thanks to the reviewer's suggestion, we performed additional experiments in a sensitized background and looked for genetic interactions. To overcome the redundancy of <italic>dilp</italic> function, we utilized the Fmi OE as a sensitized background to explore GOGO-FMI function.</p><p>Fmi OE already demonstrated extended filopodia, counteracting the putative phosphorylated Gogo function. In this situation, if <italic>dilp</italic> signal gets weaker, the phosphorylated Gogo should be reduced and will have more filopodia extension. To test this hypothesis, we knocked down <italic>dilp6</italic> only in glial cells in the Fmi OE background. We observed a significant enhancement in filopodia extension compared to the control, indicating that <italic>dilp6</italic> from glial cells likely affects filopodia extension through GOGO phosphorylation.</p><p>The additional data has been added to Figure 6 as N-Q.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This is an interesting story.

I would refer to the phenotype at 24h APF as premature filopodial extension, which can be easily distinguished in these images. In WT, R8 do not extend filopodia till after 36h APF and they do not stabilize and elongate till after 46h APF (Orkun and Zipursky, 2016). If there is &quot;axon bundling&quot; (which is not visible in the current figures) a higher magnification would help show that phenotype in detail.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer, and have changed the figure titles to read âratio of R8 axon invasionâ for all of these phenotypes. We also observed that the R8 axon terminals could not line up at the M0 layer at APF24% (phase 2), and invaded the medulla layers. Since this type of invasion generally coincides with axonal bundling and disorganization of the growth cone distances, we hypothesized that the invasion was likely to be an indirect consequence of the disorganization and bundling of R8 axons, which is consistent with our finding that in the <italic>gogo</italic> mutant, filopodia extension could not be suppressed.</p><p>We have added magnified images to Figure 2Eâ-Gâ, and also changed the titles of the quantification graphs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The phenotype identified in L3 as &quot;correct axon targeting&quot; (or &quot;mistargeting at column&quot; in Figure 3 graph) should be defined as R8 terminal morphology, which can be either horseshoe-shaped or oval morphology.</p></disp-quote><p>We have adopted this change to âR8 axon terminal morphologyâ, as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>a) Authors should also show the N-Cadherin panel so that readers can see what the cross-sections of the columns look like in the different genotypes.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added these panels to Figure 2A-C and Figure 3A-D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) They should quantitate this, maybe by using the diameter of the column to normalize for the various genetic combinations.</p></disp-quote><p>We have quantified the diameter of the columns of <italic>gogo</italic> or <italic>fmi</italic> LOF mutants, shown in Figure 2A-C.

Only Mi1 is known to arrive earlier than R8, which makes it hard to imagine that R8 is already affected by the columnar structure which is shaped by R8 itself. It is more natural to interpret that glial Fmi guides R8 axons through homophilic interaction mediated by Fmi.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>I am reviewing this paper with the view that it is probably not an option to perform experiments at this time, while still making sure that the authors conclusions are well supported by the data presented in the paper. This is why I do not suggest additional experiments..</p><p>This is an interesting study by a group that are experts in studying how the transmembrane proteins Gogo and Fmi regulate targeting of the R8 axon in the fly visual system. The present work builds upon previous studies from the lab. Overall the data quality is excellent. The key observation here is that the phosphorylation status of Gogo seems to act as a switch and is required during distinct phases of R8 projection. Secretion from glial cells, and also Fmi expression in these cells, is required for proper R8 projection. These observations are interesting. However, the study suffers from significant draw backs that unfortunately prevent me from supporting it for publication at this stage.</p><p>Firstly, this study presents significant overlap with a previous paper from the lab (Mann, 2012) that reported Gogo phosphorylation/dephosphorylation regulation by the insulin pathway, and showed that this is required for proper R8 projection in the fly visual system. While the present work looks at how these phenotypes develop through time, the idea that phosphorylation of Gogo might be regulated by Dilps and that it might change Gogo's function during R8 pathfinding is not new.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the current study has some overlap with the former publication, as this study is a continuation of the previous study; however, the current manuscript has made the following significant conceptual advances:</p><p>1) Gogo and Fmi protein localizations are now visualized.</p><p>2) As we have obtained a new marker for R8 during pupal stages, the true function of <italic>gogo</italic> in developmental stages is now known to be recognizing the column center (glia) in phase 1, and antagonizing filopodia extension in phase 2. These functions are specifically controlled by the phosphorylated species of Gogo.</p><p>3) New functionality for Fmi in column center glia has been discovered.</p><p>4) The source and ligand are now revealed as Dilp6 from glial cells.</p><p>In addition, the genetic evidence of <italic>dilp6</italic> from glial cells as the ligand is newly added to the current version of the manuscript. We hope altogether that the current form of the manuscript contains enough evidence to not only understand the function of Gogo and R8 axon pathfinding, but to convince the reviewers of the elucidated mechanisms of axon guidance and layer-specific targeting in the complex nervous system.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I also think that there is a need to better define and present the evidence for a switch in function for Gogo with respect to Fmi. Similarly, the authors should also make it clearer the extent to which Steps 1-3 are interdependent (or not). Isn't it possible that if step 1 fails, then 2 and 3 will also fail as a consequence? This is important because the authors tend to present these steps as relatively independent, but it is not made clear why they hold that view.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a valid point, and we have addressed this issue by generating a phase 2-specific knockdown of <italic>gogo</italic>, as explained above.</p><p>We still believe that phase 2 exists, and that it is required for normal R8 axon targeting, based on the following 4 lines of evidence:</p><p>1) Glial <italic>fmi</italic> loss-of-function mutation disrupted the horseshoe shape at phase 1, but not bundling at phase 2. We have added this data to Figure 7Câ and Dâ.</p><p>2) The nonphosphorylated GogoFFD rescue was not perfect, and there was still some axonal bundling, shown in Figure 5O.</p><p>3) We also added an experiment suggested below by the reviewer: the phase 2-specific <italic>gogo</italic> RNAi knockdown experiment using Gal80<sup>ts</sup>. As we anticipated, the <italic>gogo</italic> LOF phenotype, characterized by longer filopodia in more radial directions, was also observed in the phase 2-specific <italic>gogo</italic> knockdown, suggesting that the defects of Gogo LOF in phase 2 are independent of phase 1. We describe these results in Figure 2O-P''.</p><p>4) The DInR LOF mutant does not have defects in phase 1 (horseshoe shape), but exhibits a bundling phenotype in phase 2 (Figure 6A and Figure 6B, respectively). Therefore, there exists a signaling molecule that specifically regulates only phase 2, but not phase 1.</p><p>Point (1) above shows that in phase 1-specific disruption of Gogo-Fmi interaction, there is a disorganized array of R8 axons (Figure 7Dââ), but not R8 bundling or invasion into the medulla layers. We think this is the phenotype of phase 1-specific disruption of <italic>gogo</italic> function, while point (3) demonstrates the phase 2-specific disruption of <italic>gogo</italic> function (Figure 2O-Pââ). There, we see longer filopodia expanding in more radial directions, although the phenotype became milder because of residual Gal80 function and later onset of RNAi knockdown. The adult phenotype of <italic>gogo</italic> mutants may represent the addition of these phenotypes of phases 1 and 2. The disorganized array will enhance the R8 bundling and invasion when the filopodia become longer in random directions. However, from the experimental evidence, we show that the <italic>gogo</italic> functions in phase 1 and phase 2 are independent of each other inside the growth cone.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The work also feels very qualitative, especially Figure 1, and Figure 4. The authors conclusion would be greatly strengthened by providing quantifications next to the panels. I feel that given this is a relatively well-studied model system, the authors should try to come up with a better way to quantify the shape and location of the R8 termini. This would make it convincing and could even reveal new interesting features of the phenotype (and wild type).</p></disp-quote><p>This is a valid point, and we have addressed this issue by quantifying most of the phenotypes in Figure 1, Figure 4, and Figure 7, as was also suggested by other reviewers.</p></body></sub-article></article>
