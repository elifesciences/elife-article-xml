The applicability of 3-photon excitation for deep imaging of other, more heterogeneous tissue types has been much less explored. In this work, we analyze the benefit of high-pulse-energy 1 MHz pulse-repetition-rate infrared excitation near 1300 and 1700 nm for in-depth imaging of tumorous and bone tissue. We show that this excitation regime provides a more than 2-fold increased imaging depth in tumor and bone tissue compared to the illumination conditions commonly used in 2-photon excitation, due to improved excitation confinement and reduced scattering. We also show that simultaneous 3- and 4-photon processes can be effectively induced with a single laser line, enabling the combined detection of blue to far-red fluorescence together with second and third harmonic generation without chromatic aberration, at excitation intensities compatible with live tissue imaging. Finally, we analyze photoperturbation thresholds in this excitation regime and derive setpoints for safe cell imaging. Together, these results indicate that infrared high-pulse-energy low-repetition-rate excitation opens novel perspectives for intravital deep-tissue microscopy of multiple parameters in strongly scattering tissues and organs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>tumor</kwd><kwd>bone</kwd><kwd>3-photon microscopy</kwd><kwd>third harmonic generation</kwd><kwd>nonlinear microscopy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011199</institution-id><institution>FP7 Ideas: European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>617430-DEEPINSIGHT</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Friedl</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NWO Gravitation Programme 024.001.028</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Friedl</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-11-EQPX-0029</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Beaurepaire</surname><given-names>Emmanuel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-15-CE13-0015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Beaurepaire</surname><given-names>Emmanuel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DEI201512440</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Beaurepaire</surname><given-names>Emmanuel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Infrared high-pulse-energy low-pulse-repetition-rate excitation advances deep intravital microscopy in strongly scattering tissues such as skin tumors and thick bone, thereby bringing previously inaccessible tumor areas in reach with subcellular resolution.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Intravital microscopy enables studies of the physiology and malfunction of live cells in multicellular organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ritsma et al., 2012</xref>).

For example, reducing the pulse repetition rate from 80 to 1 MHz while increasing the pulse energy is an effective means to reach larger depths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beaurepaire et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Theer et al., 2003</xref>), albeit at the cost of reduced imaging speed, because 80 times less excitation events per second are introduced into the sample. Ultimately, 2P imaging depth in densely labeled fluorescent samples is limited by out-of-focus background produced in superficial regions, which at large depths becomes dominant over the signal produced in the focus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Helmchen and Denk, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Theer and Denk, 2006</xref>).</p><p>To reduce these confounding effects, shifting the excitation wavelength to the infrared optical windows at ~1300 or 1650–1700 nm was shown to reduce light scattering and, by 3-photon (3P) excitation, improve confinement of the scan focus and thereby reduce out-of-focus background signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xu et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hell et al., 1996</xref>).

Intravital microscopy of the tumor microenvironment faces several tissue-intrinsic challenges. Tumors are dense, opaque, three-dimensional objects with a size of millimeters to centimeters, which causes strong light scattering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andresen et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, analysis of the tumor microenvironment requires to detect multiple cell types, their morphology and activation states simultaneously, and tissue structures over time through a body window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Weigelin et al., 2021</xref>). HighIR combined with 3P microscopy enables the label-free detection of metabolites, tissue morphology, and leukocyte migration in mammary tumor microenvironment in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">You et al., 2018b</xref>). However, the relevance of 3P intravital microscopy for multiparametric detection of tumors expressing fluorescent reporters, as used in preclinical cancer research, and detection of tumor cells deeply inside the tumor has not been explored. We here apply 1300 and 1650–1700 nm highIR excitation to achieve 3- and 4P and higher harmonics microscopy of live fluorescent tumors in mice and other strongly scattering tissues, such as bone. We report improved multiparameter detection of cells and complex tissues, a 2-fold gain of penetration depth at non-toxic laser intensities, and established criteria to minimize photodamage that enable long-term time-lapse imaging of live-cell biology.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>3P excitation setup characterization</title><p>In contrast to the well-established 2P microscopy lowIR excitation regime (100–200 fs pulses with sub-nJ energy density at the focus), efficient 3P microscopy requires shorter (sub-100 fs) pulses at the focus with ~5–10 times higher energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">König et al., 1999</xref>) (highIR excitation) to generate comparable excitation of fluorophores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xu et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang and Xu, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). To keep the average power and associated sample heating at an acceptable level, 3P microscopy applies lower pulse repetition rates (1–2 MHz) compared to pulse repetition rates commonly used for 2P microscopy (80 MHz) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beaurepaire et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Theer et al., 2003</xref>). The source used in this study consisted of a fiber laser pumping an optical parametric amplifier (OPA) providing 1 MHz, sub-100 fs pulses at 1300 or 1650 nm wavelengths. Excitation was focused with a high-NA objective, resulting in a resolution better than 0.8 µm in the lateral and 3 µm in the axial dimension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Physiological saline was used as immersion medium for high compatibility with the tissue and observation window. Since part of the excitation pulse energy (<italic>E<sub>obj</sub></italic>) was absorbed by the immersion medium, we calculated the pulse energy at the sample surface (<italic>E</italic>) as a reference for each experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We compared highIR excitation at 1300 and 1650 nm with lowIR excitation in the range 1100–1300 nm, the current standard for in-depth multiphoton imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andresen et al., 2009</xref>). Using the mouse brain as a reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Horton et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Weisenburger et al., 2019</xref>), we confirmed that 1650 nm highIR excitation enables to resolve structural details with third harmonic generation (THG) contrast at depths encompassing the entire cortex (&gt;1 mm), which outperforms the imaging depth obtained with 1270 nm lowIR excitation by almost a factor of two (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3b,c</xref>). Since both high- and lowIR excitation measurements were using a 3P process to generate contrast, the superior performance with highIR excitation can be attributed to the enhanced excitation efficiency rather than to reduced out-of-focus background. We calculated the effective attenuation length (<italic>l<sub>e</sub></italic>), which is the mean distance travelled by light before being scattered or absorbed by the tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2018b</xref>).

To understand the nonlinear processes underlying this unusually broad spectrum of fluorophores excited with a single laser line, we investigated the order of the excitation process for each signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). We recorded the emission intensity in response to increasing excitation energy <italic>E</italic> and estimated the order of dependence between emission intensity and <italic>E</italic> by fitting the data to a power law (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>). As internal controls, SHG and THG signals were used as reference for second- and third-order processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>). When excited at 1650 nm, the red fluorophores TagRFP, mCherry, and AF680 followed a cubic dependence on excitation power, while green and blue fluorophores eGFP and Hoechst followed a quartic dependence, consistent with respective third- and fourth-order processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>). This shows that 3- and 4-photon-excited fluorescence (3PEF, 4PEF) along with multi-harmonic SHG and THG signals were obtained simultaneously using 1650 nm excitation, resulting in six-channel images in a single scan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Although independent control of each respective signal strength is not possible, a key advantage of this one-shot excitation scheme is that it is free of chromatic aberration, a common problem in multi-beam imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Theer et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Characterization of phototoxicity and bleaching</title><p>The high pulse energy required for efficient highIR excitation is a double-edged sword. Although it enables multi-modal excitation as seen above, pulsed light can induce nonlinear and linear perturbations. First, the energy density within the beam focus, which causes nonlinear interactions between a strong electric field and matter, may induce physical damage by ionization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Konig et al., 1997</xref>), toxic reactive oxygen species, and photobleaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Débarre et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tirlapur et al., 2001</xref>). This focused energy may further cause local transient heating of the focal volume during the excitation pulse, caused by water absorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Qiu et al., 2017</xref>). This type of phototoxicity is dependent on the pulse energy (nJ) at the focal plane. Second, phototoxicity may arise from linear absorption of light above and below the focal plane, which may cause accumulation of heat in a larger tissue volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Débarre et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Podgorski and Ranganathan, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rowlands et al., 2017</xref>). Sample heating is proportional to the average power of the incident excitation beam. Previous studies have investigated phototoxicity mechanisms with 1300 nm highIR excitation in the brain, and have established safety thresholds for 3P imaging of neuronal activity in this wavelength range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ouzounov et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yildirim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). In this work, we investigated the mechanisms and onset of photoperturbation with 1700 nm highIR excitation in tumor models in vitro (tumoroids), and with 1300 and 1700 nm highIR excitation in mouse dermis tumors in vivo and achieved safe live-cell imaging conditions.</p><p>As a readout for cell stress, we continuously recorded the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses of live tumor cells expressing a Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor GCaMP6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2013</xref>) in combination with the cell-death indicator Sytox Green (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). GCaMP6 fluorescence was monitored using lowIR 2P excitation (920 nm, 80 MHz) in parallel to 1700 nm highIR exposure (see <italic>Materials and methods</italic>). Intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses represent a sensitive readout for non-lethal cell stress, caused by opening of calcium channels as well as by transient membrane damage caused by reactive oxygen species and other cytotoxic events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hopt and Neher, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Iwanaga et al., 2006</xref>). In a collagen-based 3D phantom containing a reconstituted cell-rich tumoroid, spontaneous reversible Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluctuations and few Sytox-positive damaged cells were detected before highIR exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, frame #70). As a positive control, intermittent highIR scanning at toxic intensity (17 nJ) caused rapid-onset Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation in cell subsets followed by gradual increase of the Sytox signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, frames #102–201). High exposure was further confirmed by significant photobleaching of mCherry emission from cell nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, arrowheads). After termination of toxic highIR exposure, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation persisted, and an increasing number of cells became Sytox-positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, frame #425). To study the toxicity of highIR exposure in detail, Sytox-positive and -negative cells at the endpoint (frame #425) were grouped and the kinetics of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Sytox responses of both subsets were quantified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>). The Sytox-negative, surviving cells showed a transient Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation which declined to half of the maximum amplitude after cessation of highIR exposure, whereas Sytox-positive cells showed an accelerated and transient Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation upon onset of highIR exposure in combination with delayed nuclear Sytox increment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). In Sytox-positive cells, the GCaMP6 signal level eventually declined to its initial level before highIR exposure, likely as a consequence of persisting membrane damage with leakage of GCaMP6 in parallel to Sytox entry. At the single-cell level, Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation was nearly instantaneous with the onset of laser exposure in Sytox-positive cells, followed by Sytox elevation thereafter with a large spread of the onset time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>).

Thus, a threshold for excitation energy in the focus of up to 8.4 nJ at the sample surface allows for safe time-lapse imaging inside the tissue, when focusing at least 40 µm deep inside the sample.</p><p>To account for linear phototoxicity outside of the highIR focal plane, depth stacks were obtained before and after time-lapse measurements at low-to-high highIR exposure dose (5.0–17 nJ). Both Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Sytox signals were spatially restricted within the highIR excitation plane, without effects in regions above and below (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c-f</xref>). This result shows that continuous scanning with 1700 nm highIR excitation power of 17 mW (17 nJ × 1 MHz) at the sample surface can be used without causing linear phototoxicity.</p><p>To verify the setpoint for phototoxicity for intravital microscopy, we exposed mouse dermis tumors to 1300 and 1650 nm highIR excitation and monitored their cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>). During continuous highIR exposure for energies at the sample surface below or equal to 2.8 nJ (1300 nm) or 8.7 nJ (1650 nm), the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal retained background activity, with occasional spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluctuations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>, asterisk; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1 fig2video2">Figure 2—videos 1; 2</xref>). Higher excitation energies (3.9 nJ for 1300 nm, 12 nJ for 1650 nm) induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation in cell subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1 fig2video2">Figure 2—videos 1; 2</xref>, arrowheads). These Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses differed from the background fluctuations by their steep or gradual increase of signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h and i</xref>, arrowheads). Moreover, at prolonged exposure above the observed thresholds, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal induction preceded the onset of burning marks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref> , <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video2">Figure 2—video 2</xref>, closed arrowheads) or intravascular blood stasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref>). Furthermore, to avoid thermal damage induced by heating, we applied average power levels at the sample surface of at most 38 mW (38 nJ times 1 MHz) under live-cell and in vivo conditions, which in the brain suffices to limit tissue heating below ~1.8°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Podgorski and Ranganathan, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rowlands et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, we established a limit for power densities to be used for multimodal excitation in tumors to remain below functional phototoxicity levels and showed that higher doses induce different grades of damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Iwanaga et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koester et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>To quantify photobleaching, repeated 3D scanning was performed over 60–75 min (one 3D scan/min), using highIR exposure within the toxic (3.5 nJ, 1300 nm; 12 nJ, 1650 nm) or nontoxic range. Within the toxic range, eGFP intensity declined by 25% after 25 scans (1300 nm) and mCherry intensity declined by 25% after two scans (1650 nm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2b</xref>). Within the non-toxic range, mCherry intensity decreased by 10–20% after 50 scans, while 3P-excited eGFP signal remained stable. This level of photobleaching may limit applicability for imaging with sub-second frame rates, as required for Ca<sup>2+</sup> monitoring in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Weisenburger et al., 2019</xref>), but remains acceptable for monitoring with lower frame rates, in the minute-range up to days, and for large-volume scanning, which are relevant imaging regimes for monitoring tumor cell kinetics and therapy response in tumor models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haeger et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Khalil et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Deep-tumor multiparameter microscopy with highIR excitation</title><p>We next investigated whether highIR excitation at 1300 and 1650 nm provides an advantage for imaging deep-tumors regions, with respect to conventional lowIR excitation at 1180 nm using a titanium sapphire/optical parametric oscillator (Ti:Sa/OPO) combination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). To achieve arbitrarily constant emission with increasing imaging depth, we manually increased the excitation energy <italic>E</italic> using eGFP (for 1300 nm) and TagRFP (1180 and 1650 nm) as a reference, while remaining below the phototoxicity thresholds as defined above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, gray profiles). 3P and 4P highIR excitation resolved subcellular features of eGFP and TagRFP labeled cells at depths beyond 400 µm, as compared to 225 µm for OPO-generated 2P lowIR excitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Multiparameter recordings were reliably obtained at a depth of 350 µm inside the tumor using 1300 and 1650 nm highIR excitation, but not with the 1180 nm lowIR source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). To investigate the imaging depth limit for the different modalities, we first quantified the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of fluorescent features as a function of imaging depth. While the SNR remained above the detection limit (SNR ≥3) until a depth of only ~255 µm using the 2P lowIR excitation regime, the 3P highIR excitation regime enabled us to reach depths of ~395 µm (1650 nm) or ~415 µm (1300 nm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>), corresponding to a nearly 2-fold increase as compared to lowIR. The limits of deep-tissue microscopy also depend on resolution, which is affected by scattering and aberration of the incident excitation beam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2020</xref>). We thus evaluated how the axial resolution depends on imaging depth and excitation process. For 3PE and 4PE processes, resolution remained higher with increasing imaging depth as compared to the resolution achieved by 2PE, which declined steeply beyond 125 µm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). Thus, 3PE and 4PE modalities provide improved resolution in strongly scattering tissues compared to 2PE, which may be explained by the superior spatial confinement of the 3P or 4P excitation processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xu et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hell et al., 1996</xref>). In addition, light scattering and aberration may affect the quality of the focus and, thereby, resolution in a wavelength-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2020</xref>). To address the attenuation of 3PE with increasing tissue penetration in tumors, we measured the fluorescence intensity as a function of increasing imaging depth and derived the effective attenuation length <italic>l<sub>e</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). <italic>l<sub>e</sub></italic> remained constant over hundreds of micrometers, indicating that the tumor composition was homogenous over this depth range. When red-shifting the excitation wavelength from 1180 to 1300 or 1650 nm, <italic>l<sub>e</sub></italic> increased from 103 to 128 or 220 µm, respectively. Thus, compared to lowIR excitation, the gain in resolution and SNR in deep-tissue zones with highIR excitation can be attributed to several effects, including: (i) improved localization of the multiphoton effect in the focus region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Theer and Denk, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xu et al., 1996</xref>), (ii) increased <italic>l<sub>e</sub></italic> in the 1300 and 1700 nm spectral excitation windows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Horton et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2018a</xref>), and (iii) improved excitation efficiency as a consequence of increased pulse-energy and low laser repetition rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beaurepaire et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Theer et al., 2003</xref>). Through these combined effects, highIR excitation increases the imaging depth by 2-fold compared to lowIR excitation using OPO-based sources and by 4-fold compared to lowIR excitation in the 800–900 nm range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andresen et al., 2009</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Tissue penetration of 2- (2P), 3- (3P), and 4-photon (4P) microscopy in tumors in vivo.</title><p>After 15 days growth, an intradermal HT-1080 sarcoma tumor expressing eGFP and TagRFP was repetitively imaged with highIR and lowIR excitation to compare tissue penetration of the respective excitation modalities.

In the tumor, highIR-excited THG resolved extracellular and cellular details (arrowheads) at depths beyond 400 µm, while lowIR resolved primarily extracellular details until a depth of ~150 µm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). SNR analysis showed a maximum imaging depth of &gt;400 µm for highIR and &lt;100 µm for lowIR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). Imaging depth limits of THG microscopy with lowIR excitation results from the lower photon density in the focus, leading to a drastically lower excitation efficiency, in combination with the rapid attenuation of nonlinear signals upon scattering and absorption of excitation light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beaurepaire et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Theer et al., 2003</xref>). In contrast, THG by highIR excitation, which creates a multifold higher photon density in the focus, is achieved with only a small fraction of the available power at the tissue surface, which allows to increase the excitation energy at the sample surface with imaging depth further, to maintain a constant signal over a much broader depth range. Interestingly, different details were accentuated in THG images recorded with different excitation regimes. For example, THG by small collagen fibers under non-scattering conditions was best with excitation at 1180 nm, whereas THG by tumor cell nuclei was strongest at 1300 nm excitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>, arrowheads). The wavelength-dependent size of the focal volume relative to THG-generating cell and tissue structures is a possible explanation for these differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Débarre et al., 2006</xref>). Bone is a strongly light-scattering tissue, yet thin cortical bone such as the mouse skull is amenable to highIR excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). To address whether thick bone can be effectively penetrated by highIR, we performed THG microscopy in an excised ossicle, which is an ectopic bone induced by a tissue engineering approach in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dondossola et al., 2018</xref>). Subcellular structures were reliably resolved by highIR excitation beyond 220 µm depth, including osteocyte lacunae and canaliculi in the cortical bone layer and trabeculae in the bone marrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>; yz-projections and arrowheads). At comparable pulse energies and near the surface (&lt;105 µm, 1300 versus 1270 nm), a superior SNR was obtained with lowIR excitation, taking advantage of the 80 times higher repetition rate and thus increased emission photon flux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). Beyond 150 µm depth, lowIR excitation reached its maximum available power, while highIR excitation power could be further increased to maintain a constant SNR. Thus, as a consequence of the improved excitation efficiency of highIR excitation, superior SNR beyond 165 µm scan depths was obtained compared to lowIR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>, dotted lines). In addition, 1650 nm highIR excitation resulted in both increased effective attenuation length <italic>l<sub>e</sub></italic> and larger imaging depth compared to 1270 nm lowIR excitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). Thus, consistent with previous reports in thin bone samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2019</xref>), highIR excitation improves deep-tissue bone microscopy and imaging depth is doubled when using 1300 or 1650 nm highIR excitation compared to 1270 nm lowIR excitation. We finally investigated the imaging depth limit in the mouse brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3b</xref>). The SNR remained above the detection limit up to 928 µm depth for 1650 nm highIR, and up to 444 µm for 1270 nm lowIR excitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3e</xref>, dotted lines). HighIR imaging depth was ultimately limited by the dense external capsule with short <italic>l<sub>e</sub></italic>, which was not reached with lowIR THG imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3b, d, and e</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Tissue penetration of highIR- and lowIR-excited third harmonic generation (THG) microscopy in tumor and bone.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) THG microscopy in the tumor.

We experienced stable imaging conditions by carefully increasing the excitation energy with increasing tissue penetration until the maximum energy was reached, followed by rapid deterioration of the signal. For tissues with higher scattering properties (smaller <italic>l<sub>e</sub></italic>), such as bone and cell-rich tumors, the excitation energy <italic>E</italic> needed to be increased faster with imaging depth, so that the average excitation power reached its maximum value at shallower imaging depths. For 1300 nm highIR excitation in tumor, we used maximum average powers (33 nJ at 1 MHz = 33 mW, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>) well below the reported limits for tissue heating (150 mW) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rowlands et al., 2017</xref>), and therefore the imaging depth can be extended further for this modality. However, additional experiments and simulations defining linear phototoxicity limits need to be performed for the 1700 nm excitation range. It remains to be established to what extend the maximum tolerable power depends on differences in water absorption at 1700 nm compared to 1300 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Horton et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>). Tissue heating may be reduced and imaging depth increased by reducing the imaging frame rate, which allows the tissue to cool down between images or lines, or by reducing the frequency of excitation pulses. This is possible when the biological process of interest can be monitored with lower frame rates or image resolution. For example, studying cancer cell invasion only requires image acquisition with 10 min intervals, which allows effective heat dissipation during image acquisition; conversely, high scan rates required for calcium imaging deeply inside the tumor (20 s) may require a higher repetition rate of excitation pulses and preclude effective deep imaging in highly scattering tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Weigelin et al., 2021</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Performance comparison of 2P, 3P, and 4P processes excited by highIR versus lowIR.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Third harmonic generation (THG) imaging depth limit in hard to soft tissues based on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) detection limit.

The Ca<sup>2+</sup> detection of phototoxic cell stress was faster and more sensitive than recording of irreversible cell death. Additionally, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> reporter enabled to detect damage which remained sublethal within the time frame of the experiments, which may affect cell functionally but could escape detection by commonly used live-death reporters, such as DNA intercalating probes. Cell stress and bleaching were induced in the focal plane when pulse energies reached threshold values (3.9 nJ for 1300 nm and 12 nJ for 1650 nm at 50 µm depth), eventually leading to physical disruption of tissue structures (burning marks), in line with observations by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hopt and Neher, 2001</xref>). Conversely, energy doses below the thresholds were tolerated by cells without in-focus Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation, and this energy level was sufficient to achieve high-quality multiparametric image acquisition at matched depth. The in-focus phototoxicity thresholds obtained in the cell-rich tumor model are comparable to the dynamic range detected in low-density tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ouzounov et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yildirim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2020</xref>), indicating that nonlinear phototoxicity might have a general cause, such as light-induced ionization or formation of reactive oxygen species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Débarre et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tirlapur et al., 2001</xref>), irrespective of the tissue density. The impact of sub-threshold highIR light exposure on long-term integrity of cell structure and function requires further exploration, including growth, differentiation, and chromatin integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Débarre et al., 2014</xref>), as well as benchmarking of stress-sensitive complex cell functions, such as cell migration and cell-cell interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Weigelin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kiepas et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>We generated up to six-channel multiparametric images in live tumors with sufficient signal-to-noise ratio using a single highIR excitation, simultaneously detecting 3PEF and 4PEF along with SHG and THG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). To achieve multiparametric imaging, the used excitation pulse energy in the focus was higher compared to previous studies: 1.4–2.1 times for 1650 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Horton et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guesmi et al., 2018</xref>) and 0.7–1.7 times for 1300 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ouzounov et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2018a</xref>), but still below the defined phototoxicity thresholds. Other methods to achieve multichannel imaging with highIR excitation have been demonstrated, such as simultaneous 1300 and 1700 nm highIR excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guesmi et al., 2018</xref>). The method demonstrated here offers the advantage of single laser line excitation and therefore the absence of chromatic aberration and reduced excitation load. On the other hand, the requirements for fluorophore concentration and brightness are stricter for 4P, as compared to 3P excitation processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>), due to their even smaller absorption cross-section (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, fluorophores with high quantum efficiency and/or abundance, such as H2B/eGFP or Hoechst must be selected for 4P excitation. Besides addition of fluorescence channels by combination of 3P and 4P excitation, multiparametric imaging was also achieved by combination of 3P-excited fluorophores with different excitation/emission spectra, such as TagRFP, mCherry, and AlexaFluor680 at 1650 nm or TagRFP and eGFP at 1300 nm. At 1300 nm however, red fluorescent proteins were excited with reduced efficiency. Recently, the excitation efficiency of red fluorescent proteins at 1300 nm was enhanced by carefully tuning the central excitation wavelength to higher-energy electronic excited states, enabling multiparametric imaging with high SNR in three fluorescent channels, at the cost of accelerated photobleaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hontani et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, multiparametric imaging is a promising approach for the intravital study of complex tissue structures, but labeling and imaging conditions require careful optimization.</p><p>Upcoming technical improvements of highIR microscopy include lateral, axial, and temporal multiplexing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Weisenburger et al., 2019</xref>), refined compensation of pulse broadening and detection efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yildirim et al., 2019</xref>) and selective regional scanning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2020</xref>), providing means to reduce the photon burden and latent phototoxicity to advance imaging speed and depth. Furthermore, the advantages of lowIR excitation at shallow depths and highIR excitation at deep imaging regions can be combined, resulting in optimized imaging speed and SNR over the full imaging depth range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Weisenburger et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, we find that the benefits of highIR excitation (1300/1700 nm, 1–2 MHz, sub-100 fs pulse length, and nJ-range pulse energy in the focus) previously demonstrated for brain deep-tissue microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Horton et al., 2013</xref>) also prevail in even more strongly scattering tissues, including thick tumors and bone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). HighIR excitation has two important advantages in the context of tumor microscopy: it can roughly double the imaging depth compared to previous state-of-the-art 2P imaging, and it gives access to multiparametric imaging through the simultaneous detection of 3- and 4P fluorescence excitation and multi-harmonic signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">You et al., 2018b</xref>). We note that using several chromophores simultaneously with a single beam may require to adjust their relative labeling densities and to experimentally determine the best excitation wavelength to optimize the signal and average excitation power threshold to avoid phototoxic effects depending on the application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). Based on its simple single-beam excitation and improved imaging depth, highIR microscopy holds great potential to advance biomedicine and material sciences. In cancer research, highIR excitation will improve intravital microscopy of understudied regions, including the tumor core and necrosis zones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deryugina and Kiosses, 2017</xref>).

on a customized upright multiphoton microscope (TrimScope II, LaVision BioTec, a Miltenyi Biotec company, Bielefeld, Germany) equipped with two tunable Ti:Sa lasers (Chameleon Ultra I and II, Coherent, CA), an OPO (MPX, APE, Berlin, Germany) and up to six PMTs distributed over a two- and a four-channel port (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). The setup was modified to facilitate high-energy, low-repetition rate excitation. A high-power fiber laser (Satsuma HP2, 1030 nm, 20 W, 1 MHz Amplitude Systèmes, Bordeaux, France) was used to pump an OPA (AVUS SP, APE), which generated 460 or 330 mW at 1300 or 1650 nm, respectively. A fixed-distance prism compressor (Femtocontrol, APE), glass block (IR-coated 25 mm ZnSe, for 1650 nm), and an autocorrelator with internal and external detector (Carpe, APE) were included in the optical path to control the pulse length under the objective lens. The beam path further included an adjustable 2:1 telescope (<italic>f</italic> = 80 mm and <italic>f</italic> = 40 mm apochromat lenses; IR-coated), a motorized half-wave plate and a glan-laser polarizer to control laser beam diameter, power, and polarization. The pulse length under the objective lens and its point-spread-function were optimized for the chosen OPA excitation wavelength by adjustment of the excitation path bulk compression, beam pointing, and telescope, such that the objective lens’ back focal plane was 10% overfilled. A movable mirror was used to guide either the OPO or the OPA beam into the scanhead, where it was spatially overlaid with the Ti:Sa beam. Mirrors, dichroic mirrors, and lenses in the scanhead were carefully selected for high reflectance or transmission in the extended excitation wavelength range. Microscopy was performed using a 25 × 1.05 NA water immersion objective lens (XLPLN25XWMP2, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan; transmission of 69% at 1700 nm, data not shown). The following filter/PMT configurations were used: blue-green emission was split off to a two-channel port with a 560lp dichroic mirror and a 700SP laser blocker filter, while red emission was split off to a two-channel port with a 900lp dichroic mirror and an 880SP laser blocker filter. Red emission was first split by a 697sp, then further split by a 605lp and a 750sp dichroic mirror, bandpass filtered with 572/28 (TagRFP) or 593/40 (TagRFP and mCherry), 620/60 (mCherry), 710/75 (AlexaFluor680), and 810/90 (AlexaFluor750, SHG) and detected by alkali, GaAsP, or GaAs PMT detectors (H6780-20, H7422A-40, or H7422A-50, Hamamatsu, Hamamatsu city, Japan). For 1180, 1270, and 1300 nm excitation, blue-green emission was split by a 506lp dichroic mirror, bandpass filtered with 447/60 (THG) and 525/50 (eGFP) and detected by alkali or GaAsP detectors (H6780-01, H6780-20, or H7422A-40, Hamamatsu). For 1650 nm excitation, blue-green emission was split by a 506lp (more THG signal) or 560lp (more eGFP signal) dichroic mirror, bandpass filtered with 447/60 (Hoechst) or 505/40 (eGFP) and 562/40 (THG) and detected by alkali or GaAsP detectors (Hamamatsu, H6780-01, H6780-20, or H7422A-40). Filters were fabricated by Semrock (New York, NY) or Chroma Technology GmbH (Olching, Germany). The setup was equipped with a warm plate (DC60 and THO 60–16, Linkam Scientific Instruments Ltd, Tadworth, UK) and a custom-made objective heater (37°C) for live-cell and in vivo experiments, as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haeger et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Determination of setup resolution</title><p>The point-spread-function was obtained using 0.2 µm multicolor beads (FluoresBrite 0.2 um, Cat. 24050, Polysciences Inc, PA).

To maintain a constant 3P emission over imaging depth, the excitation power was increased as defined in the measurement. For image acquisition, the pixel dwell time was set to 2 or 4 µs to synchronize with the laser repetition rate, line averaging was set between 1 and 6, pixel size was 0.7 µm and the step size of z-stacks was 2.5 µm unless stated otherwise.

After polymerization, chambers were filled with culture medium (specified above), incubated overnight at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere and sealed prior to microscopy.</p></sec><sec id="s3-13"><title>Animal procedures</title><p>All animal procedures were approved by the ethical committee on animal experimentation (RU-DEC 2014–031) or the Central Authority for Scientific Procedures on Animals (CCD: AVD10300 2017 4444, license: 2017–0042). Handlings were performed at the central animal facility (CDL) of the Radboud University, Nijmegen, in accordance with the Dutch Animal experimentation act and the European FELASA protocol. C57Bl/6J WT mice and BALB/c CAnN.Cg-Foxn1nu were purchased from Charles River, Germany. Before the experiment, mice were housed in IVCM cages at standard housing conditions. Food and water were accessible ad libitum. Dorsal skinfold chambers (DSFC) were transplanted on 8- to 24-week-old male mice as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haeger et al., 2020</xref>). In short, mice were anesthetized using isoflurane anesthesia (2% in oxygen), the chamber was mounted on the dorsal skinfold of the mice, one side was surgically removed, and a coverglass was used to close the imaging window. Mice received an adequate peri-surgical analgesia using carprofen and buprenorphine. To prevent dislocation and inflammation of the DSFC, mice were housed with reduced cage enrichment during the experiment. Mice were housed in a temperature-controlled incubator at 28°C to minimize heat loss in the skin tissue due to the DSFC. One day after surgery, B16F10 melanoma (0.5 × 10<sup>5</sup>) or HT1080 fibrosarcoma (2 × 10<sup>6</sup>) were implanted as single-cell suspension into the deep dermis of the mouse using a 30-G needle (one or two tumors per mouse). To monitor tumor progression, mice were briefly anesthetized using isoflurane and epifluorescence overview images were taken (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1e</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-14"><title>3D sample preparation for cell viability experiments in vitro</title><p>A chambered coverglass was filled halfway with collagen I solution (4 mg/ml, as described above) and allowed to polymerize (37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, humidified atmosphere) in a vertical position. Then, B16F10 melanoma cells from sub-confluent (25%) culture were detached with 2 mM EDTA (1 mM) and resuspended at high density (~1 × 10<sup>8</sup>). Approximately 10 µl of cell suspension was transferred into a slightly bended 27-G hypodermic needle (BD) and positioned onto a P20 pipette. The needle was brought into the collagen gel, parallel to the coverglass. A small volume (~1 µl) was injected while retracting the needle to form a rod-shaped cell structure. Spill-over cells were removed by gently washing with PBS. Chambers were filled up with culture medium, placed in a 15 cm culture dish with wet paper to prevent evaporation, and incubated overnight (37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, humidified atmosphere). Prior to microscopy (~1 hr), 1 µM of Sytox Green (S7020, 5 mM, LOT #2204228, Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA) was added to the medium and the sample was sealed.</p></sec><sec id="s3-15"><title>Imaging setup for in vitro cell viability measurements</title><p>A custom-built setup was used for in vitro cell viability measurements. Shortly, the microscope was based on a lab-built upright frame in combination with the 25 × 1.05 NA water immersion objective, and a prototype highIR source (LOB and Amplitude Systèmes, Bordeaux, France) was used for excitation. The setup had the following highIR excitation specifications: 1700 nm central wavelength, 78 fs pulse length and &gt;100 mW under the objective, 1 MHz pulse repetition rate, and 3 µm axial resolution for 3P excitation. Thus, these conditions matched those used on the intravital imaging setup. GCaMP6 and Sytox Green were 2P excited with an Axon920 source (Coherent Inc 920 nm, 140 fs, 80 MHz), which focal plane was shifted ~6 µm deeper into the sample as compared to 1700 nm excitation. Scanning and acquisition was controlled using ScanImage software (Vidrio Technologies). Emission was split by a R561 dichroic mirror with the slope centered at 575 nm, bandpass filtered with ET505/40 (Sytox Green and GCaMP6) and 650/100 (mCherry and Sytox Green) and detected by GaAsP detectors (H7422-40, Hamamatsu, Hamamatsu city, Japan). Sample temperature was kept at 37°C using a heating chamber for upright microscopes (H310 UP with an UP-1 × 35 M insert, Okolab SRL, Pozzuoli, Italy) and an objective heater (as described for the intravital setup).</p></sec><sec id="s3-16"><title>Cell viability analysis based on tracking of individual cells</title><p>In the last recorded composite image of the time-lapse stack (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref> most right image), a group of Sytox-positive and Sytox-negative cells were selected by visual inspection. The frame order of the stack was reversed to facilitate manual tracking, which was performed on the nucleus and cytosol of each selected cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Then, a Matlab script (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2scode1">Figure 2—source code 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2scode2">Figure 2—source code 2</xref>) was used to retrieve intensity-time traces at the coordinates of the manually tracked cells, from the spatially filtered (multiplication by 10, two-pixel mean) green channel of the raw time-lapse stack. Nucleus and cytosol intensity-time traces of Sytox-positive and Sytox-negative cells were imported into Origin2019 for further processing: the normalized single-cell GCaMP intensity-time traces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>) were obtained by subsequent dark background subtraction, smoothing (method: Savitzky-Golay, window: 10 points, polynomal order: 2) and normalization to maximum of cytosol intensity-time traces. To obtain Sytox intensity-time traces without GCaMP crosstalk, the nucleus signal was divided by the cytosol signal, after background subtraction and prior to smoothing. The other processing steps were similar compared to the generation of GCaMP time traces. Cells were considered responsive (positive) if the trace intensity crossed a value <italic>threshold = mean<sub>baseline</sub> + 3* SD<sub>baseline</sub></italic>, where <italic>mean<sub>baseline</sub></italic> and <italic>SD<sub>baseline</sub></italic> are respectively the mean and the standard deviation of the unsmoothed intensity-time trace before highIR exposure. Assuming a normal distribution of trace intensities around <italic>mean<sub>baseline</sub></italic>, a null hypothesis stating that intensity is below the threshold value can be rejected with p = 0.0015, if intensity values are above a threshold value equal to 3* <italic>SD<sub>baseline</sub></italic> above the <italic>mean<sub>baseline</sub></italic> (one-tailed z-test). The Sytox and GCaMP responses over time presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> were derived by averaging all raw intensity-time traces per group (nucleus and cytosol, Sytox positive and negative) prior to background subtraction and calculation of the ratio nucleus/cytosol for the Sytox response.</p></sec><sec id="s3-17"><title>Image area-based cell viability analysis</title><p>The cell fraction responding upon highIR exposure (GCaMP+ or Sytox+ cell fraction) was derived from time-lapse and z-stack measurements within an ROI of the image for which cell mass above the highIR focal plane was 40±10 µm thick, unless stated otherwise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c</xref>). Here, the green channel images were used for quantification of GCaMP while the red channel was used for Sytox signals. An ImageJ script (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2scode3">Figure 2—source code 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2scode4">Figure 2—source code 4</xref>) was used to derive the fraction, in the following manner: first, to discriminate between responding and not responding cell area within frames, a threshold <italic>t = mean + 3*SD</italic> was defined, where mean and standard deviation (<italic>SD</italic>) were derived over the 95% dimmest pixels within the ROI, drawn in a time-lapse frame taken before highIR exposure. Second, a mask was created for every time point or depth in the median filtered (one-pixel) stack, where pixels above threshold <italic>t</italic> within the ROI are classified as high. In this mask all GCaMP+ or Sytox+ classified pixels were included, also those which were positive prior to highIR exposure. Since the aim was to quantify the positive cell fraction <italic>upon highIR exposure</italic>, the positively classified pixels prior to highIR exposure (caused by spontaneous fluctuations, dead or dying cells, melanin artifacts) were removed from the mask in the next steps. Third, a mask was created from the last time point or from the complete z-stack before highIR exposure, following the steps described above. Additionally, six dilation steps were applied to this mask, to correct for drift and/or expansion of detected features. Fourth, the last mask was subtracted from the uncorrected mask and the area of the highIR-induced GCaMP+ or Sytox+ pixels was quantified for each frame of the newly created mask. Finally, the area of the ROI corrected for positively classified pixels prior to highIR exposure was measured. The quantified areas per frame were exported to Origin2019 in order to derive the relative GCaMP+ or Sytox+ cell fractions upon highIR exposure for further representation and statistical analysis of time-lapse and z-stack measurements. For time-lapse measurements, the highIR-induced GCaMP+ cell fraction was defined as the maximum fraction obtained during highIR exposure.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s4" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>Judith Heidelin is currently employed by LaVision BioTec GmbH and explores implementation of high-pulse-energy low-duty-cycle light sources as a microscopy product line</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf4"><p>Volker Andresen is currently employed by LaVision BioTec GmbH and explores implementation of high-pulse-energy low-duty-cycle light sources as a microscopy product line</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf5"><p>Marcus Beutler has a current employment at APE Angewandte Physik &amp; Elektronik GmbH, which produces the AVUS SP as a commercial product</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Software, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation, Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Methodology, Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Methodology, Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Methodology, Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All animal procedures were approved by the ethical committee on animal experimentation (RU-DEC 2014-031) or the Central Authority for Scientific Procedures on Animals (CCD: AVD10300 2017 4444, license: 2017-0042).

However, scattering and absorption limit the penetration depth. The impact of nonlinear microscopy in biomedicine and biology would be much improved if higher imaging depths can be achieved. In this manuscript, the authors show they can accomplish imaging in complex specimens using 3- and 4-photon excitation, deeper in the specimen than comparable optics can accomplish with 2-photon excitation laser scanning microscopy. Using a customised commercial system, the authors have incorporated a high-powered laser source with an OPA and dispersion compensation to generate either 1330nm or 1650nm laser lines with high peak pulse energies at low pulse repetition rates.

Tissue heating may be reduced and imaging depth increased by reducing the imaging frame rate, which allows the tissue to cool down between images or lines, or by reducing the frequency of excitation pulses. This is possible when the biological process of interest can be monitored with lower frame rates or image resolution. For example, studying cancer cell invasion only requires image acquisition with 10-min intervals, which allows effective heat dissipation during image acquisition; conversely, high scan rates required for calcium imaging deeply inside the tumor (20 sec) may require a higher repetition rate of excitation pulses and preclude effective deep imaging in highly scattering tissue<sup>8</sup>.”</p><p>In our hands, using cells expressing relatively high H2B-eGFP and Hoechst applied at regular dose in vivo, 4-photon excitation was effective at pulse energies &lt;= 9 nJ at the sample surface when focused 50 µm deep (revised Figure 1b and 3a), which is below the phototoxic threshold (revised Figure 2d and 2i). Therefore, we consider 4P excitation as a relevant new microscopic modality in life sciences. As potential shortcoming, we noted that restrictions on labelling density and quantum efficiency will be more severe for 4-photon excited fluorophores as compared to 3-photon excited fluorophores (revised Figure 5b).

In contrast, THG by highIR excitation, which creates a multifold higher photon density in the focus, is achieved with only a small fraction of the available power at the tissue surface, which allows to increase the excitation energy at the sample surface with imaging depth further, to maintain a constant signal over a much broader depth range.”</p><p>The improved THG imaging performance of 1650 nm with respect to 1300 nm high-pulse-energy excitation may be addressed to several causes. Wavelength dependent differences in scattering and absorption of the laser light are the most plausible explanation for this effect. Scattering and absorption are dominant attenuation factors for excitation of THG, which depends on the cube of the excitation energy arriving at the focus, while the emission is much less dependent on these parameters<sup>19,21</sup>. Therefore, shifting the excitation wavelength may strongly modulate the detected signal in dense 3D tissue, since the effective attenuation length of tumor tissue is much longer for 1650 nm excitation as compared to 1300 nm excitation (revised Figure 3e).</p><p>In addition, absorption of the emitted light may indeed contribute to the improved THG signal at 1650 nm, because the blood absorption coefficient is 10 times higher at ~400 nm (THG emission at 1200-1300 nm incident wavelength) compared to 550 nm (emission from 1650 nm incident). However, we noted only minor impact of these emission wavelengths on the effective attenuation lengths (<italic>l<sub>e</sub></italic>), derived for 1300 nm excitation: <italic>l<sub>e</sub></italic> = 120 µm and <italic>l<sub>e</sub></italic> = 128 µm were found, for 433 nm (THG) and 500-550 nm (eGFP), respectively (revised Figure 3—figure supplement R1a, shown below). Also, for 1650 nm excitation, we did not find a strong correlation between the emission wavelength and the effective attenuation length: <italic>l<sub>e</sub></italic> = 218 µm and <italic>l<sub>e</sub></italic> = 220 µm were found, for 485-525 nm (4-photon excited eGFP) and 570-610 nm (TagRFP), respectively (revised Figure 3—figure supplement R1b). Notably, for 1650 nm we derived a larger effective attenuation length for THG emission centred around 550 nm as compared to fluorescence emission: <italic>l<sub>e</sub></italic> = 286 µm (revised Figure 3—figure supplement R1b), while this difference was absent for 1300 nm excitation. This finding indicates other excitation wavelength dependent mechanisms are influencing THG excitation efficiency as well, such as the size of THG signal emitting structures relative to the size of the focus.</p><p>While technically interesting, we feel that this data goes beyond the primary application focus of this work; however, should the referees and Editor support inclusion in the Supplement, we will be happy to revise accordingly.</p><p>In summary, we conclude that the longer excitation wavelength and higher excitation pulse energy are favourable for THG microscopy in the tumor, while the absorption and scattering of the emission are less critical.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 1:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors show they can accomplish imaging in complex specimens using 3- and 4-photon excitation, deeper in the specimen than comparable optics can accomplish with 2-photon excitation laser scanning microscopy.

Provide needed background and present important things first. The authors should give the reader a clear view into the issues in imaging biological tissues with the longer wavelengths that are used for confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and for two-photon laser scanning microscopy (TPLSM). There are several factoids presented, all seemingly true, but not presented in an accessible manner. Rather than starting with a mention of the expected temperature rise due to the dramatically higher absorbance by water of 1300nm and 1700nm light, the paper first presents the major absorbance of the light (~2/3 loss) and that this isn't a problem because there is sufficient laser power. For most readers, the need for a larger laser won't be their first question; instead, it will be the viability after/during the imaging session. The expected temperature rise, and an indirect mention of burn marks (!), comes at the end of the section.</p></disp-quote><p>The following specific points were revised:</p><p>1. The introduction has been rewritten to bring the proposed microscopy method in perspective with state-of-the-art methods used for intravital imaging of biological tissues, with the aim to familiarize a broad, life sciences-oriented audience to this relatively new technology.</p><p>2. The Results section has been restructured and new results characterizing phototoxicity with a commonly used viability probe have been integrated with the calcium sensor-based viability measurements. We now explain the principle of 3- and 4-photon excitation in comparison to 2-photon excitation; discuss the advantage of the presented method over the state-of-the-art methods available for intravital imaging of different tissues; application purposes; considerations for safe application, avoiding phototoxicity; and strategies to monitor phototoxicity in tissue models.</p><p>3. We added a panel explaining the principles of 1-, 2-, 3- and 4PE and higher harmonics generation (revised Figure 1a).</p><p>4. The excitation parameters of confocal LSM, conventional 2-photon microscopy and microscopy with high-pulse-energy low pulse-repetition-rate excitation are now summarized side-by-side (Supplementary File 1a).</p><p>5.

Explain and perform cell viability tests. Calcium imaging for assessing tissue viability is not the technique of choice for most readers, and is presented in a way that assumes general knowledge that simply does not exist. Membrane patency assays using membrane-impermeant DNA dyes, or other live-dead assays are far more common, but not presented in this study. I am not insistent that the authors use any particular assay, but I am insistent that the authors present the need for viability assay(s), teach the reader the principles of the assay(s) used, and present the results in an understandable manner.</p></disp-quote><p>We explained the need for viability analyses more clearly and extended the background on phototoxicity as well as the rationale for calcium sensor for in vivo monitoring. We performed additional live cell experiments, showing the superior sensitivity and responsiveness of the calcium sensor with respect to membrane patency assays (Sytox green). Both the calcium sensor and Sytox green showed phototoxicity effects for excitation pulse energies above the same threshold (new Figure 2—figure supplement 1e), however calcium but not Sytox detection allows to quantify reversible phototoxic stress. Furthermore, the threshold for nonlinear phototoxicity (phototoxicity limited to the focal plane) was updated, including statistical analysis (p. 8 and revised Figure 2d).</p><p>We discuss the required pulse energies and safety thresholds as follows (p. 13): “Cell stress and bleaching were induced in the focal plane when pulse energies reached threshold values (3.9 nJ for 1300 nm and 12 nJ for 1650 nm at 50 µm depth), eventually leading to physical disruption of tissue structures (burning marks), in line with observations by others<sup>1</sup>. Conversely, energy doses below the thresholds were tolerated by cells without in-focus ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation, and this energy level was sufficient to achieve high-quality multi-parametric image acquisition at matched depth. The in-focus phototoxicity thresholds obtained in the cell-rich tumor model are comparable to the dynamic range detected in low-density tissues<sup>2–4</sup>, indicating that nonlinear phototoxicity might have a general cause, such as light-induced ionization or formation of reactive oxygen species,<sup>5,6</sup> irrespective of the tissue density.”</p><p>Furthermore, we discussed what experimental conditions may require to be further explored, to control for subtle effects on cell biology (p. 13): “The impact of sub-threshold highIR light exposure on long-term integrity of cell structure and function requires further exploration, including growth, differentiation and, chromatin integrity<sup>7</sup>, as well as benchmarking of stress-sensitive complex cell functions, such as cell migration and cell-cell interactions<sup>8,9</sup>.”</p><p>Lastly, we discuss how phototoxicity and signal to noise ratios within the acquired images restrict imaging speed and depth, as follows (p. 12-13): “However, additional experiments and simulations defining linear phototoxicity limits need to be performed for the 1700 nm excitation range. It remains to be established to what extend the maximum tolerable power depends on differences in water absorption at 1700 nm compared to 1300 nm<sup>10,11</sup>. Tissue heating may be reduced and imaging depth increased by reducing the imaging frame rate, which allows the tissue to cool down between images or lines, or by reducing the frequency of excitation pulses.

In contrast, THG by highIR excitation, which creates a multifold higher photon density in the focus, is achieved with only a small fraction of the available power at the tissue surface, which allows to increase the excitation energy at the sample surface with imaging depth further, to maintain a constant signal over a much broader depth range.”</p><p>The improved THG imaging performance of 1650 nm with respect to 1300 nm high-pulse-energy excitation may be addressed to several causes. Wavelength dependent differences in scattering and absorption of the laser light are the most plausible explanation for this effect. Scattering and absorption are dominant attenuation factors for excitation of THG, which depends on the cube of the excitation energy arriving at the focus, while the emission is much less dependent on these parameters<sup>19,21</sup>. Therefore, shifting the excitation wavelength may strongly modulate the detected signal in dense 3D tissue, since the effective attenuation length of tumor tissue is much longer for 1650 nm excitation as compared to 1300 nm excitation (revised Figure 3e).</p><p>In addition, absorption of the emitted light may indeed contribute to the improved THG signal at 1650 nm, because the blood absorption coefficient is 10 times higher at ~400 nm (THG emission at 1200-1300 nm incident wavelength) compared to 550 nm (emission from 1650 nm incident). However, we noted only minor impact of these emission wavelengths on the effective attenuation lengths (<italic>l<sub>e</sub></italic>), derived for 1300 nm excitation: <italic>l<sub>e</sub></italic> = 120 µm and <italic>l<sub>e</sub></italic> = 128 µm were found, for 433 nm (THG) and 500-550 nm (eGFP), respectively (revised Figure 3—figure supplement 1a). Also, for 1650 nm excitation, we did not find a strong correlation between the emission wavelength and the effective attenuation length: <italic>l<sub>e</sub></italic> = 218 µm and <italic>l<sub>e</sub></italic> = 220 µm were found, for 485-525 nm (4-photon excited eGFP) and 570-610 nm (TagRFP), respectively (revised Figure 3—figure supplement 1b). Notably, for 1650 nm we derived a larger effective attenuation length for THG emission centred around 550 nm as compared to fluorescence emission: <italic>l<sub>e</sub></italic> = 286 µm (revised Figure 3—figure supplement 1b), while this difference was absent for 1300 nm excitation. This finding indicates other excitation wavelength dependent mechanisms are influencing THG excitation efficiency as well, such as the size of THG signal emitting structures relative to the size of the focus.</p><p>While technically interesting, we feel that this data goes beyond the primary application focus of this work; however, should the referees and Editor support inclusion in the Supplement, we will be happy to revise accordingly.</p><p>In summary, we conclude that the longer excitation wavelength and higher excitation pulse energy are favourable for THG microscopy in the tumor, while the absorption and scattering of the emission are less critical.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In figure 3A and 3C the SNR for 1650nm increases whilst for 1300nm and 1180 excitation this decreases. Is this simply due to more of the exciting fluorophore species residing deeper into the tissue?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, the slope of the curves shown in Figure 3C is bimodal. We escalated the excitation power gradually to achieve constant emission with increasing tissue penetration, and this correction was done “by eye” through the operator. Likely, this introduced some overcompensation and, accordingly, inaccuracy. We now describe the procedure, as follows (p. 9): “To achieve arbitrarily constant 3- or 2P emission with increasing imaging depth, we manually increased the excitation energy E using eGFP (for 1300 nm) and TagRFP (1180 and 1650 nm) as a reference, while remaining below the phototoxicity thresholds as defined above (Figure 3a, grey profiles).”</p><p>In Figure 3G (Figure 4B in the revised manuscript), different structures with different dimensions and orientations responded differently to the three excitation modalities. THG from thin fibrous collagen structures near the tumor surface was less efficiently excited with 1650 nm compared to shorter excitation wavelengths. On the other hand, cell and tissue structures within the tumor mass were excited more effectively with 1650 nm as compared to the collagen structures. At imaging depths beyond ~300 µm, excitation energy at the surface was not further increased, causing a decrease of the THG signal. As a consequence, the 1650 nm THG signal curve shows a peak. The thin fibrous collagen structures responded more strongly to 1180 nm and 1300 nm excitation, while cell and tissue structures inside the tumor emitted a relatively lower signal at these wavelengths. Therefore, 1180 and 1300 nm excited THG curves show a slope.</p><p>We now explain these differences in THG responses in greater detail, as follows (p. 11): “For example, THG by small collagen fibers under non-scattering conditions was best with excitation at 1180 nm, whereas THG by tumor cell nuclei was strongest at 1300 nm excitation (Figure 4a, arrowheads). The wavelength-dependent size of the focal volume relative to THG-generating cell and tissue structures is a possible explanation for these differences<sup>17</sup>.”</p><p>References:</p><p>1.
