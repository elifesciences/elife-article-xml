Although MAIT cells have been implicated in tumor immunity, it currently remains unclear whether they function as tumor-promoting or inhibitory cells. Therefore, we herein used induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology to investigate this issue. Murine MAIT cells were reprogrammed into iPSCs and redifferentiated towards MAIT-like cells (m-reMAIT cells). m-reMAIT cells were activated by an agonist in the presence and absence of antigen-presenting cells and MR1-tetramer, a reagent to detect MAIT cells. This activation accompanied protein tyrosine phosphorylation and the production of T helper (Th)1, Th2, and Th17 cytokines and inflammatory chemokines. Upon adoptive transfer, m-reMAIT cells migrated to different organs with maturation in mice. Furthermore, m-reMAIT cells inhibited tumor growth in the lung metastasis model and prolonged mouse survival upon tumor inoculation through the NK cell-mediated reinforcement of cytolytic activity. Collectively, the present results demonstrated the utility and role of m-reMAIT cells in tumor immunity and provide insights into the function of MAIT cells in immunity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>MAIT cells</kwd><kwd>iPSC</kwd><kwd>anti-metastasis</kwd><kwd>NK cell</kwd><kwd>cytolytic activity</kwd><kwd>adoptive transfer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17H03565</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sugimoto</surname><given-names>Chie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>26430084</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sugimoto</surname><given-names>Chie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20K10435</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fujita</surname><given-names>Hiroyoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Promotion and Mutual Aid Corporation for Private Schools of Japan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wakao</surname><given-names>Hiroshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mucosal-associated invariant T cells, an emerging member of the innate-like T cells abundant in humans bridging the innate and the adaptive immunity, could be exploited as a novel tool for cancer immunotherapy through cell reprogramming.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells belong to a family of innate-like T cells harboring semi-invariant T-cell receptors (TCRs) and recognize vitamin B2 metabolites as antigens on major histocompatibility complex class I-related gene protein (MR1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Godfrey et al., 2019</xref>). MAIT cells play a pivotal role in immunity by bridging innate and adaptive immunities. They are abundant in humans, but rare in mice, and are associated with a number of diseases, such as bacterial and viral infections, autoimmune, inflammatory, and metabolic diseases, asthma, and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Godfrey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Godfrey et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Toubal et al., 2019</xref>). Although previous studies implicated MAIT cells in various tumors, their role in tumor immunity remains obscure. An analysis of infiltrating immune cells revealed that the high infiltration of CD8<sup>+</sup>CD161<sup>+</sup> T cells, largely comprising MAIT cells, type 17 CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (Tc17 cells), and stem cell-like memory cells, in tumors represented a favorable prognostic signature across a wide array of human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gentles et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Konduri et al., 2021</xref>). In mucosal-associated cancers, including lung and colon cancers, increases in MAIT cells in tumors were concomitant with a decrease in the circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ling et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">SundstrÃ¶m et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Won et al., 2016</xref>). While the high infiltration of MAIT cells in tumors negatively correlated with a favorable outcome in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, the low infiltration of these cells in the tumors of hepatocellular carcinoma patients correlated with a poor prognosis, which is in contrast to the role of MAIT cells in tumor immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zabijak et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, the tumor microenvironment endowed by tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, tumor-associated myeloid cells, and cancer-associated fibroblast plays a pivotal role in cancer progression and regression. Accordingly, tumor-residing MAIT cells exhibit an activated and/or exhausted phenotype as exemplified by the upregulation of CD39, PD-1, and <italic>CXCL13</italic> upon the stimulation of TCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Leng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shaler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yao et al., 2020</xref>). Consistent with these findings, tumor-infiltrating MAIT cells from CRC show the decreased production of cytokines that are pertinent to antitumor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ling et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shaler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">SundstrÃ¶m et al., 2015</xref>). Nevertheless, it currently remains unclear whether these changes positively or negatively affect the function of MAIT cells in tumor immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cogswell et al., 2021</xref>). However, a recent study based on single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that approximately 50% of Tc17 cells in tumor-infiltrating T cells comprised MAIT cells across various tumors, and these Tc17 cells were particularly enriched in hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zheng et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, the frequency of Tc17 cells in melanoma patients correlated with responsiveness to anti-PD-1 therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sade-Feldman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zheng et al., 2021</xref>). The latter findings argue the antitumor activity of MAIT cells.</p><p>Based on these discrepancies, further studies are warranted to clarify the role of MAIT cells in tumor immunity in mice. However, difficulties are still associated with examining MAIT cells in mice for the following reasons. These cells are 10- to 100-fold less abundant in mice than in humans. Although the advent of MR1-tetramer (MR1-tet) has enabled the detection of murine MAIT cells, the paucity of these cells per se still hampers functional studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Corbett et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rahimpour et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, there is a lack of appropriate mouse models to investigate the function of MAIT cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Garner et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Godfrey et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Toubal et al., 2019</xref>). Although the development of MAIT cells is dependent on MR1, MR1-deficient mice do not necessarily reveal all aspects of MAIT cells because they are also devoid of other MR1-dependent cells and provide only limited information on immune cells that potentially interact with MAIT cells. Similarly, previous studies on MAIT cell-specific TCR transgenic mice revealed the protective roles of MAIT cells in bacterial infections, type I diabetes, and experimental autoimmune encephalitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chua et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Croxford et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cui et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Le Bourhis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Martin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Meierovics et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Reantragoon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sakala et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shalapour et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shimamura et al., 2011</xref>). However, the aberrant expression of transcription factors in MAIT cells impedes investigations on their precise roles in health and disease.</p><p>We herein used induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology to examine the role(s) of MAIT cells in immunity, particularly tumor immunity. We reprogrammed murine MAIT cells into iPSCs (referred to as MAIT-iPSCs), differentiated MAIT-iPSCs into MAIT-like cells (referred to as m-reMAIT cells), and adoptively transferred them into syngeneic immunocompetent mice to investigate their role. This approach not only allows us to assess the role of m-reMAIT cells as effector cells, it also provides insights into the interactions with other immune cells in tumor immunity.</p><p>In this study, we showed that 5-(2-oxopropylideneamino)-6-D-ribitylaminouracil (5-OP-RU), an agonist of MAIT cells, and 5-OP-RU-loaded murine MR1-tet (mMR1-tet) both activated m-reMAIT cells, while these reagents induced the production of a similar, but not identical, set of cytokines and chemokines in the absence of antigen-presenting cells (APCs). When adoptively transferred, m-reMAIT cells migrated to different organs concomitant with the acquisition of maturation and prolonged mouse survival upon tumor inoculation. This tumor inhibitory activity was mediated through enhancements in the cytolytic activity of m-reMAIT cells by NK cells.</p><p>The present results imply that the adoptive transfer of m-reMAIT cells has potential as a novel tool for examining the immune functions of MAIT cells in health and disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>MAIT cell reprogramming and redifferentiation/characterization of m-reMAIT cells</title><p>Fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS)-purified MAIT cells (defined as CD44<sup>+</sup>TCRÎ²<sup>+</sup>mMR1-tet<sup>+</sup> cells, purity &gt;97%) from the lungs of C57BL/6 mice were reprogrammed with the Sendai virus vector KOSM302L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wakao et al., 2013</xref>).

Consistent with this result, other MAIT-iPSC clones, such as L3-1, L11-1, L15-1, and L19-1, showed similar expression profiles to m-reMAIT cells on day 23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1H</xref>). m-reMAIT cells multiplied more than 100-fold starting from MAIT-iPSCs with a doubling time of ~10.5 hr during the logarithmic phase of growth later in differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1F and G</xref>). m-reMAIT cells were activated in a manner that was dependent on both 5-OP-RU and MR1 in the presence of APCs, such as WT3, the mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line, WT3/mMR1, WT3-overexpressing murine MR1, CH27, a B1B lymphoma cell line expressing a low level of endogenous MR1 on the cell surface, and CH27/mMR1, CH27-overexpressing murine MR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), which was consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cheng et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Miley et al., 2003</xref>).

The activation of m-reMAIT cells and subsequent production of cytokines and chemokines in the absence of APCs suggested that 5-OP-RU directly operated via MR1 in m-reMAIT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1DâF</xref>). 5-OP-RU may be passively transported into cells, which in turn promotes the release of antigen-loaded MR1 from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) onto the plasma membrane, thereby enabling signaling via TCR in m-reMAIT cells (referred to as a <italic>cis</italic>-acting signal) regardless of the apparent absence of MR1 on the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1I</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McWilliam et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, mMR1-tet directly binds to TCR on m-reMAIT cells and elicits signals (referred to as <italic>trans</italic>-acting signals). Therefore, 5-OP-RU and mMR1-tet may have elicited similar signals through serine/threonine and/or tyrosine phosphorylation or dephosphorylation via TCR, which ultimately resulted in a different profile of cytokine and chemokine production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1FâH and J</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gaud et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nausch and Cerwenka, 2008</xref>). In this respect, the signaling pathway(s) responsible for the production of IL-2, IL-4, MIP1Î± CCL3 (MIP-1Î±), and CCL4 (MIP-1Î²) may be common between 5-OP-RU and mMR1-tet. In contrast, mMR1-tet may have activated the signaling pathways pertinent to the activation of Th17 as evidenced by the production of Th17 cytokines, such as IL-17F, IL-22, and IL-23, concomitant with inflammatory chemokines, including CCL5, CCL2, CXCL1, and CXCL6, in addition to TNF-Î± (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). These results suggest that mMR1-tet signals, in part, through NF-ÎºB, while 5-OP-RU does not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>While 5-OP-RU induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation, the identity of these proteins remains unclear, except for LAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref>). Since LAT forms a hub that interacts with many signaling molecules, such as transmembrane receptors, phosphatases, kinases, guanine nucleotide exchange factors, GTP-activating proteins, ion channels, transporters, and ubiquitin ligases, further studies will provide insights into the proteins responsible for MAIT-TCR signaling and reveal the differences in signaling between conventional T cells and MAIT cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Malissen et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>It is important to note that the challenge with mMR1-tet induced the activation of m-reMAIT cells and production of cytokines and chemokines. This suggests that MAIT cells prepared from animals, including humans and mice, are unintentionally stimulated during experiments. Therefore, the interpretation of data requires caution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, F and J</xref>).</p><p>Although a previous study suggested that MAIT cells comprise MAIT1 and MAIT17 subsets characterized by the Th1 and Th17 transcriptomes, respectively, the present results revealed that m-reMAIT cells produced Th1, Th2, and Th17 cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Salou et al., 2019</xref>). This may reflect a developmental stage at which m-reMAIT cells are en route to functional maturation and m-reMAIT cells generated in vitro represent the most immature stage. Therefore, it is tempting to postulate that the interaction between nascent MAIT cells and double-positive thymocytes favors the differentiation of naÃ¯ve MAIT cells into MAIT1 and MAIT17 in vivo. The results on the adoptive transfer of m-reMAIT cells indicated that nascent MAIT cells egressed from the thymus migrate into any organs concomitant with the upregulation of CD44, a cell adhesion receptor, memory, and/or activation marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Benlagha et al., 2005</xref>). It is of interest that the expression of IL-7RÎ± in m-reMAIT cells became quasi-equivalent to that in endogenous cells in the intestines. Since IL-7 from intestinal epithelial cells plays a pivotal role in their homeostasis, the upregulation of IL-7RÎ± in m-reMAIT cells may mirror an intrinsic and primary role in this homeostasis and/or in the integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rouxel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shalapour et al., 2012</xref>). Alternatively, it may reflect the role of MAIT cells in IL-17A and Th1 cytokine production, which is dependent on IL-7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tang et al., 2013</xref>). Taken together with the time-dependent upregulation of CD44, increases in IL-18RÎ± and CXCR6 across organs indicated that m-reMAIT cells matured in the host. Thus, naÃ¯ve m-reMAIT cells, defined as mMR1-tet<sup>+</sup>TCRÎ²<sup>+</sup> cells generated in vitro, may be promoted maturation in terms of transcriptional program upon adoptive transfer into the recipient mice, as evidenced by the acquisition of cytokine receptors, the effector molecules involved in cytotoxicity and tissue repairing, and those relevant to tissue residency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplements 2</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">4</xref>). Moreover, the silencing of transcripts relevant to V-D-J recombination may ensure the continuum of the identity of m-reMAIT cells in the recipient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2âfigure supplement 5</xref>). These results have important implications for future cell therapy with human iPSC-derived MAIT cells. Further studies are needed to clarify whether and how the adoptive transfer of naÃ¯ve m-reMAIT cells affects epigenetic states, and whether this change leads to the generation of bona fide MAIT cells.</p><p>m-reMAIT cell dose-dependent mouse survival indicated their tumor inhibitory activity and function as effector cells in tumor surveillance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). However, since three consecutive injections of m-reMAIT cells failed to confer survival superiority, the niche for MAIT cells appeared to be saturated. Therefore, further studies are warranted to investigate whether a lymphopenia-inducing regimen, such as irradiation and/or cyclophosphamide, confers a difference in survival.</p><p>The failure of m-reMAIT cells to inhibit tumor growth in situ regardless of their mobilization to the skin indicated their poor infiltration into tumors rather than the loss of antitumor activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, future research that focuses on whether an intratumor injection of m-reMAIT cells inhibits tumor growth is needed.</p><p>While the importance of NK cells in tumor surveillance is well known, that of MAIT cells remains elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cogswell et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guillerey et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sharma et al., 2017</xref>). The present results showing the NK cell-dependent activation of m-reMAIT cells and the subsequent production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines suggested that NK cells stimulated the tumor inhibitory effects of MAIT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). Moreover, the enhanced expression of transcripts relevant to the cytolytic function of m-reMAIT cells upon an interaction with NK cells in vitro indicated that m-reMAIT cells exhibited cytolytic activity in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4CâG</xref>). The upregulation of <italic>Grzb</italic>, <italic>Fasl</italic>, and <italic>Tnfsf10</italic> in m-reMAIT cells suggested that cytolytic activity comprised exocytosis- as well as caspase-mediated killing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rossin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Trapani and Smyth, 2002</xref>). NK cell depletion compromised the survival of mice, which is consistent with the above findings, further highlighting the role of NK cells in boosting the tumor inhibitory activity of m-reMAIT cells in vivo. While NK cells recognize NKG2D ligands and/or the lack of MHC I on tumor cells, the molecular mechanisms by which m-reMAIT cells recognize and eliminate tumor cells warrant further study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nausch and Cerwenka, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Contrary to our results, MAIT cells have been shown to induce the metastasis of melanoma B16F10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yan et al., 2020</xref>). Although the reason for this discrepancy currently remains unclear, differences in the dynamics of MR1 shuttling between ER and the plasma membrane upon a 5-OP-RU challenge or putative ligand(s) present in the tumor milieu (TM) may be a key feature. Since LLC did not strongly upregulate MR1 on the cell surface when stimulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), 5-OP-RU may have bolstered B16F10 tumorigenicity through MR1. The MR1-elicited signal may suppress the function of NK cells for B16F10, whereas that from putative ligand(s) present in TM via MR1 did not, thereby enhancing or preserving NK cell functions. Further studies are needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms, which will provide a novel avenue for tumor immunotherapy with iPSC-derived MAIT cells.</p><p>Although we showed that m-reMAIT cells exhibited cytolytic activity against LLC together with NK cells in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and EâG</xref>), difficulties are associated with demonstrating that m-reMAIT cells isolated from mice exhibit similar lytic activity ex vivo. This is due to the low recovery of m-reMAIT cells and the compulsory use of mMR1-tet in cell preparations, which may interfere with cytolytic activity. Furthermore, it currently remains unclear whether these results are applicable to other cancer cells, such as B16F10, if the use of 5-OP-RU enhances or inhibits the cytolytic activity of m-reMAIT cells. Furthermore, since the transcriptome in m-reMAIT cells upon adoptive transfer still differed from that in endogenous cells, caution is needed when extrapolating the present results to MAIT cells in vivo.</p><p>In summary, the adoptive transfer model with m-reMAIT cells used in this study opens a new avenue for exploiting the function of MAIT cells and providing insights into their interaction(s) with immune cells in immunity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>All mouse experiments were performed with approval from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Dokkyo Medical University (permit number 1215).

In this regard, a detailed analysis to elucidate the differences is needed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Understanding the biology of MAITs is a challenging for immunologists even though this cell type represent interesting functions in a variety of diseases. In this manuscript, the authors present an exciting approach with compelling data to indicate the power of reprogramming on studying MAITs as well as the therapeutic potential on harnessing MAITs for anti-tumor responses. Overall, it is well performed and aims to address interesting and important questions with excellent approaches. Although I find this manuscript interesting, I do have some concerns on the reprogramming approaches the authors applied on the detailed cellular identity. Since transcriptomic and epigenetic events are affected by reprogramming and play important role in cell identity, it would be important to determine the transcriptome and chromatin accessibility in the reprogrammed MAITs and real MAITs from B6 mice. The comparisons will further strengthen the conclusion and allows the author more precisely interpret their results.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>a) Figure 3 contains a panel (E) that is the same as Figure 4 (H), which is the actual one used by the authors and discussed in the manuscript. The authors should be more careful to avoid this.</p><p>b) The authors demonstrate in vitro that exposure to 5âOPâRU, an agonist for MAIT cells, does not significantly upregulate MR1 on LLC cell line compared to B16F10 in Figure 3A. This was consistent with their observation that reMAIT cells do not exhibit cytolytic activity against LLC in vitro (Figure 4). However, reMAIT cells showed comparable cytolytic activity against NK cellâsensitive Yacâ1 cell line, which showed a similar expression pattern of MR1 as LLC upon exposure to 5âOPâRU.</p><p>i. Do Yacâ1 cells express molecules that can commonly activate NK cells and reMAIT cells?</p><p>ii. Is this expected of any MAIT cells, such as TCR transgenic MAIT cells that are commercially available?</p><p>iii. What is their MR1 expression pattern once injected into mice?</p><p>c) The authors demonstrated that adoptive transfer of reMAIT cells could significantly improve the survival of mice challenged with i.v. injection of LLC, an experimental model of lung metastasis. However, reMAIT cells did not enhance antiâtumor immunity against the same LLC when it was injected subcutaneously. From such observations, the authors concluded that reMAIT cells are inhibiting the metastasis of LLC rather than inducing antiâtumor immunity against them.</p><p>i. Is the lack of antiâtumor activity against subcutaneously injected LLC truly due to lack of reMAITâinduced antiâtumor immunity or potentially due to the absence or inefficient migration and residency of reMAIT cells into the skin? While the authors interrogated the distribution of transferred reMAIT cells in various organs, they did not show the skin where the frequency of MAIT cells among Î±Î²T cells is the highest as previously reported by the Belkaid group (PMID: 31649166). It is crucial to show the abundance of the transferred reMAIT cells in the organs relevant to the disease models used in the study.</p><p>ii. Perhaps using a luciferaseâexpressing LLC cell line allows monitoring the metastasis and growth of i.v. injected LLC in the presence of reMAIT cells as well.</p><p>iii. Considering the clinical potential of these iPSCâderived reMAIT cells, do reMAIT cells exhibit similar protective functions when transferred at a therapeutic time point rather than prophylactic transfer before the tumor challenge?</p><p>d) Given that the transferred reMAIT cells showed migrations into various tissues as demonstrated in Figure 2, can reMAIT cells be generated from MAIT cells isolated from other organs than the lung, such as skin or intestines, and still exhibit a similar protective role against the lung tumor metastasis model?</p><p>e) The authors nicely demonstrated that the tumor inhibitory function of reMAIT cells requires NK cells.</p><p>i. However, the transition from the observations in Figure 3 to NKâreMAIT interaction seems a little haste. It may be helpful if the authors could discuss in more depth the relevance between NK cells and MAIT cells in any context, whether cancer immunology or others, before presenting the data in Figure 4.</p><p>ii. Is the NKâinduced activation of reMAIT cells cellâcell contactâdependent? If so, is it possible to show the proximity of NK cells and reMAIT cells in the TME by using microscopy to investigate the existence of their communications in vivo?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall this work is well performed and the conclusions are supported by the data. The manuscript is clear and easy to read, which is appreciated. However, considering the in vitro differentiated system and despite being an original model, I am a bit concerned how this could be translated into physiological settings regarding the real role of MAIT cells in cancer. In order to strengthen these claims, I think the study could really benefit from additional comparison between endogenous vs. regenerated MAIT cells (are all the surface markers and transcription factors conserved?) and/or in vitro activation assays including microbialâassociated antigens to mimic the tumor microenvironment.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>â Can the authors elaborate more on the differences found between 5âOPâRU vs. mMR1âtet induced stimulations? It is briefly mentioned in the discussion but more mechanistic hypothesis could be nice.</p><p>â I think the discrepancies found in different human studies could be more discussed, because this remains one fundamental question in our poor understanding of how MAIT cells behave in cancer. For instance, they could comment on the differences found across cancer types, since one model only has been employed here for in vivo experiments. Would the authors expect to get the same response in a different tumor?</p><p>â Figure 1DâE: Activation of MAIT cells upon 5âOPâRU or mMR1âtet challenges are measured through CD69. I wonder if murine MAIT cells will express CD39 upon TCR stimulation as shown in humans (Li et al., Cell Rep Med, 2020)?</p><p>â The Figure 2 is quite interesting: can the authors discuss the distribution of regenerated MAIT cells in the different tissues upon adoptive transfer? Since they assessed CD44 expression at two time points, what is the frequency of reMAIT cells at these two timings? It would have been interesting to track/see how they populate the different organs.</p><p>â Figure 3D: can the authors show the tumor volume in the IV LLC model? I think it is important discuss the differences found between the IV and subcutaneous model. If reMAIT cells could not inhibit tumor growth in situ, the authors should at least change the conclusions in the abstract that is misleading, or test additional tumor models.</p><p>â It is a bit regretful that the authors generated this tool to explore interactions between MAIT vs. immune cells and only NK cells were studied. Since the role of NKT cells are quite well described in cancer and share a lot in terms of developmental and transcriptional pathways with MAIT cells, I wonder how they are affected in this system?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Reprogramming and redifferentiation of mucosalâassociated invariant T cells reveals tumor inhibitory activity&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

In this manuscript, the authors present an exciting approach with compelling data to indicate the power of reprogramming on studying MAITs as well as the therapeutic potential on harnessing MAITs for anti-tumor responses. Overall, it is well performed and aims to address interesting and important questions with excellent approaches. Although I find this manuscript interesting, I do have some concerns on the reprogramming approaches the authors applied on the detailed cellular identity. Since transcriptomic and epigenetic events are affected by reprogramming and play important role in cell identity, it would be important to determine the transcriptome and chromatin accessibility in the reprogrammed MAITs and real MAITs from B6 mice. The comparisons will further strengthen the conclusion and allows the author more precisely interpret their results.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your appreciation on our manuscript. While we agree that determination of the transcriptome and chromatin accessibility in the reprogrammed MAITs and real MAITs from B6 mice is of importance, these analyses are technically challenging due to the rarity of the endogenous MAIT cells as exemplified in the previous study (Hinks et al., Cell Reports, 28 3249-3262, 2019). Nonetheless, we have now addressed the transcriptome in reprogrammed naÃ¯ve MAITs, in reprogrammed MAIT cells after adoptive transfer, and in the endogenous MAIT cells in C57BL/6 mice. It turned out that the transcriptome of naÃ¯ve m-reMAIT cells clustered upon adoptive transfer, and has become reminiscent to that of endogenous MAIT cells from the lamina propria lymphocytes concomitant with upregulation of transcripts relevant to MAIT cell identity and function. Unfortunately, we could not address the chromatin accessibility. We hope that these additional data would further strengthen the quality of our manuscript and satisfy the reviewers critiques.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>a) Figure 3 contains a panel (E) that is the same as Figure 4 (H), which is the actual one used by the authors and discussed in the manuscript. The authors should be more careful to avoid this.</p></disp-quote><p>We have deleted the duplicated figure. We sincerely apologize the inconvenience.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) The authors demonstrate in vitro that exposure to 5âOPâRU, an agonist for MAIT cells, does not significantly upregulate MR1 on LLC cell line compared to B16F10 in Figure 3A. This was consistent with their observation that reMAIT cells do not exhibit cytolytic activity against LLC in vitro (Figure 4). However, reMAIT cells showed comparable cytolytic activity against NK cellâsensitive Yacâ1 cell line, which showed a similar expression pattern of MR1 as LLC upon exposure to 5âOPâRU.</p><p>i. Do Yacâ1 cells express molecules that can commonly activate NK cells and reMAIT cells?</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, we did not analyze the cell surface molecules in Yac-1. While it is known that Yac-1 expresses NKG2D ligands, important for recognition by NKG2D in anti-tumor activity (Nausch and Cerwenka, Oncogene 27 5944-5958 2008), our flow cytometry analysis failed to detect NKG2D in naÃ¯ve reMAIT cells. However, transcriptome analysis has revealed that the transcript for NKG2D was upregulated in reMAIT cells upon adoptive transfer (data will be available upon request). This strongly indicated that reMAIT cells may be activated by NKG2D ligands present in Yac-1upon contact with NK cells, which in turn led to enhanced cytolytic activity in vivo. Thus, we could speculate that ligands for NKG2D in Yac-1 activated both NK cells and reMAIT cells in vitro.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>ii. Is this expected of any MAIT cells, such as TCR transgenic MAIT cells that are commercially available?</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, we do not have TCR transgenic MAIT cells in our facility. Thus, we could not answer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iii. What is their MR1 expression pattern once injected into mice?</p></disp-quote><p>We could not measure it. Since LLC was injected intravenously, it is technically highly challenging to address such a question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) The authors demonstrated that adoptive transfer of reMAIT cells could significantly improve the survival of mice challenged with i.v. injection of LLC, an experimental model of lung metastasis. However, reMAIT cells did not enhance antiâtumor immunity against the same LLC when it was injected subcutaneously. From such observations, the authors concluded that reMAIT cells are inhibiting the metastasis of LLC rather than inducing antiâtumor immunity against them.</p><p>i. Is the lack of antiâtumor activity against subcutaneously injected LLC truly due to lack of reMAITâinduced antiâtumor immunity or potentially due to the absence or inefficient migration and residency of reMAIT cells into the skin? While the authors interrogated the distribution of transferred reMAIT cells in various organs, they did not show the skin where the frequency of MAIT cells among Î±Î²T cells is the highest as previously reported by the Belkaid group (PMID: 31649166). It is crucial to show the abundance of the transferred reMAIT cells in the organs relevant to the disease models used in the study.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your thoughtful comments. While it is true that the skin contains MAIT cells, the absolute number of MAIT cells is an order of ~10<sup>2</sup> cells/100 mm<sup>3</sup>. Concomitant with the published observation, we observed few reMAIT cell in the skin close to the tumor (please see Figure3âfigure supplement 1). From these results, it is reasonable to conclude that the lack of anti-tumor activity against subcutaneously injected LLC is due to the inefficient migration and residency of reMAIT cells in the skin, rather than the lack of anti-tumor activity of reMAIT cells per se. It is also noteworthy that such poor anti-tumor activity by m-reMAIT cells is, in part, due to poor infiltration into the tumor. Indeed, LLC is known to harbor little tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (Li, H.Y. et al., Cancer Immunol.Res. 5, 767â777 2017).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>ii. Perhaps using a luciferaseâexpressing LLC cell line allows monitoring the metastasis and growth of i.v. injected LLC in the presence of reMAIT cells as well.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments. In this study, we focused our study on the role of reMAIT cells in mouse survival rather than in metastasis of LLC per se. Future study could address this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iii. Considering the clinical potential of these iPSCâderived reMAIT cells, do reMAIT cells exhibit similar protective functions when transferred at a therapeutic time point rather than prophylactic transfer before the tumor challenge?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your thoughtful comments. We agree that this is a subject to be addressed in the near future for translational medicine.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) Given that the transferred reMAIT cells showed migrations into various tissues as demonstrated in Figure 2, can reMAIT cells be generated from MAIT cells isolated from other organs than the lung, such as skin or intestines, and still exhibit a similar protective role against the lung tumor metastasis model?</p></disp-quote><p>We could not address it. Our study has revealed that the source of MAIT cells was of prime importance for successful reprogramming, as we could not succeed in obtaining iPSCs from MAIT cells prepared from other organs under the same conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e) The authors nicely demonstrated that the tumor inhibitory function of reMAIT cells requires NK cells.</p><p>i. However, the transition from the observations in Figure 3 to NKâreMAIT interaction seems a little haste. It may be helpful if the authors could discuss in more depth the relevance between NK cells and MAIT cells in any context, whether cancer immunology or others, before presenting the data in Figure 4.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. We have added âNK cells are an essential innate sentinel in tumor immunosurveillance, and previous studies have shown contradicting results with regard to the role of MAIT cells on NK cells in tumor immunity. Yan et al. demonstrated that MAIT cells promote tumor growth by suppressing the activity of NK cells and T cells, while others have suggested that activating MAIT cells in vivo strengthens anti-tumor activity concomitant with enhanced NK cell response (Yan et al., 2020a)(Petley et al., 2021). We thus addressed whether and how m-reMAIT cells and NK cells mutually affected their functions in tumor immunity. âin the text (p13-14).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>ii. Is the NKâinduced activation of reMAIT cells cellâcell contactâdependent? If so, is it possible to show the proximity of NK cells and reMAIT cells in the TME by using microscopy to investigate the existence of their communications in vivo?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your thoughtful suggestion. From our preliminary experiments, we would infer that the direct contact between reMAIT cells and NK cells might be essential for reMAIT cells to be activated. Regarding the microscopic observation, we are a little bit afraid that our LLC system is not suitable for this purpose, as LLC is known to harbor little tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (Li, H.Y. et al., Cancer Immunol.Res. 5, 767â777 2017). It would be better if we could find a TME that contains both NK cells and reMAIT cells to observe such an interaction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Overall, this work is well performed and the conclusions are supported by the data. The manuscript is clear and easy to read, which is appreciated. However, considering the in vitro differentiated system and despite being an original model, I am a bit concerned how this could be translated into physiological settings regarding the real role of MAIT cells in cancer. In order to strengthen these claims, I think the study could really benefit from additional comparison between endogenous vs. regenerated MAIT cells (are all the surface markers and transcription factors conserved?) and/or in vitro activation assays including microbialâassociated antigens to mimic the tumor microenvironment.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>â Can the authors elaborate more on the differences found between 5âOPâRU vs. mMR1âtet induced stimulations? It is briefly mentioned in the discussion but more mechanistic hypothesis could be nice.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. According to the suggestion, we have added the following sentences in the discussion âIn contrast, mMR1-tet might have activated signaling pathways pertinent to Th-17 activation as evidenced with the production of Th-17 cytokines such as IL-17F, IL-22, and IL-23 concomitant with inflammatory chemokines such as RANTES, CCL2, CXCL1, and CXCL6 together with TNF-Î± (Figure 1F). These data suggested that mMR1-tet signals, in part, through NF-ÎºB, while 5-OP-RU fails to do soâ (p18-19).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â I think the discrepancies found in different human studies could be more discussed, because this remains one fundamental question in our poor understanding of how MAIT cells behave in cancer. For instance, they could comment on the differences found across cancer types, since one model only has been employed here for in vivo experiments. Would the authors expect to get the same response in a different tumor?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your thoughtful suggestion. We have now added more information on MAIT cells across different human cancers in Introduction (p3-4).</p><p>âWith respect to the response in a different tumor, we did not have enough data to discuss more. Please note, however, that when we have applied the same technique (adoptive transfer of reMAIT cells into syngeneic mice before tumor inoculation) to B16F10 melanoma metastasis model, we have obtained a similar positive effect on the overall survival.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â Figure 1DâE: Activation of MAIT cells upon 5âOPâRU or mMR1âtet challenges are measured through CD69. I wonder if murine MAIT cells will express CD39 upon TCR stimulation as shown in humans (Li et al., Cell Rep Med, 2020)?</p></disp-quote><p>We could not detect the expression of CD39 in endogenous MAIT cells in C57BL/6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â The Figure 2 is quite interesting: can the authors discuss the distribution of regenerated MAIT cells in the different tissues upon adoptive transfer? Since they assessed CD44 expression at two time points, what is the frequency of reMAIT cells at these two timings? It would have been interesting to track/see how they populate the different organs.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments on the distribution of regenerated MAIT cells in the recipient mice. We have provided the data relevant to this concern (please see Figure 2D, supplemented in the revised version). It seemed that the frequency of reMAIT cells in the primary lymphoid tissues (thymus and bone marrow) decreases, whereas that in other tissues including the secondary lymphoid tissues tends to increase over time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â Figure 3D: can the authors show the tumor volume in the IV LLC model? I think it is important discuss the differences found between the IV and subcutaneous model. If reMAIT cells could not inhibit tumor growth in situ, the authors should at least change the conclusions in the abstract that is misleading, or test additional tumor models.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your fruitful comments. When LLC was injected intravenously, we could not measure the tumor volume, as LLC enters circulation. In contrast, we could measure the tumor volume of LLC when LLC was injected subcutaneously. As shown in the revised manuscript, we could show that there existed only few reMAIT cell in the skin covering the tumor, implying inefficient migration of reMAIT cells in the skin or into the tumor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â It is a bit regretful that the authors generated this tool to explore interactions between MAIT vs. immune cells and only NK cells were studied. Since the role of NKT cells are quite well described in cancer and share a lot in terms of developmental and transcriptional pathways with MAIT cells, I wonder how they are affected in this system?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your thoughtful suggestion. We agree with the reviewer in that iNKT cells and MAIT cells share a lot in terms of developmental and transcriptional pathways. To answer this, we now have compared the transcriptomes among naÃ¯ve reMAIT cells (regenerated MAIT cells from iPSCs in the culture dish), reMAIT cells recovered after adoptive transfer into C57Bl/6 mice, and endogenous MAIT cells from congeneic C57Bl/6 mice. The results indicated that expression of the transcripts for transcription factors and effector molecules relevant to MAIT cell identity and function was upregulated upon adoptive transfer and the expression level has become close to that of endogenous ones (please see Figure 2âfigure supplement 1-5). However, we did not address the transcriptomes in iNKT cells.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please include in the discussion the limitations raised by in vitro redifferentiation of the MAIT cells in interpreting the data.</p><p>2) Several redundancies and typos are still found in the manuscript, a careful reading will be needed before publication.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the manuscript according to your suggestion and to that of the reviewer#2.</p><p>We described the limitation of this study with the iPSC-derived MAIT cells in the discussion.
