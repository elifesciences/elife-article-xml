have a lasting impact on neural function and behavior. Seizures during this critical period are linked to significant long-term consequences such as neurodevelopmental disorders, cognitive impairments, and psychiatric symptoms, resulting in a complex spectrum of multimorbidity. The hippocampus-prefrontal cortex (HPC-PFC) circuit emerges as a potential common link between such disorders. However, the mechanisms underlying these outcomes and how they relate to specific behavioral alterations are unclear. We hypothesized that specific dysfunctions of hippocampal-cortical communication due to early-life seizure would be associated with distinct behavioral alterations observed in adulthood. Here, we performed a multilevel study to investigate behavioral, electrophysiological, histopathological, and neurochemical long-term consequences of early-life <italic>Status epilepticus</italic> in male rats. We show that adult animals submitted to early-life seizure (ELS) present working memory impairments and sensorimotor disturbances, such as hyperlocomotion, poor sensorimotor gating, and sensitivity to psychostimulants despite not exhibiting neuronal loss. Surprisingly, cognitive deficits were linked to an aberrant increase in the HPC-PFC long-term potentiation (LTP) in a U-shaped manner, while sensorimotor alterations were associated with heightened neuroinflammation, as verified by glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression, and altered dopamine neurotransmission. Furthermore, ELS rats displayed impaired HPC-PFC theta-gamma coordination and an abnormal brain state during active behavior resembling rapid eye movement (REM) sleep oscillatory dynamics. Our results point to impaired HPC-PFC functional connectivity as a possible pathophysiological mechanism by which ELS can cause cognitive deficits and psychiatric-like manifestations even without neuronal loss, bearing translational implications for understanding the spectrum of multidimensional developmental disorders linked to early-life seizures.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The early years of life represent a critical period for neuronal maturation and the development of cognitive functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Short and Baram, 2019</xref>). Disturbances during this period can have a lasting impact on neuronal activity and cause multifaceted neuropsychiatric manifestations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Marín, 2016</xref>). Seizures are a prevalent disturbance in the immature brain and are often associated with profound and enduring adverse neurological outcomes that persist throughout adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brunquell et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Holmes, 2009</xref>). Children who experience early-life seizures (ELS) not only face an increased likelihood of developing epilepsy but also have a heightened susceptibility to cognitive impairments and behavioral disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), intellectual disability, and psychiatric symptoms like schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dreier et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Holmes, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kaufmann et al., 2009</xref>). Since the pathophysiological mechanisms linking ELS and neurodevelopmental disorders are complex, understanding how ELS per se affects neuronal function and dissecting the associations between neurobiological and behavioral alterations are crucial for developing better treatments for these conditions.</p><p>In experimental models, ELS induces long-term cognitive and behavioral alterations with translational validity with the main neuropsychiatric domains affected in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Holmes, 2016</xref>). Studies have reported that a prolonged ELS in rodents can lead to cognitive deficits, increased anxiety, reduced social interaction, and facilitated development of epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Castelhano et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">de Oliveira et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kubová et al., 2004</xref>). Interestingly, ELS models do not exhibit severe neuronal loss or structural damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baram et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Raol et al., 2003</xref>), suggesting that the behavioral alterations induced by ELS may be mediated by functional and molecular effects at the brain circuit level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kandratavicius et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kandratavicius et al., 2012a</xref>). The hippocampal-prefrontal cortical circuit (HPC-PFC) plays a crucial role in cognitive and sensorimotor processes, and evidence converges to indicate its dysfunction as a possible common mechanism shared between ELS, neurodevelopmental, and psychiatric disorders, especially epilepsy, psychosis/schizophrenia, ASD, and cognitive disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ruggiero et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sigurdsson and Duvarci, 2016b</xref>). Reports indicate that ELS impacts HPC-PFC functional connectivity, as revealed by the coordination of network oscillations during particular situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barry et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kleen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mouchati et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Niedecker et al., 2021</xref>). However, how specific functional or molecular effects of ELS on the HPC-PFC network are associated with separate behavioral dimensions within this complex multimorbidity spectrum remains unknown. Also, since behavioral alterations of ELS are long-lasting and progressive, a comprehensive characterization of network dynamics across brain states would be pivotal for a complete understanding of the effects of ELS on brain function.</p><p>Here, we hypothesized that ELS would produce long-term alterations in HPC-PFC neuronal dynamics related to behavioral abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ruggiero et al., 2012</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we induced <italic>Status epilepticus</italic> (SE) as a model of prolonged ELS and performed behavioral tests to assess cognitive and sensorimotor processes. Then, we performed neurophysiological, immunohistochemical, and neurochemical experiments to study potential changes in the HPC-PFC circuits that could underlie such behavioral alterations. We found that adult ELS rats present a myriad of behavioral impairments: working memory deficits, hyperlocomotion, poor sensorimotor gating, and behavioral sensitivity to psychostimulants. Surprisingly, we found an enhanced long-term potentiation (LTP) in the HPC-PFC pathway of ELS animals correlated with cognitive impairment in a U-shaped manner. Our results also describe neuroinflammation and alterations in dopaminergic neurotransmission as significant contributors to sensorimotor disturbances. We also investigated HPC-PFC dynamics across different brain states in freely-moving rats. ELS rats displayed an increased HPC theta power and impaired coordination of PFC gamma activity during active behavior. During rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, ELS rats showed a reduction in HPC-PFC coherence. Remarkably, ELS rats displayed an aberrant brain state during active behavior characterized by oscillatory dynamics oddly similar to REM sleep. Finally, we implemented a linear discriminant model, demonstrating that collective patterns of oscillatory alterations accurately distinguished ELS from control animals. Interestingly, although these alterations relate to broad clinical manifestations of neurodevelopmental disturbances and psychiatric manifestations, we recognize a particular convergence of dysfunctional patterns at multiple levels linking the consequences of ELS to functional alterations reported in animal models of epilepsy, psychosis/schizophrenia, ASD, and cognitive disability. These convergent patterns indicate that epileptogenic processes triggered during early life, such as neuroinflammation, could lead to altered neurotransmission and, consequently, aberrant dynamics in the HPC-PFC coordination, potentially contributing to the neurological and psychiatric manifestations linked to early-life seizure.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ELS induces cognitive and behavioral impairments in adulthood</title><p>SE induced by lithium-pilocarpine in early life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) produced an unequivocal and stereotyped seizure, consisting mainly of forelimb myoclonus and orofacial automatism (Racine 3), with some animals showing further development into bilateral forelimb myoclonus, rearing and falling (Racine 4 and 5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Racine, 1971</xref>).

Aberrant synaptic plasticity could be a common mechanism between cognitive deficits and epileptogenesis induced by ELS.

In this sense, the abnormally increased LTP could impair sensory processes during working memory and explain the poor performance we observed in ELS rats. In a neural network with aberrantly enhanced LTP, synaptic plasticity could be biased toward potentiation, resulting in a lower ability to retain information or adapt to the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Navakkode et al., 2022</xref>). This rationale is supported by several genetic studies, including on risk genes for neuropsychiatric disorders and autism that described relationships between enhanced LTP and impaired learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Garcia-Alvarez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Meng et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nuytens et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yokoi et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, hyperdopaminergic signaling enhanced HPC-PFC LTP dose-dependently following an ‘inverted-U’ function, where too high or too low dopamine levels disrupted LTP induction, indicating that altered DA neurotransmission could underlie the LTP abnormalities in ELS rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Goto and Grace, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Otani et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We also report an increase in GFAP expression in ELS animals. Inflammatory processes initiated by a brain insult could lead to functional impairments and, ultimately, psychiatric symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Vezzani et al., 2013</xref>). In ELS models, long-term glial activation has been related to behavioral impairments and epileptogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">de Oliveira et al., 2008</xref>), while treatment with inflammatory inhibitors resulted in reductions of GFAP and cognitive impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Somera-Molina et al., 2007</xref>). High levels of pro-inflammatory substances and neuroinflammation have been documented in animal models and patients with schizophrenia and ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Prata et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Vezzani et al., 2013</xref>). Noteworthy, the HPC of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and interictal psychosis present greater GFAP and microglia activation than TLE patients without psychosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Peixoto-Santos et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, GFAP is elevated in the frontal cortex of autistic subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Laurence and Fatemi, 2005</xref>). These findings are in accordance with clinical and preclinical biomarkers bridging psychosis and ASD to dopaminergic disturbances resulting from ELS.</p><p>In adult SE studies, behavioral abnormalities and cognitive deficits have been positively correlated to neuronal loss and spontaneous seizure frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wolf et al., 2016</xref>). It is suggested that the etiological mechanisms of neuropsychiatric-related alterations and epileptic excitability spread progressively over time. Indeed, the behavioral impairments in ELS models tend to be more subtle than in animal models of TLE or hyperdopaminergia. It is possible that the observed alterations in neuroinflammation, neuronal dynamics, and neurochemistry represent initial epileptogenic pathological mechanisms that could progress to spontaneous seizures, progressive neuronal loss, and more intense behavioral manifestations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dubé et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kubová and Mareš, 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Dysfunctional patterns of HPC-PFC oscillatory dynamics</title><p>Our results demonstrate a locomotion-unrelated increase in HPC theta power during active behavior in ELS animals. Theta oscillations underlie various cognitive processes and are believed to serve as a temporal organizer for multiple functions, such as sensorimotor integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buzsáki and Moser, 2013</xref>). However, increases in HPC theta power are also observed in hyperdopaminergic-like states, such as following the administration of ketamine or a dopaminergic agonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Caixeta et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Thörn et al., 2022</xref>). Increases in theta power are reported in most studies in patients with schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Newson and Thiagarajan, 2018</xref>) and have been correlated with poor cognitive performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Curic et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, stronger HPC theta power does not necessarily reflect an optimal cognitive state. In fact, abnormal and increased theta power has been described as a consequence of ELS in different models and related to cognitive impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kleen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Velasquez et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Here, we observed lower theta-gamma correlations in the PFC of ELS animals, suggesting a disconnection between theta power and local coordination of PFC activity. Similarly, the prolonged febrile model of ELS also resulted in a decreased coordination of gamma activity in the hippocampal circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kloc et al., 2023</xref>). In addition, we also observed a flatter PFC power spectrum in ELS animals compared to the normal tilt of CTRL, which has been discussed to indicate excitation/inhibition imbalance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gao et al., 2017</xref>). These findings occurring during active behavior could explain the cognitive-behavioral alterations we observed, at least to some extent.</p><p>Desynchronization between limbic-frontal circuits is also reflected by reduced theta coherence during REM. Genetic and neurodevelopmental models of cognitive disorders exhibit a decrease in HPC-PFC theta synchrony correlated with poor spatial working memory performance and anxiety behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cunniff et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sigurdsson, 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sigurdsson and Duvarci, 2016b</xref>). Interestingly, increased HPC-PFC theta coherence was described in a model of repetitive ELS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Holmes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mouchati et al., 2019</xref>). Specifically, this enhanced coherence was observed during cognitive performance and associated with a mechanism of neuronal compensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kleen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Niedecker et al., 2021</xref>). However, during REM sleep, these studies reported a decreased coherence and phase-locking value, indicating different synchronization dynamics depending on the brain state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Niedecker et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we observed impaired theta coherence only during REM sleep, which is the brain state with the expected highest coherence values, indicating that ELS animals could not reach or maintain this connectivity at the same maximum capacity as CTRL animals. The results from oscillatory dynamics in the HPC-PFC circuit indicate persistent state-dependent abnormalities in the temporal organization and interaction of local circuits that can contribute to long-term behavioral alterations and cognitive deficits. Further exploration should investigate HPC-PFC coordination during specific cognitive demands, such as working memory tasks, which we have shown to be impaired following ELS.</p><p>Our results also demonstrated that during ACT behavior, frontal-limbic oscillatory dynamics of ELS rats are unusually similar to REM sleep. Importantly, this finding could not be explained by altered locomotion or sleep architecture. This aberrant active state was more pronounced in the initial 12 hr of recording, corresponding to the habituation to the novel environment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dzirasa et al., 2006</xref> found similar results when recording hyperdopaminergic mice. The authors described a REM-like awake state in DAT-KO mice and wild-type mice injected with amphetamine. Similar to our results, the hyperdopaminergic wake state was marked by a significant increase in hippocampal theta oscillations. Additionally, treatment with antipsychotics reduced these REM-like hippocampal oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dzirasa et al., 2006</xref>). Our similar findings on a developmental model resulting in a psychotic-like phenotype support the relevance of intraindividual REM-wake similarity as a neural mechanism of psychosis. These results also advance previous studies, suggesting a shared involvement of dopamine in the impaired regulation of state-dependent global network dynamics in animal models of psychosis and epilepsy. Also interestingly, it is speculated that REM-wake similarity may represent a neural correlate of oneiric intrusion onto awake consciousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dzirasa et al., 2006</xref>), which, in the clinical context, could underlie potential phenomenological manifestations of sensorimotor disturbances of neurodevelopmental or psychiatric disorders.</p><p>In support of these dopaminergic alterations, we showed that ELS promotes apomorphine hypersensitivity and alterations in dopamine neurotransmission. Apomorphine sensitivity has been associated with reduced PPI, hyperlocomotion, and increased NAc dopamine release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ellenbroek and Cools, 2002</xref>). Corroborating our data, neonatal SE promotes amphetamine sensitization and affects both dopaminergic and glutamatergic levels in prefrontal-striatal circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lin et al., 2009</xref>). Importantly, alterations in dopamine signaling have been implicated in schizophrenia, ASD, and ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Grace, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kollins and Adcock, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kosillo and Bateup, 2021</xref>). These results point to enhanced dopaminergic neurotransmission as a potential mechanism underlying the functional abnormalities observed in ELS rats.</p><p>Importantly, the observed alterations in mesolimbic dopaminergic activity, coupled with increased neuroinflammation in thalamic nuclei, imply broader-scale brain alterations beyond the confines of the HPC-PFC circuitry. While our findings on synaptic plasticity and oscillatory patterns suggest a robust connection between behavioral manifestations and dysfunctional communication within the HPC-PFC circuit, it is plausible that SE induces dysfunction on a broader network scale. Notably, theta oscillation and state-map examination may represent larger-scale limbic-cortical dynamics that extend beyond the HPC-PFC circuit. Consolidated evidence underscores the concept that cognitive and executive functions arise from the coordinated activity of large-scale networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Uhlhaas and Singer, 2012</xref>). In this context, the disruption of functional large-scale networks may play a causal role in neuropsychiatric disorders and account for several specific dysfunctions associated with these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Uhlhaas and Singer, 2012</xref>).</p><p>The aim of our work was to establish a comprehensive framework of ELS behavioral and neurobiological outcomes to provide a foundation for future research delving into targeted interventions. In this context, we acknowledge that most of our findings are correlational, therefore, studies investigating causal manipulations will be paramount for establishing cause-and-effect links and understanding the chain of biological events that happen in the aftermath of ELS leading to behavioral and cognitive deficits. Still, our initial data-driven approach was able to reveal nuanced relationships, such as multivariate associations and non-linear relationships, that could not have been revealed through simple univariate analysis or causally perturbing single factors at first. Based on our findings and the supporting literature, particular targets for the following investigations stand out. We speculate that facilitating HPC-PFC LTP susceptibility could boost working memory performance in CTRL animals while blocking it could improve it for ELS. Also, we hypothesize that long-term inhibition of astrogliosis and neuroinflammation after ELS could attenuate subsequent sensorimotor impairments. Finally, we conjecture that aberrant plasticity and abnormal network dynamics could be normalized by dopaminergic inactivation in ELS animals. Thus, further studies performing causal manipulations will help us understand the mechanisms of ELS and bridge our findings with the development of new treatments for neurodevelopmental disorders.</p><p>In conclusion, we describe a comprehensive set of behavioral and neurobiological alterations following ELS that represent common patterns of dysfunctional circuit dynamics between developmental brain disturbances and multiple comorbidities associated. Although further studies should investigate causal links between neurobiological and behavioral alterations, our findings integrate a prominent theory about the pathogenesis of psychiatric symptoms that links stressful insults during development to increased HPC excitability, which would culminate in the hyperactivation of the mesolimbic system, resulting in behavioral dysfunctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gomes et al., 2020</xref>). Our results add depth to this theory by finding relationships among (1) neurodevelopmental insult, (2) neuroinflammation, (3) hyperexcitable HPC, (4) increased DA drive, (5) disrupted information flow in limbic-frontal circuits, and (6) psychiatric-relevant behaviors. Given the common pathophysiological and behavioral traits linking epileptogenesis and behavioral-cognitive comorbidities, we emphasize the experimental model’s validity to investigate the neurobiological mechanisms of how an injury during development can lead to neuropsychiatric symptoms. Our study also demonstrates the potential of a multilevel strategy combining electrophysiology, behavior, immunohistochemistry, and neurochemistry in revealing integrated multidimensional mechanisms linking developmental impacts to epilepsy, cognition, and psychiatric symptoms.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Wistar rats were housed in a colony room with a controlled temperature (22 ±2 °C) and a 12 hr light/dark cycle with free access to food and water.

We applied a linear and radial basis function support vector machine (SVM) <italic>fictcsvm</italic> function in MATLAB ('KernelFunction,' 'linear,' or ‘rbf’) as well as a Random Forest algorithm using the <italic>fitcensemble</italic> function in MATLAB ('Method,' 'bag,' 'NumLearningCycles,' 50, for Random Forest) to decode states. We used the ACT and REM epochs from all the rats creating one single model for the CTRL or ELS condition. Using the same approach, we also constructed a random forest decoder model with non-reduced variables using 1–55 Hz (0.5 Hz bins) for the PFC and HPC power and coherence. Discrimination was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). The pointwise confidence interval was calculated using a 1000-repetition bootstrap. Average AUC-ROC values were calculated using the prediction of the trained model on 20% of the epochs as test data and repeating the process 100 times.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism Software version 9.00 (GraphPad Software, LLC), and R studio version 2021. We used paired Student <italic>t</italic>-tests for within-group comparisons and two-sample <italic>t-</italic>tests for between-group comparisons. Two-way ANOVA with repeated measures (RM) was performed for comparisons across time bins, using Sidak’s multiple comparison tests as a <italic>post-hoc</italic>. To examine linear model assumptions, we analyzed the distribution of the residuals using a Q-Q plot, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, homoscedasticity, and the residual plot. We used the Mann-Whitney test to compare two groups and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to paired comparisons as non-parametric alternatives. We calculated Pearson’s linear correlation and Spearman’s rank correlation as a nonparametric equivalent. To compare correlation and spectral coherence estimates we applied Fisher’s Z transform to the data. For multiple comparisons in the neurochemical quantification, we performed Holm’s procedure for multiple comparison correction across neurotransmitters and metabolites per region.</p><p>Data are expressed as the mean ± SEM. The significance level was set to 0.05 unless stated otherwise. For some multiple comparisons, statistical values are expressed as the range. Significances are expressed as <sup>†</sup>p&lt;0.1, *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, and ***p&lt;0.001.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Linear mixed-effects models</title><p>We also constructed statistical inferential models across time controlling for individual variability and litter using linear mixed-effects models. We compared power and coherence estimates throughout time by dividing the electrophysiological recording into five periods (6 hr). Group and time (periods) were assigned as fixed effects and subject, litter, and time were assigned as random effects. We used this approach to construct a maximal random effects structure model as preconized in the literature as more generalizable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barr et al., 2013</xref>). The model was estimated by restricted maximum likelihood using the <italic>lme</italic> function of the <italic>nlme</italic> package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pinheiro et al., 2023</xref>) with an unstructured covariance matrix.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Multivariate analysis</title><p>Each variable was Z-scored before multivariate analysis. We constructed correlograms to assess the relationship within behavioral and neurobiological measures. Variables were sorted by agglomerative hierarchical clustering using Ward’s method and correlation as the metric. We also performed agglomerative hierarchical clustering of subjects using Ward’s method and Euclidean distance as the metric to assess how unsupervised clustering by our multivariate data might match the experimental groups. An optimal number of clusters was estimated using the silhouette method and final definition was based on parsimonious interpretability of the results.</p><p>PCA, using singular-value decomposition, was used for dimensionality reduction to find collective patterns of variance within behavioral variables (behavior factors) and neurobiological variables (neurobiology factors), and to reduce each immunohistochemical measure across all brain regions into single scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Johnson and Wichern, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Marques et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Marques et al., 2022</xref>). Principal components (PCs) were projected onto data and the mean score was compared between conditions.</p><p>CCA was performed to describe multivariate relationships between behavioral and neurobiological measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Drysdale et al., 2017</xref>). Missing data were imputed using the multiple imputation by chained equations algorithm. For CCA, we used the first PC (PC1) and second PC (PC2) of behavioral variables as inputs for the behavioral factors and the PC1 of each immunohistochemical variable (NeuN, PV, mGluR5, and GFAP,) across all brain regions and the Z-scored LTP data as inputs for the neurobiological factors. Variables were narrowed down from 30 to 7, which is statistically appropriate for our sample size. We used the CCA package in R to obtain the canonical dimensions and performed the Hotelling-Lawley trace statistic to assess the significance of each dimension.</p><p>We used multivariate generalized linear models (GLM) with a Gaussian family and an identity link function. Quasi-Poisson regression (quasi-Poisson family and logarithmic link function) were used for count data with overdispersion (Errors in the radial maze) using a quadratic covariate (LTP). We constructed two types of models: (1) a full model considering all the covariates; and (2) a restricted model using backward stepwise model selection based on the Akaike information criterion.</p><p>To assess the effectiveness of neurophysiological features in discriminating CTRL from ELS rats, we fitted a regularized linear discriminant classifier model on the PCA scores of selected electrophysiological variables. We used the MATLAB function <italic>fitcdiscr</italic> without hyperparameter optimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Johnson and Wichern, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Marques et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Marques et al., 2022</xref>). The linear classifier using two predictors allowed the graphical representation and avoided the overfitting of a high number of variables. Accuracy was determined as the probability of correct category assignments using leave-one-out cross-validation. We also determined the contribution of each original neurophysiological variable by assessing their respective AUCs using a univariate logistic regression model.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Validation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Validation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Project administration</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All procedures were performed according to the National Council for the Control of Animal Experimentation guidelines for animal research and approved by the local Committee on Ethics in the Use of Animals (Ribeiräo Preto Medical School, University of Säo Paulo; protocol: 159/2014).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-90997-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All behavioral, electrophysiological, immunohistochemical, and neurochemical data have been deposited at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/3yw65/">https://osf.io/3yw65/</ext-link> and are publicly available.

They find that prolonged early life seizures do not lead to obvious cell loss, but lead to astrogliosis, working memory deficits on the radial arm maze, increased startle response, decreased paired pulse inhibition, and increased hippocampal-PFC LTP. There was a U-shaped relationship between LTP and cognitive deficits. There is increased theta power during the awake state in ELS animals but reduced PFC theta-gamma coupling and reduced theta HPC-PFC coherence. Theta coherence seems to be similar in ACT and REM states in ELS animals while in decreases in active relative REM in controls.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The main strength of the paper is the number of convergent techniques used to understand how hippocampal PFC neural dynamics and behavior change after early life seizures. The sheer scale, breadth and reach of the experiments are praiseworthy. It is clear that the paper is a major contribution to the field as far as understanding the impact of early life seizures. The LTP findings are robust and provide an important avenue for future study. The experiments are performed carefully and the analysis is appropriate. The paper is well-written and the figures are clear.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The main weakness of the paper remains the lack of causal manipulations to determine whether prevention or augmentation of any of the findings have any impact on behavior or cognition. Alternatively, if other manipulations would enhance working memory in ELS animals, it would have been interesting to see the effects on any of these parameters measured in the paper. The authors now discuss the lack of causal manipulations in the discussion but have not performed new experiments to address this weakness. Also, I find the sections where correlations and dimensionality reduction techniques are used to compare all possible variables to each other less compelling than the rest of the paper (with the exception of the findings of U shaped relationship of cognition to LTP). In fact, I think these sections take away from the impact of the actual findings. The rationale for the apomorphine experiments are now explained more fully.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id

content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p><p>This important study assesses anatomical, behavioral, physiological, and neurochemical effects of early-life seizures in rats, describing a striking astrogliosis and deficits in cognition and electrophysiological parameters. The convincing aspects of the paper are the wide range of convergent techniques used to understand the effects of early-life seizures on behavior as well as hippocampal prefrontal cortical dynamics. While reviewers thought that the scope was impressive, there was criticism of the statistical robustness and number of animals used per study arm, as well as the lack of causal manipulations to determine cause-and-effect relationships. This paper will be of interest to neurobiologists, epileptologists, and behavioral scientists.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Joseph Gleeson as the Reviewing Editor and Laura Colgin as the Senior Editor for considering this revision of our manuscript for publication in eLife. We appreciate the positive acknowledgment of the study and the critical points raised by the reviewers. We have addressed all the excellent comments of the two reviewers, providing a detailed response for each comment. We believe that these revisions have significantly improved the quality and rigor of our study.</p><p>We want to assure you that our experimental design was meticulously crafted, incorporating adequate control groups, and is grounded in prominent studies in systems neurophysiology focusing into early-life seizures effects, especially for capturing mild effects. We conducted statistical tests adhering to established norms and recommendations, ensuring a thorough and transparent description of the employed statistical methods. We welcome any specific suggestions to further improve this aspect.</p><p>In fact, the concerns raised by the reviewers regarding statistical robustness may stem from a misunderstanding of the rat cohorts used in each experiment. Criticism was directed at the use of only 5 animals without a control group for acute electrophysiological recording. It is essential to clarify that this group served the sole purpose of confirming that the injection of lithium-pilocarpine would induce both behavioral and electrographic seizures. Importantly, this was a descriptive result, and no statistical test or further analysis was conducted with these data. In the revised manuscript, we have made adjustments to this description, aiming to eliminate any ambiguity, particularly addressing the issue of sample size in each experiment.</p><p>Regarding the lack of causal manipulations, we fully agree that this approach would provide a deeper mechanistic understanding of our findings and is an essential next step. Still, developmental brain disturbances are linked to manifold intricate outcomes, so an initial observational exploration would offer insights about particular and nuanced relationships for following studies aimed at targeted interventions. In this context, our objective was to provide a comprehensive characterization of ELS effects to serve as a foundation for future research. While recognizing the relevance of causal manipulations, only a more sophisticated data analyses were able to reveal more complex aspects like specific multivariate associations and non-linear relationships that would not have been revealed by causally perturbing one or another factor at first. In the revised manuscript, we emphasized the limitation of lacking causal manipulations as well as the advantages of our approach. Also, we mentioned some possible targets for following perturbational investigations based on our findings.</p><p>For a more detailed discussion on these matters, we invite you to review our response to reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 1</bold></p><p>In this paper, Ruggiero, Leite, and colleagues assess the effects of early-life seizures on a large number of anatomical, physiological, behavioral, and neurochemical measures. They find that prolonged early-life seizures do not lead to obvious cell loss, but lead to astrogliosis, working memory deficits on the radial arm maze, increased startle response, decreased paired pulse inhibition, and increased hippocampal-PFC LTP. There was a U-shape relationship between LTP and cognitive deficits. There is increased theta power during the awake state in ELS animals but reduced PFC theta-gamma coupling and reduced theta HPC-PFC coherence. Theta coherence seems to be similar in ACT and REM states in ELS animals while in decreases in active relative REM in controls.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The main strength of the paper is the number of convergent techniques used to understand how hippocampal PFC neural dynamics and behavior change after early-life seizures. The sheer scale, breadth, and reach of the experiments are praiseworthy. It is clear that the paper is a major contribution to the field as far as understanding the impact of early-life seizures. The LTP findings are robust and provide an important avenue for future study. The experiments are performed carefully and the analysis is appropriate. The paper is well-written and the figures are clear.</p></disp-quote><p>We express our gratitude to Reviewer #1 for conducting a thoughtful and comprehensive review of our manuscript. We sincerely value both the constructive criticisms provided and your acknowledgment of the manuscript's strengths.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The main weakness of the paper is the lack of causal manipulations to determine whether prevention or augmentation of any of the findings has any impact on behavior or cognition. Alternatively, if other manipulations would enhance working memory in ELS animals, it would be interesting to see the effects on any of these parameters measured in the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely appreciate the insightful comments from Reviewer #1 regarding the potential benefits of including causal manipulations in our study. We wholeheartedly agree that such manipulations can provide a deeper understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of the observed relationships and represent a crucial next step in our research trajectory.</p><p>Our primary objective in this study was to establish a comprehensive framework through observational examinations, exploring intricate relationships across various neurobiological and behavioral variables in the aftermath of early-life seizures (ELS). By identifying these associations, our work aims to provide a foundation for future investigations that can delve into targeted interventions.</p><p>While we acknowledge the importance of causal manipulations, we would like to underscore the advantages of our initial multivariate correlational study. Importantly, developmental brain disturbances have lasting impacts affecting multiple biological outcomes that may have intricate relationships between themselves. Firstly, although some neurobiological variables stood out from the comparisons of group means, this did not reveal some nuanced relationships within the data. The complexity of the relationships we uncovered, involving behavior, cognition, immunohistochemistry, plasticity, neurochemistry, and network dynamics, required a more elaborate analytical approach. Only through sophisticated data analysis techniques, we were able to dissect important peculiarities, such as the robust multivariate association between brain-wide astrogliosis and sensorimotor impairments, as well as non-linear relationships, such as the inverted-U relationship between plasticity and working memory. These nuances might not have been fully revealed through causal manipulations, since several variables are strongly related and consequently can affect several outcomes, leading to a false conclusion of direct causality.</p><p>Nevertheless, we acknowledge the understatement of the limitation of lacking causal manipulations in our manuscript. To address this, we have included a dedicated section in the discussion highlighting this limitation. We emphasize the advantages of this exploratory phase, supported by a review of the literature on cause-and-effect studies that align with our findings. Additionally, we speculate on promising targets for future cause-and-effect studies based on our findings. For instance, we hypothesize that enhancing plasticity may improve working memory in control subjects, while attenuating plasticity might have a similar effect in ELS subjects. Furthermore, we propose that reactive astrogliosis and concurrent neuroinflammatory processes likely underlie sensorimotor changes in the ELS group. Lastly, we suggest that dopaminergic antagonism in the ELS group could normalize behavioral deficits, prevent the exaggerated LTP induction of the HPC-PFC pathway, reestablish the state-dependent network dynamics, and desensitize the dopaminergic response.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[...]Also, I find the sections where correlations and dimensionality reduction techniques are used to compare all possible variables to each other less compelling than the rest of the paper (with the exception of the findings of U-shaped relationship of cognition to LTP). In fact, I think these sections take away from the impact of the actual findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's feedback and would like to emphasize the significance of the multivariate analysis conducted in our study. Multivariate analysis extends beyond bivariate correlations and is the only type of analysis capable of comprehending the relation of data in a multidimensional way, offering a comprehensive approach to understanding complex relationships among multiple variables. By employing techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA), generalized linear models (GLM), and canonical correlation analysis (CCA), we aimed to unravel intricate patterns of covariance that explore how different variables collectively contribute to the observed outcomes and assess the impact of each independent variable (predictor) on the dependent variable (the variable to be predicted or explained). Importantly, it enables us to control for potential confounding factors by keeping all other variables constant.</p><p>While we acknowledge that these sections may appear intricate, their inclusion is indispensable for a comprehensive understanding of the diverse variables associated with SE outcomes. We believe that these analyses offer valuable insights into the intricate dynamics of our study, providing a more holistic perspective on the altered spectrum induced by early-life seizures (ELS).</p><p>Regarding the reviewer's observations about the impact of the U-shaped relationship between cognition and LTP, we have made graphical and textual adjustments to emphasize the significance of these findings, aiming to enhance their clarity and impact within the broader context of our research. We trust that these modifications contribute to a more compelling presentation of our results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…]Finally, the apomorphine section seemed to hang separately from the rest of the paper and did not seem to fit well.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the Reviewer #1 feedback on the apomorphine section. In order to address this point, we carefully rewrote our rationale before the results to clarify our hypothesis and chosen methodology. In our work, we performed the apomorphine experiment as a logical next step of previous data. We showed that ELS rats display REM-like oscillatory dynamics during active behavior, similar to genetically and pharmacologically hyperdopaminergic mice (Dzirasa et al., 2006). Furthermore, other results also indicated possible dopamine neurotransmission alterations, such as working memory deficits, hyperlocomotion, PPI deficits, aberrant HPC-PFC LTP, and abnormal PFC gamma coordination. Therefore, we hypothesized that ELS animals would present a state of hyperdopaminergic activity. Among the possible methodologies to investigate the hyperdopaminergic state, we choose the apomorphine sensitivity test, which is classically used and induces unambiguous behavior and neurochemical alterations in hyperdopaminergic rodents (Duval, 2023; Ellenbroek &amp; Cools, 2002).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) It would be useful to stain for other GABAergic interneuron markers such as somatostatin, VIP, CCK.</p><p>(2) The authors refer to neuroinflammation but they are really referring to reactive astrogliosis. I would also suggest staining for microglial markers.</p><p>(3) The duration of chronic electrographic seizures in ELS animals should also be calculated and presented.</p><p>(4) Word usage: the authors frequently use the word &quot;presents&quot; when &quot;demonstrates&quot; would be more appropriate</p></disp-quote><p>(1) We appreciate your insight into staining for other GABAergic interneuron markers such as somatostatin, VIP, CCK. While investigating additional interneuron types is indeed relevant, it was not the primary focus of this study for several reasons: (1) The overall neuron density, assessed through NeuN immunostaining, revealed no differences between controls and early life seizure (ELS) groups, even in brain regions susceptible to neuron death after SE (i.e., CA1). Therefore, differences in interneurons, which are more resistant to death in SE and constitute approximately 20% of the cells, are unlikely. (2) Among all interneuron subtypes, Parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons represent a substantial population and are susceptible to various stressors. In the hippocampus, 24% of GABAergic neurons are PV+, whereas 14% are SST+, 10% are CCK+, and VIP+ are less than 10% (Freund and Buzsaki, 1996). Consequently, we considered PV+ interneurons to be a more sensitive subpopulation for evaluating the effects of SE. As they showed no significant difference, we do not believe that assessing smaller subtypes, such as VIP+ or CCK+ cells, would yield significant differences.</p><p>(2) While we often see activated microglia in hippocampal sclerosis, these cells are only slightly increased in cases without hippocampal sclerosis (which are similar to our animals), as we previously published (Peixoto-Santos et al., 2012). Astrocytes are a better marker for the epileptogenic zone, as are increased in epileptogenic zones without neuron loss and are also important for controlling neuronal activity by neurotransmitter recycling and ion buffering. In fact, our present model is very similar to the mesial temporal lobe epilepsy patients with gliosis-only, which are characterized by only presenting increased reactive astrogliosis in the hippocampus, without cell loss, and also present changes in innate inflammatory response related to the presence of reactive astrocytes (Grote et al., 2023).</p><p>(3) We have performed these calculations and added this information to the revised manuscript.</p><p>(4) We thank the reviewer for the word usage recommendation. Indeed, we frequently used “present” throughout the manuscript to describe the observations and patterns the groups “exhibited” or “showed”. However, we believe this is truly not the most appropriate usage in the Discussion when we describe the multivariate latent factors, as we did not “present” them, but rather, we “demonstrated” their existence and significance through our analysis. We rewrote these sentences and hope this is the point the reviewer was referring to.</p><p>References:</p><p>Duval F.

Their research begins by establishing an ELS rat model and conducting behavioral and neuropathological studies in adulthood. Subsequently, the manuscript delves into testing hypotheses concerning HPC-PFC network dysfunction. While the results are intriguing, my enthusiasm is tempered by concerns related to the logical flow</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing attention to the logical flow of the manuscript.

We hope these changes contribute to a more straightforward rationale and easily understandable presentation of our hypotheses and results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Focus on Correlations: The manuscript primarily highlights correlations as the most significant findings. For instance, it demonstrates that ELS induces cognitive and sensorimotor impairments. However, it falls short of elucidating why these deficits are specifically linked to HPC-PFC synaptic plasticity/network. Furthermore, the manuscript mentions the involvement of other brain regions like the thalamus in the long-term outcomes of ELS based on immunohistochemistry data.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your insightful comments, which allowed us to provide further clarification on our study's focus and findings. Our primary goal was to delve into the electrophysiological alterations within the HPC-PFC pathway. The rationale behind this choice lies in the hypothesis that, even in the absence of significant neuronal loss, functional changes in circuits closely linked to the cognitive and behavioral aspects under investigation could be identified.</p><p>While we concentrated our electrophysiological investigation on the HPC-PFC pathway due to its well-established functional correlates in existing literature, it is essential to highlight that our data reveal broader alterations in neural circuitry. Notably, we observed an increase in GFAP in the entorhinal cortex and thalamic reticular nucleus, along with changes in the dopaminergic release within the VTA-NAc pathway. These findings suggest that the impact of early-life seizures extends beyond the HPC-PFC circuit.</p><p>While we recognize the relevance of other brain circuits in the outcomes of ELS, we argue for a specific role of the HPC-PFC circuit in the outcomes of ELS. We will detail the supporting evidence and arguments that specifically link the HPC-PFC function to our ELS-related observations in a later comment regarding the &quot;overinterpretation&quot; of the HPC-PFC role.To better convey these important nuances, we have made specific modifications to the results and in the discussion section to underscore the broader implications of our findings, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the study's scope and outcomes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…]This raises questions about the subjective nature and persuasiveness of the statistical studies presented.</p></disp-quote><p>All statistical analyses were carefully applied based on the literature and following well-established precepts and precautions. Specifically, we constructed the experimental design for univariate inferential statistics for the data related to behavioral tests, synaptic plasticity, immunohistochemistry, oscillatory activity, and dopaminergic sensitization. However, we also submitted our data to multivariate statistical analysis, which is recommended in cases with a considerable amount of data, and intend to investigate possible hidden effects. In this situation, multivariate analyses are inherently exploratory due to the possibility of using multiple measurements for each phenomenon investigated. Nevertheless, their application is not subjective and follows the same statistical rigor as univariate analyses. We firmly believe that abstaining from exploring these data, would not reach the full potential of this analytical method in dissecting the multidimensional associations within our dataset. In order to eliminate any doubt regarding the objectivity in the choice and application of statistics, we carefully rewrote the methods, highlighting the details of statistical rigor even more.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Sample Size Concerns: The manuscript raises concerns about the adequacy of sample sizes in the study. The initial cohort for acute electrophysiology during ELS induction comprised only 5 rats, without a control group. Moreover, the behavioral tests involved 11 control and 14 ELS rats, but these same cohorts were used for over four different experiments. Subsequent electrophysiology and immunohistochemistry experiments used varying numbers of rats (7 to 11). Clarification is needed regarding whether these experiments utilized the same cohort and why the sample sizes differed. A power analysis should have been performed to justify sample sizes, especially given the complexity of the statistical analyses conducted.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's thoroughness and considerations regarding the sample sizes used in our study. The concerns raised about statistical robustness seem to stem from a lack of clarity in delineating the rat cohorts used in each experiment. It is encouraging to note that several studies in the field of neurophysiology, employing similar analyses, utilize a sample size similar to what was used in our research. The choice of the sample size was based on a thorough analysis of the existing literature, considering specific experimental demands, the complexity of employed techniques, and the need to achieve statistically robust results. In response to these concerns and to enhance clarity on the sample sizes, we have made several modifications (highlighted in red) in the text. Below, we provide details for each animal cohort utilized:</p><p>Cohort 1 - Acute Electrophysiology</p><p>The decision to use only 5 animals without a control group for acute electrophysiological recording aimed specifically to confirm that the injection of lithium-pilocarpine would induce both behavioral and electrographic seizures. It is crucial to note that this was a descriptive result and a methodological control of the ELS model. Besides, no statistical test or further analysis was conducted on these data. We maintain the belief that a group of 5 animals is sufficient to demonstrate that the protocol induces electrographic seizures, and introducing a control group was considered unnecessary to show that saline injection does not induce electrographic seizures.</p><p>Cohort 2 - Behavior, LTP Recording, and Immunohistochemistry</p><p>Initially, 14 (ELS) and 11 (CTRL) rats were used for behavior assessment. The reduction in sample size for LTP and immunohistochemistry experiments was influenced by practical challenges, including mortality during LTP surgery and issues with immunohistochemical staining that hindered a proper analysis for some animals.</p><p>Cohort 3 - Chronic Freely-Moving Electrophysiology</p><p>A new cohort of animals (n=6 and 9 for CTRL and ELS, respectively) was used specifically for freely-moving electrophysiological data.</p><p>Cohort 4 - Behavioral Sensitization to Psychostimulants</p><p>A fourth cohort was utilized for assessing behavioral sensitization to psychostimulants (CTRL n=15 and ELS n=14). The reduced sample size for neurotransmitter analysis (CTRL n=8 and ELS n=9) was a deliberate selection of a subsample to ensure a sufficient sample for quantification while maintaining statistical validity</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overinterpretation of HPC-PFC Network Dysfunction: The manuscript potentially overinterprets the role of HPC-PFC network dysfunction based on the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the insight from Reviewer #2 regarding the potential overinterpretation of the role of the hippocampal-prefrontal cortex (HPC-PFC) network dysfunction in the various alterations observed after ELS.</p><p>The significance of HPC-PFC plasticity and network function has been extensively documented concerning cognitive, affective, and sensorimotor functions, as well as in models of neuropsychiatric diseases. Our recent review (Ruggiero et al., 2021) compiles these findings. Specifically, the HPC-PFC network has been linked to spatial working memory through a series of causal and correlational studies conducted by Floresco et al. and Gordon et al. These findings make the HPC-PFC pathway a plausible candidate for underlying alterations associated with working memory, consistent with our observation of exaggerated HPC-PFC LTP associated with poorer performance in the ELS group. Regarding the immunohistochemical observations, we concur with Reviewer #2 that these findings suggest broader-scale brain alterations related to sensorimotor dysfunction beyond the HPC-PFC circuitry. Surely, we acknowledge that these large-scale alterations may underlie brain-wide network functional changes.</p><p>In our network dynamics study arm, we investigated HPC-PFC oscillatory activity, allowing us to discuss potential relationships between abnormal plasticity (verified in the second study arm) and network dynamics. It is important to note that while there is some anatomical specificity to the LFPs recorded in the HPC and PFC, these activities may represent larger-scale limbic-cortical dynamics. The intermediate HPC exhibits a significant influence from both dorsal and ventral HPC, and the prelimbic PFC is intricately related to both hippocampal and thalamic oscillations exhibiting under-demand state-dependent synchrony. Additionally, the state maps used in our study were initially described to distinguish states at a global forebrain network level. Even in our past studies, we have described HPC-PFC patterns of network activity (Marques et al., 2022a) that later were found to represent a part of a brain-wide synchrony pattern (Marques et al., 2022b). However, most of our findings on oscillatory dynamics were centered around theta oscillations, a well-established brain-wide activity that originates and spreads from the hippocampus and are present in the HPC-PFC circuit during activity.</p><p>In conclusion, we believe the correlations between HPC-PFC LTP and working memory, as well as the specific alterations of theta coordinated activity, support a particular role of the HPC-PFC network dysfunction in the effects of ELS. However, the brain-wide immunochemical alterations are plausible indications of larger-scale dysfunctional networks. To address this issue, we emphasized in the discussion of network findings that the immunohistochemical and neurochemical findings endorse the need to investigate ELS effects on larger networks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Notably, cognitive deficits are described as subtle, with no evidence of learning deficits and only faint working memory impairments. However, sensorimotor deficits show promise. Consequently, it's essential to justify the emphasis on the HPC-PFC network as the primary mechanism underlying ELS-associated outcomes, especially when enhanced LTP is observed. Additionally, the manuscript seems to sideline neuropathological changes in the thalamus and the thalamus-to-PFC connection. The analysis lacks a direct assessment of the causal relationship between HPC-PFC dysfunction and ELS-associated outcomes, leaving a multitude of multilevel analyses yielding potential correlations without easily interpretable results.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer #2 for the thorough review and insightful comments. To better grasp the context, it is crucial to consider this characterization within the scope of our experimental design and expected outcomes. Unlike epilepsy models involving adult animals or interventions causing pronounced neuronal loss and structural modifications, our study was intentionally designed to explore moderate behavioral alterations. In fact, the mild behavioral alterations observed in ELS models and the lack of neuronal loss guided our focus on investigating changes in HPC-PFC communication.</p><p>While our observed cognitive deficits may be milder compared to certain models, it is imperative to underscore their robustness and clinical relevance. These findings have been consistently replicated globally across various experimental models, encompassing ELS induced by hyperthermia (Chang et al., 2003; Kloc et al., 2022), kainic acid (Statsfrom et al. 1993), flurothyl (Karnam et al., 2009a; 2009b), and hypoxia (Najafian et al., 2021; Hajipour et al., 2023). Mild cognitive deficits were also evident by other research groups using the pilocarpine model in P12 (Mikulecká et al., 2019; Kubová et al., 2013; Kubová et al., 2002). Furthermore, our group replicated the working memory deficit results using an alternative paradigm (the T-maze) and a different rat strain (Sprague Dawley), enhancing the reliability of our observations (D’Agosta et al., 2023).</p><p>The clinical perspective gains importance, considering that cognitive effects of ELS may be less severe than those in patients with long-term epilepsy. In fact, the majority of patients with childhood epilepsy exhibit mild cognitive impairment as the most common grade of severity - more than two times the rate of severe cognitive impairment (Sorg et al., 2022). Investigating the mechanisms underlying these mild cognitive changes is crucial for shedding light on neurobiological aspects not fully understood, thereby expanding our comprehension of the consequences of ELS.</p><p>We recognize the challenges associated with conducting causal experiments in neuroscience, especially in long-term and chronic alterations as seen in our model. Isolating modifications of specific activities is indeed intricate. However, it's essential to acknowledge that neuroscience progress has not solely relied on causal experiments but has significantly advanced through correlational observations. Our findings serve as a foundational step in comprehending the repercussions of ELS, proposing mechanisms and circuits that necessitate further in-depth dissection and study in the future. We have integrated these considerations into the discussion section of the manuscript to enhance clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, while the manuscript presents intriguing findings related to the HPC-PFC network and ELS outcomes, it requires a more rigorous experimental design[…]</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for acknowledging our intriguing findings. Regarding the experimental design, we are confident that all the manuscript hypotheses, design, and execution of experiments were rigorously based on the literature and carried out with all necessary controls. As stated earlier, we constructed the experimental design for univariate inferential statistics and explored associations between variables using multivariate statistics. Specifically, we achieved a rigorously experimental design following a series of guidelines. First, the planning of the sample size in each experiment and their respective controls were based on mild effects from the ELS literature. As previously indicated, the only experiment with one group was just the description of the behavioral effects and electrographic seizures after the acute injection of lithium-pilocarpine. Given the exhaustive replication of these data in the ELS literature, this result was presented descriptively as a methodological control. Second, detailed descriptions of statistics were made in both methods and results, always indicating positive and negative results. Notably, the experimental designs used in the work do not correspond to any novelty or radicalization, strictly following the literature of the field. However, new indications and references about the experimental accuracy were added to the manuscript to resolve any doubts regarding objectivity.</p><p>References:</p><p>Chang YC, Huang AM, Kuo YM, Wang ST, Chang YY, Huang CC.
