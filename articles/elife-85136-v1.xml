mechanism leading to total knee arthroplasty (TKA) revision. Nevertheless, subjective knee instability is not well defined clinically, plausibly because the relationships between instability and implant kinematics during functional activities of daily living remain unclear. Although muscles play a critical role in supporting the dynamic stability of the knee joint, the influence of joint instability on muscle synergy patterns is poorly understood. Therefore, this study aimed to understand the impact of self-reported joint instability on tibiofemoral kinematics and muscle synergy patterns after TKA during functional gait activities of daily living.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Tibiofemoral kinematics and muscle synergy patterns were examined during level walking, downhill walking, and stair descent in eight self-reported unstable knees after TKA (3M:5F, 68.9±8.3 years, BMI 26.1±3.2 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 31.9±20.4 months postoperatively), and compared against ten stable TKA knees (7M:3F, 62.6±6.8 years, 33.9±8.5 months postoperatively, BMI 29.4±4.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). For each knee joint, clinical assessments of postoperative outcome were performed, while joint kinematics were evaluated using moving video-fluoroscopy, and muscle synergy patterns were recorded using electromyography.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Our results reveal that average condylar A-P translations, rotations, as well as their ranges of motion were comparable between stable and unstable groups. However, the unstable group exhibited more heterogeneous muscle synergy patterns and prolonged activation of knee flexors compared to the stable group. In addition, subjects who reported instability events during measurement showed distinct, subject-specific tibiofemoral kinematic patterns in the early/mid-swing phase of gait.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our findings suggest that accurate movement analysis is sensitive for detecting acute instability events, but might be less robust in identifying general joint instability. Conversely, muscle synergy patterns seem to be able to identify muscular adaptation associated with underlying chronic knee instability.</p><p><bold>Funding:</bold> This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Orthopedic hospital DongXiang</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>External research fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rao</surname><given-names>Longfeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><back><sec id="s1" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interest</title><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf1"><p>The authors declare that no competing interests exist.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: The project was approved by the Zürich cantonal ethics committee (BASEC no. 2019-01242), and all subjects provided their written informed consent prior to participation.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional Files</title><sec id="s3" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>Source Data files and related codes have been provided for all Figures and Tables in the supplementary and can be found here: https://doi.org/10.3929/ethz-b-000584582.</p><p>The following datasets were generated:</p><p><element-citation id="dataset1" publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>Longfeng Rao</collab></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2022">2022</year><source>Comparable in vivo joint kinematics between self-reported stable and unstable knees after TKA can be explained by muscular adaptation strategies</source><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.3929/ethz-b-000584582">https://doi.org/10.3929/ethz-b-000584582</ext-link><comment>10.3929/ethz-b-000584582</comment></element-citation></p></sec><supplementary-material><ext-link xlink:href="elife-85136-supp-v1.zip">Download zip</ext-link><p>Any figures and tables for this article are included in the PDF.
