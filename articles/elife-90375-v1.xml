atherogenesis. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are essential for vessel repair and, via their secretome, can invade from the vessel media into the intima to mediate ECM remodelling. Accumulation of fibronectin (FN) is a hallmark of early vascular repair and atherosclerosis. Here, we show that FN stimulates human VSMCs to secrete small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) by activating the β1 integrin/FAK/Src pathway as well as Arp2/3-dependent branching of the actin cytoskeleton. We found that sEVs are trapped by the ECM in vitro and colocalise with FN in symptomatic atherosclerotic plaques in vivo. Functionally, ECM-trapped sEVs induced the formation of focal adhesions (FA) with enhanced pulling forces at the cellular periphery preventing cellular spreading and adhesion. Proteomic and GO pathway analysis revealed that VSMC-derived sEVs display a cell adhesion signature and are specifically enriched with collagen VI on the sEV surface. In vitro assays identified collagen VI as playing a key role in cell adhesion and invasion directionality. Taken together, our data suggests that the accumulation of FN is a key early event in vessel repair acting to promote secretion of collagen VI enriched sEVs by VSMCs. These sEVs stimulate directional invasion, most likely by triggering peripheral focal adhesion formation and actomyosin contraction to exert sufficient traction force to enable VSMC movement within the complex vascular ECM network.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>extracellular matrix</kwd><kwd>cell migration</kwd><kwd>cell adhesion</kwd><kwd>regeneration</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000274</institution-id><institution>British Heart Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BHF-PG/17/37/33023</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shanahan</surname><given-names>Catherine M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000274</institution-id><institution>British Heart Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PG/20/6/34835</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Iskratsch</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000274</institution-id><institution>British Heart Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FS/14/30/30917</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Iskratsch</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM134531</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cheney</surname><given-names>Richard E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>0419-2021-001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kutikhin</surname><given-names>Anton</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Fibronectin triggers secretion of extracellular vesicles carrying collagen VI that regulate smooth muscle cell adhesion and migration during vascular repair and atherogenesis.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The healthy arterial vasculature is dominated by a highly organised medial extracellular matrix (ECM) containing organised layers of contractile vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Vascular pathologies such as atherosclerosis are associated with dramatic remodelling of the ECM ultimately leading to plaque rupture and myocardial infarction or stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Libby et al., 2011</xref>). Progenitor medial VSMCs are essential for vessel repair and must invade through the ECM to form the protective intimal fibrous cap in the plaque. This process of VSMC invasion actively contributes to ECM remodelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chappell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Misra et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Durham et al., 2018</xref>). The accumulation of liver-derived fibronectin (FN) in the vasculature is an early biomarker of atherosclerotic plaque formation and conditional FN knockout in the liver blocked VSMC invasion and fibrous cap formation in the ApoE mouse model.

Cell adhesion to FN is primarily mediated by α5β1 integrins and proteoglycans acting together to activate small GTP-binding proteins, Cdc42, Rac1, and Rho which in turn induce branched actin cytoskeletal rearrangements to form cellular membrane protrusions, filopodia, and lamellipodia, which are attached to the ECM via transient peripheral focal complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pankov and Yamada, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hocking et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bass et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nobes and Hall, 1995</xref>).

In turn, sEVs are trapped to ECM, and these ECM-associated sEVs regulate VSMC invasion directionality in a 3D model. Mechanistically, ECM-associated sEVs induced earlier formation of focal adhesions (FA) with enhanced pulling forces at the cell periphery, thus switching the leading edge from protrusion activity into contractile mode to enable cell body propulsion. Importantly, we found that the sEV cargo, collagen VI, is indispensable for triggering FA formation and directed cell invasion. We hypothesise that sEV-triggered peripheral FA formation anchors the cellular leading edge and activates cell contraction to exert sufficient force to allow VSMC invasion into the complex ECM fibre meshwork. This novel mechanism opens a unique therapeutic opportunity to target specifically VSMC invasion activity during vascular repair and restenosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ECM components involved in vessel injury repair stimulate sEV release via b1 integrins</title><p>FN is detectable in the vasculature as early as the fatty streak stage and preceding major atherogenic alterations such as neointima formation and it is also a novel marker for symptomatic carotid plaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Rohwedder et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Langley et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Glukhova et al., 1989</xref>).

Blocking these pathways with small inhibitors (FAM14 and PP2, respectively) reduced sEV secretion by cells plated on FN but not on plastic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H and I</xref>).

We quantified total sEV and characterised the sEV tetraspanin profile in conditioned media, and the 0.5 M NaCl and GuHCl fractions using ExoView. The total particle count showed that EVs are both loosely bound and strongly trapped within the ECM. sEV tetraspanin profiling showed differences between these 3 EV populations. While there was close similarity between the conditioned media and the 0.5 M NaCl fraction with high abundance of CD63+/CD81+ sEVs as well as CD63+/CD81+/CD9+ in both fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, the GuHCl fraction was particularly enriched with CD63+ and CD63+/CD81+ sEVs with very low abundance of CD9+ EVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The abundance of CD63+/CD81+ sEVs was confirmed independently by a CD63+ bead capture assay in the media and loosely bound fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>We previously found that the serum protein prothrombin binds to the sEV surface both in the media and MVB lumen, showing it is recycled in sEVs and catalyses thrombogenesis being on the sEV surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kapustin et al., 2017</xref>). So we investigated whether FN can also be associated with sEV surface where it can be directly involved in sEV-cell cross-talk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kapustin et al., 2017</xref>). We treated serum-deprived primary human aortic VSMCs with FN-Alexa568 and found that it was endocytosed and subsequently delivered to early and late endosomes together with fetuin A, another abundant serum protein that is a recycled sEV cargo and elevated in plaques (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). CD63 visualisation with a different fluorophore (Alexa488) confirmed FN colocalisation with CD63+MVBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Next, we stained non-serum deprived VMC cultured in normal growth media supplemented with serum (M199 supplemented with 2.5% sEV-free FBS) with an anti-FN antibody and observed colocalisation of CD63 and serum-derived FN. Co-localisation was reduced, likely due to competitive bulk protein uptake by non-deprived cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Notably, when we compared FN distribution in sparsely growing VSMCs versus confluent cells, we found that FN intracellular spots, as well as colocalisation with CD63, completely disappeared in the confluent state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F and G</xref>). This correlated with nearly complete loss of CD63+/CD81+sEV secretion by the confluent cells, indicating that confluence abrogates intracellular FN trafficking as well as sEV secretion by VSMCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Finally, FN could be co-purified with sEVs from VSMC conditioned media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1I</xref>) and detected on the surface of sEVs by flow cytometry confirming its loading and secretion via sEVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p>To understand how VSMCs interact with sEVs in the ECM versus in the media, we isolated and fluorescently labelled sEVs and added them either to the ECM or the media and tracked sEV distribution. Super-resolution microscopy (iSIM) revealed that the addition of sEVs to the cell media resulted in fast uptake by VSMCs and delivery to the nuclear periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1J</xref>). This was particularly obvious in 3D projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1J</xref>). In contrast, purified sEVs added to FN-coated plates resulting in their even distribution across the ECM were not internalised even 24 hr after cell addition with no perinuclear localisation of ECM-associated sEVs observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1K</xref>).

These proteins have previously been implicated in lipid metabolism alterations as well as inflammation in the plaque, hence indicating the advanced atherosclerotic plaque signature of the analysed samples.

Staining of atherosclerotic plaques with haematoxylin and eosin revealed well-defined regions with the neointima as well as tunica media layers formed by phenotypically transitioned or contractile VSMCs, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Masson’s trichrome staining of atherosclerotic plaques showed abundant haemorrhages in the neointima and sporadic haemorrhages in the tunica media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Staining of atherosclerotic plaques with orcein indicated weak connective tissue staining in the atheroma with a confluent extracellular lipid core, and strong specific staining at the tunica media containing elastic fibres which correlated well with the intact elastin fibrils in the tunica media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Using this clear morphological demarcation, we found that FN accumulated both in the neointima and the tunica media where it was significantly colocalised with the sEV marker, CD81 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D, E and F</xref>). Notably, CD81 and FN colocalisation was particularly prominent in cell-free, matrix-rich plaque regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>). Interestingly, colocalisation analysis of CD81 and FN distribution showed that there was a trend of higher colocalisation levels of CD81 with FN in the neointima as compared to tunica media, which was not significant (Thresholded Mander’s split colocalisation coefficient for CD81 colocalisation with FN 0.58±0.21 and 0.49±0.14, respectively, N=13, p=0.052, paired T test). An enhanced expression of CD81 by endothelial cells in early atheroma has been previously reported so to study the contribution of CD81+ sEVs derived from endothelial cells, we investigated the localisation of CD31 and CD81 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rohlena et al., 2009</xref>). In agreement with a previous study, we found that the majority of CD31 colocalises with CD81 (Thresholded Mander’s split colocalisation coefficient 0.54±0.11, N=6) indicating that endothelial cells express CD81 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rohlena et al., 2009</xref>). However, only a minor fraction of total CD81 colocalised with CD31 (Thresholded Mander’s split colocalisation coefficient 0.24±0.06, N=6) confirming that the majority of CD81 in the neointima is originating from the most abundant VSMCs. Finally, western blot analysis confirmed FN accumulation in the plaque region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H and I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). To understand the origin of plaque FN, we performed RT-PCR.

As we found that FN is loaded into VSMC-derived sEVs, we hypothesised that ECM-entrapped sEVs can enhance cell migration by increasing cell adhesion and FA formation in the context of a FN-rich ECM. Therefore, we tested the effect of sEV deposition onto the FN matrix on VSMC migration in 2D and 3D models. We found that FN coating promoted VSMC velocity and inhibition of bulk sEV secretion with 3-OMS reduced VSMC speed in a 2D single-cell migration model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>) in agreement with previous studies using tumour cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Sung et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Sung and Weaver, 2017</xref>). However, the addition of sEVs to the ECM had no effect on VSMC speed at baseline but rescued cell speed and distance in the presence of the sEV secretion inhibitor, 3-OMS, suggesting the EVs are not primarily regulating cell speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>sEV induces directional VSMC invasion.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) VSMC migration in 2D assay.

We developed a script to automatically measure cell invasion parameters (track length, cell speed, straightness, accumulated distance, lateral and vertical displacement and parallel forward motion index [FMI]; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/Alex-biochem/eLife-VOR-RA-2023-90375">https://github.com/Alex-biochem/eLife-VOR-RA-2023-90375</ext-link>, copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kapustin, 2025</xref>). The addition of sEVs had no effect on cell speed, accumulated distance, or straightness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D, E and F</xref>). However, VSMCs invading in the presence of embedded sEVs migrated more aligned to the FBS gradient compared to cells plated in the absence of sEVs.

Hence, ECM-associated sEVs have modest influence on VSMC speed but influence VSMC invasion directionality.</p><p>We wondered whether VSMC migration and invasion were affected by the FN cargo in sEVs that was shown previously to promote tumour cell migration by enhancing FA assembly and cellular adhesion to FN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Sung et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, we measured VSMC adhesion using an adhesion assay where sEVs were added to FN-coated plates and cells were plated onto these matrices for 1 hr and firmly attached cells counted. Surprisingly, we observed a marked reduction of VSMC adhesion to FN in the presence of sEVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), suggesting that ECM-associated sEV can impair VSMC adhesion. Mesenchymal cell attachment to the matrix is mediated by transient focal complexes present in the cellular protrusion as well as centripetal FAs that link the cellular cytoskeleton to the matrix and mediate the pulling force to move the cell body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Sheetz et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ridley, 2001</xref>). Consistently, we observed focal complexes in cellular protrusions as well as more centripetal FAs which were associated with mature actin stress fibres in VSMCs plated onto FN matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Therefore, we used a live cell spreading assay to monitor cellular adhesion over time using ACEA’s xCELLigence. As expected, FN alone stimulated VSMC spreading and adhesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>). Addition of sEVs did not impact cellular adhesion over the first ~15 min but then the adhesion was stalled in the presence of sEVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>), suggesting a defect in further cellular spreading. Again, to test whether this was specific for the sEV subset, we also tested the effect of larger EVs pelleted at 10,000 x <italic>g</italic> and found that these EVs had no effect on VSMC adhesion and spreading onto the FN matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>).

To test if sEVs can influence FA turnover in migrating VSMCs, we examined FA turnover in the presence of sEVs.

Interestingly, the FA turnover index remains the same in the presence of sEVs, indicating that FA stability was not altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>). These data correlate well with no changes observed in FA average size across various conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>) and indicate that sEVs are not influencing FA assembly or ‘life-cycle’ directly.

We hypothesised that sEVs trigger the appearance of premature, peripheral FAs by activating Rho-dependent cellular contractility. To test whether sEVs can modulate mature FA contractility, we measured individual traction force which is generated by mature adhesion sites in the absence or presence of sEVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

To confirm the presence of collagen VI in ECM-associated sEVs, we analysed sEVs extracted from the 3D matrix using 0.5 M NaCl treatment and showed that both collagen VI and FN are present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Next, we analysed the distribution of collagen VI using dot-blot. Alix staining was bright only upon permeabilisation of sEV, indicating that it is preferentially a luminal protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). On the contrary, CD63 staining was similar in both conditions, showing that it is a surface protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Interestingly, collagen VI staining revealed that 40% of the protein is located on the outside surface with 60% in the sEV lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). To test the role of collagen VI in sEV-induced changes in VSMC spreading, we incubated FN-deposited sEVs with an anti-collagen VI antibody to block its interaction with the proteoglycan NG2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sardone et al., 2016</xref>). Addition of the anti-collagen VI antibody restored VSMC spreading on the FN matrix as compared to non-specific IgG treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>).

Altogether, these data indicate that sEVs can induce early formation of mature peripheral FAs by presenting collagen VI, thus acting to modulate cell directionality upon the invasion (Graphical Abstract).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>VSMC migration and invasion to the site of vascular injury is crucial for vessel repair as well as the pathogenic development of atherosclerotic plaque; however, the mechanisms of effective invasion through the complex vascular ECM meshwork have been poorly studied. Here, we show that FN, a novel marker of unstable plaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Langley et al., 2017</xref>), enables VSMC migration and invasion by stimulating secretion of collagen VI-loaded sEVs which decorate the ECM and stimulate FA maturation. Notably, our data are consistent and extend previous reports showing that EV secretion by tumour cells enhances nascent adhesion formation, hence facilitating tumour cell migration and invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Sung et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Sung and Weaver, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Sung et al., 2020</xref>). In particular, we found that sEVs induce formation of FAs with an enhanced pulling force at the cell periphery, thus favouring actomyosin-mediated contractility which is essential for cell body propulsion and locomotion.</p><p>Mesenchymal cell migration begins with protrusive activity at the leading edge followed by the forward movement of the cell body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ridley, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arthur and Burridge, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pankova et al., 2010</xref>). Cell directionality is guided via the integrin β1 ‘probe’ on the tip of cellular protrusions, filopodia, and lamellipodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Galbraith et al., 2007</xref>). Cellular protrusions are attached to the ECM via focal complexes and extended by the physical force generated by the branched network of actin filaments beneath the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pollard and Borisy, 2003</xref>). Focal complexes either disassemble or mature into the elongated centripetally located FAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chrzanowska-Wodnicka and Burridge, 1996</xref>). In turn, these mature FAs anchor the ECM to actin stress fibres and the traction force generated by actomyosin-mediated contractility pulls the FAs rearward and the cell body forward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Sheetz et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ridley, 2001</xref>). Here, we report that β1 integrin activation triggers sEV release followed by sEV entrapment by the ECM. Curiously, we observed CD63+ MVB transport toward the filopodia tips as well as inhibition of sEV-secretion with filopodia formation inhibitors, suggesting that sEV secretion can be directly linked to filopodia, but further studies are needed to define the contribution of this pathway to the overall sEV secretion by cells. To gain insight into how sEVs can stimulate cell invasiveness, we explored VSMC protrusive activity using live cell spreading assays and TIRF imaging. FN stimulated VSMC spreading by increasing the number of FAs, which were formed centripetally from the cell plasma membrane. FN-associated sEV dramatically ceased VSMC spreading by inducing early formation of mature FAs at the cell periphery. Cell spreading and adhesion are orchestrated by the Rho family of small GTPases, Cdc42, Rac1, and Rho, with Cdc42 and Rac1 modulating filopodia and lamellipodia and focal complex formation and Rho controlling FA maturation and actomyosin-mediated contractility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nobes and Hall, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ridley and Hall, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Price et al., 1998</xref>). Interestingly, in fibroblasts, Rho is specifically degraded in cellular protrusions and cellular spreading on FN is accompanied by transient Rho suppression during the fast cell spreading phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arthur and Burridge, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ren et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Wang et al., 2003</xref>). This phase is followed by Rho activation leading to formation of actin stress fibres, tension increase on the focal complexes and their maturation into elongated centripetally located FAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chrzanowska-Wodnicka and Burridge, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arthur and Burridge, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ren et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Rottner et al., 1999</xref>). Excessive Rho activation leads to premature FA assembly and stress fibre formation, resulting in reduced cellular protrusions, inhibition of cellular spreading and motility on the FN matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arthur and Burridge, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ren et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Roberts et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nobes and Hall, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cox et al., 2001</xref>). Altogether, these data indicate that Rho activity, in mesenchymal cells with extensive FA networks such as fibroblasts or VSMCs, can slow down cell migration by immobilising cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ridley, 2001</xref>). However, we found that sEVs were not influencing mature FA stability. On the contrary, sEV-induced FAs were spatially restricted to the cell periphery near cellular protrusions and were characterised by an enhanced pulling force activity. Interestingly, fibroblast polarisation is driven by Smurf1-dependent RhoA ubiquitinylation and localised degradation in cellular protrusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Wang et al., 2003</xref>). A recent study indicated that Rho-dependent contractility is essential for cell invasion in a 3D model and it is tempting to speculate that local Rho activity can enable VSMC invasion by stabilising FAs at the leading edge and stimulating actomyosin-mediated contractility and cell body movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Matera et al., 2021</xref>). On the other hand, Rho–ROCK activity is critical for the protease-independent rounded motility of tumour cells and cell types with few adhesion contacts (ameboid) when Rho-dependent contractile forces generate hydrostatic pressure forming multiple membrane blebs to invade the ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sahai and Marshall, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sanz-Moreno et al., 2008</xref>). In fact, we observed that an extensive secretion of sEVs effectively ceased protrusion activity; also, VSMCs acquired a rounded morphology when ‘hovering’ over the FN matrix decorated with sEVs (data not shown). Hence, it will be interesting in future studies to investigate whether sEVs can stimulate Rho activity by presenting adhesion modulators—particularly collagen VI—on their surface, thereby guiding cell directionality during invasion.</p><p>Collagen VI is a nonfibrillar collagen that assembles into beaded microfilaments upon secretion and it plays both structural and signalling roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Okada et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, type VI collagen deposition by interstitial fibroblasts is increased in the infarcted myocardium and collagen VI knockout in mice improves cardiac function, structure and remodelling after myocardial infarction via unknown pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bryant et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Luther et al., 2012</xref>). Immunohistochemical analysis showed that in the healthy vasculature, collagen VI is detected in the endothelial basement membrane in the intima and it also forms fibrillar structures between smooth muscle cells in the media. In the fibrous plaque, collagen VI is diffusely distributed throughout both the fibrous cap and atheroma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Katsuda et al., 1992</xref>). Curiously, treatment of ApoE-/- mice with antibodies to collagen VI reduced atherosclerosis, but its exact role has remained unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liu et al., 2022</xref>). We and others detected Collagen VI in sEVs, but its functional significance remained unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kapustin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">He et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we showed that collagen VI is essential for early FA formation at the VSMC periphery as well as VSMC invasion in a 3D model. We propose that collagen VI modulates FA formation either by activating cellular signalling or acting as a structural component changing local ECM stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Sheetz et al., 1998</xref>). Identified collagen VI receptors include α3β1 integrin, the cell surface proteoglycan chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan-4 (CSPG4; also known as NG2), and the anthrax toxin receptors 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Doane et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nishiyama and Stallcup, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nanda et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burgi et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, a novel, recently identified Collagen VI signalling receptor (CMG2/ANTXR2) mediates localised Rho activation upon collagen VI binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burgi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bürgi et al., 2020</xref>). NG2 also activates the Rho/ROCK pathway leading to effective amoeboid invasiveness of tumour cells which is characterised by excessive blebbing and enhanced actomyosin contractility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sahai and Marshall, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Paňková et al., 2012</xref>). Hence, binding of collagen VI to these receptors can potentially locally activate Rho and trigger FA formation and actomyosin contractility, thus increasing VSMC motility and directional invasiveness. Of note, it was also reported that NG2 expression is elevated in VSMCs in the atherosclerotic plaque and NG2 knockout prevents plaque formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Tillet et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">She et al., 2016</xref>). Curiously, endotrophin, a collagen VI α3 chain-derived profibrotic fragment has recently been associated with a higher risk of arterial stiffness and cardiovascular and all‐cause death in patients with type 1 diabetes and atherosclerosis, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Holm Nielsen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Frimodt-Møller et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In addition to collagen VI, the unique adhesion cluster in VSMC-derived sEVS also includes EGF-like repeat and discoidin I-like domain-containing protein (EDIL3), transforming growth factor-beta-induced protein ig-h3 (TGFBI) and the lectin galactoside-binding soluble 3 binding protein (LGALS3BP), and these proteins are also directly implicated in activation of integrin signalling and cellular invasiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Costanza et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Stampolidis et al., 2015</xref>). Although we found that collagen VI plays the key role in sEV-induced early formation of FAs in VSMCs, it is tempting to speculate that the high sEV efficacy in stimulating FA formation is driven by cooperative action of this unique adhesion complex on the sEVs surface and targeting this novel sEV-dependent mechanism of VSMC invasion may open up new therapeutic opportunities to modulate atherosclerotic plaque development or even to prevent undesired VSMC motility in restenosis.</p><p>We also identified a positive feedback loop and showed that FN stimulates sEV secretion by VSMCs. sEV secretion is a tightly regulated process which is governed by activation of signalling pathways including activation of G-protein-coupled receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Verweij et al., 2018</xref>) and alterations in cytosolic calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Savina et al., 2003</xref>), small GTPases Rab7, Rab27a, Rab27b, and Rab35 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jaé et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Savina et al., 2002</xref>), vesicular trafficking scaffold proteins including syntenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baietti et al., 2012</xref>), sortillin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goettsch et al., 2016</xref>), and CD63 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">van Niel et al., 2011</xref>) or accumulation of ceramide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Trajkovic et al., 2008</xref>). We found that the fibrillar ECM proteins, FN and collagen I, induce sEV secretion by activating the β1 integrin/FAK/Src and Arp2/3-dependent pathways. Our in vivo FN staining data are in good agreement with previous studies showing accumulation of FN in late-stage plaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Langley et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Glukhova et al., 1989</xref>). Moreover, we observed close co-distribution of FN and CD81 in the plaque, suggesting that accumulating FN matrices can stimulate sEV secretion in vivo. Notably, expression of the major FN receptor, α5β1 integrin is re-activated upon VSMC de-differentiation following vascular injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pickering et al., 2000</xref>). It is thought the α5β1 integrin mediates FN matrix assembly, whilst β3 integrins are important for cell-matrix interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pickering et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Slepian et al., 1998</xref>). Our data sheds new light on the functional role of α5β1 as an ECM sensor inducing production of collagen VI-loaded sEVs which in turn enhance cell invasion in the complex ECM meshwork. Although our small inhibitors and integrin modulating antibody data clearly indicate that β1 activation triggers sEV secretion via activation of actin assembly, we cannot fully rule out that FN may also be modulating growth factor activity which in turn contributes to sEV secretion by VSMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kapustin et al., 2015</xref>). Excessive collagen and elastin matrix breakdown in atheroma has been tightly linked to acute coronary events; hence, it will be interesting to study the possible link between sEV secretion and plaque stability, as sEV-dependent invasion is also likely to influence the necessary ECM degradation induced by invading cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Libby and Aikawa, 2002</xref>).</p><p>In summary, cooperative activation of integrin signalling and F-actin cytoskeleton pathways results in the secretion of sEVs which associate with the ECM and play a signalling role by controlling FA formation and cell-ECM crosstalk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).

All emission light was filtered through a quad channel filter set (Chroma 89000) in the upper filter turret and a secondary bandpass emission filter in the lower turret position was used as follows for each channel (488 nm excited: filter BP 525/50 - Chroma; 561 nm excited: filter BP 595/50 - Chroma; 640 nm excited: filter BP 700/75 - Chroma).

The Cell area, whole cell Vinculin and Far-Red intensity measurements were calculated from this binary region.

The foci mask was then limited to the cell mask regions to allow interpretation of the foci in the cell area. Minimum distance to the outside of the cell for each foci was calculated by measurement of the nearest distance to the inverted non-cell mask. The average distance was then recorded for each image.

Proteins were separated by the sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) at 150 V for 2 hr using NuPAGE 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid SDS running buffer (NP0002, Thermo Fisher Scientific), NuPAGE Antioxidant (NP0005, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and XCell SureLock Mini-Cell vertical mini-protein gel electrophoresis system (EI0001, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Protein transfer was performed using polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) transfer stacks (IB24001, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and iBlot 2 Gel Transfer Device (IB21001, Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s protocols using a standard transfer mode for 30–150 kDa proteins (P0 – 20 V for 1 min, 23 V for 4 min, and 25 V for 2 min). PVDF membranes were then incubated in iBind Flex Solution (SLF2020, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 1 hr to prevent non-specific binding.</p><p>Blots were probed with rabbit primary antibodies to fibronectin or GAPDH (loading control). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (7074, Cell Signaling Technology) or goat anti-mouse (AP130P, Sigma-Aldrich) secondary antibodies were used at 1:200 and 1:1000 dilution, respectively. Incubation with the antibodies was performed using iBind Flex Solution Kit (SLF2020, Thermo Fisher Scientific), iBind Flex Cards (SLF2010, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and iBind Flex Western Device (SLF2000, Thermo Fisher Scientific) during 3 hr according to the manufacturer’s protocols. Chemiluminescent detection was performed using SuperSignal West Pico PLUS chemiluminescent substrate (34580, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and C-DiGit blot scanner (3600–00, LI-COR Biosciences) in a high-sensitivity mode (12 min scanning). Densitometry was performed using the ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health) using the standard algorithm (consecutive selection and plotting of the lanes with the measurement of the peak area) and subsequent adjustment to the loading control (GAPDH).</p></sec><sec id="s4-27-6"><title>Shotgun proteomics and proteomics data analysis</title><p>Carotid atherosclerotic plaques and adjacent intact arterial segments were excised pairwise during carotid endarterectomy. Tissue segments were homogenised in T-PER Tissue Protein Extraction Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific), supplemented with Halt protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific), for total protein extraction according to the manufacturer’s protocols. Following acetone (Supelco) precipitation to remove T-PER buffer, protein pellets were resuspended in 8 M urea (Sigma-Aldrich) in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (Sigma-Aldrich). Protein concentration was measured using a Qubit 4 fluorometer and QuDye Protein Quantification Kit (Lumiprobe), per manufacturer’s instructions. Each protein sample (10  μg) was incubated with 5 mmol/L dithiothreitol (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 hr at 37°C, followed by 15 mmol/L iodoacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min in the dark at room temperature. Samples were diluted with 7 volumes of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate and digested for 16 hr at 37°C using trypsin gold (Promega) at a 1:50 trypsin:protein ratio (200 ng per sample). Peptides were dried using a Labconco CentriVap Centrifugal Concentrator (Labconco), dissolved in 0.1% formic acid (Sigma-Aldrich), and desalted with C18 spin tips according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After desalting, peptides were dried again and re-dissolved in 0.1% formic acid for LC-MS/MS analysis. Each sample was analysed in technical duplicate. Approximately 500 ng of peptides were subjected to shotgun proteomics using UHPLC-MS/MS with ion mobility on a TimsToF Pro mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics) coupled to a nanoElute UHPLC system (Bruker Daltonics). Separation was performed in two-column mode using an Acclaim PepMap 5  mm Trap Cartridge and Bruker Ten separation column (C18 ReproSil AQ, 100 mm × 0.75 mm, 1.9  µm, 120  Å; Bruker Daltonics) at a flow rate of 500  nL/min and 50°C. Mobile phase A was water/0.1% formic acid; mobile phase B was acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid. The UHPLC gradient was set as: 2–30% phase B over 16  min, 30–38% phase B over 5  min, and 38–95% phase B over 3  min, followed by 6  min washing at 95% phase B. Electrospray ionisation was achieved using a CaptiveSpray ion source with a capillary voltage of 1600  V, nitrogen flow of 3  L/min, and source temperature of 180°C. Mass spectrometry acquisition was performed in data-independent acquisition mode with trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS, in PASEF mode, diaPASEF). The diaPASEF method included five cycles with three or two mobility windows each, totaling 13 mass width windows (50  Da width) spanning an m/z range of 457.81–1046.80 and ion mobility range (1 /K0) of 0.85–1.18 Vs/cm². Collision energy was programmed as a function of ion mobility, increasing linearly from 20  eV at 1 /K0 = 0.85 Vs/cm² to 59  eV at 1 /K0 = 1.3 Vs/cm². Protein identification was performed using DIA-NN software (v1.8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Demichev et al., 2020</xref>) with the human SwissProt protein database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.uniprot.org">https://www.uniprot.org</ext-link>; accessed 14 December 2021; taxonomy: Human [9606]; uploaded 2 March 2021).

Namely, the authors have addressed several of the major issues with the original submission, providing a more concrete link between fibronectin and the secretion of extracellular vesicles. Additionally, the authors have moderated some of the conclusions to better suit the rigor of the experimental results and limitations of their approach. Generally, the findings convey an interesting cell autonomous pathway in which smooth muscle cells sense fibronectin, which canonically is a proinflammatory substrate with activating properties in many tissues. Fibronectin-mediated integrin signaling stimulates secretion of small extracellular vesicles containing collagen VI which is deposited into the surrounding extracellular matrix. Collagen VI itself gleaned from extracellular vesicle secretion seems to further alter smooth muscle cell morphodynamics. For this later finding, much of the mechanism behind collagen VI vesicle loading and secretion has yet to be worked out. The authors provide evidence of extracellular vesicles containing collagen VI trapped in fibronectin in atherosclerotic plaques providing a nice validation of their in vitro findings in a diseased human cohort. Some limitations do still exist in the manuscript in its current form such as the assessment of the vesicle origins, contents and their association with the actin cytoskeleton; however, the rigor and execution are much improved from the preceding version. Overall, the pathobiology underlying vascular smooth muscle remodeling in disease states is a critical area of research that warrants further exploration.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.90375.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The findings in the current manuscript are interesting and valuable contributions to the fields of vascular biology and extracellular vesicle-related mechanisms. They suggest a potential role for smooth muscle cell-derived extracellular vesicles in presenting Type VI collagen to cells to orchestrate their migration, with proposed relevance to aberrant smooth muscle cell movements in the progression of atherosclerotic lesions. A wide range of assays are utilized to test various aspects of this working model, with the resulting data being largely solid and supporting several of the interpretations articulated by the authors. The revised manuscript has adequately addressed key weaknesses.</p><p>The authors present data suggesting a working model in which vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMCs) are stimulated by fibronectin (FN) to generate small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) that harbor Type VI Collagen (collagen VI). These collagen VI-associated sEVs are suggested to accumulate in the extracellular matrix (ECM) and influence cell migration and adhesion dynamics, potentially contributing to disease progression in atherosclerosis. Majors strengths of this manuscript include robust imaging data and the inclusion of human-derived samples in their analysis. The authors also make a reasonable attempt to provide data to support the potential existence of these mechanistic connections, though some minor questions remain regarding data interpretation. The authors largely achieved their aims of finding evidence consistent with their interpretations, and they have presented logical support for their conclusions while acknowledging important limitations and caveats to their current study. This work will likely have a sustained impact on the field of sEV biology and potential intersections with vascular biology, including their methodology e.g., imaging approaches. As biologists continue to explore the role of sEVs in physiological and pathological processes, this work raises an interesting aspect that must be considered more broadly, and that is, what is the role of sEVs that are ECM-associated and not necessarily internalized by recipient cells? Are there discrete mechanisms that govern their role in maintaining and/or disrupting normal physiological processes? This manuscript makes an attempt to address these unresolved yet critical questions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id

reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary</p><p>In this investigation Kapustin et al. demonstrate that vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) exposed to the extracellular matrix fibronectin stimulates the release of small extracellular vesicles (sEVs). The authors provide experimental evidence that stimulation of the actin cytoskeleton boosts sEV secretion and posit that sEVs harbor both fibronectin and collagen IV protein themselves which also, in turn, alter cell migration parameters. It is well established that fibronectin is associated with increased cell migration and adherence; therefore, this association with VSMCs is not novel.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that FN has been associated with migration and adherence in previous studies. However we have extended these observations to show that the extracellular fibronectin matrix stimulates small extracellular vesicle (sEVs) secretion by modulating the actin cytoskeleton. We also showed that sEVs are trapped in the extracellular matrix and that by presenting collagen VI induce early focal adhesion formation, reduce excessive cellular spreading and guide cell invasion directionality though a 3D matrix. Hence, sEVs mediate cell-matrix cross talk and change cell behaviour in the context of fibronectin matrix. This is critically important for vasculature where regulated VSMC invasion is essential for repair with its deregulation leading to pathology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors purport that sEV are largely born of filopodia origin; however, this data is not well executed and seems generally at odds with the presented data.</p></disp-quote><p>Our experimental data showed that CD63 MVs are associated with filopodia in fixed and live cells (Fig 2E, 2F and Video S1) and that inhibition of filopodia formation using the formin inhibitor, SMIFH2 reduced sEV secretion on FN (Fig 2B). However, we agree with the reviewer that further studies are required to connect sEV secretion to filopodia. To address this we have provided further data analysis but also toned down our conclusions regarding this point: . Changes include:</p><p>(1) Title: Matrix-associated extracellular vesicles modulate smooth muscle cell adhesion and directionality by presenting collagen VI.</p><p>(2) Results, section title: 2. FN-induced sEV secretion is modulated by Arp2/3 and formin-dependent actin cytoskeleton remodelling</p><p>(3) Results, page 6 Line 27-44 and conclusion page 7, Ln 3 “Interestingly, CD63+ MVBs can be observed in filopodia-like structures suggesting that sEV secretion can also occur spatially via cellular protrusion-like filopodia but more studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.”</p><p>(4) Discussion, page 12, line 19. “Curiously we observed CD63+ MVB transport toward the filopodia tips as well as inhibition of sEV-secretion with filopodia formation inhibitors suggesting that sEV secretion can be directly linked to filopodia but further studies are needed to define the contribution of this pathway to the overall sEV secretion by cells.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, the effect of sEVs on parameters of cell migration has almost no magnitude of effect, making mechanism exploration somewhat nebulous.</p></disp-quote><p>VSMC are mesenchymal-type cells with a low migration rate and we agree that the changes in the motility are not of great magnitude even for the positive controls suggesting that this is a complex, multifactorial process for VSMCs. In our experiments we collected data from &gt;5000 individual cells to measure the average speed and found that fibronectin matrix on its own increased VSMC speed from ~0.61 um/min to ~0.68 μm/min (~12% raise) which was statistically significant (Fig 5A). Addition of a sEV inhibitor caused a modest but significant decrease in cellular speed. Interestingly, addition of ECM-associated sEVs did not influence cell speed in 2D or 3D assays. However in a 3D model we observed a 22% change in cell directionality (Fig 5G) and a 235% change in cell alignment index (FMI, Fig 5H) which we believe is very strong evidence that VSMC-derived sEVs are involved in a regulation of VSMC invasion directionality. These data are also in agreement with sEV effects in tumour cells (Sung et al., 2015) though this previous study did not identify the factor driving the directionality and we think our Collagen VI data extends significantly these previous observations.</p><p>Results, page 9: “Hence, ECM-associated sEVs have modest influence on VSMC speed but influence VSMC invasion directionality.”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lastly, the proposed mechanism of VSMCs responding to, and depositing, ECM proteins via sEVs was not rigorously executed; again, making the conclusions challenging for the reader to interpret.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment regarding the mechanistic aspects of VSMCs responding to and depositing ECM proteins via sEVs. In our revised manuscript, we have expanded the data demonstrating that sEVs can be retained within the extracellular matrix (see Figs 3A, 3B, S3A, S3B). Additionally, we show that collagen VI is present on the surface of sEVs, where it may modulate cell adhesion and influence the directionality of cell invasion (Fig 7E). Our results further indicate that both fibronectin (FN) and collagen VI can be recycled through multivesicular bodies (see Figs S3C, S3D, S3E–S3G). However, we acknowledge that the precise mechanisms governing the selective loading of ECM proteins onto sEVs, as well as the specific contributions of sEVs to overall ECM organization, remain to be fully elucidated and warrant further investigation. Based on our current evidence, we propose that collagen VI–loaded sEVs act primarily in a signaling capacity by modulating focal adhesion formation but are not directly involved in ECM structural remodeling.</p><p>Results, page 7: To quantify ECM-trapped sEVs we applied a modified protocol for the sequential extraction of extracellular proteins using salt buffer (0.5M NaCl) to release sEVs which are loosely-attached to ECM via ionic interactions, followed by 4M guanidine HCl buffer (GuHCl) treatment to solubilize strongly-bound sEVs (Fig S3A) [42]. We quantified total sEV and characterised the sEV tetraspanin profile in conditioned media, and the 0.5M NaCl and GuHCl fractions using ExoView. The total particle count showed that EVs are both loosely bound and strongly trapped within the ECM. sEV tetraspanin profiling showed differences between these 3 EV populations. While there was close similarity between the conditioned media and the 0.5M NaCl fraction with high abundance of CD63+/CD81+ sEVs as well as CD63+/CD81+/CD9+ in both fractions (Fig S3A). In contrast, the GuHCl fraction was particularly enriched with CD63+ and CD63+/CD81+ sEVs with very low abundance of CD9+ EVs (Fig S3A). The abundance of CD63+/CD81+ sEVs was confirmed independently by a CD63+ bead capture assay in the media and loosely bound fractions (Fig S3B).</p><p>Results, page 7: We previously found that the serum protein prothrombin binds to the sEV surface both in the media and MVB lumen showing it is recycled in sEVs and catalyses thrombogenesis being on the sEV surface43. So we investigated whether FN can also be associated with sEV surface where it can be directly involved in sEV-cell cross-talk43. We treated serum-deprived primary human aortic VSMCs with FN-Alexa568 and found that it was endocytosed and subsequently delivered to early and late endosomes together with fetuin A, another abundant serum protein that is a recycled sEV cargo and elevated in plaques (Figs S3C and S3D). CD63 visualisation with a different fluorophore (Alexa488) confirmed FN colocalization with CD63+ MVBs (Fig S3E). Next, we stained non-serum deprived VSMC cultured in normal growth media (RPMI supplemented with 20% FBS) with an anti-FN antibody and observed colocalization of CD63 and serum-derived FN. Co-localisation was reducd likely due to competitive bulk protein uptake by non-deprived cells (Fig S3F). Notably, when we compared FN distribution in sparsely growing VSMCs versus confluent cells we found that FN intracellular spots, as well as colocalization with CD63, completely disappeared in the confluent state (Fig S3F and S3G). This correlated with nearly complete loss of CD63+/CD81+ sEV secretion by the confluent cells indicating that confluence abrogates intracellular FN trafficking as well as sEV secretion by VSMCs (Fig S3H). Finally, FN could be co-purified with sEVs from VSMC conditioned media (Fig S3I) and detected on the surface of sEVs by flow cytometry confirming its loading and secretion via sEVs (Fig 3C).</p><p>Results: page 10 Collagen VI was the most abundant protein in VSMC-derived sEVs (Fig 7B, Table S7) and was previously implicated in the interaction with the proteoglycan NG2[53] and suppression of cell spreading on FN[54]. To confirm the presence of collagen VI in ECM-associated sEVs we analysed sEVs extracted from the 3D matrix using 0.5M NaCl treatment and showed that both collagen VI and FN are present (Fig 7D). Next, we analysed the distribution of collagen VI using dot-blot. Alix staining was bright only upon permeabilization of sEV indicating that it is preferentially a luminal protein (Fig 7E). On the contrary, CD63 staining was similar in both conditions showing that it is surface protein (Fig 7E). Interestingly, collagen VI staining revealed that 40% of the protein is located on the outside surface with 60% in the sEV lumen (Fig 7E).</p><p>Discussion page 12. “In fact, we observed that an extensive secretion of sEVs effectively ceased protrusion activity; also VSMCs acquired a rounded morphology when “hovering” over the FN matrix decorated with sEVs (data not shown).

That said, the static images and the dynamic imaging fall short of being fully convincing that the small extracellular vesicles found in the neighboring extracellular matrix are indeed being deposited there via the smooth muscle cell filopodia. Many of the lines of evidence presented suggest that this could occur, but alternative hypotheses also exist that were not fully ruled out, such as the ECM-deposited vesicles were secreted more from the soma and/or the lamellipodia that are also emitted and retracted from the cells. In particular, the authors show very nice dynamic imaging (Supplementary Figure S2A and Supplemental Video S1) that is interpreted as &quot;extracellular vesicles being released from the cell&quot; and these are seen as &quot;bursts&quot; of fluorescent signal; however, none of these appear to occur in filopodia as they appear within the cell proper (a &quot;burst&quot; of signal vs. a more intense &quot;streak&quot; of signal), which would be a stronger and more consistent observation predicted by the working model proposed by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>Our live and fixed cell microscope data as well as inhibitor analysis showed that sEV secretion can be associated with the filopodia.

More data should address this potentially confounding interpretation of the signals presented in images within Figure 4.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful comment that the sEV marker CD81 can originate from endothelial cells in agreement with Rohlena et al., 2009. To address this we investigated the spatial overlap between CD81 and the endothelial marker, CD31.

Importantly, quantification of colocalization confirmed that 80% of CD81 in the neointima does not overlap with CD31 excluding an endothelial origin of these sEVs. (Fig 4G). Moreover, we included complete morphological characterisation of the atherosclerotic plaques confirming that CD81 sEVs were primarily observed in the neointima where VSMCs constitute the cellular majority (Fig S4A, S4B, S4C and S4D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On a conceptual level, the idea that the small extracellular vesicles contain Type VI Collagen, and this element of their cargo is modulating smooth muscle cell migration, is an intriguing aspect of the authors' working model. Nevertheless, the evidence supporting this potential mechanism does not quite fit together as presented. It is not entirely clear how the collagen VI within the vesicles is somehow accessed by the smooth muscle cell filopodia during migration. Are the vesicles lysed open once on the extracellular matrix? If so, what is the proposed mechanism for that to occur? If not, how are the adhesion molecules on the smooth muscle cell surface engaging the collagen VI fibers that are contained within the vesicles? This aspect of the model does not quite fit together with the proposed mechanism and may be an interesting speculative interpretation, warranting further investigation, but it should not be considered a strong conclusion with sufficient convincing data supporting this idea.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their insightful comments regarding the mechanism by which collagen VI associated with sEVs could modulate smooth muscle cell adhesion and migration. To clarify, our new data suggest that collagen VI is predominantly present on the surface of the sEVs, as evidenced by Fig 7E. This surface localization strongly implies that collagen VI can be directly accessed by cell surface adhesion receptors, without the need for vesicle lysis or opening. While we cannot entirely rule out all alternative mechanisms, we consider vesicle rupture or lysis within the extracellular matrix to be a highly unlikely route for collagen VI exposure, given the known stability of sEVs under physiological conditions. We have added these points to clarify:</p><p>(1) Results, page 10, Ln 45 “To confirm the presence of collagen VI in ECM-associated sEVs we analysed sEVs extracted from the 3D matrix using 0.5M NaCl treatment and showed that both collagen VI and FN are present (Fig 7D).

Although we found that collagen VI plays the key role in sEV-induced early formation of FAs in VSMCs, it is tempting to speculate that the high sEV efficacy in stimulating FA formation is driven by cooperative action of this unique adhesion complex on the sEVs surface and targeting this novel sEV-dependent mechanism of VSMC invasion may open-up new therapeutic opportunities to modulate atherosclerotic plaque development or even to prevent undesired VSMC motility in restenosis. .</p><p>(4) Abstract Figure</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On a technical level, some of the statistical analysis is not readily understood from the data presented.

However, in figures such as Figure 5, there are bars shown and indicated to be different by statistical comparison (see panel B in Figure 5). It is not clear how the values for Group 1 (no FN, no 3-OMS, no sEV) are statistically different (denoted by three asterisks but no p value provided in the legend) than Group 3 (no FN, 3-OMS added, no sEV), when their means and standard deviations appear almost identical. If this is an oversight, this needs to be corrected. If this is truly the outcome, further explanation is warranted.

Addition of sEVs to the ECM had no effect on VSMC speed at baseline but did rescue cell speed and distance in the presence of 3-OMS, consistent with EVs acting primarily on invasion directionality rather than speed in both 2D and 3D models (Fig. 5A, 5D).

FN is a promigratory substrate, hence its extensive use as a cell adhesion aid; thus one could assume that simply plating on FN induces a pro-migratory phenotype (later data supports this notion). Does the addition of growth factors also increase sEV release? An endogenous function of FN is siloing of various GFs during clot formation. Also, FAK and SRC networks intersect with canonical RTK signaling in terms of promoting Rac1, CDC42 and other migration mediators. The reason I believe this is important is because the data could be interpreted in two ways: (1) FN induces pro-migration signaling and then sEVs are released, or visa versa, FN induces sEV release and migration is initiated. GF supplementation in the absence of FN would clarify this relationship.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful comment regarding the possible role of growth factors (GFs) and the mechanistic relationship between FN stimulation, sEV secretion, and cell migration.

Interestingly, ECM-associated sEVs appear to play a complementary but distinct role: they do not significantly affect cell migration speed (Fig. 5A) but instead guide cell invasion directionality (Figs. 5G, 5H), reduce the number of FAs per cell (Fig. 6E), and promote early peripheral FA formation (Fig. 6F). In light of these findings, we have updated our graphical abstract to reflect the unique cross-talk mediated by sEVs between VSMCs and the ECM.</p><p>Regarding the influence of growth factors, we acknowledge that FN can bind and present different GFs, which could also contribute to changes in sEV secretion.

To directly address this hypothesis, we performed additional experiments comparing VSMCs cultured at low and high confluency. As described in the revised Results (page 7, line 39), we found that high cellular confluency reduced FN recycling, as indicated by the marked decrease in intracellular FN-positive spots and loss of colocalization with CD63 (Figs S3F, S3G). Importantly, this was accompanied by a significant reduction in CD63+/CD81+ sEV secretion by confluent cells (Fig S3H). These results suggest that VSMC confluence, which suppresses filopodia formation, nearly abolishes both intracellular FN trafficking and sEV secretion, even in the presence of FN. Thus, under our experimental conditions, sEV secretion by VSMCs appears to be closely linked to dynamic cell–matrix interactions and is dramatically reduced when these processes are limited by confluence:</p><p>(1) Results, page 7, Ln 39 : “Notably, when we compared FN distribution in sparsely growing VSMCs versus confluent cells we found that FN intracellular spots, as well as colocalization with CD63, completely disappeared in the confluent state (Fig S3F and S3G).

We agree that CD63 staining alone at the plasma membrane or in the extracellular matrix is not sufficient to unequivocally identify sEVs. To address this, we employed several complementary approaches to rigorously characterize ECM-associated sEVs:</p><p>First, using high-resolution iSIM imaging, we confirmed the association of CD63-positive particles specifically with the FN-rich matrix, and demonstrated that SMPD3 knockdown significantly reduced the number of CD63+ particles in the matrix (Fig. 3B; revised from Fig. S3A).</p><p>Second, by incubating FN matrices with purified and fluorescently labeled sEVs, we directly observed efficient entrapment of these labeled sEVs within the matrices (Fig. 3E), confirming that sEVs can interact with and be retained by the ECM.</p><p>Third, we developed and applied a sequential extraction protocol using mild salt buffer (0.5M NaCl) and strong denaturant (4M guanidine HCl) to selectively extract ECM-associated sEVs based on the strength of their association (see new Figs.

Extracted vesicles were then characterized by ExoView analysis, which demonstrated a tetraspanin profile (CD63+/CD81+/CD9+) closely matching that of sEVs from conditioned media, providing evidence that these particles are true sEVs and not merely membrane debris. We also found that the more weakly bound (NaCl-extracted) fraction closely resembles media-derived sEVs, while the strongly bound (GuHCl-extracted) fraction is more enriched in CD63+ and CD63+/CD81+ sEVs but contains very few CD9+ vesicles, further supporting distinct extracellular vesicle subpopulations within the ECM.</p><p>In addition, the abundance of CD63+/CD81+ sEVs in both media and ECM-derived fractions was independently validated by CD63 bead-capture assay (Fig. S3B).</p><p>We hope these clarifications and the expanded data set address the reviewer’s concerns about sEV identification and quantification in the extracellular matrix:</p><p>(1) Results, page 7, Ln 16. To quantify ECM-trapped sEVs we applied a modified protocol for the sequential extraction of extracellular proteins using salt buffer (0.5M NaCl) to release sEVs which are loosely-attached to ECM via ionic interactions, followed by 4M guanidine HCl buffer (GuHCl) treatment to solubilize strongly-bound sEVs (Fig S3A) 42. We quantified total sEV and characterised the sEV tetraspanin profile in conditioned media, and the 0.5M NaCl and GuHCl fractions using ExoView. The total particle count showed that EVs are both loosely bound and strongly trapped within the ECM. sEV tetraspanin profiling showed differences between these 3 EV populations. While there was close similarity between the conditioned media and the 0.5M NaCl fraction with high abundance of CD63+/CD81+ sEVs as well as CD63+/CD81+/CD9+ in both fractions (Fig S3A). In contrast, the GuHCl fraction was particularly enriched with CD63+ and CD63+/CD81+ sEVs with very low abundance of CD9+ EVs (Fig S3A). The abundance of CD63+/CD81+ sEVs was confirmed independently by a CD63+ bead capture assay in the media and loosely bound fractions (Fig S3B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• A control of fig 3b would be helpful to parse out random uptake of extracellular debris verses targeted sEV internalization.

As a comparison, in our study we analyzed the uptake of both sEVs and serum proteins such as fibronectin and fetuin-A (Figs S3C and S3D), and observed similar patterns of intracellular trafficking. However, we acknowledge that inert nanoparticles or beads of a similar size to sEVs could serve as potential controls to assess nonspecific micropinocytosis or endocytosis.</p><p>It is important to note, however, that the uptake of sEVs is strongly influenced by their surface protein composition and the so-called “protein corona.” Recent work from Prof. Khuloud T. Al-Jamal’s group underscores that exosome uptake mechanisms may be highly specific (Liam-Or et al., 2024), and studies from Mattias Belting’s lab have also shown the importance of heparan sulfate proteoglycans in exosome endocytosis (Cerezo-Magana et al., 2021).

While our revised analysis confirms that sEVs have little to no effect on VSMC migration speed or distance in 2D and 3D models, we did observe a robust effect of sEVs on the directionality of cell invasion (Figs. 5G and 5H). This prompted us to look more closely at pathways involved in cell guidance rather than bulk cell motility.</p><p>Our proteomic comparison between larger EVs (10K fraction) and sEVs (100K fraction) revealed a unique adhesion complex present specifically on the sEVs—comprising collagen VI, TGFBI, LGALS3BP, and EDIL3 (Figs. 7A–C)—each of which has previously been implicated in integrin signaling, cell adhesion, or invasion.

Although we found that collagen VI plays the key role in sEV-induced early formation of FAs in VSMCs, it is tempting to speculate that the high sEV efficacy in stimulating FA formation is driven by cooperative action of this unique adhesion complex on the sEVs surface and targeting this novel sEV-dependent mechanism of VSMC invasion may open-up new therapeutic opportunities to modulate atherosclerotic plaque development or even to prevent undesired VSMC motility in restenosis”. .</p><p>(3) Discussion, page 14, Ln 14 “In summary, cooperative activation of integrin signalling and F-actin cytoskeleton pathways results in the secretion of sEVs which associate with the ECM and play a signalling role by controlling FA formation and cell-ECM crosstalk.

Staining of atherosclerotic plaques with orcein indicated weak connective tissue staining in the atheroma with a confluent extracellular lipid core, and strong specific staining at the tunica media containing elastic fibres which correlated well with the intact elastin fibrils in the tunica media (Figs S4C and S4D). Using this clear morphological demarcation, we found that FN accumulated both in the neointima and the tunica media where it was significantly colocalised with the sEV marker, CD81 (Fig. 4D, 4E and 4F). Notably CD81 and FN colocalization was particularly prominent in cell-free, matrix-rich plaque regions (Figs. 4E and 4F). .”</p><p>We showed that collagen VI is presented on the surface of sEVs:</p><p>(1) Results, page 10, Ln43: “Collagen VI was the most abundant protein in VSMC-derived sEVs (Fig 7B, Table S7) and was previously implicated in the interaction with the proteoglycan NG253 and suppression of cell spreading on FN54. To confirm the presence of collagen VI in ECM-associated sEVs we analysed sEVs extracted from the 3D matrix using 0.5M NaCl treatment and showed that both collagen VI and FN are present (Fig 7D). Next, we analysed the distribution of collagen VI using dot-blot. Alix staining was bright only upon permeabilization of sEV indicating that it is preferentially a luminal protein (Fig 7E). On the contrary, CD63 staining was similar in both conditions showing that it is surface protein (Fig 7E). Interestingly, collagen VI staining revealed that 40% of the protein is located on the outside surface with 60% in the sEV lumen (Fig 7E)</p></body></sub-article></article>
