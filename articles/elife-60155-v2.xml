transducers involved in mediating the action of many natural extracellular stimuli and many therapeutic agents. Non-invasive approaches to manipulate the activity of G-proteins with high precision are crucial to understand their regulation in space and time. Here, we developed LOV2GIVe, an engineered modular protein that allows the activation of heterotrimeric G-proteins with blue light. This optogenetic construct relies on a versatile design that differs from tools previously developed for similar purposes, that is metazoan opsins, which are light-activated G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Instead, LOV2GIVe consists of the fusion of a G-protein activating peptide derived from a non-GPCR regulator of G-proteins to a small plant protein domain, such that light uncages the G-protein activating module. Targeting LOV2GIVe to cell membranes allowed for light-dependent activation of Gi proteins in different experimental systems. In summary, LOV2GIVe expands the armamentarium and versatility of tools available to manipulate heterotrimeric G-protein activity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Optogenetics</kwd><kwd>GTPase</kwd><kwd>GEF</kwd><kwd>GPCR</kwd><kwd>Girdin</kwd><kwd>GIV</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM136132</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Garcia-Marcos</surname><given-names>Mikel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PF-19-084-01-CDD</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maziarz</surname><given-names>Marcin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>LOV2GIVe allows to activate Gi proteins non-invasively with innocuous blue light based on a design principle unrelated to light-activated GPCRs (metazoan opsins), thereby expanding the range of potential experimental applications.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Heterotrimeric G-proteins are critical transducers of signaling triggered by a large family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factors (GEFs) that activate G-proteins by promoting the exchange of GDP for GTP on the Gα-subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gilman, 1987</xref>). This signaling axis regulates a myriad of (patho)physiological processes and also represents the target for &gt;30% of drugs on the market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sriram and Insel, 2018</xref>), which fuels the interest in developing tools to manipulate G-protein activity in cells with high precision.</p><p>Optogenetics, the use of genetically-encoded proteins to control biological processes with light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Warden et al., 2014</xref>), is well-suited for the non-invasive manipulation of signaling. Metazoan opsins are light-activated GPCRs that have been repurposed as optogenetic tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Airan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bailes et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Karunarathne et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Oh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Siuda et al., 2015</xref>), albeit with limitations. For example, opsins tend to desensitize after activation due to receptor internalization and/or exhaustion of their chromophore, retinal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Airan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bailes et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Siuda et al., 2015</xref>). Exogenous supplementation of retinal, which is not always feasible, is required in many experimental settings because this chomophore is not readily synthesized by most mammalian cell types or by many organisms. Also, opsins are relatively large, post-translationally modified transmembrane proteins, which makes them inherently difficult to modify for optimization and/or customization for specific applications.</p><p>Here we leveraged the light-sensitive LOV2 domain of <italic>Avena sativa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harper et al., 2003</xref>) to develop an optogenetic activator of heterotrimeric G-proteins not based on opsins. LOV2 uses ubiquitously abundant FMN as the chromophore and does not desensitize. It is small (~17 KDa) and expresses easily as a soluble globular protein in different systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lungu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Strickland et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zayner et al., 2013</xref>), making it experimentally tractable, easily customizable, and widely applicable. Our results provide the proof-of-principle for a versatile optogenetic activator of heterotrimeric G-proteins that does not rely on GPCR-like proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Design and optimization of a photoswitchable G-protein activator</title><p>We envisioned the design of a genetically-encoded photoswitchable activator of heterotrimeric G-proteins by fusing a short sequence (~25 amino acids) from the protein GIV (a.k.a. Girdin) called the <italic>Gα-Binding-and-Activating</italic> (GBA) motif to the C-terminus of LOV2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, left). GBA motifs are evolutionarily conserved sequences found in various cytoplasmic, non-GPCR proteins that are sufficient to activate heterotrimeric G-protein signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">DiGiacomo et al., 2018</xref>). We reasoned that the GBA motif would be ‘uncaged’ and bind G-proteins when the C-terminal Jα-helix of LOV2 becomes disordered upon illumination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harper et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, right). We named this optogenetic construct LOV2GIV (pronounced ‘<italic>love-to-give’</italic>). To facilitate the biochemical characterization of LOV2GIV, we initially used two well-validated mutants that mimic either the dark (D) or the lit (L) conformation of LOV2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harper et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harper et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zimmerman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, right), with the intent of subsequently validating the G-protein regulatory activity of LOV2GIVe in cells using light.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Design and optimization of LOV2GIV, an optogenetic activator of heterotrimeric G-proteins.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>Left,</italic> diagram depicting the design of the LOV2GIV fusion protein.

In the dark conformation (D, which is mimicked by the LOV2 C450S mutant), the C-terminus of LOV2 forms an α-helix (Jα) and the GBA motif is not readily accessible for G-proteins. In the lit conformation (L, which is mimicked by the LOV2 mutant I539E), the C-terminus of LOV2 is more disordered and the GBA motif becomes accessible for G-proteins, which in turn are activated upon binding to the GBA motif. (<bold>B</bold>) LOV2GIV (L) binds Gαi3 better than LOV2GIV (D).

Based on a structural homology model of LOV2GIV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), we reasoned that it could be due to the relatively high accessibility of Gαi3-binding residues of the GIV GBA motif (L1682, F1685, L1686) within the dark conformation of LOV2GIV. In agreement with this idea, fusion of the GBA motif at positions of the Jα helix more proximal to the core of the LOV2 domain tended to lower G-protein binding, including one variant (‘e’, henceforth referred to as LOV2GIV<underline>e</underline>) in which binding to the dark conformation was almost undetectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Consistent with this, a structure homology model of LOV2GIVe showed that amino acids required for G-protein binding are less accessible than in the LOV2GIV prototype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In contrast, the lit conformation of LOV2GIVe displayed robust Gαi3 binding, thereby confirming an improved dynamic range compared to the LOV2GIV prototype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Mutation of GIV’s F1685 to alanine, a replacement known to preclude G-protein binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Opakua et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Garcia-Marcos et al., 2009</xref>), resulted in greatly diminished binding of Gαi3 to the lit conformation of LOV2GIVe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>LOV2GIVe binds and activates G-proteins efficiently in vitro only in its lit conformation</title><p>Concentration-dependent binding curves revealed that the affinity of Gαi3 for the dark conformation of LOV2GIVe is orders of magnitude weaker than for the lit conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), which had an equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) similar to that previously reported for the GIV-Gαi3 interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">DiGiacomo et al., 2017</xref>). We also found that LOV2GIVe retains the same G-protein specificity as GIV. Much like GIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garcia-Marcos et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marivin et al., 2020</xref>), LOV2GIVe bound robustly only to members of the G<sub>i/o</sub> family among the four families of Gα proteins (G<sub>i/o</sub>, G<sub>s</sub>, G<sub>q/11,</sub>and G<sub>12/13</sub>), and could discriminate within the G<sub>i/o</sub> family by binding to Gαi1, Gαi2 and Gαi3 but not to Gαo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Next, we assessed if LOV2GIVe can activate G-proteins in vitro, that is whether it retains GIV’s GEF activity. First, we measured Gαi3’s steady-state GTPase activity in the presence of LOV2GIVe to assess its GEF activity. Under steady-state conditions, nucleotide exchange is rate limiting because GTP hydrolysis occurs orders of magnitude faster than GTP loading for Gαi proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mukhopadhyay and Ross, 2002</xref>). Thus, steady-state GTP hydrolysis can report changes in the rate of nucleotide exchange on Gαi, which we have previously validated for GIV and other related non-receptor GEFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aznar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coleman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garcia-Marcos et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Garcia-Marcos et al., 2011</xref>). We found that LOV2GIVe in the lit, but not the dark, conformation led to a dose-dependent increase of Gαi3 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), which was comparable to that previously shown for GIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Garcia-Marcos et al., 2009</xref>). Using a GTPγS binding assay that measures nucleotide exchange more directly, we also found that LOV2GIVe in the lit conformation promoted nucleotide exchange on Gαi3, an effect that was impaired upon introduction of the F1685A (FA) mutation that reduces G-protein binding or when using the dark-mimicking mutant (D) of LOV2GIVe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). These findings indicate that LOV2GIVe recapitulates the G-protein activating properties of GIV in vitro, and that these are effectively suppressed for the dark conformation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>LOV2GIVe binds and activates Gαi3 in vitro in its lit conformation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) LOV2GIVe binds with high affinity to Gαi3.

When we expressed LOV2GIVe dark (D), lit (L) or wt in this strain, only very weak levels of β-galactosidase activity were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, right). We reasoned that this could be due to the subcellular localization of the construct, presumed to be cytosolic in the absence of any targeting sequence, because we have previously shown that GIV requires membrane localization to efficiently activate G-proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Parag-Sharma et al., 2016</xref>). Expressing LOV2GIVe (L) fused to a membrane-targeting sequence (<underline>m</underline>LOV2GIVe) led to a very strong induction of β-galactosidase activity, which was not recapitulated by expression of mLOV2GIVe (D) or wt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, right). LOV2GIVe-mediated activation levels (several hundred-fold over basal) are comparable to those previously reported for the endogenous pathway in response to GPCR activation by mating pheromone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hoffman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lambert et al., 2010</xref>). Next, we tested mLOV2GIVe in mammalian cells. Instead of using a downstream signaling readout as we did in yeast, we used a Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET) biosensor that measures G-protein activity directly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, left). Expression of mLOV2GIVe (L), but not (D), led to an increase of BRET proportional to the amount of plasmid transfected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, right). At the highest amount tested, mLOV2GIVe (L) caused a BRET increase comparable to that observed upon maximal stimulation of the M4 muscarinic receptor, a Gi-activating GPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, right, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Introducing a mutation that precludes G-protein activation by GIV’s GBA motif (F1685A (FA), [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Garcia-Marcos et al., 2009</xref>]), in mLOV2GIVe (L) also abolished its ability to induce a BRET increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). As an alternative readout of G-protein regulation by LOV2GIVe, we measured cAMP levels in cells because the enzymes that produce this second messenger, adenylyl cyclases, are classical effectors of GTP-bound Gαi subunits. Acute activation of Gi proteins leads to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity, but prolonged Gi activation leads to the opposite effect— it sensitizes adenylyl cyclases to subsequent activating inputs, such as the stimulation of a Gs-linked GPCR, leading to the potentiation of cAMP production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brust et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Watts and Neve, 2005</xref>). We found that expression of LOV2GIVe (L) leads to a potentiation of the cAMP response induced by the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol, suggesting prolonged activation of Gi proteins in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). The magnitude of the potentiation (~2 fold) is comparable to that reported for many Gi-activating GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Watts and Neve, 2005</xref>). In contrast, expression of similar amounts of LOV2GIVe (L) bearing the F1685A (FA) mutation or of LOV2GIVe (D), which do not bind or activate Gαi, failed to recapitulate the potentiation of the cAMP response elicited by LOV2GIV (L) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>), further supporting the involvement of Gαi activation. Taken together, our results indicate that the lit conformation of LOV2GIVe activates G-protein signaling in different cell types.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>LOV2GIVe activates G-protein signaling in cells in its lit conformation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>Left</italic>, diagram comparing key steps and components of the mating pheromone response pathway of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> to those of an engineered, humanized strain used in the experiments shown in this figure.

For this, we used two complementary experimental systems. The first one consisted of measuring G-protein activity directly with the mammalian cell BRET biosensor described above upon illumination with a pulse of blue light. We found that, in HEK293T cells expressing mLOV2GIVe wt, a single short light pulse resulted in a spike of G-protein activation that decayed at a rate similar to that reported for the transition from lit to dark conformation of LOV2 (T<sub>1/2</sub> ~1 min) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This response was not recapitulated by a mLOV2GIVe construct bearing the GEF-deficient FA mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

Instead of using β-galactosidase assays to report G-protein dependent activation of the <italic>FUS1</italic> promoter by light, we assayed conditional histidine prototrophy controlled by the <italic>FUS1</italic> promoter using spot growth assays because they are better suited to allow homogenous and continued illumination than the cell suspension conditions used of the β-galactosidase assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, left).

This tool is based on a modular design that combines the properties of the light-sensitive LOV2 domain with a motif present in a non-GPCR activator of G-proteins of the Gi family. We propose that the versatility of the LOV2GIVe design could help overcome some limitations of currently available optogenetic tools that are based on GPCR-like proteins. For example, recent evidence suggests that opiod receptors can activate Gi proteins in different subcellular compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stoeber et al., 2018</xref>), but it has not been possible to control GPCR activation in specific subcellular compartments to address the consequences of spatially encoded signals. Given that our results indicate that LOV2GIVe requires targeting to membranes where the substrate G-protein localizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), it would be possible in the future to target it to different membranous organelles to trigger Gi activation in specific subcellular compartments. LOV2GIVe could also be useful for neurobiogical applications because Gi proteins are critical mediator of inhibitory neuromodulation. Combined with the potential for subcellular compartmentalization, LOV2GIVe could be leveraged to assess the different impact of inhibitory modulation at pre- or post-synaptic sites. Our results also support that LOV2GIVe can activate G-protein signaling even in cellular systems where there is not sufficient synthesis of retinal to support opsin-based activation, like in the yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Scott et al., 2019</xref>). This could open the application of optogenetic Gi activation to organisms or experimental settings in which the lack of external supplementation of retinal is detrimental, such those required prolonged and/or repeated stimulation. A general advantage of optogenetic approaches over other synthetic biology approaches to activate G-proteins like chemogenetics with Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Urban and Roth, 2015</xref>) is that they allow for the rapid and accurate temporal control of both activation and deactivation. Thus, LOV2GIVe could be used to investigate Gi signaling processes over a broad temporal scale, also including intermittent or pulsatile activation. A limitation of LOV2GIVe is that it only acts on one subset of heterotrimeric G-proteins, those containing Gαi subunits. Nevertheless, potential applications are still broad, as Gi proteins control processes as diverse as inhibitory neuromodulation, opioid action, or heart rate, among many others.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Reagents and antibodies</title><p>Unless otherwise indicated, all chemical reagents were obtained from Sigma or Fisher Scientific.

The main features of this strain are that the gene encoding only pheromone responsive GPCR (<italic>STE3</italic>) is deleted, the endogenous Gα-subunit Gpa1 is replaced by a chimeric Gpa1(1-41)-human Gαi3 (36-354) and the gene encoding the cell cycle arrest-inducing protein Far1 is deleted. In this strain, the pheromone response pathway can be upregulated by the ectopic expression of activators of human Gαi3 and does not result in the cell cycle arrest that occurs in the native pheromone response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cismowski et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cismowski et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maziarz et al., 2018</xref>).

The <italic>FUS1p::LacZ</italic>-expressing strain was transformed with pLIC-YES2 plasmids (2 µm, URA) encoding each of the LOV2GIV constructs described in ‘<italic>Plasmid Constructs’</italic>. Double transformants were selected in synthetic defined (SD)-TRP-URA media. Individual colonies were inoculated into 3 mL of SDGalactose-TRP-URA and incubated overnight at 30°C to induce the expression of the proteins of interest under the control of the galactose-inducible promoter of pLIC-YES2. This starting culture was used to inoculate 20 mL of SDGalactose-TRP-URA at 0.3 OD600. Exponentially growing cells (~0.7–0.8 OD600, 4–5 hr) were pelleted to prepare samples for ‘<italic>β-galactosidase Activity Assay</italic>’ and ‘<italic>Yeast Spot Growth Assay</italic>’ described below and for preparing samples for immunobloting as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Opakua et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maziarz et al., 2018</xref>).

HEK293T cells (ATCC, CRL-3216) were seeded on 6-well plates (~400,000 cells/well) coated with gelatin and after one day transfected using the calcium phosphate method with plasmids encoding for the following constructs (DNA amounts in parenthesis): Venus(155-239)-Gβ<sub>1</sub> (VC-Gβ<sub>1</sub>) (0.2 μg), Venus(1-155)-Gγ<sub>2</sub> (VN-Gγ<sub>2</sub>) (0.2 μg) and Gαi3 (1 μg) mas-GRK3ct-Nluc (0.2 μg) along with mLOV2GIVe constructs in the amounts indicated in the corresponding figure legends. Approximately 16–24 hr after transfection, cells were washed and gently scraped in room temperature PBS, centrifuged (5 min at 550 g) and resuspended in assay buffer (140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.37 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 0.1% glucose) at a concentration of 1 million cells/mL. 25,000–50,000 cells were added to a white opaque 96-well plate (Opti-Plate, Perkin Elmer) and mixed with the nanoluciferase substrate Nano-Glo (Promega cat# N1120, final dilution 1:200) for 2 min before measuring luminescence signals in a POLARstar OMEGA plate reader (BMG Labtech) at 28°C. Luminescence was measured at 460 ± 40 nm and 535 ± 10 nm, and BRET was calculated as the ratio between the emission intensity at 535 ± 10 nm divided by the emission intensity at 460 ± 40 nm. For the activation of M4R in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, cells were exposed to 100 µM carbachol for 4 min prior to measuring BRET. For measurements shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, BRET data are presented as the difference from cells not expressing LOV2GIVe constructs. For kinetic BRET measurements shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, luminescence signals were measured every 0.24 s for the duration of the experiment. The illumination pulse was achieved by switching from the luminescence read mode to the fluorescence read mode of the plate reader, with the following settings: 485 ± 6 nm filter, 200 flashes (~1.5 s). After the pulse of illumination, measurements were returned to luminescence mode with the same settings as prior to illumination. BRET data were corrected by subtracting the BRET signal baseline (average of 30 s pre-light pulse) and then subjected to a smoothening function (second order, four neighbors) in GraphPad for presentation. At the end of some BRET experiments, a separate aliquot of the same pool of cells used for the luminescence measurements was centrifuged for 1 min at 14,000 g and pellets stored at −20°C. To prepare lysates for IB, pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 5 mM Mg(CH3COO)<sub>2</sub>, 125 mM K(CH3COO), 0.4% Triton X-100, 1 mM DTT, and protease inhibitor mixture).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, including Volker Dötsch as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Garcia-Marcos et al. describe a method to study the activity of heterotrimeric G-proteins. These switches are usually activated via GPCRs and play very important roles in cellular signalling. Investigating their function is often difficult. Therefore, the authors have designed an optogenetic tool that activates Gi proteins by blue light based on an engineered LOV2 domain. They demonstrate that activation is specific and that the dark state has a much lower affinity than the light state. The optimization is quite impressive. Overall, this is an interesting and useful tool but some experimental verifications are required.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 1 shows binding of the G protein to permanently on or off mutant versions of LOV2GIV. Since the G protein is purified, abundant and bound to GST-LOV2GIV, why is it not visible in the Ponceau S stained gel?</p><p>2) This figure needs additional controls. Is the interaction with WT LOV2GIV induced by light as shown in the cartoon? Does the interaction lead to increased GTP binding, as shown in the cartoon? Is the binding blocked by GIV residues known to be important for G protein binding as shown in the cartoon structure? Whether or not these controls have been used in the past, they should be done here as well for this particular fusion.</p><p>3) Figure 2A shows binding association (not dissociation as indicated) for the same constructs as in Figure 1. Figure 2B shows GTP hydrolysis but the function of GIV is to stimulate GTP binding, which is just as easy to measure. Again, this figure needs additional controls to show that it is activated by light and relies on key residues.</p><p>4) Figures 3 and 4 shows G protein activation in yeast and HEK293T cells. GIV leads to increased GTP binding but the cell assays do not measure G-α-GTP signaling but rather measure release of G-β-γ. A direct assay for G-α-GTP should be used. The yeast legend and figure do not match and the yeast assays in Figures 3 and 4 use different readouts when both could be used in parallel. A single concentration of a single agonist as a reference is not sufficient when the authors could easily do a concentration-response experiment with an antagonist as a negative control.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60155.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>Garcia-Marcos et al. describe a method to study the activity of heterotrimeric G-proteins.

Is the interaction with WT LOV2GIV induced by light as shown in the cartoon? Does the interaction lead to increased GTP binding, as shown in the cartoon? Is the binding blocked by GIV residues known to be important for G protein binding as shown in the cartoon structure? Whether or not these controls have been used in the past, they should be done here as well for this particular fusion.</p></disp-quote><p>This point has several parts and we have carried out additional controls to address as many of them as possible:</p><p>– In the new Figure 1—figure supplement 1 we show that mutation of a residue of GIV known to be important for G protein binding (F1685) disrupts binding of Gαi3 to LOV2GIVe in the lit conformation.</p><p>– To assess GTP binding directly, we have now carried out GTPγS binding experiments. We found that LOV2GIVe in the lit conformation enhances GTPγS binding to Gαi3, and that this effect is inhibited by mutation of a residue of GIV known to be important for G protein binding (F1685). These results are shown in the new Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</p><p>The reviewers also pointed to the cartoon in Figure 1 that illustrates a model in which binding of LOV2GIVe to G proteins (and subsequent effects) can be triggered by light and asked for experiments to show directly that light induces LOV2GIVe binding to Gαi3. We would like to start by clarifying that our overall intention was to implement widely used and validated mutants of LOV2 that mimic either the lit or dark conformations to first characterize and optimize the biochemical properties of our construct, and then test it in functional cell-based assays with light. There are technical reasons for this overall approach that arise from our own expertise limitations. While we are comfortable with biochemistry and cell biology, our engineering abilities to create optogenetic hardware are quite limited. For this reason, we conducted experiments with light only for assays that were compatible with the technical resources available to us (repurposing of the fluorescence mode of a plate reader to provide a flash of light, or a homemade flat array of commercial blue LEDs for yeast assays).</p><p>We have not attempted to carry out the requested biochemical experiments with light because this would have required the creation and validation of new optogenetic hardware that we would have not been able to make/achieve in a reasonable amount of time. Under the current pandemic situation, reaching out to external collaborators is also not feasible. In other words, even under normal circumstances this would have taken us beyond the standard few months intended for revisions at <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Although we acknowledge that not all the properties of LOV2GIVe have been tested with light, we believe that, taken collectively, the evidence provided in the manuscript strongly supports the conclusion that light-induced conformational changes in LOV2GIVe trigger G protein regulation. This has now been bolstered by the inclusion of controls with LOV2GIVe mutants that specifically disable G protein binding/regulation (see above and in the response to following review points below).</p><p>We have clarified in the text our overall approach of starting with biochemical characterization using mutants followed by validation in functional assays in cells with light (see subsection “Design and optimization of a photoswitchable G-protein activator”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 2A shows binding association (not dissociation as indicated) for the same constructs as in Figure 1.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that Figure 2A shows association between LOV2GIVe and Gαi3. We believe that what might have led to confusion is the nomenclature “Kd” when we were actually reporting an <italic>equilibrium</italic> dissociation constant, which is frequently denoted as K<sub>D</sub>. Also, we believe that reporting equilibrium dissociation constants instead of equilibrium association constants is more widely used and more intuitive. To address this possible confusion, we have now changed the nomenclature from Kd to K<sub>D</sub> in the text and in the figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2B shows GTP hydrolysis but the function of GIV is to stimulate GTP binding, which is just as easy to measure. Again, this figure needs additional controls to show that it is activated by light and relies on key residues.</p></disp-quote><p>As indicated in the response to point 2 above, we have carried out GTPγS binding experiments that show that LOV2GIVe in the lit conformation enhances GTP binding to Gαi3, and that this effect in inhibited by mutation of a residue of GIV known to be important for G protein binding (F1685) (see new Figure 2—figure supplement 1). For the same reasons explained in point 2, we have not carried out these biochemical experiments with light.</p><p>We would like to indicate that even though the original Figure 2B measured GTP hydrolysis, these measurements were done under steady-state conditions. Under these conditions, GTP hydrolysis reflects the rate of GTP binding because hydrolysis happens much faster (orders of magnitude) than nucleotide exchange (GTP binding) on Gαi. We have previously validated for GIV and other related GEFs that steady-state GTPase and GTPγS assays provide equivalent results. However, our first choice tends to be steady-state GTPase activity because of higher reproducibility (activity is linear for longer times) and because of the increasingly prohibitive cost of radio-labeled GTPγS. We have now modified the text to explain why steady-state GTPase assays with Gαi report the rate of nucleotide exchange (see subsection “LOV2GIVe binds and activates G-proteins efficiently in vitro only in its lit conformation”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figures 3 and 4 shows G protein activation in yeast and HEK293T cells. GIV leads to increased GTP binding but the cell assays do not measure G-α-GTP signaling but rather measure release of G-β-γ. A direct assay for G-α-GTP should be used.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now performed additional experiments to investigate the regulation of adenylyl cyclase, a classic effector of Gαi-GTP. We found that LOV2GIVe in the lit conformation leads to an <italic>increase</italic> of adenylyl cyclase activity as determined by the production of cAMP in response to isoproterenol stimulation (see new Figure 3—figure supplement 3). Although this is the opposite of what one would expect based on the effects of acute Gi activation, it is consistent with the expected effects of chronic Gi activation. It has been known for over 30 years that sustained activation of Gi leads to the phenomenon of adenylyl cyclase sensitization (Sharma et al., PNAS 1975 PMID: 1059094) – i.e., that agonists that activate adenylyl cyclase do so more robustly after chronic Gi activation (reviewed in Watts and Neve, 2005). Because expression of LOV2GIVe after transfection should exert its action for prolonged times, the observed increase in cAMP response is consistent with chronic Gi activation effects. This is further supported by inhibition of this potentiation effect upon introduction of a mutation in LOV2GIVe that prevents its ability to bind and activate Gαi3 (see new Figure 3—figure supplement 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The yeast legend and figure do not match and the yeast assays in Figures 3 and 4 use different readouts when both could be used in parallel.</p></disp-quote><p>Although we agree that the yeast assays in Figures 3 and 4 could theoretically be performed in parallel, there are technical reasons for our choice. The reason is suitability of each assay for the specific experimental setting. Figure 3 uses a β-galactosidase assay and Figure 4 uses a spot growth assay to measure transcriptional activity from the FUS1 promoter. The β-galactosidase assay is well suited to carry out quantitative measurements from cell cultures in suspension, but it is not well suited to achieve constant and uniform blue light illumination of cells. On the other hand, the spot growth assay is ideally suited to achieve constant and uniform illumination of cells growing on a flat surface. We have now modified the text to clarify the choice of yeast assays in the two figures (see subsection “LOV2GIVe activates G-protein signaling in cells upon illumination”).</p><p>We have also fixed the title of the Figure 3 legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A single concentration of a single agonist as a reference is not sufficient when the authors could easily do a concentration-response experiment with an antagonist as a negative control.</p></disp-quote><p>We are now showing an agonist concentration-response experiment, including also an antagonist, as a control for this assay (see new Figure 3—figure supplement 1). This result justifies not only the specificity of the readout based on complete blockade by the antagonist, but also the single concentration of agonist (100 µM) that was used in the comparison with LOV2GIVe in Figure 3B because it corresponds to the maximal response observed in the concentration-response curve.</p></body></sub-article></article>
