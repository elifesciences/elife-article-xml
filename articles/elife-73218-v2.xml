factor receptor (EGFR) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that couples the binding of extracellular ligands, such as EGF and transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α), to the initiation of intracellular signaling pathways. EGFR binds to EGF and TGF-α with similar affinity, but generates different signals from these ligands. To address the mechanistic basis of this phenomenon, we have carried out cryo-EM analyses of human EGFR bound to EGF and TGF-α. We show that the extracellular module adopts an ensemble of dimeric conformations when bound to either EGF or TGF-α. The two extreme states of this ensemble represent distinct ligand-bound quaternary structures in which the membrane-proximal tips of the extracellular module are either juxtaposed or separated. EGF and TGF-α differ in their ability to maintain the conformation with the membrane-proximal tips of the extracellular module separated, and this conformation is stabilized preferentially by an oncogenic EGFR mutation. Close proximity of the transmembrane helices at the junction with the extracellular module has been associated previously with increased EGFR activity. Our results show how EGFR can couple the binding of different ligands to differential modulation of this proximity, thereby suggesting a molecular mechanism for the generation of ligand-sensitive differential outputs in this receptor family.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>receptor tyrosine kinases</kwd><kwd>erbb receptor</kwd><kwd>EGFR signaling</kwd><kwd>transforming growth factor</kwd><kwd>epidermal growth factor</kwd><kwd>biased signaling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002784</institution-id><institution>Canada Excellence Research Chairs, Government of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Subramaniam</surname><given-names>Sriram</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014823</institution-id><institution>VGH and UBC Hospital Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Subramaniam</surname><given-names>Sriram</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2RO1CA09650406</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kuriyan</surname><given-names>John</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cryo-EM analysis of full-length human epidermal growth factor receptor provides a molecular explanation for how ligand-induced differential effect in the ligand-binding extracellular module tunes the transmembrane signaling mediated by epidermal growth factor receptor.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Human EGFR can be activated by seven related ligands that generate different signaling outputs from the receptor. While the classical mechanism for receptor tyrosine kinase activation, ligand-induced dimerization, is essential for all these ligands to activate the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kovacs et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Leahy, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lemmon et al., 2014</xref>), it cannot explain how the extracellular module of EGFR is able to respond differently to different ligands once the receptor is dimerized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ronan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Singh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wilson et al., 2009</xref>). The extracellular module of EGFR consists of four domains, denoted Domains I, II, III, and IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Domains I and III sandwich the ligands between them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Garrett et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ogiso et al., 2002</xref>). Domain II, which bridges the ligand-binding domains, contains the ‘dimerization arm’, a loop that mediates the principal interaction with the other subunit in an activated dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dawson et al., 2005</xref>). Domains I, II, and III form a compact unit that we refer to as the ligand-binding ‘head’, and Domain IV forms a rigid and elongated ‘leg’ that connects the ligand-binding head to the single transmembrane helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A structural collage of a ligand-bound EGFR dimer.</title><p>Left, a schematic diagram of ligand-bound dimeric EGFR.

It appeared that these conformational differences might explain how different EGFR ligands generate different signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wilson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Scheck et al., 2012</xref>), but the significance of these structural differences are unclear because only fragments of the receptor were analyzed. For weakly binding ligands, such as epiregulin and epigen, the lifetime of the dimeric receptor is shortened relative to that for the tighter-binding ligands, such as EGF, and the reduction in dimer lifetime affects signaling output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Freed et al., 2017</xref>). However, EGF and TGF-α are both high-affinity ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jones et al., 1999</xref>), and they also generate different outputs from EGFR. How this happens is still unclear.</p><p>Cell-based studies using fluorescent reporters of EGFR conformation have shown that the binding of EGF and TGF-α results in different conformations of the intracellular juxtamembrane segments of the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Scheck et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Doerner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lowder et al., 2015</xref>). The balance between alternative conformations of the juxtamembrane segments can be modulated by point mutations in the transmembrane helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sinclair et al., 2018</xref>) and oncogenic mutations in the kinase domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lowder et al., 2015</xref>). A more recent study reveals that simply switching the conformation of the juxtamembrane segments by mutation suffices to switch EGFR signaling outputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mozumdar et al., 2021</xref>). These studies demonstrate that the extracellular module, the transmembrane helix, the intracellular juxtamembrane segments, and the intracellular kinase domains are coupled allosterically, and that they respond differently to EGF and TGF-α. How the two ligands generate these differences remains unknown. To gain structural insight into this mechanism, we analyzed full-length human EGFR in complex with EGF and TGF-α by cryo-EM.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Linkages between the extracellular modules and the transmembrane helices are not rigidly defined</title><p>We purified full-length human EGFR expressed in a human HEK293S GnTI<sup>-</sup> cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Reeves et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Qiu et al., 2009</xref>), and reconstituted the complex of EGFR with EGF into four membrane-mimetic environments: detergent micelles, lipid nanodiscs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bayburt and Sligar, 2010</xref>), amphipols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gohon et al., 2006</xref>), and peptidiscs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Angiulli et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carlson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Cryo-EM reconstructions of the full-length EGFR:EGF complex in all four reconstitutions look very similar, and only the extracellular modules are resolved in the cryo-EM densities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The lack of resolvable density for the transmembrane helices and the intracellular kinase domains suggests that the linkage between the extracellular modules and the transmembrane helices is not rigidly defined, consistent with 2D class averages of negative-stain EM images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, mechanisms for ligand-dependent differential responses in EGFR that require strict stereochemical coupling between the extracellular ligand-binding modules and the transmembrane helices appear to be ruled out.

The rotation between the two ligand-binding heads is due to a rigid-body rotation of each head about an axis parallel to the dimerization arms, and is correlated with a slight twist in the dimerization arm of each EGFR subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3—videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video3">3</xref>). The extent of this intersubunit rotation can be estimated by defining a dihedral angle corresponding to rotation about a virtual bond connecting the Cα atoms of Thr 249 in each EGFR subunit (we number amino acid residues in EGFR without including the 24-residue signal sequence). The positions of the Cα atoms of Ile 190 in each subunit are used to further specify the dihedral angle, and the value of this dihedral angle ranges from ~10<sup>o</sup> to ~25<sup>o</sup> in the 10 representative structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><p>The scissor-like rotation between ligand-binding heads in the cryo-EM structures is reminiscent of differences noted previously between crystal structures of fragments of EGFR extracellular modules bound to different ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2012</xref>).

Thus, the partitioning of the cryo-EM data into subclasses reflects an intrinsic conformational variability of the ligand-bound EGFR extracellular module.

This allowed us to determine the position and orientation of the Domain IV legs associated with each representative conformation from the ensemble revealed by cryo-EM.

The hydrophobic sidechain of Ile 619 packs against the sidechain of Ala 623 in the first turn of the transmembrane helix. Ile 619 is followed by a 3<sub>10</sub>-helical turn spanning Pro 620 to Ala 623 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). These structural constraints cause the linker-transmembrane helix junction to orient parallel to the membrane surface in both structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). As a consequence, in the N-terminal dimer of the transmembrane helices, the two linkers are oriented away from each other, with the two Ile 619 residues separated by ~20 Å. In contrast, the C-terminal dimer has the two linkers oriented toward each other, with the distance between the two Ile 619 residues at ~10 Å.

These observations suggest that the junctions between the extracellular module and the transmembrane helices are more separated in the N-terminal dimer of the transmembrane helices than the connection in the C-terminal dimer.</p><p>We used molecular dynamics simulations to explore the constraints on the separation between the two threonine residues at position 614 in the linker, starting either the N-terminal dimer configuration (PDB code: 5LV6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bocharov et al., 2017</xref>) or the C-terminal dimer configuration (PDB code: 2M0B <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bocharov et al., 2016</xref>). Following equilibration (see Materials and methods for full details), we initiated 25 independent molecular dynamics trajectories for both configurations, each 100 ns long, for a total simulation time of 2.5 µs for each configuration. The configuration of the transmembrane helices remains close to the starting configuration over this timescale. The conformation of the junction between the linker and the transmembrane helices is also very stable in both sets of simulations, with the sidechain of Ile 619 remaining associated with Ala 623 over the course of the simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and F</xref>). In the simulations of the N-terminal dimer configuration, the linkers explore a range of configurations but are oriented predominantly such that they point away from one another, and the distance between Thr 614 from each subunit ranges between 20 Å and 35 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). In the simulations starting from the C-terminal dimer configuration, the Thr 614 residues from each subunit are much closer to each other, predominantly sampling distances between 7 Å and 12 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). These results further support the idea that the junction between the linker and the transmembrane helices imposes a constraint on the orientation of the linkers. When the transmembrane helices are in the N-terminal dimer configuration, this linker favors a connection to the tips-separated conformation of the extracellular module, and when the transmembrane helices are in the C-terminal dimer configuration, a connection to the tips-juxtaposed conformation of the extracellular module is indicated.</p><p>We computed the free-energy change of the system when the distance between the Thr 614 residues from each subunit is driven from 27 Å (the peak in the distribution of distances between these residues in simulations of the N-terminal dimer, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) to 8 Å (the corresponding peak in simulations of the C-terminal dimer, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), when the transmembrane helices are in the N-terminal dimer configuration. We used umbrella-sampling simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Torrie and Valleau, 1977</xref>), with sampling windows spaced 1 Å apart (for a total of 20 windows) and starting structures for each window taken from a steered molecular dynamics simulation. Three independent umbrella-sampling calculations were performed, with the starting structures for each taken from different steered molecular dynamics trajectories. These calculations converged (i.e. the potential of mean force does not change) when each window sampled ~60–90 ns of simulation. All three umbrella-sampling simulations yield similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), with the free-energy being lowest when the distance between the Cα atoms of Thr 614 residues from each subunit is ~26 Å. Decreasing this distance to 8 Å leads to the free energy of the system increasing by ~9 kJ.mol<sup>–1</sup> (~3.5 <italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub><italic>T</italic> at room temperature, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). This indicates that in the N-terminal dimer configuration, it is thermodynamically unfavorable for the linkers between the extracellular modules and the transmembrane helices to sample conformations where the distance between the Thr 614 residues is small. Thus, when the transmembrane helices are in the N-terminal dimer configuration, it is likely that the tips-separated conformation of the extracellular module dimer, with the tips of Domain IV at a larger distance, is favored over the tips-juxtaposed conformation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>An oncogenic mutation in the kinase domain stabilizes the tips-separated conformation of the extracellular module</title><p>Dimerization of the transmembrane helices through the N-terminal dimerization motif is associated with increased kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Miloso et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pahuja et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sinclair et al., 2018</xref>), so our structural analysis of the connection between the extracellular module and the transmembrane helices suggests that the tips-separated conformation of the extracellular module is associated with a more active conformation of the kinase domains, through its coupling to the N-terminal dimer of the transmembrane helices.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we examined an oncogenic variant of EGFR seen frequently in cancer patients, in which a leucine residue in the activation loop of the intracellular kinase domain is substituted by arginine (L834R; this is residue 858 when the signal sequence is included). The activation loop is a key allosteric control element at the active site of the kinase domain, and the L834R mutation promotes the formation of the catalytically active asymmetric dimer of the kinase domains, leading to hyper-activation of EGFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Red Brewer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shan et al., 2012</xref>).

The two structures representing the tips-juxtaposed and the tips-separated conformations of the EGFR(L834R):EGF complex were determined at resolution of 3.3 Å and 3.4 Å, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>The overall structures of the tips-juxtaposed and tips-separated conformations of the EGFR(L834R):EGF complex are very similar to those seen for the corresponding complex of the wild-type receptor. The effect of the activating mutation, L834R, becomes apparent when comparing the quality of the cryo-EM densities in the Domain IV legs for the wild-type and mutant EGFR. For the tips-juxtaposed conformations, the cryo-EM densities are of comparable quality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). An important result emerges when comparing the tips-separated conformations for wild-type EGFR and the oncogenic variant. Although the oncogenic L834R mutation involves a residue that is located in the intracellular kinase domain, this mutation markedly stabilizes the flexible leg in the tips-separated conformation of the extracellular module on the other side of the membrane, compared to wild-type EGFR. The cryo-EM density for the flexible leg is much better resolved in the EGFR(L834R):EGF complex than for wild-type EGFR, with secondary structural features clearly visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Thus, activation of the intracellular kinase domains by oncogenic mutation preferentially stabilizes the flexible leg in the tips-separated conformation of the extracellular module, providing direct evidence for conformational coupling between the extracellular and intracellular modules of EGFR.

Compared to the EGFR:EGF complex, the flexible leg in the tips-separated conformation of the EGFR:TGF-α complex is destabilized. The cryo-EM density for the flexible leg is poorly defined, and there is no interpretable density for this leg in the reconstruction of the tips-separated conformation of the EGFR:TGF-α complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). For the tips-juxtaposed conformation, the reconstructions for the EGFR:EGF and EGFR:TGF-α complexes are similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), with near-symmetrical densities for the Domain IV legs in both complexes.

Several key interactions with Domain I of the receptor are different between EGF and TGF-α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). As a result, the ligand-binding pocket is slightly compressed when TGF-α is bound. We used molecular dynamics simulations to investigate this difference. We initiated four trajectories from the crystal structure of the EGFR extracellular module bound to EGF (PDB code: 3NJP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lu et al., 2010</xref>). We also initiated four trajectories starting from this crystal structure (PDB code: 3NJP), but with the EGF replaced by TGF-α, with the structure of the ligand taken from the crystal structure of truncated EGFR bound to TGF-α (PDB code: 1MOX <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Garrett et al., 2002</xref>). Each trajectory was run for between ~350 and ~ 550 ns, for a total simulation time of ~1.8 µs for EGFR bound to EGF and ~2.0 µs for EGFR bound to TGF-α. We measured the angle between the centroids of Domain I, part of Domain II and Domain III (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>) over the course of the simulations. In EGFR bound to EGF, this angle is slightly larger, with the mode occurring at ~80°. In the simulations of EGFR bound to TGF-α, this angle is slightly smaller, with the mode occurring at ~75°, indicating that the ligand-binding pocket is slightly compressed when EGFR is bound to TGF-α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). This compression between Domains I and III causes Domain II to bend in the TGF-α complex relative to its structure in the EGF complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>), leading to a small difference in the orientation of the dimerization arm with respect to Domains III and IV. EGF and TGF-α both maintain the same interface between the dimerization arms of the two EGFR subunits in the dimer, but the additional bending of Domain II in the TGF-α complex requires the two Domain IV legs to rotate toward each other. In the tips-separated conformation of the TGF-α complex, this inward motion would cause a steric clash between the two legs if the legs maintained the conformation seen in the EGF complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>).

We speculate that the observed differences in the ability of EGF and TGF-α to stabilize the Domain IV leg in the tips-separated conformation underlies the ability of these two ligands to trigger different levels of kinase activity and downstream signaling from EGFR. Specifically, our structural model suggests that the EGF-bound EGFR complex is likely to be more active than the TGF-α bound EGFR.</p><p>Although previous studies have demonstrated that these two ligands can induce different long-term cellular responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wilson et al., 2009</xref>), it is unclear how this is manifested at the level of receptor autophosphorylation and the activation of proximal signaling events. To test the effect of these two ligands on the kinase activity of EGFR, we first purified detergent-solubilized full-length human EGFR from mammalian cells (HEK293FT), followed by stimulation of EGFR activity through addition of EGF and TGF-α, and detection of phosphorylation on EGFR by western blot analysis. Indeed, the results show that EGF induces stronger EGFR autophosphorylation than TGF-α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Next, we transiently transfected mammalian cells with full-length human EGFR and stimulated the cells with saturating amounts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Macdonald-Obermann and Pike, 2014</xref>) of EGF and TGF-α (100 ng/ml), respectively. EGFR phosphorylation levels in the stimulated cells were analyzed by western blot. Consistent with the results obtained with the purified EGFR protein, the EGFR phosphorylation level is higher in the EGF-stimulated cells than that in the TGF-α-stimulated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Importantly, ligand-dependent differences can also be detected in the downstream signaling events following receptor activation, by monitoring the phosphorylation level of the extracellular signal–regulated kinase (Erk). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1C</xref>, EGF stimulates higher levels of Erk phosphorylation than TGF-α does in cells transiently transfected with EGFR, at EGF and TGF-α concentrations of 100 ng/ml, 200 ng/ml, and 500 ng/ml.</p><p>According to our structural model, for these two ligands to differentially activate EGFR, the structural difference originating from the ligand-binding head needs to be transmitted to the tips of the extracellular module, and thereby to the transmembrane helices. We hypothesize that disrupting the conformational coupling between the ligand-binding head and the Domain IV leg, or the coupling between the Domain IV leg and the transmembrane helices, will interfere with the differential effects of EGF and TGF-α. To disrupt the connection between the ligand-binding head and the Domain IV leg, we mutated a conserved residue (Trp 492) buried in a hydrophobic pocket between Domain III and Domain IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). Mutating this tryptophan to glycine (W492G) is expected to loosen the connection between Domain III and Domain IV, and the Erk phosphorylation assay shows that this mutation results in levels of Erk phosphorylation that are the same for activation by EGF and TGF-α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><p>Since our structural model suggests that the conformation of the linker at the junction between the extracellular module and the transmembrane helices is important for the coupling between the two domains, replacing the linker (Asn 615-Pro 620) with a flexible sequence, Gly-Gly-Ser-Gly-Gly-Ser (GGSGGS), should compromise this coupling. This mutation (replacement of the linker by GGSGGS) breaks the differential Erk activation by EGF and TGF-α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1E</xref>). In another construct, we inserted a flexible segment, with sequence Gly-Gly-Ser-Gly-Gly-Ser-Gly-Gly-Ser (GGSGGSGGS), into the linker connecting the extracellular module to the transmembrane helix, between Pro 617 and Lys 618. The insertion of this flexible segment results in a similar extent of Erk activation by EGF and TGF-α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1E</xref>), which is consistent with the importance of this linker in coupling the conformations of the extracellular module and the transmembrane helix.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our cryo-EM analysis provides a molecular explanation for the ability of EGFR to respond differently to two high-affinity ligands, EGF and TGF-α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). The differential activation of EGFR by these two ligands arises from structural differences in the receptor-ligand interactions. As a result, EGF and TGF-α differ in their abilities to stabilize the tips-separated conformation of the extracellular module that couples to the N-terminal dimer configuration of the transmembrane helices, which is further coupled to a specific configuration of the juxtamembrane segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arkhipov et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Endres et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jura et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sinclair et al., 2018</xref>), ultimately promoting the formation of kinase dimers with higher activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>). In this way, EGF and TGF-α can generate different responses from EGFR by differentially modulating the structure of the junction point between the extracellular module and the transmembrane helices, altering the balance between alternative dimeric configurations of the transmembrane helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). A lack of rigidity in the linkage between the extracellular module and the transmembrane helices is emerging as a common feature in receptor tyrosine kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Diwanji et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Uchikawa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>), and the mechanism we have defined, involving modulation of the separation of the tips of the extracellular modules, could potentially be utilized by other receptor tyrosine kinases to generate ligand-specific signaling outputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmed et al., 2020</xref>).</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>A mechanism for differential activation of EGFR by EGF and TGF-α.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representations of the ligand-bound extracellular module of EGFR illustrate the differential modulation of the conformation of the Domain IV legs by TGF-α (left), EGF(middle) and oncogenic L834R mutation (right).

The nominal dose per frame was ~1 e<sup>-</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup> and the total dose per movie is ~50 e<sup>-</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup>. For the full-length EGFR:EGF complex reconstituted in peptidiscs, a total of 4331 movies were collected.

After local CTF determination using Patch-Based CTF Estimation, a total of 4,234,635 particles from 4,431 micrographs were automatically selected using template-free Blob_picker and were extracted with a box size of 320 × 320 pixels. Due to strongly preferred particle orientations, a relatively low threshold value was used during the particle picking to include particles with less contrast than the preferred views. The majority of the initial 4,234,635 picks are from the background. After iterative 2D classification, most of the background particles were removed based on 2D class averages. The remaining 1,587,872 particles were further cleaned-up by ab-initio reconstruction into four classes. The resulting 3D maps showed that 3 of the ab-initio reconstruction classes were mostly ‘junk’ particles without recognizable structural features, and the other class showed clear resemblance to the dimeric extracellular module of EGFR. This clean class of particles (814,089) were selected and subjected to a final round of 2D classification. After visual inspection of the final 2D class averages, 765,883 particles were retained and ab-initio reconstruction was performed to generate the initial model, which was used as the reference for a round of homogeneous refinement as well as a non-uniform refinement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Punjani et al., 2019</xref>). Based on the gold-standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC) 0.143 criterion, the overall resolution of the reconstructions from homogeneous refinement and non-uniform refinement are determined as 3.0 Å and 2.9 Å, respectively. After visual inspection of both reconstructions, the map generated from non-uniform refinement with better quality was chosen for further analysis and used as the reference in the subsequent round of heterogeneous refinement (3D classification) using the 765,883 particles, resulting in 10 classes. A final round of homogeneous refinement and non-uniform refinement were performed for each of the resulting 10 classes from the heterogeneous refinement run.

In the full-length structure, these residues are a part of the ordered region in Domain IV of the extracellular module and would not be available to form such interactions.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Stevan R Hubbard (Reviewer #1); Xiao-chen Bai (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Cryo-EM 3D classification was widely used to analyze the dynamics of protein complexes. It could be efficient in probing new intermediate states. But it is not strictly a quantitative method unless certain &quot;unbiased&quot; procedures are applied throughout the complete workflow of image processing. For example, the authors only showed classification results of one dataset (Figure 2). The particles appeared to be evenly distributed in the ten classes, which was a sign that the classification was not efficient and the resulting reconstructions are still mixtures of multiple states. To support the main conclusion of the manuscript, the authors should show the classification results of all datasets: (1) To our knowledge, cryoSparc is less efficient in separating particles into different conformations compared to Relion. The authors could try Relion and multiple rounds of 3D classification could be implemented. (2) Mask-based classification should be applied. (3) The authors could provide an analysis on the changes of particle distribution among different datasets.</p><p>2. Although the mutations introduced into EGFR (W492G, etc.) that mitigate the phosphorylation differences between EGF and TGF-αt are strong evidence for the authors' hypothesis, it is important to show (through a ligand-concentration series) that saturating amounts of TGF-α cannot achieve the same EGFR phosphorylation level as saturating amounts of EGF. The authors used a single concentration of EGF or TGF-α (16 µM in vitro, 16 nM in-cell) in the results shown in Figure 9 and Figure 9-supplement 1. Any differences in affinity and/or ligand solubility/delivery, etc. between EGF and TGF-α could explain the difference in phosphorylation levels in the experiments with wild-type EGFR.</p><p>3. For the cell-based phosphorylation results shown in Figure 9C and E, the authors have already performed at least three biological replicates. It would be useful for the readers if the authors could include densitometry analysis and appropriate statistics on the biological replicates to show the effect of mutations and different types of ligand binding on EGFR activity in a more quantitative way.</p><p>4. What is rationale to use 16.7 nM as the ligand concentration in the cell-based assay? Has this been commonly used in EGFR activity assay in previous work? Have the authors tried other ligand concentration?</p><p>5. Related to previous two points, have the authors tested the effect of L834R mutation on the activity of EGFR using similar cell-based phosphorylation experiment? This is just to confirm that L834R is indeed a gain-of-function mutation. It also would be interesting to check whether EGFR-L834R also has different activities when responding to EGF or TGF-α.</p><p>6. The authors need to prepare similar figures as Figure3A to show the cryo-EM image processing workflows for EGFR/TGF-α and EGFR-L834R/EGF datasets.</p><p>7. The authors claimed that conformations between ECD, TM and ICD are coupled within ligand-bound EGFR. But the TM and kinase domains are not resolved at all in any of the classes.

Huang et. al reported a series of cryo-EM structures of full-length EGFR/EGF complexes in different conformations. The major difference among these structures is the distance between the membrane proximal domains IV of EGFR. Although the TM and kinase domains of EGFR were not resolved in the cryo-EM maps, through comprehensive structural analysis and MD simulations, the authors proposed that, the EGFR/EGF complex with separated domains IV would induce N-terminal associated dimeric TM domain and high activity; whereas the EGFR/EGF complex with juxtaposed domains IV would promote C-terminal associated dimeric TM domain and low activity. Such claim is strongly supported by two structure evidences: (1) In the cryo-EM structure of EGFR L834R mutant/EGF complex (a mutant that is supposed to have higher activity than EGFR WT), the separated domains IV is captured in a more stable state. (2) In the cryo-EM structure of EGFR with a weaker ligand TGF-a bound, the separated domains IV is in a more flexible conformation. In addition, the authors also introduced some mutations to EGFR, designed to break the structural coupling between domain IV and TM domain. These EGFR mutants can't response to EGF and TGF-a differently, which further supports the major conclusion of this work that the conformation of ECD determines the conformation of TM as well as the downstream signaling. Overall, the experiments were well designed, and the structural and functional works are of great quality.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73218.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

In this regard, it is important to note that the classification procedure resulted in the identification of alternative conformations of the ligand-binding head that correspond closely to structures that had been identified previously in crystal structures of different states of the receptor. Specifically, as noted on page 6 of the manuscript (starting line 123), the “tips-juxtaposed” conformation is almost precisely the same as that seen in a crystal structure of the isolated EGFR extracellular module bound to EGF (PDB code: 3NJP). Likewise, the “tips-separated” conformation corresponds to the structure of a truncated form of the extracellular module of EGFR (ligand-binding head only) bound to TGF-α (PDB code: 1MOX). While we agree with the point made by the reviewer, the important point is that this correspondence to previously determined crystal structures makes the key conclusions of our cryo-EM analysis robust, although a quantitative determination of conformational populations cannot be obtained reliably.</p><p>We have now added the classification results for the other two datasets as well, L834R:EGF (Figure 3—figure supplement 3A) and EGFR:TGF-α (Figure 3—figure supplement 3B).</p><p>In response to reviewer’s comments (1) and (2), despite intense efforts, including multiple rounds of mask-based 3D classifications and partial signal subtraction, we were unable to achieve better classification results for our datasets using Relion.</p><p>Regarding comment (3), the difference in the particle distributions among different conformational states are quite small, when the EGFR:EGF, EGFR:TGF-α, and L834R:EGF complexes are compared. Specifically, the ratio between the particle numbers of the juxtaposed and of the separated conformations is ~1.18 (105,728: 89,757), ~1.24 (126,471: 102,206), and ~1.23 (123,670: 100,615), in the EGFR:EGF, EGFR:TGF-α, and L834R:EGF complexes, respectively. We interpret this to mean that the principal effect of changing the ligand, or introducing an activating mutation, is in the altered dynamics of the Domain IV leg in the tips-separated conformation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Although the mutations introduced into EGFR (W492G, etc.) that mitigate the phosphorylation differences between EGF and TGF-α are strong evidence for the authors' hypothesis, it is important to show (through a ligand-concentration series) that saturating amounts of TGF-α cannot achieve the same EGFR phosphorylation level as saturating amounts of EGF. The authors used a single concentration of EGF or TGF-α (16 µM in vitro, 16 nM in-cell) in the results shown in Figure 9 and Figure 9-supplement 1. Any differences in affinity and/or ligand solubility/delivery, etc. between EGF and TGF-α could explain the difference in phosphorylation levels in the experiments with wild-type EGFR.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very important point raised by reviewer, and it is critical to demonstrate that the phosphorylation differences between EGF and TGF-α complexes are achieved by saturating amounts of both EGF and TGF-α.</p><p>The affinities of EGFR for EGF and TGF-α were reported to be ~0.6 nM and ~3 nM (Macdonald-Obermann and Pike, 2014), respectively. In cell-based assays, we used saturating concentrations of EGF and TGF-α (100 ng/ml or 16.7 nM), which have been commonly used in EGFR activity assays in previous work (Macdonald-Obermann and Pike, 2014; Sinclair et al., 2018). For in vitro assay using purified full-length EGFR protein, EGF and TGF-α were added in 16 times (16 μM) excess of EGFR (1 μM).</p><p>To further demonstrate that TGF-α cannot achieve the same EGFR activation level as EGF, even at concentrations that are higher than the saturating concentration (100 ng/ml), we conducted a new set of cell-based experiments to measure the phosphorylation levels of Erk in cells that are transiently transfected with wild-type EGFR. As shown in Figure 9—figure supplement 1C, EGF stimulates higher levels of Erk phosphorylation than TGF-α does, regardless of the ligand concentrations used.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. For the cell-based phosphorylation results shown in Figure 9C and E, the authors have already performed at least three biological replicates. It would be useful for the readers if the authors could include densitometry analysis and appropriate statistics on the biological replicates to show the effect of mutations and different types of ligand binding on EGFR activity in a more quantitative way.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion.

Related to previous two points, have the authors tested the effect of L834R mutation on the activity of EGFR using similar cell-based phosphorylation experiment? This is just to confirm that L834R is indeed a gain-of-function mutation.

The authors claimed that conformations between ECD, TM and ICD are coupled within ligand-bound EGFR. But the TM and kinase domains are not resolved at all in any of the classes. Could the authors provide a brief explanation for this issue?</p></disp-quote><p>Based on our current structural model, the coupling between the extracellular module and the transmembrane helices does not require a rigid connection between the two domains. Instead, it is the extent of the proximity of the tips of the extracellular domains in a dimer, at the point where they connect to the transmembrane helices, that is the central structural feature responsible for coupling between the conformations of the extracellular module and the transmembrane helices. We were unable to resolve the transmembrane and the intracellular module of the receptor, even within the subclasses of the separated or juxtaposed conformations, presumably due to major segmental flexibility observed between the extracellular module and the transmembrane helices. This flexible connection between the extracellular module and the transmembrane helices is likely caused by the flexible linker connecting the extracellular module to the transmembrane helices. And we do not expect this flexible linker to become rigid in any of the subclasses. But we do expect the conformational heterogeneity within the transmembrane helices and the intracellular module to get reduced when they are linked to the tips-separated conformation of the extracellular module.</p><p>It is worth noting that recent studies on other full-length receptor tyrosine kinases all failed to resolve the transmembrane domains or intracellular modules, likely due to similar flexibility (Li et al., 2019; Uchikawa et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020; Diwanji et al., 2021).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The manuscript by Huang et al. reports the cryo-EM structures of EGF and TGFalpha bound to full-length EGFR.
