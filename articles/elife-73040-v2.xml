myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) and JMML-like myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) associated with Noonan syndrome (NS). Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) are the disease propagating cells of JMML. Here, we explored transcriptomes of HSPCs with SHP2 mutations derived from JMML patients and a novel NS zebrafish model. In addition to major NS traits, CRISPR/Cas9 knock-in Shp2<italic><sup>D61G</sup></italic> mutant zebrafish recapitulated a JMML-like MPN phenotype, including myeloid lineage hyperproliferation, ex vivo growth of myeloid colonies, and in vivo transplantability of HSPCs. Single-cell mRNA sequencing of HSPCs from Shp2<italic><sup>D61G</sup></italic> zebrafish embryos and bulk sequencing of HSPCs from JMML patients revealed an overlapping inflammatory gene expression pattern. Strikingly, an anti-inflammatory agent rescued JMML-like MPN in Shp2<italic><sup>D61G</sup></italic> zebrafish embryos. Our results indicate that a common inflammatory response was triggered in the HSPCs from sporadic JMML patients and syndromic NS zebrafish, which potentiated MPN and may represent a future target for JMML therapies.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia is a childhood blood cancer. It is more common in children with a genetic condition called Noonan Syndrome, which causes problems with development in many parts of the body. The most frequent cause is a mutation in a protein called Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase-2, or SHP2 for short.</p><p>Juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia starts in the stem cells that normally become blood cells. In children with Noonan Syndrome, these cells show signs of problems before leukaemia begins. Recreating Noonan Syndrome in an animal could shed light on how this childhood cancer develops, but doing this is not straightforward. One option is to use zebrafish, a species of fish in which the embryos are transparent, allowing scientists to watch their blood cells developing under a microscope. They also share many genes with humans, including SHP2.</p><p>Solman et al. genetically modified zebrafish so they would carry one of the most common mutations seen in children with Noonan Syndrome in the SHP2 protein. The fish had many of the typical features of the condition, including problems producing blood cells. Single cell analysis of the stem cells that become these blood cells showed that, in the mutated fish, these cells had abnormally high levels of activity in genes involved in inflammation. Treating the fish with an anti-inflammatory drug, dexamethasone, reversed the problem. When Solman et al. investigated stem cells from human patients with juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia, they found the same high levels of activity in inflammatory genes.</p><p>The current treatment for juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia is a stem cell transplant, which is only successful in around half of cases. Finding a way to prevent the cancer from developing altogether could save lives. This new line of zebrafish allows researchers to study Noonan Syndrome in more detail, and to test new treatments. A next step could be to find out whether anti-inflammatory drugs have the same effects in mammals as they do in fish.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>RASopathies</kwd><kwd>Noonan syndrome</kwd><kwd>hematopoiesis</kwd><kwd>SHP2</kwd><kwd>leukemia</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERARE NSEURONET</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cave</surname><given-names>Helene</given-names></name><name><surname>den Hertog</surname><given-names>Jeroen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EJPRD NSEURONET</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cave</surname><given-names>Helene</given-names></name><name><surname>den Hertog</surname><given-names>Jeroen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004622</institution-id><institution>KWF Kankerbestrijding</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>12829</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>den Hertog</surname><given-names>Jeroen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA211734</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Langenau</surname><given-names>David M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R24OD016761</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Langenau</surname><given-names>David M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>MGH Research Scholar Award</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Langenau</surname><given-names>David M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Alex Lemonade Stand Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yan</surname><given-names>Chuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The transcriptomes of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells of human juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia patients and a zebrafish model for Noonan syndrome reveal a common inflammatory response, which may have a causal role in associated myeloproliferative neoplasm.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A broad spectrum of heterozygous germline activating mutations in the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 encoded by <italic>PTPN11</italic> has been found to cause Noonan syndrome (NS), a dominantly inherited developmental disorder from the RASopathy group affecting 1:1500 individuals. NS is characterized by a systemic impact on development, most commonly resulting in short stature, congenital heart defects, and specific craniofacial characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rauen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tajan et al., 2018</xref>). Somatic activating mutations in <italic>PTPN11</italic> are the most common cause of sporadic juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), a rare but aggressive myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) occurring in young children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caye et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tartaglia et al., 2003</xref>). Consistently, children with NS are predisposed to developing neonatal MPN, that either regresses without treatment or rapidly progresses to JMML leading to early death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kratz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Strullu et al., 2014</xref>). Previous studies support the view of a strong endogenous role of germline <italic>PTPN11</italic> mutations in the occurrence of myeloproliferative complications with the existence of high-risk mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mulero-Navarro et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Strullu et al., 2014</xref>). Given the aggressive nature of JMML and lack of therapies, a better understanding of the elusive JMML(-like MPN) pathophysiology and development of reliable preclinical models are essential.</p><p>Several lines of evidence indicate the importance of prenatal hematopoiesis such as the young age window for both NS-associated and sporadic JMML. The prenatal origin of <italic>PTPN11</italic> mutations in sporadic JMML suggests that JMML and NS-associated JMML-like MPN originate from fetal hematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Behnert et al., 2022</xref>). Studying SHP2-driven JMML(-like MPN) during fetal hematopoiesis is challenging in conditional knock-in mouse models of JMML with <italic>PTPN11</italic> mutations, because mutant SHP2 expression is induced only postnatally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xu et al., 2011</xref>) or indolent MPN is induced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tarnawsky et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tarnawsky et al., 2018</xref>). NS knock-in mice with activating <italic>PTPN11</italic> mutations develop mild MPN only after 5 months of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Araki et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Araki et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) with rapid ex utero development, transparent embryos, and conserved blood ontogeny emerged as a unique pediatric leukemia model that enables monitoring of leukemogenesis from its initial stages with high temporal and spatial resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Pater and Trompouki, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gore et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, NS-associated features, such as shorter body axis length, craniofacial defects, defective gastrulation, and impaired heart looping, are recapitulated in zebrafish embryos upon transient overexpression of NS-associated protein variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonetti et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jopling et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Niihori et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Paardekooper Overman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Runtuwene et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>To better assess the link between dysregulated SHP2 and myeloproliferation in the context of NS, we developed and characterized a novel genetic zebrafish model of NS with Shp2-D61G mutation, a dominantly inherited NS-associated mutation that is most frequently associated with NS/JMML-like MPN in human patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Strullu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tartaglia et al., 2001</xref>). Mutant zebrafish developed hematopoietic defects consistent with JMML-like MPN. Transcriptomic comparison of HSPCs obtained from JMML patients with somatic <italic>PTPN11</italic> mutations and HSPCs from mutant zebrafish harboring an NS-associated variant of Shp2 suggested common mechanisms of disease initiation in sporadic and syndromic <italic>PTPN11</italic>-driven JMML. Both datasets show a similar proinflammatory gene expression and an anti-inflammatory agent largely rescued the hematopoietic defects in mutant zebrafish, suggesting inflammation as potential drug target for sporadic and syndromic JMML(-like MPN). Our data show that Shp2 mutant zebrafish convincingly model the human NS-associated MPN thereby providing a valuable preclinical model for development of future therapies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Shp2<italic><sup>D61G</sup></italic> mutant zebrafish display typical NS traits</title><p>To investigate early hematopoietic defects associated with NS in a vertebrate animal model, we turned to zebrafish, which represents a versatile model to study leukemogenesis and in which it is feasible to introduce mutations at will using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homology directed repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tessadori et al., 2018</xref>). NS is a dominant autosomal disorder and 50% of NS patients carry heterozygous mutations in the protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 (<italic>PTPN11</italic>). The zebrafish genome contains two <italic>ptpn11</italic> genes (<italic>ptpn11a</italic> and <italic>ptpn11b</italic>), encoding Shp2a and Shp2b. Shp2a is indispensable during zebrafish development, whereas loss of Shp2b function does not affect development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonetti et al., 2014</xref>). Certain NS mutations are more frequently associated with NS/JMML-like MPN than others. The D61G substitution in SHP2 is the most frequently occurring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Strullu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tartaglia et al., 2001</xref>). The homology between human SHP2 and zebrafish Shp2a is 91% and the amino acid D61 is located in an absolutely conserved region of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Thus, we introduced the D61G mutation in zebrafish Shp2a using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homology directed repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), targeting the <italic>ptpn11a</italic> gene. Sequencing confirmed that the oligonucleotide used for the homology directed repair was incorporated correctly into the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and that the introduced mutation did not have a detectable effect on Shp2a protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Prior to phenotypic analyses, the mutant lines were outcrossed twice to ensure that potential background mutations due to the CRISPR/Cas9 approach were removed.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Shp2<italic><sup>D61G</sup></italic> zebrafish display Noonan syndrome (NS)-like traits.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sequencing trace derived from Shp2<italic><sup>D61G/D61G</sup></italic> zebrafish.

Based on the extent of the phenotypes, defects were categorized as normal, mild, and severe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). The observed phenotypic defects were mostly mild, but in some cases severe defects were found, including severely stunted growth, edemas of the heart and jaw, and absence of the swim bladder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). A more detailed characterization of the typical NS traits showed that the body axis length was significantly reduced in Shp2<italic><sup>D61G</sup></italic> mutant embryos at 5 dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Furthermore, imaging of Alcian blue-stained cartilage revealed NS-reminiscent craniofacial defects in 4 dpf Shp2<italic><sup>D61G</sup></italic> mutant embryos, characterized by broadening of the head (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), leading to an increased ratio of the width of the ceratohyal and the distance to Meckel’s cartilage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). We also assessed the general morphology and function of the mutant embryonic hearts. Whole-mount in situ hybridization (WISH) with cardiomyocyte (<italic>myl7</italic>), ventricular (<italic>vhmc</italic>), and atrial (<italic>ahmc</italic>) markers identified no obvious morphological heart defects, such as changes in heart size or heart looping, as well as heart chamber specification at 3 dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). A decrease in heart rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>), ejection fraction, and cardiac output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>,E) was detected from the ventricular kymographs obtained from high-speed video recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tessadori et al., 2012</xref>) of the Shp2<italic><sup>D61G</sup></italic> mutant hearts at 5 dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).

The rest of both Shp2<italic><sup>D61G/wt</sup></italic> and Shp2<italic><sup>D61G/D61G</sup></italic> mutant zebrafish grew up normally, their life span was not affected, and they displayed rather mild defects in adult stages, such as shorter body axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>), with markedly reduced length observed from the embryonic stage of 5 dpf until the fully developed adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>).

We were not able to observe any effect of the Shp2<italic><sup>D61G</sup></italic> mutation on primitive hematopoiesis in embryos at 2 dpf using WISH for markers of erythroid progenitors (<italic>gata-1</italic>), myeloid progenitors (<italic>pu.1</italic>), and white blood cells (<italic>l-plastin</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). On the other hand, a significant effect of the Shp2-D61G mutation on definitive hematopoiesis was observed at 5 dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). First, the number of HSPCs was determined using the Tg(<italic>cd41:GFP</italic>, <italic>kdrl:mCherry-CAAX</italic>) transgenic line. CD41-GFP-positive cells mark HSPCs when the GFP signal is low (CD41-GFP<sup>low</sup>) and thrombocytes when the GFP signal is high (CD41-GFP<sup>high</sup>). An increased number of CD41-GFP<sup>low</sup> HSPCs was observed in the caudal hematopoietic tissue (CHT) region, corresponding to the fetal liver in human and the head kidney (corresponding to the bone marrow in human) of the mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). Shp2<italic><sup>D61G</sup></italic> mutation seems to affect both proliferation and apoptosis of HSPCs, evident by an increase in CD41-GFP<sup>low</sup> cells positive for phosphohistone H3 (pHis3), a marker for late G2 and M phase and a decrease in Acridine orange-positive cells in the CHT region, marking apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>,C). We observed an increase of <italic>c-myb</italic>-positive cells, marking HSPCs and of <italic>l-plastin</italic>-positive cells, marking all white blood cells, in both CHT and head kidney region of the Shp2<italic><sup>D61G</sup></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–F</xref>). These latter cells appear not to be lymphocytes, since the size of the <italic>ikaros-</italic>positive thymus was not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>,E). On the other hand, the myeloid lineage was markedly expanded, evident from the increase in the number of mpx-GFP-positive neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and H</xref>) and mpeg-mCherry-positive macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G1</xref>), in Tg(<italic>mpx:GFP, mpeg:mCherry</italic>) double transgenic mutant embryos. Shp2<italic><sup>D61G</sup></italic> mutant embryos also displayed a mild decrease in the number of CD41-GFP<sup>high</sup>-positive thrombocytes and the number of <italic>β-globin</italic>-positive erythrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F-H</xref>). The observed defects in all different blood lineages examined here were stronger in the homozygous Shp2<italic><sup>D61G/D61G</sup></italic> than heterozygous Shp2<italic><sup>D61G/wt</sup></italic> embryos, supporting a dosage effect. One of the clinical hallmarks of JMML is the hypersensitivity of myeloid progenitors to GM-CSF. GM-CSF is not present in zebrafish, but stimulation of HSPCs in ex vivo colony-forming assays in semi-solid media with granulocyte colony stimulating factor a (Gcsfa) or Gcsfb gives rise to colony-forming unit granulocyte (CFU-G) and colony-forming unit macrophage (CFU-M) type of colonies, similarly to GM-CSF stimulation in human, suggesting a compensatory role of Gcsfa/b for the missing GM-CSF in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oltova et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stachura et al., 2013</xref>). Compared to their wild type (wt) siblings, colonies developed from the CD41-GFP<sup>low</sup> cells isolated from the Shp2<italic><sup>D61G/wt</sup></italic> zebrafish embryos at 5 dpf and exposed to Gcsfa were larger in size and number, demonstrating an enhanced CFU-G and CFU-M colony-forming ability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J and K</xref>). Finally, we tested whether the observed myeloid expansion was reconstituted upon transplantation of the WKM cells harvested from Shp2<italic><sup>D61G/wt</sup></italic> animals in the Tg(<italic>mpx:GFP, mpeg:mCherry</italic>) background into the optically clear recipient <italic>prkdc-/-</italic> immunodeficient zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Moore et al., 2016</xref>). Animals injected with 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> mutant WKM cells (3/5) accumulated GFP- and mCherry-positive cells near the site of injection starting at 14 days and increasing until 28 days.

Proinflammatory gene expression was evident both in HSPCs from JMML patients and in mutant zebrafish. It should be noted that the type of data is different, bulk sequencing of the human samples and single-cell sequencing of the zebrafish material. In addition, the source of the material is distinct, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-sorted CD41-GFP<sup>low</sup> HSPCs from zebrafish embryos and immunophenotypically FACS-sorted postnatal HSCs and progenitors from human. Moreover, genotypically, the samples differed in that the zebrafish carried a single Shp2 mutation (D61G) and the human JMMLs carried distinct activating SHP2 mutations even with additional mutations. Therefore, it is not surprising that the ranking of overexpressed inflammatory genes in HSPCs from mutant zebrafish and human JMML patients was not identical. Nevertheless, the similarity of the proinflammatory signatures revealed by GSEA between these diverging samples is striking.</p><p>Already early studies reported high levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, TNF-α, GM-CSF, in JMML patients plasma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bagby et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Freedman et al., 1992</xref>). However, little is known about the cellular origin of the proinflammatory status, its pathophysiological role, and therapeutic potential. The inflammatory response may be initiated in a cell autonomous way or in response to signals from the microenvironment. Dong et al. suggested that IL-1β is secreted by differentiated monocytes which get recruited upon secretion of the chemokine, CCL3, by cells of the bone marrow microenvironment containing activating SHP2 mutations. However, the levels of CCL3 in the bone marrow of four NS patients varied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dong et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, a microenvironment-driven inflammatory response would not explain high levels of cytokines in sporadic JMML, where niche cells are not mutated. On the other hand, recent reports indicate that JMML leukemia stem cells are heterogeneous but confined to the HSPCs compartment, defining JMML HSPCs as the origin of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caye et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Louka et al., 2021</xref>). The pseudotime analysis of inflammatory genes in zebrafish HSPCs indicated that the initiation of the proinflammatory program happens during early differentiation of HSPCs toward the monocyte/macrophage progenitor lineage in Shp2<italic><sup>D61G</sup></italic> embryos. The limited number of human patients included in our analysis allowed us to establish that the HSPCs compartment from JMML patients showed an inflammatory response, but not which lineage. Transcriptomic analysis of individual progenitor lineages from additional patients will be required to conclude which cell type displayed an inflammatory response. Our data suggest that proinflammatory reprogramming of the monocyte/macrophage lineage might be endogenously driven at least in part, and detailed mechanisms remain to be elucidated in the future.</p><p>To our knowledge, the Shp2<italic><sup>D61G</sup></italic> mutant zebrafish we developed is the first NS zebrafish model carrying an activating Shp2 mutation at its endogenous locus generated by CRISPR/Cas9-based knock-in technology. Strikingly, phenotypes developed by the Shp2<italic><sup>D61G</sup></italic> zebrafish corroborate closely with the phenotypes displayed by human NS patients and the existing NS mouse models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Our model presents an exciting novel tool for deciphering pathogenesis mechanisms of NS with its complex traits and for finding novel therapies for this as yet poorly treatable condition.</p><p>NS children with D61G mutation have a higher predisposition to develop JMML(-like MPN), and comparably Shp2<italic><sup>D61G</sup></italic> zebrafish embryos displayed typical JMML-like MPN characteristics, such as expansion of the myeloid lineage, increased sensitivity to Gcsfa, mild anemia, and thrombocytopenia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Furthermore, the observed blood defect was transplantable to secondary recipients and the disease originated in HSPCs, which displayed aberrant proliferation and apoptosis. Given the importance of fetal hematopoiesis during JMML(-like MPN) development, the zebrafish Shp2<italic><sup>D61G</sup></italic> mutant represents a reliable and unique model for JMML-like MPN, which allows us to study hematopoietic defects caused by mutant Shp2 during the prenatal development for the first time. Our results suggest that the JMML-like MPN defect is initiated at the CHT, which is the counterpart of fetal liver in human. Here, we observed expanded HSPCs, which displayed aberrant proliferation and apoptosis. We further characterized the transcriptomes of HSPCs specifically originating from the CHT, and studied their response to inhibitor treatments directly at the CHT. Striking similarities between the patient and zebrafish HSPCs transcriptomes indicate that the Shp2<italic><sup>D61G</sup></italic> zebrafish model is an exciting preclinical model for in vivo drug screens at relevant developmental time points, in a high throughput manner.</p><p>The only effective treatment of JMML is allogeneic stem cell transplantation, which has a high relapse rate of 50%. Hence, there is a great need for other means of therapeutic intervention.

Here, we demonstrate that dampening inflammation using the glucocorticoid dexamethasone partially rescued the observed blood phenotype in Shp2<italic><sup>D61G</sup></italic>, suggesting that the inflammatory response evoked in the cells of myeloid/macrophage lineage was an important driver of the NS/JMML-like blood defect and might be a potential drug target for both sporadic and syndromic JMML(-like MPN). To our surprise, targeting inflammation reversed the blood defect to a similar extent as the MAPK and PI3K pathway inhibitors, emphasizing not only the crucial role of inflammation during JMML pathogenesis, but also its strong therapeutic potential. Since anti-inflammatory therapies are non-invasive and widely available, targeting inflammation might represent a novel avenue for JMML treatment, either alone or in combination with other therapies.</p><p>In conclusion, we observed striking similarities in expression patterns of HSPCs from sporadic human JMML patients with an activating SHP2 mutation and HSPCs from an engineered zebrafish model with an activating NS-associated mutation in Shp2. Particularly genes associated with the inflammatory response were upregulated and strikingly, pharmacological inhibition of the inflammatory response ameliorated JMML-like MPN in the zebrafish model, suggesting this may be a first step for therapeutic intervention in human patients.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Zebrafish husbandry</title><p>All procedures involving experimental animals were approved by the animal experiments committee of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW), Dierexperimenten commissie protocol HI18-0702, and performed under the local guidelines in compliance with national and European law.

TL wt zebrafish embryos at the one-cell stage were injected directly in the cell with 1 nl of the injection mixture containing 18.75 ng/ml of sgRNA, 37.5 ng/ml of template oligonucleotide, and 3.6 mg/ml of Cas9 protein in 300 mM KCl. Cas9 protein was a gift from the Niels Geijsen laboratory at the Hubrecht Institute. The injected embryos were grown into the adulthood. F0 generation zebrafish were outcrossed with the wt zebrafish. DNA extracted from the 12 distinct 1 dpf old F1 generation embryos was screened for the correct insertion of the template oligonucleotide. Screening was done by Sanger sequencing (Macrogen Europe B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands) of the 225 bp long PCR product encompassing the genomic regions of the CRISPR target sites, which was generated using the forward 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">TCATCTCCTCACTAGGCGAAAT</named-content>-3’ and reverse primer 5’- <named-content content-type="sequence">TATGTATGTGCTCACCTCTCGG</named-content>-3’. The efficiency of the knock-in was 1.8% (1 founder zebrafish in 54 screened primary injected zebrafish). F1 generation was then established from the F0 founder. F1 generation adults were finclipped and sequenced for the presence of the mutation. All experiments were performed in zebrafish embryos and adults from the F3 and F4 generation. For all of the experiments except single-cell RNA sequencing and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR), embryos were siblings derived from an incross of Shp2<italic><sup>D61G/wt</sup></italic> animals.

protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 in zebrafish, creating a model consistent with the human Noonan syndrome (NS), which is predisposed to juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) and myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN)-like syndrome. The study nicely provides a new model that can be used as the basis for future studies in the field. Because the mutant variably displays phenotypes along a spectrum from NS to MPN, different researchers can choose to focus on this as they see fit.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73040.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>White</surname><given-names>Richard M</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02yrq0923</institution-id><institution>Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2020.09.10.289090">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.10.289090v2">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Embryonic CD41-GFP<sup>low</sup> positive HSPCs were isolated from zebrafish embryos and postnatal FACS-sorted HSPCs from human patients. The human material was sorted based on the immunophenotypic signatures and included HSCs and progenitors. We have included a remark about the identity of the human cells that were used in the Results section (p. 16, line 305). In zebrafish, such an approach to isolate distinct compartments of HSPCs is not available, because of the lack of appropriate antibodies. Nevertheless, CD41-GFP<sup>low</sup> cells have been reported to represent the HSPCs population in zebrafish and these cells were analyzed by single-cell RNA sequencing, which confirmed their identity as HSC-like cells, early myeloid progenitors, monocyte/macrophage progenitors and thrombocyte/ erythroid progenitors. Hence, the fish and human material both included HSCs and progenitors and we have indicated this in the text of the revised manuscript. The finding that fish and human HSPCs both show an inflammatory response is striking. We advanced the single cell RNA sequencing analysis and established that the proinflammatory response is evoked during early differentiation of monocyte/macrophage progenitors in Shp2D61G zebrafish HSPCs (see new Figure 4C-E and Figure 4—figure supplement 1 of the revised manuscript).</p><p>In response to the specific comment of reviewer 1 regarding leukemogenesis in the title, we have changed the title into: “Inflammatory response in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells triggered by activating SHP2 mutations evokes blood defects”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A better way to address the effect of the anti-inflammatory drugs you have chosen in terms of staining for marker genes by in situ or via transgenic reporters of the various cells affected.

All parameters indicated that dexamethasone rescued the effects of the Shp2-D61G mutation, by directly affecting the observed myeloid lineage expansion and decreasing proinflammatory gene expression.

There is not much difference between heterozygous and homozygous D61G fish in terms of phenotype penetrance or gene expression. Please explain.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, phenotypes are similar between heterozygous and homozygous fish. Phenotypes appear to be more pronounced in homozygous embryos than in heterozygous embryos, which may reflect that Shp2-D61G is a gain-of-function mutation that – like in human patients – acts in a dominant manner.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

It is noteworthy that the D61 amino acid is located in an absolutely conserved region of the protein. The N-terminal 119 amino acids of SHP2 and Shp2a are identical. We have included a statement about sequence conservation in the text (p. 5, line 114-116) and we have included a sequence alignment in the Supplementary Material (Figure 1—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Loss of functional Shp2a is embryonic lethal, whereas Shp2b is dispensable and Shp2b-/- fish are viable and fertile. This is why we targeted Shp2a for the D61G gain-of-function mutation. We have included a statement to this effect in the text (p. 5, line 108-111). It is noteworthy that Shp2b is also dispensable in heterozygous and homozygous Shp2a-D61G background, in that the Shp2a-D61G phenotypes were indistinguishable between Shp2b+/+ and Shp2b-/- backgrounds. We have not included this in the manuscript, because it is beyond the scope of the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Figure 1J.

Whereas genotyping by finclipping as early as 3 dpf is feasible (Figure 1K), it might have severe adverse effects on the expression data. To avoid large differences in genetic backgrounds, the adult fish that were used for these crosses were siblings from the same family. We used a pool of 50 embryos for each sample in the flow experiments.
