However, the mechanisms of angiogenesis and the origin of the tumor vasculature remain poorly understood. While conventional theory suggests that GBM tumor vasculature derives from existing vessels or from bone marrow progenitor cells, recent studies have indicated that this is not the case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Purhonen et al., 2008</xref>). Indeed, the tumor endothelium may actually be derived from the tumor itself. GBM is maintained via a population of self-renewing, tumorigenic cancer stem cells (CSCs), which have been implicated in tumor invasion and metastasis for a large variety of cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Vescovi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fan et al., 2013</xref>). The progeny of these CSCs are not confined to a neural lineage but rather can differentiate into functional endothelium. Based on the work of Ricci-Vitiani et al., it appears that part of the vasculature in GBM originates from tumor cells, bypassing the normal mechanisms of angiogenesis. These findings offer insights into tumor self-renewal, and offer new options for cancer treatment by targeting the differentiation of tumor cells into endothelial progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ricci-Vitiani et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Kaur and Bajwa, 2014</xref>).</p><p>In order to demonstrate the CSC lineage of GBM tumor vasculature, Ricci-Vitiani et al. first traced the genetic lineage of the tumor endothelium. They analyzed the vasculature in 15 human glioblastoma patient samples and found that a large subset of endothelial cells harbored the same mutations and chromosomal aberrations as the tumors themselves. They also showed that in culture, glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs) could be differentiated to express multiple endothelial markers, and showed substantial tube-forming ability, whereas fully differentiated glioblastoma cell lines could not. Ricci-Vitiani et al. also traced the lineage of tumor vasculature in vivo, confirming the presence of human endothelial cells expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) in a mouse xenograft of human GSCs expressing GFP. These experiments, and others, demonstrated that tumor xenografts obtained by injection of human glioblastoma neurospheres developed an intrinsic vascular network composed of tumor-derived endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ricci-Vitiani et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The authors next sought to investigate whether the GSC-derived endothelial cells contributed to tumor growth. This key finding is the focus of this replication study. The authors transduced glioblastoma neurospheres with a lentiviral vector containing the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene (<italic>tk</italic>) under the control of the transcription regulatory elements of the endothelial marker <italic>Tie2</italic>. In this way, the tumor-derived endothelial cells could be selectively killed by exposure to ganciclovir. As negative controls, the authors used neurospheres transduced with an empty viral vector, as well as the differentiated glioblastoma cell line U87MG. As a positive control, they used neurospheres and U87MG cells transduced with a vector conferring constitutive expression of <italic>t</italic><italic>k</italic> (PGK-<italic>tk</italic>). Upon administration of ganciclovir, selective targeting of endothelial cells generated by GSCs in mouse xenografts resulted in tumor reduction and degeneration, indicating the functional relevance of the GSC-derived endothelial vessels.</p><p>Prior to subcutaneous injection of transduced glioblastoma neurospheres, Ricci-Vitiani et al. first confirmed the lack of endogenous <italic>Tie2</italic> expression in both the GSCs and the U87MG cells. This quality control step will be replicated in Protocol 1, the results of which will be compared to Figure S11C. Next, the viral transduction of GSCs and U87MG cells with expression constructs for Tie2-<italic>tk</italic> and PGK-<italic>tk</italic>, as well as empty viral vector, will be replicated in Protocol 2. The generation and analysis of xenografts using various cell lines in immunocompromised mice will be replicated in Protocol 3. This protocol will generate data that can be compared to original data presented in Figures 4B, S10B, S10C, and S10D.</p><p>Recently, multiple other studies have explored the phenomenon of tumor-derived vasculature in GBM. Two recent reports found results very similar to those of Ricci-Vitiani et al., showing that oncogene-induced glioblastoma tumors gave rise to tumor-derived endothelial cells, as indicated by GFP expression. These studies also found that endothelial cells within tumors harbored the same genetic signature as the tumor itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Wang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Soda et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, Chiao et al. reported that GCSs formed vasculogenic mimicry in tumor xenografts and expressed pro-vascular molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chiao et al., 2011</xref>). However, other groups have found that endothelial cells comprising GBM vasculature do not share the same genetic make-up as neoplastic tissues, and that GSCs routinely do not give rise to endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Rodriguez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Cheng et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, Cheng et al. present an alternative hypothesis to that of Ricci-Vitiani et al. by showing that GSCs can give rise to vascular pericytes—which also express Tie2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">De Palma et al., 2005</xref>)—rather than endothelial cells. Targeting these GSC-derived pericytes disrupted vessel function and inhibited tumor size similarly as the results presented by Ricci-Vitiani et al. for targeting endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Cheng et al., 2013</xref>). El Hallani et al. demonstrated that GSCs were capable of vasculogenesis in vitro, and that a fraction of GSCs could transdifferentiate into vascular smooth muscle-like cells. However, their later work suggested that rather than transdifferentiating, the GSCs were fusing with endothelial cells to create a hybrid tumor vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">El Hallani et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">El Hallani et al., 2014</xref>). Conversely, using a GSC mouse xenograft, Lathia et al. did not observe the integration of tumor-derived cells into the vascular wall; however, this observation was only reported in the text. No data were shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Lathia et al., 2011</xref>). Ghanekar et al. tried analogous experiments using hepatocellular carcinoma CSCs and did not find any evidence that the tumor cells gave rise to the endothelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ghanekar et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Unless otherwise noted, all protocol information was derived from the original paper, references from the original paper, or information obtained directly from the authors.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Protocol 1: Evaluation of <italic>Tie2</italic> expression in various cell lines using qPCR</title><p>This protocol evaluates the expression of the endothelial marker <italic>Tie2</italic> in three cell lines using semi-quantitative PCR: patient-derived glioblastoma neurospheres (GSC83), human glioblastoma cell line U87MG, and normal human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC-d).

We will measure tumor growth rates across all mouse cohorts over the length of the study, both before and after GCV treatment. These data were not analyzed in the original study, so we consider them exploratory data. We will plot tumor growth curves for each animal and calculate the area under the curve (AUC) before and after GCV treatment. We will perform an ANCOVA on the different treatment groups to evaluate the AUC after GCV treatment, with the baseline (AUC before GCV treatment) included as the covariate. Further, we will perform Bonferroni corrected <italic>t</italic>-tests for pairwise comparisons between controls and <italic>tk</italic>-expressing tumors.</p></list-item></list></list-item></list></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="s2-3-6"><title>Known differences from the original study</title><p>The methods section in the original paper stated that mice were dual-injected with both control and Tie2-<italic>tk</italic> expressing neurospheres into the right and left flanks, respectively, and bilateral tumors were allowed to form. However, subsequent dialogue with the authors clarified that mice actually only received a single injection, as dual injections often led to problematic differences in tumor growth rates. Therefore, we will be using a single-injection model, where mice will be either injected with <italic>tk</italic> vectors or controls, but not both simultaneously. We will only be comparing GSC83-derived cell lines and U87MG-derived cell lines, excluding the other GSC lines used in the original study. Along with measuring differences in tumor diameter, we will also be measuring tumor volume throughout the course of the study. In the original study, it was not specified how many tumors were harvested and histologically analyzed. We have elected to harvest a random subset of tumors that represent all treatment groups. All known differences in reagents and supplies are listed in the ‘Materials and reagents’ section above, with the originally used item listed in the ‘Comments’ section. All differences have the same capabilities as the original and are not expected to alter the experimental design.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3-7"><title>Provisions for quality control</title><p>The genetic integrity, mycoplasma-free and rodent pathogen-free purity, and efficient viral transduction of each cell line used in this experiment have been previously validated in Protocols 1 and 2.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Sean Morrison (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, four reviewers, and a biostatistician. Two of the reviewers, Yoshiaki Kubota and Ruggero De Maria, have agreed to share their identity.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As part of The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology, Chroscinski et al. propose to replicate key experiments from “Tumour vascularization via endothelial differentiation of glioblastoma stem-like cells” by Ricci-Vitiani and colleagues, published in Nature in 2010. The original Nature manuscript demonstrated that endothelial cells bearing the same genomic alteration as cancer cells may show a different sensitivity to conventional anti-angiogenic treatments and suggests the possibility of targeting the process of GSC differentiation into endothelial cells as a new therapeutic option in cancer treatment.</p><p>The authors accurately summarize the Nature paper and the proposed experiment using GSCs transduced with a Tie2-tk construct sufficiently replicates the key finding in that Nature paper.</p><p>The following questions should be addressed in a resubmission:</p><p>1) A directly conflicting paper by Cheng et al. (Cell, 2013) discussed that the discrepancy is attributed to possible activation of Tie2 promoter in pericytes, which may eliminate pericytes as well. Do the authors have any discussion on this issue?</p><p>2) Within protocol 1, the authors plan to use HMVEC instead of HUVEC as previously outlined in the original study. Endothelial cells of different lineage vary greatly in their gene expression profile in particular between HUVEC and HMVEC. As HUVECs are commercially available, the authors should provide a clearer explanation in their change of reagents.</p><p>3) To maximize the quality of the replication, we would suggest that the authors establish more precise criteria for neurosphere passage. Protocol 1.1.a.ii states that “GSC83 cells should be subcultured when neurosphere size prevents the needed provision of nutrients”. This criteria is subjective, and viability, differentiation potential, infection efficiency etc of glioma stem cells can all be influenced by the abundance or lack of nutrients. Always plating a fixed cell number and subculturing after a fixed period of time could be one way to avoid variability in culture methods.</p><p>Statistical comments:</p><p>Overall, I have no major concerns over the statistics.</p><p>1) For protocols 1 and 3, the aim is to replicate the detection of the very large effects seen in the original report. The original report used very small numbers so both the reported effect size and the SD will have very poor precision. With a sample size of 2-4 per group it is impossible to judge whether the data points have been sampled from a normal distribution so the p-value strongly relies on the assumption of normality (which is not so important for large sample sizes). However, the researchers presumably have extensive prior experience of using such techniques in similar situations and hence expect to see very large effects with no overlap of the distributions of values observed in each group. So I judge that the very small sample sizes, provided no data are missing, will be sufficient to answer these questions.</p><p>2) It seems reasonable to use the Bonferroni adjusted significance levels as the same sample is used for several comparisons.</p><p>3) When it comes to presenting the results and comparing with the original report, a Forest plot is appropriate but this should not include an overall summary statistic (combining the original and replicate).</p><p>4) The method used to compare the growth rates seems rather convoluted. Why not put the repeated measurements into a full linear model with the baseline included as a co-variate?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04363.003</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) A directly conflicting paper by Cheng et al.

Do the authors have any discussion on this issue</italic>?</p><p>As reviewed in the Introduction, many conflicting reports exist within the field of tumor-derived vasculature in GBM. We believe the data presented in Cheng et al. provide a very interesting alternative hypothesis that may help to explain the results achieved by Ricci-Vitiani and colleagues. We have expanded our discussion of this paper in the Introduction, to better outline the results of Cheng et al. We will be sure to highlight these data again in the Replication Study as a possible alternative mechanism to understand the results of the replication.</p><p><italic>2) Within protocol 1, the authors plan to use HMVEC instead of HUVEC as previously outlined in the original study. Endothelial cells of different lineage vary greatly in their gene expression profile in particular between HUVEC and HMVEC. As HUVECs are commercially available the authors should provide a clearer explanation in their change of reagents</italic>.</p><p>As demonstrated in Supplementary Figure 11C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ricci-Vitiani et al., 2010</xref>), Ricci-Vitiani and colleagues measured Tie2 expression in both HUVEC and HMVEC cell lines. Both cell lines served as a positive control, demonstrating high levels of Tie2 expression. According to our correspondence with Ricci-Vitiani and colleagues, they included HMVEC cells as an additional control at the behest of their own reviewers for the original Nature manuscript. These reviewers felt that including an adult endothelial cell line constituted a more accurate control for adult-derived glioblastoma neurospheres than did the fetal-derived HUVEC cells. Thus, we have opted to also include this more-relevant control cell line. We are obtaining the same adult HMVEC cell line as used by the original authors to enable a direct comparison of gene expression.</p><p><italic>3) To maximize the quality of the replication, we would suggest that the authors establish more precise criteria for neurosphere passage. Protocol 1.1.a.ii states that “GSC83 cells should be subcultured when neurosphere size prevents the needed provision of nutrients”. This criteria is subjective, and viability, differentiation potential, infection efficiency etc of glioma stem cells can all be influenced by the abundance or lack of nutrients. Always plating a fixed cell number and subculturing after a fixed period of time could be one way to avoid variability in culture methods</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for these suggestions. Upon further correspondence with Ricci-Vitiani and colleagues, we have updated the Registered Report to include more details pertaining to the culture of GSC#83, including defined cell plating numbers and subculturing schedule. We will be obtaining the same culture that was initially derived by the authors, and using the same conditions they use for this culture.</p><p><italic>Statistical comments</italic>:</p><p><italic>[…]</italic></p><p><italic>3) When it comes to presenting the results and comparing with the original report, a forest plot is appropriate but this should not include an overall summary statistic (combining the original and replicate)</italic>.</p><p>We disagree with the reviewer and as described in Valentine et al., 2011 and Bumming, 2012, combining multiple studies using a meta-analytic approach is a statistical option that can be employed to describe all of the available evidence about a given effect size. Specifically we will utilize a random effects meta-analysis because this approach assumes that the effects vary due to known and unknown characteristics of the studies.</p><p><italic>4 ) The method used to compare the growth rates seems rather convoluted. Why not put the repeated measurements into a full linear model with the baseline included as a co-variate</italic>?</p><p>We thank the reviewer for this helpful suggestion. We have changed the method used to compare the growth rates of the different cohorts. We will perform an ANCOVA to analyze the differences in the tumor growth curves after GCV treatment using the tumor growth curves before GCV treatment (baseline) as the covariate. We will also use the area under the curve to quantify and compare the tumor growth curves.</p></body></sub-article></article>
