gondii</italic> is an important human pathogen infecting an estimated one in three people worldwide. The cytokine interferon gamma (IFNγ) is induced during infection and is critical for restricting <italic>T. gondii</italic> growth in human cells. Growth restriction is presumed to be due to the induction of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) that are upregulated to protect the host from infection. Although there are hundreds of ISGs induced by IFNγ, their individual roles in restricting parasite growth in human cells remain somewhat elusive. To address this deficiency, we screened a library of 414 IFNγ induced ISGs to identify factors that impact <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection in human cells. In addition to IRF1, which likely acts through the induction of numerous downstream genes, we identified RARRES3 as a single factor that restricts <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection by inducing premature egress of the parasite in multiple human cell lines. Overall, while we successfully identified a novel IFNγ induced factor restricting <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection, the limited number of ISGs capable of restricting <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection when individually expressed suggests that IFNγ-mediated immunity to <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection is a complex, multifactorial process.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>intracellular parasite</kwd><kwd>egress</kwd><kwd>cell death</kwd><kwd>interferon gamma</kwd><kwd>growth restriction</kwd><kwd>Toxoplasma</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI154048</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sibley</surname><given-names>L David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI118426</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sibley</surname><given-names>L David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI083359</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alto</surname><given-names>Neal M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I-1704</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alto</surname><given-names>Neal M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI158124</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schoggins</surname><given-names>John W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Overexpression of interferon-stimulated genes revealed a role for RARRES3 in restricting growth of <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> by inducing early egress from human cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> infection is common in humans, and while typically self-limiting in immunocompetent individuals, it can be severe in congenital toxoplasmosis and in immunodeficient individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Furtado et al., 2011</xref>). Additionally, <italic>T. gondii</italic> is a leading cause of infectious retinochoroiditis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Weiss and Dubey, 2009</xref>). Eye disease is most prominent in Latin America and Africa with approximately one-third of uveitis cases being attributed to ocular toxoplasmosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Furtado et al., 2013</xref>). Although mechanisms of immune control are well studied in the mouse, they are less well understood in humans with currently known mechanisms of restriction observed in a cell type-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fisch et al., 2019b</xref>).</p><p>In response to pathogen infection, host cells express and secrete interferons (IFNs), which signal in an autocrine or paracrine manner through IFN receptors to induce factors designed to block infection. Interferons fall into three categories: type I (including IFNα and IFNβ), type II (IFNγ), and type III (IFNλ1–4). In general, receptors for type I and type II IFN are ubiquitously expressed whereas type III IFN sensitivity is restricted to epithelial barriers. Conventionally, IFN signaling involves the induction of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) involved in host defense via JAK-STAT-mediated signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alspach et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lazear et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schoggins, 2019</xref>). Although IFN upregulates the expression of many genes, induction of ISGs is only semi-conserved between cell types, with many ISGs being cell type dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schoggins, 2019</xref>). Variability in ISG expression is perhaps due to the induction of noncanonical IFN signaling pathways that have been observed in a cell type-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Van Boxel-Dezaire and Stark, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">van Boxel-Dezaire et al., 2006</xref>). To identify and study the functions of this diverse set of genes, a wide variety of approaches have been utilized including ectopic overexpression, siRNA-mediated knockdown, and more recently CRISPR-Cas9 screening approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schoggins, 2019</xref>). For the purpose of our study, several previous overexpression screens have been informative: an ectopic expression-based screen of type II IFN induced genes developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrams et al., 2020</xref>, and the prior screen developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schoggins et al., 2011</xref>, which focused on type I IFN induced genes. These screens utilized a lentiviral-based expression cassette to express a curated library of commonly expressed ISGs in a one gene per well format. Abrams et al., successfully used this approach to identify novel type II IFN induced genes that impact <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> infection while the screen developed by Schoggins et al., has been used to identify many ISGs impacting a broad range of pathogens, including both bacteria and viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrams et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schoggins et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schoggins et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Perelman et al., 2016</xref>). A similar ectopic expression-based screen utilized a large cDNA library to search for enhancers of STAT1-mediated transcription in <italic>T. gondii</italic> infected cells and successfully identified the orphan nuclear receptor TLX as an enhancer of STAT1-mediated transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beiting et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Interferon gamma (IFNγ) has been known since the 1980s to be expressed during <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection and to be critical for restricting infection in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Suzuki et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McCabe et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shirahata and Shimizu, 1980</xref>). IFNγ-mediated restriction has been attributed to the expression of a group of ISGs, including immunity-related GTPases (IRGs) and guanylate binding proteins (GBPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gazzinelli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">MacMicking, 2012</xref>). IRGs and GBPs are recruited to the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) resulting in a loss of membrane integrity and parasite death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ling et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martens et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yamamoto et al., 2012</xref>). As a defense, type I and type II strains of <italic>T. gondii</italic> express the Ser/Thr kinase ROP18, which phosphorylates and inactivates IRG proteins to prevent PVM damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hunter and Sibley, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mukhopadhyay et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, increased nitric oxide production due to induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) has also been shown to play a role in restricting <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection in mice in vivo and in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Khan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adams et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Meisel et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>IFNγ is similarly important for <italic>T. gondii</italic> restriction in human cells in vitro and IFNγ expression has been shown to correlate with disease severity in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pfefferkorn et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Meira et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast to the situation in mouse, the reported mechanisms underlying IFNγ-mediated <italic>T. gondii</italic> restriction in humans tend to be cell-type specific. However, it is important to note here that many of the studies in mice have been conducted in primary cells whereas human studies have mostly relied on immortalized cell lines. This could also be an important factor in the differences between restriction mechanisms observed in mice and humans. Humans possess one truncated IRG that likely lacks GTPase activity and only one nontruncated IRG that is not IFNγ or infection inducible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bekpen et al., 2005</xref>). Hence, it is unlikely IRGs play a role in human resistance to <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection. Although human GBP1 has been shown to restrict <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection, it does so in a cell type-dependent manner. GBP1 restricts infection in IFNγ-treated human mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and lung epithelial cells (i.e., A549 cells) but not myeloid-derived cells (i.e., HAP1 cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Qin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ohshima et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Johnston et al., 2016</xref>). GBP1 is also implicated in an inflammasome pathway that results in host cell death in human macrophages following <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fisch et al., 2019a</xref>). Additionally, GBP5 has been shown to play a role in the clearance of <italic>T. gondii</italic> from human macrophages in vitro, albeit in an IFNγ independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Matta et al., 2018</xref>). Humans also possess an ISG15-dependent, IFNγ inducible, noncanonical autophagy (ATG) pathway that restricts <italic>T. gondii</italic> growth in human cervical adenocarcinoma cells (HeLa cells) and A549 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhushan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Selleck et al., 2015</xref>). A similar noncanonical ATG dependent pathway has been reported in human umbilical vein epithelial cells (HUVECs), although it differs slightly in culminating in lysosome fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clough et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1) has been shown in vitro to restrict <italic>T. gondii</italic> growth by limiting L-tryptophan availability in human fibroblasts and monocyte-derived macrophages as well as in human-derived cell lines of myeloid, foreskin, liver, or cervix origin (e.g., HAP1s, HFFs, Huh7s, and HeLas) but not in cells lines originating from mesenchymal stem cells, the large intestine, or the umbilical endothelium (e.g., MSCs, CaCO<sub>2</sub>s, or HUVECs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Qin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bando et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pfefferkorn, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Woodman et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dimier and Bout, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schmitz et al., 1989</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, the previous studies examining IFNγ-mediated growth restriction in human cells support a model where different mechanisms make variable contributions in distinct lineages. However, the known pathways for restriction only cover a small fraction of the genes that are normally upregulated in different human cell types following treatment with IFNγ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schoggins, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rusinova et al., 2013</xref>). Hence, there may be additional control mechanisms not yet defined, including either those that are lineage-specific or that operate globally in all cell types. To explore this hypothesis, we screened a library of 414 IFNγ induced ISGs in a one gene per well format to attempt to identify novel human factors with the ability to restrict <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To identify novel ISGs that impact <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection, we employed a library of 414 IFNγ induced ISGs cloned into a lentiviral expression cassette co-expressing tagRFP, as previously described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrams et al., 2020</xref>. To screen for ISGs that restrict <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection, we developed a high-throughput method to quantitatively measure infection of GFP-expressing type III strain CTG parasites using automated microscopy. CTG is a type III strain of <italic>T. gondii</italic> that is avirulent in mice and more susceptible to IFNγ-mediated restriction than other strains thus making it ideal for identifying individual ISGs which can restrict infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Khaminets et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boothroyd and Grigg, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Saeij et al., 2006</xref>). A549 lung epithelial cells were infected with CTG-GFP and the size of individual parasitophorous vacuoles (PVs), the number of vacuoles per field, and the percentage of vacuoles with a size consistent with containing ≥8 parasites were determined after 36 hr of culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). A549 cells were used as they are highly permissive to transduction with our VSV-G pseudotyped lentivirus and readily infected by <italic>T. gondii</italic>. Cells were transduced with lentivirus in a one gene per well format and challenged with CTG-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Transduction efficiency was high for most ISGs with 86% (357/414) of ISGs expressed in at least 50% of the cell population and 50% of ISGs (205/414) expressed in 90% of the cell population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Using this approach, we found three ISGs that restricted infection: IRF1, TRIM31, and RARRES3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). All hits were identified as significant by a two-way ANOVA (p&lt;0.0001). Interestingly, six ISGs significantly promoted parasite growth, including IL7R, IFITM1, MX1, DHX58, RNF19B, and CNDP2. For the purposes of this study, we were interested in investigating ISGs that restricted infection and did not further validate or study any ISGs that promoted parasite growth. We found it curious that IDO1 was not identified by this screen considering its significant impact on infection observed in some but not all cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Qin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bando et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pfefferkorn, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Woodman et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dimier and Bout, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schmitz et al., 1989</xref>). There have been no previous reports as to the role of IDO1 during infection in A549s and as such we generated an IDO1 deficient A549 cell line and challenged with CTG-GFP in the presence of IFNγ. Consistent with the results of our screen, IDO1 deficiency did not impair IFNγ-mediated restriction of CTG-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). It is worth noting here that the concentration of tryptophan used in the media for these experiments (16 µg/ml) was higher than what has been used previously to observe IDO1-mediated infection restriction, which may prevent IDO1-mediated depletion of tryptophan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pfefferkorn, 1984</xref>). However, in the present study, a much higher dose of IFNγ was also used to induce strong ISG expression and this might be expected to overcome increased tryptophan levels. Collectively, our results suggest that IDO1 does not play a major role in the restriction of <italic>T. gondii</italic> in A549 cells under the experimental conditions used in this study.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Screen for interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) impacting <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> infection.</title><p>A549 cells were treated with indicated concentrations of IFNγ for 24 hr and subsequently infected with the type III strain CTG expressing GFP (CTG-GFP) for 36 hr.

However, it is unknown what subset of IFNγ-induced genes are regulated by IRF1 in A549 cells. To define these two gene sets, we ectopically expressed IRF1 or luciferase control in A549 cells, treated a subset of control cells with IFNγ, and analyzed transcriptional changes by RNA-seq. For both IFNγ and IRF1, the majority of changes were due to upregulation, and we focused our analysis on these genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>).

Phospholipase and acyltransferase activities of HRASLS subfamily enzymes involve the temporary acylation of an active site cysteine residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mardian et al., 2015</xref>). To determine if the catalytic activity of RARRES3 was required for restriction of infection, we generated two active site point mutants (C113A, C113S) of RARRES3. Cells ectopically expressing mutant or WT RARRES3 were subsequently challenged with CTG-GFP. Although WT RARRES3 restricted infection, neither mutant was able to do so (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Notably, RARRES3 C113A ectopic expression slightly promoted infection. Analysis of protein expression by western blot indicated that both mutants were strongly expressed compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). These data suggest that the enzymatic activity of RARRES3 is necessary for restriction of infection. To determine if endogenously expressed RARRES3 impacts infection, we next used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing to generate a RARRES3<sup>−/−</sup> A549 cell line. Alternatively, cells were transduced with an expression cassette containing Cas9 and a previously used nontargeting sgRNA to serve as a negative control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Doench et al., 2016</xref>). RARRES3 deficiency did not alter the susceptibility of quiescent cells to infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–D</xref>). However, RARRES3 deficiency partially alleviated IFNγ-mediated restriction of CTG-GFP infection and this deficiency was complemented with RARRES3 ectopic expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–D</xref>). As previously mentioned, RNA-seq analysis showed that RARRES3 expression was strongly induced by both IRF1 and IFNγ. Since RARRES3 was the only ISG identified by our screen to restrict <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection, we wanted to determine if the impact of IRF1 on infection was solely due to upregulation of RARRES3 expression. To test this, we ectopically expressed IRF1 or luciferase control in WT and RARRES3<sup>−/−</sup> A549 cells and challenged them with CTG-GFP. However, loss of RARRES3 did not impact IRF1-mediated restriction of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). This suggests that either IRF1-mediated infection restriction is RARRES3 independent or involves multiple factors with RARRES3 playing a redundant role in the process of restricting growth. As previously mentioned, CTG is a type III strain of <italic>T. gondii</italic> that is less virulent in mice and more susceptible to IFNγ-mediated restriction than other strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Khaminets et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boothroyd and Grigg, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Saeij et al., 2006</xref>).

This result suggested to us that RARRES3 might be promoting premature egress of the parasite. To test this possibility, we infected A549 cells ectopically expressing RARRES3 with CTG-GFP parasites and measured lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). RARRES3 ectopic expression resulted in increased LDH release in CTG-infected cells compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We next sought to differentiate if the observed LDH release was due to protein kinase G (PKG) dependent, active parasite egress, or a form of induced cell death. To differentiate between these two hypotheses, we treated cells during infection with a trisubstituted pyrrole <italic>T. gondii</italic> protein kinase G inhibitor known as Compound 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gurnett et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Donald et al., 2006</xref>). Compound 1 is a potent inhibitor of parasite egress and has also been shown to promote differentiation from tachyzoites to bradyzoites, significantly slowing parasite growth thus also delaying or preventing egress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nare et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lourido et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Radke et al., 2006</xref>). Treatment with Compound 1 blocked the LDH release observed during infection and compound 1 treated cells did not stain with propidium iodide, suggesting that host cell death as measured by LDH release was due to parasite egress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Similar to above, this phenotype was blocked by Compound 1 addition. A common trigger of premature egress is the induction of cell death pathways, of which there is a diversity of types controlled by different mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Persson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Niedelman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rosenberg and Sibley, 2021</xref>). If induction of host cell death is the trigger for premature egress, we would expect to observe host cell death even when parasite egress is blocked. Hence, we were curious if extending this timepoint further would reveal host cell death even with blockage of parasite egress by Compound 1. However, Compound 1 addition during infection resulted in no significant increase in LDH release or propidium iodide staining even 72 hr after infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Meanwhile, in untreated, infected cultures, the cell monolayer was nearly completely lysed and LDH activity was elevated in the supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Further, we did not observe signs of death such as cell rounding, blebbing, or loss of nuclear integrity prior to parasite egress during live imaging (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref>). Collectively, these findings suggest that induction of cell death by RARRES3 is not the trigger for promotion of parasite egress. To further test this idea, we treated cells with a panel of established inhibitors of known cell death pathways during infection either individually or in combination as indicated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). These inhibitors included the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK, which blocks apoptosis; the necroptosis inhibitors GSK’963, GSK’872, and necrosulfonamide (NSA), which block RIP1, RIP3, and MLKL activity, respectively; and the pyroptosis inhibitor Z-YVAD-FMK, which blocks caspase 1. No single drug or combination thereof was capable of inhibiting LDH release during infection except for GSK’872, which partially prevented LDH release in both RARRES3 ectopically expressing and control cells. Overall, we conclude from these experiments that it is unlikely that overexpression of RARRES3 induces cell death and therefore it must trigger premature egress by some other means.</p><p>A similar premature egress phenotype to that observed here has previously been identified in HFF cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Niedelman et al., 2013</xref>). We hypothesized that RARRES3 might play a role in this process. To test this possibility, we ectopically expressed RARRES3 in HFF cells and infected with CTG-GFP parasites. RARRES3 ectopic expression was found to restrict CTG infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–B</xref>). We next ablated RARRES3 expression in HFFs using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing. Loss of RARRES3 resulted in a partial reduction in IFNγ-dependent cell death in RARRES3<sup>−/−</sup> HFF cells compared to control cells expressing Cas9 and a nontargeting sgRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). This finding indicates that RARRES3 plays a role in premature egress but is not the only factor involved in HFF cells. In line with this finding, RARRES3 deficiency in HFF cells partially abrogated IFNγ-mediated restriction of CTG-GFP infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Moreover, treatment with Compound 1 completely blocked cell death during infection, suggesting that cell death is caused by PKG-dependent parasite egress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D-F</xref>). Collectively, this data suggests that RARRES3 overexpression promotes premature parasite egress independently of host cell death pathways in multiple cell lines which presumably stunts parasite growth leading to reduced infection overall.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>IFNγ-dependent host cell death during infection in HFFs is partially RARRES3 dependent.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) HFF cells were transduced with TRIP.RARRES3 or TRIP.FLUC control and infected 72 hr later with CTG-GFP for 96 hr.

However, the currently known restriction mechanisms in humans show dramatic differences between cell types with no common or widespread restriction mechanism being observed. On the other hand, of the hundreds of ISGs, the vast majority have never been studied in relation to <italic>T. gondii</italic>, leaving open the possibility of unidentified restriction mechanisms. Herein, we performed a screen of IFNγ induced ISGs to identify novel mechanisms of IFNγ-mediated immunity in humans. Our screen identified RARRES3 and IRF1 as ISGs restrictive to <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection in human cells. Further study revealed that RARRES3 induced premature egress of <italic>T. gondii</italic> from host cells in a cell death independent manner. Not unexpectedly, IRF1 induced genes were largely found to be a subset of those induced by IFNγ, including RARRES3. These findings suggest that IRF1 works by the collective action of multiple ISGs. The relative lack of individual ISGs that are active alone also suggests that control mechanisms effective against <italic>T. gondii</italic> rely on complexes of multiple ISGs or cellular proteins working in concert. Hence, the control of intracellular eukaryotic pathogens contrasts with that of viral pathogens, mirroring differences in their overall biological complexity.</p><p>We identified RARRES3 as an ISG promoting premature egress of type III strains of <italic>T. gondii</italic> in two different human cell lines. This phenotype occurs independently of triggering downstream immune signaling. A common cause of premature egress is the induction of host cell death pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Persson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Niedelman et al., 2013</xref>). And indeed, such a mechanism might be suggested due to the fact that RARRES3 ectopic expression has been previously shown to induce apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tsai et al., 2007</xref>). However, in our system RARRES3 ectopic expression was not found to impact cell death. Additionally, basal levels of LDH release were not increased in cells ectopically expressing RARRES3. Finally, when we blocked cell death pathways individually or in tandem, we did not see a reduction in LDH. The one exception to this pattern was the reduced release of LDH following treatment with GSK’872. We suspect this result is due to RIP3 inhibition mediated induction of apoptosis as has been demonstrated previously with GSK’872 treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tenev et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, following treatment with GSK’872 it is likely that infection is hindered by host cell apoptosis and LDH release is not observed since cell membranes remain largely intact. The early egress phenotype observed here was similar to an IFNγ-dependent premature parasite egress observed in HFF cells that was independent of known cell death pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Niedelman et al., 2013</xref>). We found that ablation of RARRES3 expression partially prevented the IFNγ and infection-dependent cell death phenotype in HFF cells. Furthermore, we observed that LDH release was blocked via Compound 1 mediated inhibition of PKG suggesting that RARRES3 overexpression leads to parasite egress resulting in host cell lysis. Although previous studies using CDPK3 inhibition concluded that blocking egress was not sufficient to prevent cell death, our findings differ from this conclusion, possibly due to the stronger role for PKG in controlling egress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lourido et al., 2012</xref>). It is presently unclear how RARRES3 leads to premature egress, although it is possible that its phospholipase A1/A2 activity may alter cellular lipid pools that could induce premature egress consistent with the requirement for catalytic residues. As an example of the sensitivity of egress to membrane lipid constituents, increases in phosphatidic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bisio et al., 2019</xref>), or the activity of lipolytic lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pszenny et al., 2016</xref> have been shown to trigger egress of <italic>T. gondii</italic>.</p><p>Although our studies define a role for RARRES3 in promoting early egress in vitro, they do not address how this outcome impacts parasite infection in vivo. Premature egress prevents further parasite growth and would reduce the maximum number of parasites reduce per round of infection while also incurring additional energy costs of reinvasion. Further, it removes the parasite from its protected intracellular niche, resulting in exposure to the extracellular environment and potential recognition by the immune system. Finally, host cell death that accompanies premature egress is a proinflammatory event that would presumably lead to a heightened immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rock and Kono, 2008</xref>). For these reasons, we expect that the early egress induced by RARRES3 would be protective against <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection in vivo. However, it is possible that rapid egress could result in faster spread to neighboring cells. It is also worth noting premature expulsion by phagocytic cells has been suggested to promote the dissemination of <italic>T. gondii</italic> and other pathogens such as <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Seoane and May, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Drewry and Sibley, 2019</xref>). Further studies using in vivo models of infection are needed to clarify the role of RARRES3 in control of infection.</p><p>In addition to RARRES3, we found that ectopic expression of IRF1 was sufficient to restrict <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection. It was not surprising to us that we identified IRF1 in this screen considering the well-known role of IRF1 in the secondary induction of ISGs and other protective factors downstream of IFN signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feng et al., 2021</xref>). Mice deficient in Irf1 were previously shown to be more susceptible to <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Khan et al., 1996</xref>). However, considering the limited number of ISGs found to restrict <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection in our screen, we were curious as to what genes or pathways were being induced by IRF1 ectopic expression and how this compared to IFNγ-mediated gene expression in A549s. Although few genes were substantially downregulated by IRF1 expression, 160 genes were upregulated ≥2-fold by IRF1 compared to 380 genes with IFNγ treatment. IRF1 induced genes were largely a subset of those IFNγ inducible genes. Notably, this is not always the case with a significant disparity in genes being induced by IRF1 compared to IFNs being reported previously in BEAS-2B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Panda et al., 2019</xref>). Overall, similar processes were induced by both IRF1 and IFNγ and these were related to antigen processing and presentation, host defense, and immune signaling. We observed that IRF1 and IFNγ both strongly induced the expression of RARRES3 which led us to question if infection restriction by IRF1 was due to the induction of RARRES3 expression. However, we found that this was not the case, suggesting that RARRES3 either does not play a role in IRF1-mediated restriction of <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection or plays a redundant role. Hence, it is likely that IRF1 leads to overexpression of multiple ISGs that collectively inhibit parasite growth.</p><p>Although our study is the first to broadly screen ISGs for anti-protozoal activity, it is curious that we only identified two genes that were inhibitory to <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection. In contrast, similar screens challenging viruses and bacteria have commonly identified a minimum of 2–3 times this number of gene products that were restrictive to infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrams et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schoggins et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schoggins et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Perelman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dittmann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kuroda et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kane et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). To our knowledge, a total of 30 viruses and two bacterial pathogens have been challenged in similar screens. It is possible that the above observation may not hold as more screens are performed on other pathogens especially intracellular bacteria or parasites. One possible explanation of this difference is that <italic>T. gondii</italic> separates itself from the host cytoplasm via the host derived PVM that forms a barrier to otherwise harmful ISGs in the cytosol. Another explanation is that a common mechanism of ISG activity is the manipulation or shutdown of host processes required for pathogen infection. Examples include PKR-mediated and IFIT-mediated inhibition of host translation machinery, processes that directly affect viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schoggins, 2019</xref>). In contrast, <italic>T. gondii</italic> is a relatively autonomous intracellular pathogen with relatively limited need for host machinery for its growth and replication. Hence, the fact that so few genes were identified by this screen may reflect a secluded existence of T<italic>. gondii</italic> within the PVM and its autonomy of cellular processes relative to viral or bacterial pathogens.</p><p>Alternatively, the low number of single genes that restrict the growth of <italic>T. gondii</italic> in A549 cells suggests that IFNγ-dependent restriction is a complex process requiring the cooperation of multiple host factors at a time. Hence, the expression of single factors may not be sufficient to restrict infection. For example, a requirement for additional factors could explain why ISG15 was not identified by this screen as ISGylation also requires ubiquitin-like conjugation to attach to target proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Perng and Lenschow, 2018</xref>). ISG15 knockout was previously found to enhance <italic>T. gondii</italic> growth in A549 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhushan et al., 2020</xref>) and this was attributed to its role in the targeting of autophagy machinery to the PV during infection leading to restriction of parasite growth. Currently, over 200 genes have been found to be involved in autophagy in human cells according to the human autophagy database (HADb, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://autophagy.lu/clustering/index.html">http://autophagy.lu/clustering/index.html</ext-link>). Furthermore, coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicated that ISG15 interacts directly or indirectly with more than 240 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhushan et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, although ISG15 may be necessary for autophagy-mediated infection restriction as observed with knockout-based studies, its individual ectopic expression may not be sufficient to induce this mechanism of infection restriction. A similar explanation can be made for GBP1 that was shown via knockout experiments to be important for restriction of <italic>T. gondii</italic> in A549 cells previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Johnston et al., 2016</xref>). Gbp1 recruitment to the PV and parasite clearance in mice has been shown to require the autophagy machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Selleck et al., 2013</xref>) and the interaction of GBP1 with ATG5 has been reported in a human cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhushan et al., 2020</xref>). In human macrophages, the AIM2 inflammasome has been reported to induce host cell death in a GBP1 dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fisch et al., 2019a</xref>). Thus, the expression of GBP1 individually may not be sufficient to restrict <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection. A similar argument is unlikely to explain the lack of a phenotype for IDO1, which is not thought to require any other genes for its function. However, this pathway does not seem to operate in all human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Qin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Woodman et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dimier and Bout, 1997</xref>). Our findings demonstrate that IDO1 does not impact infection in A549s at least under the conditions used in this study. Finally, it is also possible that ISGs important for <italic>T. gondii</italic> were missed by this screen as the library used herein is not an exhaustive list of all ISGs expressed in A549 cells. Hence, it is possible that other ISGs that restrict <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection could be identified using a more focused library or using a similar approach in a different human cell line.</p><p>Although we successfully identified a novel anti-parasitic ISG impacting <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection, the scarcity of ISGs identified with the screening approach used here is also of interest. Our results suggest that immunity to <italic>T. gondii</italic> is a complex process requiring multiple factors to impact infection. This complexity differs from other intracellular pathogens such as bacteria and viruses, where single ISGs are often sufficient to inhibit infection. As such, a future loss-of-function based screen for ISGs targeting <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection may reveal additional mechanisms of <italic>T. gondii</italic> restriction.</p></sec><sec

and human embryonic kidney-derived 293T cells (ATCC #CRL-3216) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 2 mM L-glutamine, and 10 µg/ml gentamicin. Cells were grown at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. <italic>T. gondii</italic> strains RH88 (type I), Me49 (type II), and CTG (type III) expressing GFP were generated via random insertion of pGRA1.GFP.GRA2.DHFR after electroporation as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shen et al., 2017</xref>). Clonal populations expressing GFP were generated via limiting dilution. <italic>T. gondii</italic> lines were passaged as described previously in HFFs grown under the conditions listed above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Khan and Grigg, 2017</xref>). Parasite and host cell lines were confirmed to be negative for mycoplasma using an e-Myco Plus Kit (Intron Biotechnology).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Plasmids and cloning</title><p>The plasmids TRIP.RARRES3 and control constructs were kindly provided by Neal Alto and John Schoggins. Briefly, the TRIP plasmid encodes an expression cassette flanked by lentiviral LTRs. Expression of a bicistronic transcript including tagRFP and a gene of interest is driven by a CMV promoter. The gene of interest and tagRFP are translated independently via an internal ribosome entry site. Cas9 resistant RARRES3 was generated from the WT TRIP.RARRES3 construct by overlap extension PCR using Q5 high fidelity DNA polymerase (NEB). N-terminally V5 tagged WT, C113A, and C113S RARRES3 were generated from WT by overlap extension PCR. Fragments were cloned into pDONR221 using BP Clonase II (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and subsequently cloned into pTRIP using LR Clonase II (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For CRISPR/Cas9 experiments, RARRES3 and nontargeting guides were cloned into plentiCRISPRv2 (Addgene plasmid #52961) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sanjana et al., 2014</xref>). Primers for the above cloning are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>. For IDO1, an IDO1 targeting sgRNA was cloned into pLenti-Cas9-GFP (Addgene plasmid #86145). Briefly, pLenti-Cas9-GFP was digested with BsmBI (New England Biolabs). Primers listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref> were annealed and ligated into the digested plasmid using T4 ligase (New England Biolabs). For the generation of pGRA1.GFP.GRA2.DHFR, an expression cassette consisting of the GRA1 5′ UTR (M26007.1, nucleotides 4–615) driving the expression of GFP (MN114103.1, coding sequence) flanked by the GRA2 3′ UTR (XM_002366354.2, nucleotides 997–1114) was cloned into pHL931 along with DHFR (XM_002367211.2, coding sequence) expressed from its native promoter and flanked by its 3′ UTR (L08489.1).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Lentivirus production and cell line generation</title><p>TRIP lentiviruses were produced as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schoggins et al., 2012</xref>). Lentiviruses derived from Lenti-Cas9-GFP, lentiCRISPRv2, and HAGE NFkB-TA-LUC-UBC-GFP-W (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wilson et al., 2013</xref>) were produced similarly. Briefly, 293T cells were seeded at 4×10<sup>5</sup> cells per well into six-well plates. Cells were transfected with 1 µg pTRIP, pLenti-Cas9-GFP, plentiCRISPRv2, or pHAGE NFkB-TA-LUC-UBC-GFP-W, 0.2 µg plasmid expressing VSVg, and 0.8 µg plasmid expressing HIV-1 gag-pol using X-tremeGENE 9 (Sigma-Aldrich). Media were changed 6 hr later and lentivirus containing culture supernatants were collected at 48 and 72 hr post-transfection. Pooled supernatants were clarified by centrifugation at 800×<italic>g</italic> for 5 min. Polybrene and HEPES were added to a final concentration of 4 µg/ml and 35 mM, respectively. Lentivirus was stored at –80°C until use.</p><p>For lentivirus transductions, cells were seeded at 7×10<sup>4</sup> cells per well in 24-well plates. The next day, media were changed to DMEM supplemented with 4 µg/ml polybrene, 3% FBS, 35 mM HEPES, 2 mM glutamine, and 10 µg/ml gentamicin. Cells were transduced by spinoculation at 800×<italic>g</italic>, 45 min, 37°C. For the ISG screen, media was changed 6 hr later to normal growth medium. Cells were replated at 48 hr post-transduction for subsequent experimentation.</p><p>For knockout cell line generation, cells were transduced with lentiCRISPRv2 or pLenti-Cas9-GFP containing the appropriate sgRNA for Cas9 targeting as above. For lentiCRISPRv2, cells were selected for at least 2 weeks in growth media containing 4 µg/ml puromycin before experimentation. For IDO1<sup>−/−</sup>, STAT1<sup>−/−</sup>, and RARRES3<sup>−/−</sup> A549 cell lines, cells were transduced with a single lentivirus and clonal cell lineages were established through limiting dilution. For HFFs, a heterogeneous bulk population RARRES3 knockout cell line was generated by transducing at a tissue culture infectious dose of 90% (TCID<sub>90</sub>) with two different lentiCRISPRv2 based lentiviruses expressing separate RARRES3 targeting sgRNAs. Nontargeting control cell lines were generated for use as a control in all experiments involving RARRES3<sup>−/−</sup> cells. Here, cells were transduced with a single lentiCRISPRv2 based lentivirus containing a single nontargeting guide. For RARRES3 and STAT1, editing was confirmed by PCR amplifying targeted loci using primers listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref> and PrimeSTAR GXL DNA polymerase (Tocris) followed by Sanger sequencing. Editing efficiency was quantitated using Synthego ICE analysis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ice.synthego.com/#/">https://ice.synthego.com/#/</ext-link>). For single-cell clones, &gt;90% editing was verified. For HFF bulk population knockout of RARRES3, 68% editing of sequenced alleles was observed. For STAT1, editing was further confirmed functionally via testing the sensitivity of cells to IFN treatment as determined by IRF1 induction. For IDO1, editing was confirmed via loss of protein expression observed by western blot.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Infections</title><p>A549 and HeLa cells were seeded at 1.5×10<sup>4</sup> in 96-well plates 24 hr prior to infection.

Briefly, A549 or HFF cells split in 96-well plates were infected for 1 hr as described above with CTG-GFP at an MOI of 40 or 15, respectively, and subsequently treated with drugs as indicated. After 36 or 72 hr, 20 µl of 10× lysis buffer or PBS was added to each well and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. Afterward, 50 µl of cell supernatant was mixed with 50 µl of assay buffer and substrate for 30 min at room temperature.

Cells were treated with or without 100 U/ml IFNβ or IFNγ as indicated for 24 hr and subsequently infected as indicated with CTG-GFP at an MOI of 2 for 24 hr. For firefly luciferase assays, cells were lysed in 50 µl of 1× Luciferase Cell Culture Lysis Buffer (Promega). For Gaussia luciferase assays, supernatant was collected. Luciferase assays were conducted using Pierce Gaussia Luciferase Glow Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or Luciferase Assay System Kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Next generation RNA-sequencing sample preparation and analysis</title><p>A549 cells transduced with TRIP.IRF1 or TRIP.FLUC derived lentivirus were split at 3.5×10<sup>6</sup> into 100 mm dishes. After 24 hr, cells were treated with or without IFNγ at 1000 U/ml for an additional 12 hr before harvest with RLT buffer. RNA was isolated with a Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Prior to sequencing, RNA quality was determined on an Agilent Bioanalyzer to have a RIN&gt;8.0. Libraries prepared from samples were analyzed with an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 S4 generating a minimum of 3×10<sup>7</sup> reads per sample. Data were analyzed with Partek Flow software. Prior to alignment, 5 bp were trimmed from the 5′ end of transcripts. Only fragments ≥25 bp in length were considered for alignment. Alignment was conducted with the STAR aligner and differential expression analysis was conducted using GSA analysis with recommended settings. Genes were characterized here as induced by IFNγ or IRF1 if they induced gene expression ≥2-fold with an FDR&lt;0.05. Gene lists were compared using GeneVenn (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genevenn.sourceforge.net/index.htm">http://genevenn.sourceforge.net/index.htm</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pirooznia et al., 2007</xref>).

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Over-expression Screen of Interferon-Stimulated Genes Identifies RARRES3 as a Restrictor of <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> Infection&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jos Van der Meer as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Kirk Jensen (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. Overall there is considerable enthusiasm for the quality and importance of the work and we would be delighted to entertain a revised version if the following essential revisions can be addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There are no data in the paper that address the importance of the observations in the context of an in vivo infection. We have decided that such experiments are not required for a revised version. However, in the absence of such data, it is impossible to know whether the observed process is anti-parasite or perhaps beneficial to the parasite. Although pathogen expulsion is most likely anti-pathogen, it has also been the proposed that process of pathogen expulsion may benefit the pathogen (see microreview by Seoane and May PMID: 31730731). Tempering of the claims of an anti-parasite function of RARRES3 is thus required as is an acknowledgement that the effects of RARRES3 during in vivo infection remain unknown. These points could be discussed in the revised manuscript.</p><p>2) In the absence of in vivo data, the most novel aspect of the paper would be a demonstration that RARRES3 is involved in pathogen expulsion. However, the data in the manuscript in support of this mechanism are all indirect. Some direct observational data demonstrating that RARRES3 acts to mediate explusion (live imaging perhaps?) seem to us as an essential requirement in a revised manuscript.</p><p>3) The invidividual reviewers identify additional changes to the manuscript that should also be addressed in a revised version. Experiments with an additional pathogen would broaden the impact of the work but would not be required in a revised version.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Citations:</p><p>– Lines 55/56: would be helpful to cite one or more review articles on IRGs/ GBPs.</p><p>– Line 57: instead of citing 2 review articles, I would suggest the authors cite the 3 original papers that first demonstrated the Toxo PV-oriented membrano-lytic activity of IRGs/ GBPs: PMID: 16940170; PMID: 16304607; PMID: 22795875; after all the manuscript cites the original Toxoplasma work on IFNγ, nitric oxide, IDO, etc.- so why not do the same for IRGs/ GBPs?</p><p>– Line 58: why cite a 2012 review considering that many relevant ROP18-IRG papers have been published since 2012? I'd recommend PMID: 33178630 for a more timely review. Alternatively, cite the most relevant original research papers.</p><p>Data presentation:</p><p>– It is most common to have the controls (untreated, DMSO, WT, FLUC, etc.) on the left. However, it's also fine to have the controls on the right, if that's your preference, but whatever the arrangement, it should be consistent across all panels / figures to make it easier/ more intuitive to read the figures. For examples: Figure 5 – going from left to right – KO first and then WT in panels A and B but WT first and then KO in panel C. In Figure 1 panel A data are shown as IFN treated on the left and untreated on the right but in panel F it is the other way around. Etc. Please, check all figures and make it consistent across all figures and panels.</p><p>Writing/ argumentation:</p><p>– Line 167: PKG is mentioned but not defined. Definition is provided in next sentence.</p><p>– Lines 177/178: I am having a hard time understanding what the authors are trying to argue here. Admittedly, that could be me. Consider editing?</p><p>– First sentence of the Discussion: &quot;IFNγ-mediated immunity are highly conserved across different cell types in mice,&quot; – does this statement specifically refer to immunity to Toxo? Also, what's the evidence for this to be true? Provide citations.</p><p>– When comparing mouse with humans, the authors should also consider that most experiments in mice have been performed in primary cells (astrocytes, fibroblasts), whereas most experiments in human cells have been conducted in immortalized cancer cells – often of epithelial origin (e.g. A549 in this study) – therefore, these broad statements regarding host species-specific conservation of immune responses (or lack thereof) seem to be based on an incommensurable comparison</p><p>– Last sentence of first paragraph of Discussion &quot;Hence the control of intracellular eukaryotic pathogens contrasts with that of bacterial and viral pathogens, mirroring differences in their overall biological complexity&quot; – What is the evidence that the control of intracellular eukaryotic pathogens is fundamentally different from the control of intracellular bacterial pathogens – let's say Chlamydia, for example. So far observations made with Toxo closely mirror what has been seen with Chlamydia, a bacterium, and vice versa. I would suggest to revise this statement.</p><p>– In the same vain: line 253 ff. &quot;In contrast, similar screens challenging viruses and bacteria have commonly identified a minimum of 2-3 times this number of ISGs that were restrictive to infection(10-13). […]&quot; The number of screens is small and doesn't justify drawing such sweeping conclusions. If I am not mistaken, there's only been one screen with a bacterial pathogen, <italic>Listeria</italic>. I would suggest the authors rethink this entire paragraph (and other text passages such as the final paragraph of the Discussion), as I suspect time will show that these broad statements are inaccurate.</p><p>– Could the authors provide a rationale for choosing a type III strain for their screen</p><p>– Discuss potential physiological relevance of the egress pathway. Could this actually benefit the parasite in vivo by escaping the toxic intracellular environment of an IFNγ-primed cells? Would ejected parasites be more easily killed by phagocytes?</p><p>Suggested experiments/ data analysis</p><p>– REF [57] showed timelapse microscopy capturing parasite egress in IFNγ primed cells. Similar experiments monitoring egress in real time in controls vs RARRES3 overexpression and/or WT vs RARRES3 KO cells would provide direct evidence in support of the proposed mechanistic model and therefore significantly strengthen the paper.

We have decided that such experiments are not required for a revised version. However, in the absence of such data, it is impossible to know whether the observed process is anti-parasite or perhaps beneficial to the parasite. Although pathogen expulsion is most likely anti-pathogen, it has also been the proposed that process of pathogen expulsion may benefit the pathogen (see micro-review by Seoane and May PMID: 31730731). Tempering of the claims of an anti-parasite function of RARRES3 is thus required as is an acknowledgement that the effects of RARRES3 during in vivo infection remain unknown. These points could be discussed in the revised manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Extending these studies to test the role or RARRES3 in vivo is not straightforward, especially since control mechanism vary between humans and experimental models like mice. However, we agree that our findings that RARRES3 controls early egress, and apparent growth restriction in vitro, as necessarily indicative of control in vivo. We have added a discussion of the different potential roles for early egress – or expulsion, on either control of infection or potential spread of the parasite.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In the absence of in vivo data, the most novel aspect of the paper would be a demonstration that RARRES3 is involved in pathogen expulsion. However, the data in the manuscript in support of this mechanism are all indirect. Some direct observational data demonstrating that RARRES3 acts to mediate explusion (live imaging perhaps?) seem to us as an essential requirement in a revised manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this would be test of our assumption and we have performed a time-lapse study that demonstrates early egress in RARRES3 over-expression cells. The data are now included in figure 6C and videos 1-2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The invidividual reviewers identify additional changes to the manuscript that should also be addressed in a revised version. Experiments with an additional pathogen would broaden the impact of the work but would not be required in a revised version.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed the remaining concerns with revisions to the text as detailed in the point by point response below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Citations:</p><p>– Lines 55/56: would be helpful to cite one or more review articles on IRGs/ GBPs.</p></disp-quote><p>Review articles cited on line 57 were moved to line 56.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 57: instead of citing 2 review articles, I would suggest the authors cite the 3 original papers that first demonstrated the Toxo PV-oriented membrano-lytic activity of IRGs/ GBPs: PMID: 16940170; PMID: 16304607; PMID: 22795875; after all the manuscript cites the original Toxoplasma work on IFNγ, nitric oxide, IDO, etc. – so why not do the same for IRGs/ GBPs?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the suggested citations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 58: why cite a 2012 review considering that many relevant ROP18-IRG papers have been published since 2012? I'd recommend PMID: 33178630 for a more timely review. Alternatively, cite the most relevant original research papers.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the suggested citation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Data presentation:</p><p>– It is most common to have the controls (untreated, DMSO, WT, FLUC, etc.) on the left. However, it's also fine to have the controls on the right, if that's your preference, but whatever the arrangement, it should be consistent across all panels / figures to make it easier/ more intuitive to read the figures. For examples: Figure 5 – going from left to right – KO first and then WT in panels A and B but WT first and then KO in panel C. In Figure 1 panel A data are shown as IFN treated on the left and untreated on the right but in panel F it is the other way around. Etc. Please, check all figures and make it consistent across all figures and panels.</p></disp-quote><p>Controls are now consistently placed on the left in all figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Writing/ argumentation:</p><p>– Line 167: PKG is mentioned but not defined.

Admittedly, that could be me. Consider editing?</p></disp-quote><p>Additional explanation has been added to the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– First sentence of the Discussion: &quot;IFNγ-mediated immunity are highly conserved across different cell types in mice,&quot; – does this statement specifically refer to immunity to Toxo? Also, what's the evidence for this to be true? Provide citations.</p></disp-quote><p>The statement has been toned down to better reflect the cell types tested thus far and additional citations were added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– When comparing mouse with humans, the authors should also consider that most experiments in mice have been performed in primary cells (astrocytes, fibroblasts), whereas most experiments in human cells have been conducted in immortalized cancer cells -often of epithelial origin (e.g. A549 in this study) – therefore, these broad statements regarding host species-specific conservation of immune responses (or lack thereof) seem to be based on an incommensurable comparison</p></disp-quote><p>We added a statement in the Introduction noting this as an additional factor that complicates the comparison of results in mice and humans.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Last sentence of first paragraph of Discussion &quot;Hence the control of intracellular eukaryotic pathogens contrasts with that of bacterial and viral pathogens, mirroring differences in their overall biological complexity&quot; – What is the evidence that the control of intracellular eukaryotic pathogens is fundamentally different from the control of intracellular bacterial pathogens – let's say Chlamydia, for example. So far observations made with Toxo closely mirror what has been seen with Chlamydia, a bacterium, and vice versa. I would suggest to revise this statement.</p></disp-quote><p>The statement has been revised as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In the same vain: line 253 ff. &quot;In contrast, similar screens challenging viruses and bacteria have commonly identified a minimum of 2-3 times this number of ISGs that were restrictive to infection(10-13). […]&quot; The number of screens is small and doesn't justify drawing such sweeping conclusions. If I am not mistaken, there's only been one screen with a bacterial pathogen, Listeria. I would suggest the authors rethink this entire paragraph (and other text passages such as the final paragraph of the Discussion), as I suspect time will show that these broad statements are inaccurate.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the number of bacterial pathogens tested is very limited. We have clarified in the text the number of viral and bacterial pathogens which have been tested and noted that further work is needed to validate our observation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Could the authors provide a rationale for choosing a type III strain for their screen</p></disp-quote><p>A rationale has been added to the beginning of the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Discuss potential physiological relevance of the egress pathway. Could this actually benefit the parasite in vivo by escaping the toxic intracellular environment of an IFNγ-primed cells? Would ejected parasites be more easily killed by phagocytes?</p></disp-quote><p>We added a section in the Discussion covering the potential physiological relevance of RARRES3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Suggested experiments/ data analysis</p><p>– REF [57] showed timelapse microscopy capturing parasite egress in IFNγ primed cells. Similar experiments monitoring egress in real time in controls vs RARRES3 overexpression and/or WT vs RARRES3 KO cells would provide direct evidence in support of the proposed mechanistic model and therefore significantly strengthen the paper. Current evidence is entirely circumstantial.</p></disp-quote><p>As indicated above, we conducted a live imaging experiment to directly observed parasite egress in RARRES3 and FLUC ectopically expressing A549s.
