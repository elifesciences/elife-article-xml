Recent studies have identified examples of genomic deletions that have remained polymorphic in the human lineage for hundreds of millennia, ostensibly owing to balancing selection. Nevertheless, genome-wide investigation of ancient and possibly adaptive deletions remains an imperative exercise. Here, we demonstrate an excess of polymorphisms in present-day humans that predate the modern human-Neanderthal split (ancient polymorphisms), which cannot be explained solely by selectively neutral scenarios. We analyze the adaptive mechanisms that underlie this excess in deletion polymorphisms. Using a previously published measure of balancing selection, we show that this excess of ancient deletions is largely owing to balancing selection. Based on the absence of signatures of overdominance, we conclude that it is a rare mode of balancing selection among ancient deletions. Instead, more complex scenarios involving spatially and temporally variable selective pressures are likely more common mechanisms. Our results suggest that balancing selection resulted in ancient deletions harboring disproportionately more exonic variants with GWAS (genome-wide association studies) associations. We further found that ancient deletions are significantly enriched for traits related to metabolism and immunity. As a by-product of our analysis, we show that deletions are, on average, more deleterious than single nucleotide variants. We can now argue that not only is a vast majority of common variants shared among human populations, but a considerable portion of biologically relevant variants has been segregating among our ancestors for hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of years.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The persistence of versions of genes that cause severe disease in human populations has long perplexed scientists. It is common for many versions of a gene to exist. But scientists expect that over time natural selection will eliminate versions of genes harmful to human health.</p><p>Sometimes, there are good reasons that a disease-causing gene may persist. For example, having two copies of a particular gene variant causes a condition, called sickle cell disease. But having one sickle cell-causing copy of the gene and one non-disease-causing copy protects against malaria. As a result, the version of the gene that causes sickle cell is more common in people from areas where malaria is prevalent despite the risks to people who end up with two copies. Scientists call this phenomenon balancing selection because trade-offs in the gene’s benefits and risks cause it to persist in the population.</p><p>Aqil et al. show that balancing selection has likely caused many ancient gene variants to persist in human populations. In the experiments, Aqil et al. scoured the genomes of hundreds of modern humans from around the world and four groups of ancient human ancestors, including Neanderthals and Denisovans. The experiments looked for structural changes in genes, like deletions, that date back to more than 700,000 years ago – before modern humans split from their ancestors. They found large numbers of such ancient genes in modern humans.</p><p>Using computer modeling, Aqil et al. showed that these ancient genes likely persist because of balancing selection. Many of these ancient genes regulate the immune response and metabolism. These genes may protect against infectious diseases outbreaks and starvation, which have occurred periodically throughout human history. But these same genes may cause immune or metabolic diseases in modern humans not currently facing these threats. The experiments show how such biological trade-offs have shaped human evolution and reveal that modern human populations, regardless of race or region of origin, share the same genetic variation that already our ancestors carried within them.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>Neanderthals</kwd><kwd>Denisovans</kwd><kwd>genomics</kwd><kwd>structural variation</kwd><kwd>copy number variation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2123284</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gokcumen</surname><given-names>Omer</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Sir Henry Wellcome Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>220457/Z/20/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Speidel</surname><given-names>Leo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Speidel</surname><given-names>Leo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

In humans, tens of thousands of common variants are reported to be associated with human diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Loos, 2020</xref>). However, the mainstream view remains that the majority of these functional genetic variants have had a negligible effect on reproductive fitness and that the frequency of these variants has fluctuated neutrally by drift over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bromberg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dudley et al., 2012</xref>). Functional variants that have measurable fitness effects are often observed at a low frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eyre-Walker, 2010</xref>). These low-frequency functional variants are considered to be in the process of being eliminated from the population by negative selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gibson, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lettre, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zeng et al., 2018</xref>). Nevertheless, an increasing number of studies are showing that more complex evolutionary histories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Benton et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mathieson and Mathieson, 2018</xref>) involving introgression from archaic hominins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McArthur et al., 2020</xref>), geography-specific adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hamid et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lachance and Tishkoff, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mendoza-Revilla et al., 2021</xref>), negative selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zeng et al., 2018</xref>), and polygenic selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Barghi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Berg and Coop, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pritchard et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sella and Barton, 2019</xref>) may explain the allele frequencies of variants associated with complex diseases. In this context, we aim to test the hypothesis that balancing selection is a considerable force in shaping the allele frequencies of extant functional deletions in the human genome.</p><p>Balancing selection is a mode of natural selection that maintains a genomic polymorphism by overcoming the stochastic loss or fixation of one of the alleles by genetic drift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fijarczyk and Babik, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fisher, 1923</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Noonan et al., 2006</xref>). HJ Muller was the first to discover balancing selection from his study of balanced lethals in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Muller, 1918</xref>). Adaptive variational maintenance by balancing selection may be achieved in a number of ways. In a mechanism known as overdominance (also called heterozygote advantage), the individual who is heterozygous for a certain variant has a higher fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fisher, 1923</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wallace, 1970</xref>). In negative frequency-dependent selection, rarer variants confer higher fitness. This leads to a fluctuation of a variant’s frequency in the population until an equilibrium is established, such that neither variant confers an advantage relative to the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Smith Maynard et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Takahashi and Kawata, 2013</xref>). Temporally varying selection, wherein the selection coefficient associated with an allele changes over time, can lead to the oscillation of this allele’s frequency over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdul-Rahman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wittmann et al., 2017</xref>). Spatially varying selection, wherein the selection coefficient associated with an allele varies across geography, may fix this allele locally in one niche and eliminate it in another, leading to the global persistence of variation at the locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hedrick, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Levene, 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Saitou et al., 2021a</xref>).</p><p>Unlike positive and negative selection, there is only a modest number of well-established instances of balancing selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Charlesworth and Charlesworth, 2017</xref>). In humans, these include polymorphisms of the <italic>ABO</italic> gene, which determine the A, B, and O blood groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ségurel et al., 2012</xref>), and polymorphisms in the major histocompatibility complex, which encodes cell-surface glycoproteins that display samples of peptides from within the cell on the cell’s surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Takahata et al., 1992</xref>). Two variants of <italic>ERAP2,</italic> which too is involved in the antigen-presenting pathway, have also been maintained under balancing selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Andrés et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Klunk et al., 2022</xref>). The classic example of recent, shorter-term balancing selection in humans is the maintenance (by overdominance) of sickle-cell alleles at the β-globin locus in the regions of Africa where malaria is endemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Allison, 1954a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Allison, 1954b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hedrick, 2011</xref>). Similar reasoning applies to certain α-thalassemia alleles in parts of Southeast Asia where malaria is widespread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Qiu et al., 2013</xref>). In fact, the higher fitness of heterozygotes for thalassemia alleles in malaria-struck regions was presciently predicted by Haldane in 1949 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lederberg, 1999</xref>). In the realm of structural variants, complex copy number variation in the human salivary agglutinin genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alharbi et al., 2022</xref>), a regulatory deletion upstream of <italic>APOBEC3</italic> gene family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gokcumen et al., 2013</xref>), and a deletion spanning <italic>LCE3B</italic> and <italic>LCE3C</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pajic et al., 2016</xref>), which is associated with psoriasis, have been explicitly argued to be evolving in the human lineage under balancing selection.</p><p>So far, most systematic investigations into balancing selection in modern humans have focused primarily on genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">DeGiorgio et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Soni et al., 2022</xref>) and on single nucleotide variants (SNVs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Siewert and Voight, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bitarello et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Siewert and Voight, 2017</xref>). Additionally, some studies have focused exclusively on ‘long-term’ balancing selection wherein variants have been maintained in the human lineage since before the split from the chimpanzee clade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Leffler et al., 2013</xref>). Others have focused on short-term or population-specific balancing selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hedrick, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Qiu et al., 2013</xref>). We set out to identify potential targets of balancing selection that are structural in nature and that may not have been captured by earlier studies. Thus, we concentrate our efforts on autosomal deletion polymorphisms (&gt;50 bp) that have been maintained in the human lineage since before the split, approximately ~700,000 years ago, of anatomically modern humans (AMHs) from the lineage that led to both Neanderthals and Denisovans (henceforth, collectively referred to as archaic hominins). In this study, we will use the term ‘ancient polymorphisms’ to refer to such polymorphisms. Focusing on such ‘medium-term’ balancing selection will likely allow us to capture more potential targets than could an exclusive study of either ‘long-term’ or ‘short-term’ balancing selection. Moreover, deletions are interesting in the context of selection: since a given deletion affects more nucleotides than an SNV, if a defined genomic window is indeed of adaptive importance, deletions may have more profound functional consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Conrad et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Saitou and Gokcumen, 2020</xref>). Such functional outcomes may translate into non-trivial selection coefficients either for or against the deletion. Additionally, deletions are relatively easier to both genotype and analyze than are other structural variants, making an evolutionary analysis involving deletions tractable.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>AMH exhibits a greater proportion of ancient polymorphisms than expected under adaptive neutrality</title><p>Older polymorphisms may be more likely than newer ones to exhibit signatures associated with balancing selection because they have survived stochastic fixation or elimination for extended periods. It is, therefore, possible that a certain proportion of human polymorphisms that are older than the AMH-archaic split (~700,000 years), that is, ancient polymorphisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), have been maintained by balancing selection. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the proportion of ancient polymorphisms segregating in AMHs to a neutrally expected distribution of this proportion. If this proportion is significantly higher in the observed data than under the neutrally simulated data, and if we can reject other plausible explanations for difference, we can conclude that some of the polymorphisms older than 700,000 years may have been maintained by balancing selection.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Excess of ancient polymorphisms segregating in anatomically modern humans (AMHs).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic representation of derived ‘ancient’ variants (purple) that emerged before the AMH-archaic hominin divergence (and after hominin-chimp divergence), and have remained polymorphic in the AMH lineage.

We focused on random SNVs instead of all the SNVs in order to mitigate the biases that would be introduced due to linkage. A variant was classified as ancient if the derived allele was shared, by common descent, with at least one of the four high-coverage archaic hominin genomes (three Neanderthals and one Denisovan) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mafessoni et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Meyer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Prüfer et al., 2017</xref>). We found that the ancient SNVs make up 13.7% (3894 SNVs) of the total. Note that we removed the recurrent SNVs from our analysis using a linkage disequilibrium (LD)-based approach (see Methods). To compare the proportion of ancient SNVs against neutral expectations, we used ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hudson, 2002</xref>) to produce 2000 runs of 20,000 neutrally simulated variants in the Yoruba population (see Methods for details). Thereupon, in each run, we calculated the proportion of variants shared with archaic hominins, producing a distribution of the expected proportion of ancient polymorphisms under neutrality.</p><p>To ensure that our analysis is not biased by the idiosyncrasies of any particular model, we performed these simulations using 36 distinct models. The models vary by three parameters: N<sub>e</sub> of Yoruba/AMH, N<sub>e</sub> of archaic hominins, and the time of divergence between the AMH and the archaic hominin lineage. The N<sub>e</sub> for humans can be either constant (ranging from 10,000 to 30,000) or varying over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Speidel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

We refer to this as the ‘base model’.</p><p>Using this model, we find that the entire simulated distribution of the proportion of ancient polymorphisms lies to the left of the empirical value of 13.7% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These results hold for all other models with realistic sets of parameters. Even when we change any single parameter to unrealistic levels (e.g., either AMH-N<sub>e</sub>=30,000, or divergence time = 500 kya), we still observe an excess of ancient polymorphisms. Neutral models can explain the empirical proportion of ancient polymorphisms only when at least two parameters are tweaked in a less realistic direction (e.g., both AMH-N<sub>e</sub>=30,000 and divergence time = 500 kya). Therefore, we conclude that the high proportion (13.7%) of ancient polymorphisms cannot be explained by realistic neutral scenarios.</p><p>There is a possibility that we are observing an empirical excess of ancient polymorphisms owing to a high incidence of recurrent mutations in the AMH and archaic hominin lineages that remained undetected by the LD-based approach we used to identify them. Since CpG sites may be particularly prone to recurrent mutations, we calculated the proportion of empirical ancient polymorphisms again using only A⇄T SNVs. This analysis yielded a proportion of 14.24%, not much different from the previously calculated 13.7%. Moreover, if recurrence was the main cause of the observed excess of ancient polymorphisms, we would expect this excess (relative to the simulated distribution) to be more pronounced among polymorphisms with low derived allele frequencies. To test if this is the case, we repeated our analysis using the base model for simulations, dividing the empirical and simulated SNVs into derived allele frequency bins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We observed that the excess of ancient polymorphisms is, in fact, most pronounced at high derived allele frequency. Both these results combined suggest that our results are not biased due to undetected recurrent mutations.</p><p>Next, we consider possible non-adaptive explanations for the observed excess of ancient polymorphisms. First, we considered scenarios invoking structure in the population that was ancestral to both AMHs and archaic hominins, while allowing gene flow between the latent subgroups within the ancestral population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; see Methods for details). We found that the excess of ancient polymorphisms can be explained by structuring the ancestral population into three distinct subpopulations, such that the fraction of each subgroup formed by the migrants from each of the other subgroups, every generation, is below 0.0075% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>). However, the allele frequency spectrum for SNVs simulated with ancient population structure significantly deviates from the observed allele frequency spectrum in that the former overestimates the intermediate/common variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Therefore, invoking such structure to explain the excess of ancient polymorphisms may be unrealistic. Another possible explanation comes from the evidence of introgression from early modern human ancestors into Neanderthals to the exclusion of Denisovans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Posth et al., 2017</xref>). Such admixture can increase the apparent proportion of ancient polymorphisms due to elevated allele sharing with Neanderthals. However, we do not observe a higher proportion of derived allele sharing (by common descent) with Neanderthals than with Denisovans. In fact, the proportion of derived alleles shared with the Denisovan (9.75%) and the Altai Neanderthal (10.28%) is higher than the proportion shared with Chagyrskaya and Vindija Neanderthals (6.14% each), which is incompatible with such introgression as the prime cause of excessive ancient polymorphisms in AMHs. We note that the differential allele sharing with the Denisovan and Altai Neanderthal on one hand, and the Vindija and Chagyrskaya Neanderthal on the other would be an interesting subject for future studies.</p><p>Overall, based on our current knowledge of ancient interactions and demographic history, our analyses implicate balancing selection as a possible cause of the excess of observed ancient polymorphisms. Next, we focus on deletion polymorphisms segregating in AMHs, categorize them based on their evolutionary histories, and test whether ancient deletion polymorphisms are enriched for targets of balancing selection.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Categorizing human deletions based on their evolutionary history</title><p>Having established that AMHs exhibit an excess of ancient polymorphisms that cannot be explained solely by non-adaptive causes, we identify ancient deletion polymorphisms among AMHs. Since the vast majority of deletions in AMHs are derived relative to chimpanzees (Supplementary material), this could be accomplished by identifying AMH deletions that are shared with archaic hominins by common descent.</p><p>In this analysis, AMHs are represented by the YRI (Yoruba), CEU (Utah residents with Northern and Western European ancestry), and CHB (Han Chinese in Beijing) from 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3 dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Auton et al., 2015</xref>); and archaic hominins are represented by the four available high-coverage (~30×) archaic hominin genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mafessoni et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Meyer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Prüfer et al., 2017</xref>). Our choice of AMH populations was guided by our wish to both sample from different regions, and use relatively well-studied populations. We genotyped all AMH deletions in the archaic hominin genomes using a read depth-based pipeline (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We considered a deletion ‘shared’ if it was identified in at least one of the four archaic genomes. For our analysis, we used only the deletions with an allele-count &gt;1 in YRI, CEU, and CHB combined. Additionally, we retained only 4863 human deletion polymorphisms that are in LD (r<sup>2</sup> &gt;0.9) with at least one SNV (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). We imposed this LD requirement because SNVs in LD with the deletion can enable us to distinguish the shared deletions that are introgressed or recurrent from those that are shared by common descent.</p><p>We found that 575 (11.8%) AMH deletions were shared with archaic hominins, that is, identified in at least one archaic hominin genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

We found that the median age for ancient deletions, using Relate, is ~1 million years. About 15% (63) of these deletions are older than 2 million years. In contrast, the median age of non-ancient deletions is ~239,000 years. As such, we infer that both our genotyping pipeline and deletion categorization approach are sound. Counterintuitively, a small number of ‘ancient’ deletions have very recent dates. This may be due to instances of recent soft sweeps involving some deletions leading to an increased length of the associated haplotype and an artificial decrease in age. Second, some ancient deletions may have low frequencies, which too, creates a downward bias in age. Lastly, this may be due to miscategorization of non-ancient deletions as ancient.

Stdβ2 is a measure of balancing selection, that calculates the weighted average of the number of flanking-derived variants, where weights are the similarity in frequency between the core allele and the flanking variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Siewert and Voight, 2017</xref>).</p><p>For a conceptual understanding of Stdβ2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), suppose a deletion emerges and the resulting polymorphism is subject to balancing selection; the deletion will rise in frequency until it reaches a certain equilibrium frequency. New SNVs will emerge on the haplotypes carrying the deletion. Some of these SNVs will drift upward in frequency, but since these SNVs will be linked to the deletion, they too can only rise to the equilibrium frequency of the balanced deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Siewert and Voight, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Siewert and Voight, 2017</xref>). We refer to this type of drift as <italic>Goldilocks drift</italic>, since the linked SNVs drift upward to the ‘just-right’ equilibrium frequency of the balanced deletion. Goldilocks drift thus leads to allelic class build-up (analogous to how hitchhiking leads to sweeps), which refers to a situation involving the fixation of many flanking variants within the set of haplotypes carrying the deletion. Stdβ2 value for a core variant may be thought of as the average intensity of <italic>Goldilocks drift</italic> experienced by SNVs around it. Therefore, a high stdβ2 value for a variant implies that it is either a target of balancing selection or close to a target of balancing selection.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>An empirical assessment of putative balancing selection among ancient deletions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The conceptual framework in which stdβ2 statistic works.

These results provide empirical evidence that ancient deletion polymorphisms are enriched for targets of balancing selection. Our results are consistent with other recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Soni et al., 2022</xref>) that have argued that the role of balancing selection in explaining the maintenance of common variation in the human lineage is underappreciated.</p><p>Previous genome-wide balancing selection scans focused on either individual genes or SNVs. Consequently, we do not expect to find many ancient deletions that have previously been reported as targets of balancing selection. Nevertheless, we investigated whether the exons in any of the genes that have been reported as targets of balancing selection in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">DeGiorgio et al., 2014</xref>, or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Soni et al., 2022</xref>, overlap with ancient deletions. We found no overlaps. We also found that 77 common (&gt;5% in YRI, CEU, and CHB combined) ancient deletions were in LD (r<sup>2</sup> &gt;0.9) with SNVs that had high (in the 95th percentile) Stdβ2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Siewert and Voight, 2020</xref>) values in YRI, CEU, and CHB. This is unsurprising since this is the measure we used to show that ancient deletion polymorphisms are enriched for balancing selection targets. Interestingly, one of the ancient deletions with a high associated Stdβ2 value overlaps a candidate region for balancing selection previously identified using the non-central deviation method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bitarello et al., 2018</xref>). This 433 bp deletion (esv3607090), which is 2 million years old and common across populations, deletes part of an intron of the <italic>STK32A</italic> gene.

It follows then that any adaptively maintained ancient polymorphisms must be functional. If an appreciable proportion of ancient deletion polymorphisms have evolved under balancing selection and more recent deletion polymorphisms have not, we should expect ancient deletions to be enriched for functional effects. To avoid biases introduced by different proportions of rare variants among ancient versus non-ancient deletions, we focus only on deletion with frequency &gt;5% in AMHs. For both ancient and non-ancient deletions, we investigated (1) whether a deletion intersects exons and (2) whether any of the SNVs in LD with it are associated with UK BioBank genome-wide association studies (GWAS) traits with p&lt;10<sup>–8</sup> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nealelab.is/uk-biobank/">http://www.nealelab.is/uk-biobank/</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; see Methods).

However, when we classify a deletion as functional more conservatively, that is, it both intersects an exon and has a GWAS association (i.e., one of the SNVs in LD with it has a GWAS association), we observe a 4.2-fold enrichment (p=0.003) of functional variants among ancient deletions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). In fact, out of the 18 common deletions (frequency &gt;5%) that both intersect genes and have GWAS associations, 9 (50%) are ancient. Further, we observed a phenotypic enrichment among ancient deletions for some GWAS trait categories: a 12.5-fold enrichment (p=10<sup>–5</sup>) of traits related to inflammatory response and a 2.8-fold enrichment (p=0.003) of traits related to metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Functional enrichment among ancient deletions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Functional categorization of common deletions.

First, whole-gene deletions may affect the function of entire environment-interacting gene families. We found two ancient whole-gene deletions: esv3587563 (deleting <italic>LCE3B</italic> and <italic>LCE3C</italic>) and esv3600896 (deleting <italic>UGT2B28</italic>). The members of the <italic>LCE3</italic> and <italic>UGT2B</italic> gene families mediate immune response and steroid metabolism, respectively; genes from both families likely evolved under adaptive forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">de Guzman Strong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pajic et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Starr et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Xue et al., 2008</xref>). The functional consequence of whole-gene deletions is, of course, loss of function of the deleted genes. In addition, esv3587563 is associated with an increase in the expression of <italic>LCE3A</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">de Guzman Strong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pajic et al., 2016</xref>)<italic>,</italic> while esv3600896 is associated with an increase in the expression of <italic>UGT2B11</italic>.

For example, we found multiple ancient deletions that are proximal to the <italic>HLA</italic> locus, associated with immune-related phenotypes, and affect the expression levels of nearby genes. One such example, the deletion esv3608584, is noteworthy within the context of balancing selection because it affects the expression of different <italic>HLA</italic> genes in opposite directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). As such, this deletion may lead to increased susceptibility to some pathogens while increasing the defenses against others. Further, we observed that the ancient deletions in the <italic>HLA</italic> locus also lead to the expression of different isoforms of HLA genes. Using the GTeX database, we found at least four other instances where ancient deletions lead to the expression of different isoforms, including deletions affecting the <italic>HLA-DRB1-6, HLA-DOB, SIRPB1, GHR,</italic> and <italic>CYP3A43</italic> genes. We recently showed that the ancient deletion of the third exon of the growth hormone receptor gene leads to the expression of a smaller version of growth hormone, which may be adaptive in times of starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Saitou et al., 2021b</xref>). The <italic>SIRPB1</italic> gene encodes a glycosylated transmembrane receptor protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kharitonenkov et al., 1997</xref>), and its different isoforms may lead to the recognition of different pathogens. Similarly, <italic>CYP3A43</italic>, a member of the cytochrome p450 gene family, is involved in metabolizing external substances, and genetically determined isoforms contribute to its functional variation in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agarwal et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, ancient deletions that lead to specific isoform expression may have been adaptively evolving to adjust the function of environment-interacting genes across both geography and time. It is important to acknowledge that these non-exonic deletions may not be the causal variant in the associated haplotypes. Nevertheless, the full extent of deletion polymorphisms shaping the expression levels and sculpting the isoform diversity at the genetic level remains a fascinating area of future research.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The effect of negative selection is stronger on deletions than SNVs</title><p>Based on previous work, we expect that deletions are more likely than SNVs to be under negative selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Conrad et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kondrashov, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lin and Gokcumen, 2019</xref>). To investigate the magnitude of this effect, we compared the proportion of SNVs and deletion polymorphisms that are ancient. Applying the same bioinformatic pipeline to identify ancient polymorphisms in both cases, we found that 13.7% of SNVs and 9.6% of deletion polymorphisms are ancient in YRI. This result alone suggests that deletion polymorphisms are more likely than SNVs to be eliminated by negative selection, a trend that we expect to be more pronounced with increasing ages of polymorphisms. The greater intensity of negative selection acting on deletions implies that deletions are, in general, more deleterious than SNVs. It follows that younger (non-ancient) deletions currently segregating in human populations, which negative selection has not yet purged, are more likely to be deleterious (and perhaps disease-causing) than SNVs are (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kondrashov, 2017</xref>).</p><p>The preceding argument makes intuitive sense since a given deletion spans more bases than does an SNV. If this intuition is correct, we expect that larger deletions should, on average, experience more intense negative selection. Since most large ancient deletions would have been purged by negative selection, we expect surviving ancient deletions to be, on average, smaller than non-ancient deletions. We test this using common deletions (frequency &gt;5% in YRI, CEU, and CHB combined). Ancient deletions are indeed, on average (median), 14% shorter than non-ancient deletions (p=0.02; permutation test). Nevertheless, there is an excess of long deletions among ancient deletions relative to non-ancient deletions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). In particular, the 95th and 98th size percentiles of ancient deletions are 33% (p=0.04; permutation test) and 128% (p=0.005; permutation test) larger than non-ancient deletions, respectively (see Methods). This excess of longer deletions is inconsistent with evolution under neutrality or negative selection.

To identify the signatures of overdominance, we simulated sequence evolution under neutrality and overdominance (using a variety of selection coefficients), in turn, for variants that emerged one million years ago. We asked whether we can distinguish between neutrality and overdominance by calculating several population genetic statistics, including Tajima’s D, π, θ, etc., on sequences generated from the neutral and overdominance simulations (see Methods for full list).

In contrast, under neutrality, a random change in allele frequency in every generation produced elevated noise across time in allele frequency trajectories. To ascertain if overdominance is a common mechanism of evolution for ancient deletions, we inferred the allele frequency trajectories of ancient deletions using <italic>Relate</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Speidel et al., 2019</xref>) and quantified the variation in allele frequency between 5000 and 50,000 years ago by squaring the standardized allele frequency difference (χ<sup>2</sup>) (Methods). We already know that ancient deletions are enriched for targets of balancing selection. If a large proportion of these balancing selection targets have evolved under overdominance, we expect ancient deletions to have more stable allele frequencies across time, relative to non-ancient deletions, leading to smaller χ<sup>2</sup> values on average. However, we do not observe this trend among common (frequency &gt;5% in YRI, CEU, and CHB combined) deletions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Consequently, at least with our current resolution of allele frequency trajectory estimation, we found no evidence for overdominance being the prime mode of balancing selection operating on ancient polymorphisms in AMHs.</p><p>In fact, we observe that ancient deletion polymorphisms exhibit greater allele frequency variation than do non-ancient deletions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>; p=2 × 10<sup>–7</sup>, Wilcoxon). This suggests that a large proportion of the instances of medium-term balancing selection likely involve temporally and spatially variable selection, which lead to elevated levels of allele frequency variation over time. This is consistent with our locus-specific analyses of ancient deletion polymorphisms. For example, we recently reported that the deletion (esv3604875) of the third exon of the human growth hormone receptor gene (<italic>GHR</italic>) has evolved under temporally and geographically variable adaptive constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Saitou et al., 2021b</xref>). In fact, this deletion is in the 93rd percentile of χ<sup>2</sup> values. Ancient deletions like these are common and old, and also exhibit high population differentiation. Collectively, we argue that such adaptive maintenance of ancient, functional alleles may be due to selection constraints that vary across time and geography.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This manuscript asked whether adaptive forces have maintained ancient deletion polymorphisms in humans. We provide evidence supporting the idea that AMHs exhibit an excess of ancient polymorphisms, relative to the neutral expectation. Using simulations and empirical data, we provide evidence for the notion that balancing selection is likely a considerable force in the evolution of deletion polymorphisms. We show that when functionality is defined conservatively, ancient deletions are disproportionately functional, compared to non-ancient deletions. In fact, 50% of such functionally relevant deletions are ancient. Additionally, ancient deletions are enriched for associations related to metabolism and inflammatory response. Our results suggest that classical overdominance may not be the prime mode of balancing selection affecting the evolution of ancient deletions. Instead, geographically and temporally variable, as well as frequency-dependent selection may underlie the maintenance of ancient functional deletions. We also provide insights about the mechanisms by which a deletion could confer function: in addition to previously defined functional effects of deletions such as the loss of a gene’s function and regulation of expression levels, we highlight multiple instances where the presence of ancient deletions leads to the expression of different isoforms. Overall, our study contributes to the growing body of evidence supporting the notion that balancing selection may be an important force in the evolution of genomic variation shared among human populations. These ancient variants are an important part of our legacy as a species: something we all share.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Proportion of ancient polymorphisms in neutral simulations versus observation</title><p>We compared the proportion of ancient polymorphisms in randomly chosen YRI SNVs against the expected distribution of this proportion under neutrality. We obtained SNVs from the 1000G phase-3 vcf files (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Auton et al., 2015</xref>) for the analysis described above. Using a script written in AWK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aho et al., 1979</xref>), we subsetted the vcf files to retain only those biallelic SNVs that contained information about the ancestral/derived status of the two alleles. We used the <monospace>--keep</monospace> option in vcftools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Danecek et al., 2011</xref>) to retain individuals only from the Yoruba population. We then used the <monospace>--mac</monospace> option to retain only those SNVs for which the minor allele-count was greater than 1. The allele-count filter was used to exclude singletons which could create spurious results for the LD analysis described below. On the resulting vcf files, we used the SelectVariants tool with the <monospace>--select-random-fraction</monospace> option in GATK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Van der Auwera and O’Connor, 2020</xref>) to randomly retain 0.25% of the variants. This resulted in a set of 38,231 SNVs. Next, we investigated whether the random SNVs are in LD with any other SNVs in their vicinity. In particular, we used the <monospace>--hap-r2-positions</monospace> and <monospace>--min-r2</monospace> option in vcftools, along with the ancestral/derived status of alleles, to retain only those random SNVs wherein the derived allele was in LD (r<sup>2</sup> &gt;0.9) with the derived allele of another SNV within a 50 kb radius of the random SNV. This resulted in 28,491 SNVs. We only retained the random SNVs with variants in LD in their vicinity to rule out cases of recurrence of the SNV between AMHs and archaic hominins, as described below. There seems to be one bias that may be introduced by eliminating polymorphisms with no SNVs in LD in AMHs: this would bias our analysis to regions with low recombination rates. In these regions, we would expect higher background selection due to the Hill-Robertson effect, leading to a deflation in the proportion of ancient polymorphisms. Since we observe a larger than expected proportion of ancient polymorphisms despite this bias, we can conclude that this bias only makes our analysis more conservative.</p><p>We then inspected the 28,491 random SNVs to see whether the derived alleles are shared with any of the four high-coverage archaic genomes (Altai Neanderthal, Vindija Neanderthal, Chagyrskaya Neanderthal, and the Denisovan). We found that 4616 SNVs (16.2%) had their derived allele shared (either homo- or heterozygously) with at least one of the four archaic hominins. Since we are only interested in polymorphisms older than 700,000 years, we want to focus only on SNVs where the derived allele is shared with archaic hominins by <italic>common descent</italic>. We thus excluded the SNVs where the derived allele emerged independently (recurrence) in AMHs and archaic hominins in the following way. For each of the 4616 core SNVs with shared derived alleles in archaic hominins, we tested whether any of the derived alleles in LD with the core derived allele is also present in any of the same archaic hominins which carry the derived allele for the core SNV itself. If any of the archaic hominins contain both the derived allele of the core SNV along with at least one derived allele in LD with the derived allele of the core SNV, we classify that core SNV as ‘shared by common descent’. If any core SNV has a derived allele shared with archaic hominins but not a derived allele in LD with the core SNV, we classify the core SNV as ‘recurrent’. This approach yielded 3894 SNVs (13.7%) wherein the derived allele is shared with at least one of the archaic hominins by common descent.</p><p>In order to investigate whether this percentage (13.7%) of ancient polymorphisms (700,000 years old polymorphisms) is significantly higher than the neutral expectation, we wanted to calculate the same percentage for a set of neutrally simulated SNVs. We used the program ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hudson, 2002</xref>) to neutrally simulate a set of 20,000 (independent, and therefore freely recombining) variants 2000 times using various models. All of these models included 216 haploid genomes representing YRI (matching the YRI sample size in 1000G dataset) and 2 haploid genomes representing each of the four archaic hominins. For every model, and for each of the 2000 runs we calculated the proportion of SNVs present in the YRI with minor allele-count &gt;1 that were shared with at least one of the archaic hominins. Thereby, we obtained a distribution of the proportion of ancient polymorphisms under each of the models.</p><p>We used a total of 36 models. The models varied by three parameters: N<sub>e</sub> of Yoruba/AMH, N<sub>e</sub> of archaic hominins, and the time of divergence between the AMH and archaic hominin lineages. For 27 of these models, N<sub>e</sub> for humans was constant across time (ranging from 10,000 to 30,000 across models); for 9, it varied over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Speidel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The N<sub>e</sub> of the archaic hominin lineage was constant over time in each model ranged from 1000 to 3000 across models; and the time of divergence between AMH and archaic hominins ranges from 500 to 700 kya across models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bergström et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mafessoni et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Meyer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Prüfer et al., 2014</xref>). In the main text, we focused on the model with variable AMH-N<sub>e</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Speidel et al., 2019</xref>), using the well-accepted archaic hominin N<sub>e</sub> of 1000 and a divergence time of 700 kya; we referred to this as the ‘base model’. For each model, we assumed that Denisovans diverged from Neanderthals ~400,000 years ago, the Altai Neanderthal lineage separated from the Vindija-Chagyrskaya lineage ~130,000 years ago, and the Vindija lineage separated from the Chagyrskaya lineage ~90,000 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bergström et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gravel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mafessoni et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Meyer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Prüfer et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, the generation time was assumed to be 29 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fenner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Langergraber et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Li and Durbin, 2011</xref>).</p><p>To test if the empirical excess of ancient polymorphisms is more pronounced among low derived allele frequency variants (due to recurrence), we repeated our analysis using the base model (variable AMH N<sub>e</sub>, Archaic N<sub>e</sub> = 1000, divergence time = 700 kya) for simulations, dividing the empirical and simulated SNVs into derived allele frequency bins. To ensure there are enough variants in each frequency bin, we used a larger set of randomly chosen YRI SNVs. In particular, we used 300,000 SNVs that have a minor allele-count &gt;1 and at least one variant in LD (r<sup>2</sup> &gt;0.9) with them. Using the same method as described above, we identified the SNVs that are shared with archaic hominins by common descent. We used the base model to simulate 1500 runs of 400,000 SNVs. Thereupon, we divided the empirical and simulated SNVs into 10 derived allele frequency bins of uniform length, and compared the simulated distribution of the proportion of ancient polymorphisms with the observed proportion in each bin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, to gauge whether recurrence at CpG sites leads to the excess of ancient polymorphisms, we subsetted the 300,000 SNVs to retain only the 21,402 A⇄T SNVs, and calculated the proportion of ancient polymorphisms therein.</p><p>Additionally, we also performed another set of neutral simulations, this time with structure introduced in the population ancestral to the archaic hominins and AMHs. This too was done using Hudson’s ms. This was done using a constant size model with YRI/AMH N<sub>e</sub> = 14,474 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gravel et al., 2011</xref>), Archaic N<sub>e</sub> = 1,000, and divergence time = 700 kya. The effective population size for each of the subgroups in the population ancestral to both AMHs and archaic hominins was set to 10,000. We define m<sub>i,j</sub> as the fraction of subgroup <italic>i</italic> that is formed by the migrants of subgroup j in each generation, where i <italic>≠</italic> j and i,j ∈ {1,2,3}. For all i and j, where i <italic>≠</italic> j<italic>,</italic> we set m<sub>i,j</sub>=m. The program ms takes this parameter in the form of M=4 Nm (where N=10,000 is the effective population size of each subgroup). We performed simulations for 10,000 different values of M chosen uniformly on the log scale from the range (0.01,100). This is akin to running simulations using 10,000 different values of m in the range (0.25×10<sup>–7</sup>, 0.25×10<sup>–2</sup>). For each m, 1000 variants were simulated. Thus, for each m, we calculated the percentage of variants in Yoruba (with allele-count &gt;1) wherein the derived allele was shared with the archaic hominins. The proportion of allele-sharing in simulations equaled or exceeded the proportion (13.7%) observed in real-life at approximately m≤0.0075%.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Identifying deletions in archaic genomes</title><p>The identification of deletions in archaic hominins was predicated on the concept that a deletion in an archaic hominin would correspond to a low read depth in the window of deletion in the hominin’s genome. We started with two main types of input files: (1) The VCF file for the 1000 Genomes Phase 3 dataset and (2) a BAM file for each high-coverage archaic hominin.</p><p>The 1000G phase-3 VCF file was obtained from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.internationalgenome.org/data">https://www.internationalgenome.org/data</ext-link>. This includes 84.4 million variants from 2504 individuals across 26 populations. The file was then converted to a BED file (with three tab-separated columns representing chromosome numbers, start positions, and end positions of deletions) using a script written in AWK. This VCF file was filtered to retain only biallelic autosomal deletions. This amounted to 32,154 deletions. We genotyped all these deletions in the four high-coverage archaic hominin genomes. (Note that in the main text, we focused only on 4863 deletions with both allele-count &gt;1 in YRI, CEU, and CHB combined, and at least one SNV in LD.)</p><p>The sequence files for archaic genomes mapped to hg19 were obtained from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.eva.mpg.de/genetics/genome-projects.html?Fsize=0%2C%252%27A%3D0">https://www.eva.mpg.de/genetics/genome-projects.html?Fsize=0%2C%252%27A%3D0</ext-link>. These BAM files containing mapping information (such as the start and end coordinates of the part of the genome to which a read maps) were converted to BED files. This was done using the bamToBed command in the bedtools module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</xref>). We then used the two types of BED files to count the number of reads for each archaic genome that mapped to a region of the genome that is polymorphically deleted in AMHs. In order to achieve this, we used the intersectBed command with the -c option within the bedtools module. This command counts the number of reads in an archaic genome that intersects with the region of the genome harboring a deletion polymorphism in AMHs.</p><p>Next, for every archaic genome, we normalized the number of reads at each window of deletion by the size of the window.<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">N</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">m</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">z</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">d</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">R</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">d</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">D</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">h</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">#</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">f</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">d</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">g</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">h</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">w</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">d</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">w</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">f</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">d</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">S</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">z</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">f</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">h</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">w</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">d</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">w</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">f</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">d</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>For each archaic genome, we wanted to calculate the Z-scores of the normalized read depths across all windows of deletion, and classify a window as a deletion if the normalized read depth was below a certain threshold.

We thus eliminated 92 deletions that were likely introgressed from archaic hominins into AMHs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Age of deletions and allele frequency trajectories</title><p>We estimate the ages of the deletions in the <italic>deletion dataset</italic> using two methods: (1) Human Genome Dating database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://human.genome.dating/download/index">https://human.genome.dating/download/index</ext-link>) and (2) Relate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Speidel et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The Human Genome Dating database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://human.genome.dating/download/index">https://human.genome.dating/download/index</ext-link>) hosts age estimates for over 45 million SNVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Albers and McVean, 2020</xref>). This database reports multiple age estimates for each SNV. We used the median age estimate calculated using the joint clock. Since this database only includes age estimates for SNVs (and not for deletions), we could only date a deletion if the dating database contained the age estimate for at least one of the variants in LD (r<sup>2</sup> &gt;0.9) with the deletion. If age estimates were available for only one variant in LD, the same age estimate was assigned to the deletion. If age estimates were available for more than one variant in LD with the deletion, we used the highest age estimate, which may be inaccurate in certain cases.</p><p>Relate is a method that estimates genome-wide genealogies and can be used to infer the age of a variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Speidel et al., 2019</xref>). We used Relate to infer the ages of the deletions in the <italic>deletion dataset</italic>. To this end, we used previously inferred genome-wide genealogies for samples of the SGDP dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mallick et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Speidel et al., 2021</xref>), available from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/2gjyxe3kqzh932o/AAAQcipCHnySgEB873t9EQjNa?dl=0">https://www.dropbox.com/sh/2gjyxe3kqzh932o/AAAQcipCHnySgEB873t9EQjNa?dl=0</ext-link>. For each deletion, we used SNVs in LD where the derived allele was tagging the deletion at an r<sup>2</sup> exceeding 0.9 and calculated the mean age of such SNVs to date each deletion.</p><p>To quantify allele frequency variation, we computed the ratio of lineages carrying the derived allele by the total number of lineages remaining at 5000 years and 50,000 years before present, but only if the number of lineages remaining at 50,000 years exceeded 10% of the present-day sample size. We then standardized the allele frequency change stratified by present-day allele frequency, by calculating the mean and standard deviation given present-day frequency. Finally, we squared this standardized allele frequency change to obtain our statistic χ<sup>2</sup>, which is expected to have a Chi-squared distribution with one degree of freedom under neutrality, and smaller values for more stable trajectories. This approach was inspired by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Edge and Coop, 2019</xref><italic>,</italic> who used a similar approach to quantify polygenic positive selection using genealogies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Beta measure</title><p>We used a recent and robust measure of balancing selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Siewert and Voight, 2017</xref>), stdβ2, to investigate whether ancient deletion are enriched for targets of balancing selection. A high stdβ2 for a variant is indicative of balancing selection.</p><p>In our study, we estimated stdβ2 for the deletions in the deletion dataset using SNVs in LD with them. We did this for the CEU, CHB, and YRI population separately. The stdβ2 scores for SNVs are publicly available (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/ksiewert/BetaScan">https://github.com/ksiewert/BetaScan</ext-link>, copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/swh:1:dir:0836fc75c28effd499255a98b19752137ed44e55;origin=https://github.com/ksiewert/BetaScan;visit=swh:1:snp:21660ff2c85b893f66727d4a25b79f441a695aaf;anchor=swh:1:rev:8ade55c13fa5e21bb858bbe9078e0c67af519a77">swh:1:rev:8ade55c13fa5e21bb858bbe9078e0c67af519a77</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Siewert-Rocks, 2023</xref>) for the CEU, CHB, and YRI populations. For each deletion in each of these populations, we obtained the stdβ2 values for variants in LD with deletions whenever they were available. For a given deletion, when the stdβ2 values were available for more than one variant in LD with the deletion, we used two approaches to estimate the stdβ2 for the deletions. In the first approach, we used the highest stdβ2 among the LD variants as the estimate for the stdβ2 for the deletion. We call this BETAMAX. In the second approach, we focused on the stdβ2 values for the SNVs that were in LD with the deletion with the highest r<sup>2</sup> value. If multiple SNVs were in LD with the deletion with the highest r<sup>2</sup> value, we used the stdβ2 value of the SNV that was closest to the deletion among these SNVs as the estimate for stdβ2 for the deletion. We call this BETAPRIME. We performed this process for YRI, CEU, and CHB populations separately to arrive at stdβ2 estimates for deletions in our deletion dataset in each of these three populations. Using both BETAMAX and BETAPRIME gave us similar trends across populations. These values are available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Ascribing phenotypic relevance to deletion</title><p>We used two criteria to ascribe phenotypic relevance to deletions: (1) intersection of the deletion with at least one exon and (2) association of an SNV in LD with the deletion with a GWAS trait.</p><p>In order to identify deletions that intersect with exons, we started with the genome annotation file download from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://hgdownload-test.gi.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/bigZips/genes/hg19.refGene.gtf.gz">https://hgdownload-test.gi.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/bigZips/genes/hg19.refGene.gtf.gz</ext-link>. Using an AWK script, this GTF file was then converted to a BED file containing five columns: (1) annotation’s chromosome number; (2) annotation’s start position; (3) annotation’s end position; (4) gene name; and (5) type of feature. Only the rows wherein the type of feature was ‘exon’ and the chromosome number was between 1 and 22 were retained. All repeated entries (rows) were eliminated. The resulting file contained only columns (1) to column (4). We then used a BED file containing information about the AMH deletions in our deletion dataset and the BED file mentioned above to identify deletions spanning exons. This was done using the intersectBed option with -wa and -wb flags in the BEDtools module. On the resulting file, we used the groupby tool with the ‘-o freqdesc’ flag in the BEDtools module in order to obtain a file containing the names of the genes (and the number of exons within each intersecting gene) that overlap the deletions; 243 (5%) of the 4863 deletions in the deletion dataset were exonic.</p><p>The second method to ascribe phenotypic relevance to deletions was to use results from previously published GWAS. We used a publicly available catalog of GWAS results based on the UK BioBank data (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nealelab.is/uk-biobank/">http://www.nealelab.is/uk-biobank/</ext-link>). In particular, we used data for 4113 traits. For each trait, we used data that produced results using both sexes. For continuous traits, we used the raw version of the data, as opposed to the inverse rank normalized version. For each trait, only those SNVs were retained that were associated with the phenotype with a p-value less than 10<sup>–8</sup>. We are making available a consolidated table with all statistically significant associations from this dataset (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Table_S3_for_Aqil_et_al_2022/19606192">https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Table_S3_for_Aqil_et_al_2022/19606192</ext-link>). We hope this will make it easier for the scientific community to use GWAS results than the currently available datasets which store associations with each trait in a different table. Then, for each of the 4863 deletions in our deletion dataset, we checked if any of the SNVs in LD were among the SNVs that were significantly (p&lt;10<sup>–8</sup>) associated with a phenotype. We then obtained the phenotype that was associated with one of the SNVs in LD with the lowest p-value, and ascribed it to the deletion. Thus, 433 (8.9%) of the 4863 deletions in the deletion dataset had phenotypic associations.</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>Enrichment analysis for ancient deletions</title><p>We performed enrichment analyses for phenotypic relevance and length among ancient deletions using variants with a pooled frequency &gt;5% in YRI, CEU, and CHB combined. First, we investigate whether a higher proportion of ancient deletions, relative to non-ancient deletions, have phenotypic relevance. To this end, we defined phenotypic relevance in three ways: (1) GWAS association, (2) exonic overlap, and (3) both GWAS association and exonic overlap. For each definition, we first calculated the observed proportions of phenotypic deletions among both ancient and non-ancient categories in turn. Then, we shuffled the ‘ancient’ and ‘non-ancient’ labels among the deletions in 10,000 permutations, calculating the proportion of phenotypic deletions among both ancient and non-ancient labels for each permutation. Using the number of permutations in which the difference in proportions of phenotypic deletions was more extreme than the difference in observed proportions, we obtained an empirical p-value for phenotypic enrichment among ancient deletions.</p><p>We also investigated whether certain phenotypic categories are overrepresented in ancient deletions relative to non-ancient deletions. For this, we used the UK BioBank traits associated with the deletions. In total, 1675 traits were associated with the deletions in the deletion dataset. We manually placed each of these traits into 1 of 18 categories such that any deletion could be associated with one or more phenotypic categories (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Only deletions with a pooled frequency &gt;5% in YRI, CEU, and CHB combined were retained for analysis. For each phenotypic category, we obtained the proportion of deletions associated with that category among ancient and non-ancient deletions. We then shuffled the ‘ancient’ and ‘non-ancient’ labels in 10,000 permutations. Just as above, we used the number of permutations in which the difference in proportions of deletions associated with a phenotypic category was more extreme than the difference in observed proportions, and we obtained an empirical p-value.</p><p>Now, we turn to length enrichment. We calculated the 2nd, 5th, 10th, 20th, 30th, 40th, 50th, 60th, 70th, 80th, 90th, 95th, and 98th length percentiles for deletions in ancient and non-ancient categories. We calculated the differences in corresponding percentiles in ancient and non-ancient deletions. Again, we shuffled the ‘ancient’ and ‘non-ancient’ labels into 10,000 random permutations, calculating the differences in corresponding percentiles in ancient versus non-ancient deletions for each permutation. This gave us empirical p-values for differences in the length of ancient and non-ancient deletions at various percentiles.</p></sec><sec id="s3-9"><title>Simulations to identify signatures of overdominance</title><p>We set out to identify signatures associated with a locus that has evolved under overdominance.</p><p>Methodologically, we approached the problem of separating overdominance from neutrality on two fronts: (1) the trajectory of the allele frequency of the mutation conditioning on the age of the mutation, and (2) the patterns of neutral polymorphisms around the so-called focal mutation which has evolved either under overdominance or neutrally (with the same age of the mutation). Given that a mutation under overdominance (heterozygote advantage) may be at intermediate frequency, we also (3) studied simple coalescent simulations conditioning on the existence of at least one SNV within a certain frequency range (e.g., 50–60%). The age of a mutation is crucial for the study of balancing selection. We considered two values for the age of a mutation: (1) 10,000 generation and (2) 40,000 generations old. In the first case, the age of the mutation corresponds to 10,000×29 years=290,000 years old mutation. In the second case, the mutation is 1,160,000 years old. Conditioning on the age of the mutation, we generated allele frequency trajectories of the mutation, that is, the frequency of the mutation at each time point from its onset until the present day. For the overdominance scenario, we used the software <italic>trajdemognpops,</italic> implemented using tools from ms and <italic>mssel</italic> (kindly provided by RR Hudson), to generate trajectories of a mutation under overdominance. The dominance coefficient is characterized by a large value (here, h=10) in order to assign a benefit for the heterozygote. Thus, the fitness for genotypes at a biallelic locus is by:</p><p>Aa: (1+sh), where s is the selection coefficient and h the dominance coefficient. Here, s<italic>=</italic>0.005 and h=10, that is, the heterozygote Aa has a fitness value 1.05. If we had considered codominance (as opposed to overdominance), we would have set h=0.5.</p><p>AA: 1+s, thus, the fitness for the AA is 1.005 <bold>aa</bold>: 1.</p><p>Given the trajectory of a mutation, a population is split into two kinds of genotypes. The haplotypes carrying the mutation (or the derived allele) and the haplotypes that carry the ancestral allele. Each <italic>neutral</italic> (i.e., passenger mutation) can change ‘population’ (genetic background) by recombination. Therefore, the coalescent in this case is described as a structured coalescent of two populations (a population with the derived allele and another population with the ancestral allele) that communicate between themselves via recombination. The size of each population is determined at each time point by the trajectory of the derived allele.</p><p>In order to understand the effect of the age of the allele (and also to test the mssel code for correctness), we performed coalescent simulations (using Hudson’s ms) conditioning on the presence of at least one SNV at frequency within a given range. Since we are interested in the mutations that are approximately at 50% frequency in the population, we conditioned on the presence of derived mutations in the sample in 22–28 (out of 50) haplotypes. This set of simulations are called <italic>pseCoal</italic>. For each simulated dataset, we calculated the relevant population genetics statistics available through Comus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Papadantonakis et al., 2016</xref>) including number of segregating sites, θ, π, Tajima’s D, ZnS, Fay, and Wu’s H, dvk, and dvh. Then, we conducted a summary of all these statistics using PCA. The goal is to understand whether the different scenarios can get separated by using polymorphic patterns.</p></sec><sec id="s3-10"><title>Conceptual and methodological concerns</title><sec id="s3-10-1"><title>Human polymorphisms wherein derived allele is shared with archaic hominins are older than 700,000 years</title><p>AMHs and archaic hominins are estimated to have diverged around ~700,000 years ago. Therefore, if a human polymorphism has been maintained for more than ~700,000 years, it was also present in the common ancestral population of AMH and archaic lineages. It follows that if a polymorphism (the presence of both ancestral and derived alleles in a population) is present in AMHs and archaic hominins, then (barring recurrence and introgression), by parsimony, the polymorphism was also present in their common ancestral population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Thus, a polymorphism that is shared by common descent between AMHs and archaic hominins has been maintained for over ~700,000 years. Moreover, because the ancestral allele is fixed in chimpanzees by definition, AMH polymorphisms wherein the derived allele is fixed in archaic hominins were also present (in the polymorphic state) in the common ancestral population of archaic hominins and AMHs. In essence, AMH polymorphisms for which archaic hominins carry the derived allele (fixed or polymorphic) have been maintained for more than 700,000 years.</p><p>Why use SNVs (as opposed to deletion polymorphisms) for comparison of the real-life proportion of ancient polymorphisms against neutrally simulated SNVs.</p><p>It is worth explaining why we used SNVs, instead of deletions – the class of variants that we are interested in – for comparing observed versus simulated (under neutral conditions) proportions of ancient polymorphisms. Deletions are not suitable for such a comparison because, in general, they are targets of strong negative selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Conrad et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kondrashov, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lin and Gokcumen, 2019</xref>). Thus, negative selection would have purged a large proportion of deletions that emerged in the common ancestral population of AMHs and archaic hominins. It follows that a smaller proportion of AMH polymorphic deletions than expected under neutral conditions will be shared by common descent with archaic hominins. Even if balancing selection were inflating the proportion of deletions that are shared with archaic hominins, it would not be observable due to the opposite deflationary effect of negative selection. Since negative selection is not as strong a force in the evolution of SNVs as it is for deletions, this problem would not be as pronounced if we used SNVs instead of deletions for testing this premise. Hence, our choice of SNVs for this analysis. In the main text, we have expanded on the idea that deletions are targets of stronger negative selection.</p></sec><sec id="s3-10-2"><title>The vast majority of human deletions are derived relative to chimpanzees</title><p>In order to identify deletion polymorphisms that have been maintained in the human lineage for over 700,000 years, we focused on deletions that were present (either polymorphically or fixed) in the four high-coverage archaic genomes. This technique would work only for deletions that were derived in humans, relative to chimps. However, variants that have been called as deletions (wherein deletion is the alternative allele) in the 1000 Genomes Project may, in fact, be human-specific insertions, such that the reference allele (non-deletion) is derived. To investigate how common this situation is among the 4863 deletions in our dataset, we lifted over the the coordinates of the deletions from hg19 on to the Chimpanzee reference panTro3 using the LiftOver tool in UCSC Genome Browser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kent et al., 2002</xref>). If the liftover for a deletion fails on account of the window being completely or partially deleted in the Chimpanzee reference, it is indicative of the region being a human-specific insertion. The liftover failed for this reason for only 184 (3.8%) of the 4863 deletions. Therefore, the vast majority of deletions are, in fact, derived relative to chimps.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3-11"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated can be found in the supplementary files.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Both reviewers agree that this paper is interesting and should warrant publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, assuming that the authors can perform the following essential revisions, which are laid out in more detail in the individual reviews:</p><p>1. Show that the results a robust to variation of the neutral demographic model used. In particular, the departure presented in Figure 1B might depend critically on the specific population sizes chosen both in modern and in archaic humans. The authors should repeat their simulations while varying these population sizes.</p><p>2. Please provide some estimation of the fraction of deletions that are truly novel balancing selection loci as opposed to simply being linked to balancing selection loci already identified through linked SNVs in the cited scans.</p><p>3. Please provide some more justification/assessment for the classification of the shared polymorphisms as recurrent, recently introgressed, or ancient shared by descent and the use of SNPs with r2 &gt; 0.9.</p><p>4. If the authors can show that there is statistical enrichment of functional deletions among the ancient set, that would strengthen the conclusion and their &quot;27%&quot; statement in the abstract.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The reasons why the authors use a random subset of variants to measure allele sharing instead of using all SNV variants available are very important and needs to be extensively explained in the main text. Is it to avoid the confounding effect of linkage blocs?</p><p>The authors already have the Relate allele age estimates. In addition to allele sharing, the authors could also compare the distribution of ages of shared alleles under the neutral simulations with those observed in the genome.</p><p>It would be great to have Figure 1B and its distributions of allele sharing, but multiple times, each time for a separate bin of derived allele frequencies, for example 0-0.05, 0.05-0.1, 0.1-0.2, 0.2-0.3,…..0.8-0.9, 0.9-0.95, 0.95-1. Even if the authors mention that simple overdominance does not seem to explain the results, it is important to be able to check that the excess of shared alleles is not concentrated on low minor allele frequencies.</p><p>The use of human-specific as in Figure 2 is erroneous. Every Homo is human. The authors should use modern human-specific.</p><p>In figure 4 the x-axis should be labeled stbeta2, not just β.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Regarding the classification of the shared variants as recurrent, ancient shared by descent, and recently introgressed:</p><p>– In the SNP analysis, were CpG polymorphisms included? Usually these need to be carefully considered as they are more likely to be recurrent mutations. Is this proportion still elevated among the ancient set, and is there still an excess of ancient polymorphisms if CpG sites are excluded from both dataset and simulations?</p><p>– Perhaps the first issue, and eliminating recurrent events more generally, is resolved by using the LD criteria. However, this is not directly addressed by the authors but rather assumed to be the case. The polymorphisms are considered ancient when there is the same SNP in high LD (r2 &gt; 0.9) in both modern human and archaic genomes. How good is this at differentiating ancient from recurrent cases? I.e., how often do you expect to have a SNP in this LD in both populations if recurrent? How often do you expect not to have a SNP in LD if shared by descent? Why was 0.9 chosen? If the deletions are truly shared by descent, they should have the same breakpoints – was this always the case to the resolution that could be assessed?</p><p>2. The selection of variants by looking only at YRI, CEU, and CHB seems odd, both because CHB has ~ half the sample size of the other populations and it seems that any/all populations could be used. If there is a reason for this, it would be good to include it.</p><p>3. The authors suggest that requiring a SNP to be in high LD (r2&gt;0.9) with the deletions does not introduce any bias in the proportion shared by common descent. One concern could be that this would bias towards regions of low recombination, although I'm not sure what effect that would have on either proportion shared by common descent or recurrent mutation, though the effects of background selection might be greater. The authors could test whether there is a bias to regions of low recombination and if so how that could affect the analysis. Is there any effect on the length of the deletions (and more generally, what is the distribution of lengths of these deletions in the three classes)?</p><p>4. Along these same lines, it is not stated in the main text (unless I missed it) but the detail is relevant that the ages are for the SNP in LD, not the deletion itself. It should be clearer that this is being used as a proxy (not just in methods) and also some indication of how close these age estimates are expected to be with r2=0.9.</p><p>Writing comments</p><p>5. An explanation of what &quot;sharing with archaics&quot; means was lacking in the main text – it is only late in the methods that it says the four genomes are 3 Neandertals and 1 Denisovan genome, and whether this sharing had to be with all or any of them, heterozygous or homozygous, to be considered as shared. Given how key this is to understanding what the set of variants analysed consists of, I think it needs to be briefly stated when the dataset is introduced in the results.</p><p>6. The methods are also in a very different order than the results are presented (e.g., simulations for the non-synonymous variants are first in the results but late in the methods, association with biobank phenotypes is early in the methods but late in the results). It would help the reader and the flow if these could be more aligned (I realize that is not always strictly sensible).</p><p>7. Sometimes &quot;linkage&quot; or &quot;linked&quot; is used when it should be &quot;linkage disequilibrium&quot;, e.g., &quot;we imposed this linkage requirement&quot; and in the table README, but LD is what is meant.</p><p>8. Happened to notice typo in last line of p. 18 ('classified as phenotypically insignificant').</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79111.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Both reviewers agree that this paper is interesting and should warrant publication in eLife, assuming that the authors can perform the following essential revisions, which are laid out in more detail in the individual reviews:</p><p>1.

To address this as comprehensively as possible, we have now generated additional simulations with varying parameters, as suggested by the reviewers. We found no realistic neutral scenarios that explain the excess allele sharing that we observed. We now reconstructed Figure 1 based on these findings and described them as follows in the Results section:</p><p>“To ensure that our analysis is not biased by the idiosyncrasies of any particular model, we performed these simulations using 36 distinct models. The models vary by three parameters: N<sub>e</sub> of Yoruba/AMH, N<sub>e</sub> of archaic hominins, and the time of divergence between the AMH and the archaic hominin lineage. The N<sub>e</sub> for humans can be either constant (ranging from 10,000 to 30,000) or varying over time (Speidel et al. 2019) (Figure 1B). N<sub>e</sub> of archaic hominins ranges from 1,000 to 3,000; and the divergence time ranges from 500 to 700 kya (Bergström et al., 2021; Mafessoni et al., 2020; Meyer et al., 2012; Prüfer et al., 2014). In the main text, we focus on the model with variable AMH-N<sub>e</sub> (Speidel et al. 2019), using the well-accepted archaic hominin N<sub>e</sub> of 1,000 and a divergence time of 700 kya. We refer to this as the “base model”.</p><p>Using this model, we find that the entire simulated distribution of the proportion of ancient polymorphisms lies to the left of the empirical value of 13.7% (Figure 1C). These results hold for all other models with realistic sets of parameters. Even when we change any single parameter to unrealistic levels (e.g., either AMH-N<sub>e</sub> = 30,000, or divergence time = 500 kya), we still observe an excess of ancient polymorphisms. Neutral models can explain the empirical proportion of ancient polymorphisms only when at least two parameters are tweaked in a less realistic direction (e.g., both AMH-N<sub>e</sub> = 30,000 and divergence time = 500 kya). Therefore, we conclude that the high proportion (13.7%) of ancient polymorphisms cannot be explained by realistic neutral scenarios.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Please provide some estimation of the fraction of deletions that are truly novel balancing selection loci as opposed to simply being linked to balancing selection loci already identified through linked SNVs in the cited scans.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on this suggestion, we have compared the haplotypes that harbor ancient deletions and previous balancing selection datasets and found that virtually all of our candidate deletions are novel. We described this analysis in a paragraph:</p><p><bold>“</bold>Previous genome-wide balancing selection scans focused on either individual genes or single nucleotide variants (SNVs). Consequently, we do not expect to find many ancient deletions that have previously been reported as targets of balancing selection. Nevertheless, we investigated whether the exons in any of the genes that have been reported as targets of balancing selection in DeGiorgio et al. (2014) or Soni et al. (2022) overlap with ancient deletions. We found no overlaps. We also found that 77 common (&gt;5%) ancient deletions were linked (r2&gt;0.9) to SNVs that had high (in the 95th percentile) Std<italic>β</italic>2 (Siewert and Voight 2020) values in YRI, CEU, and CHB. This is unsurprising since this is the measure we used to show that ancient deletion polymorphisms are enriched for balancing selection targets. Interestingly, one of the ancient deletions with a high associated Std<italic>β</italic>2 value overlaps a candidate region for balancing selection previously identified using the non-central deviation (<italic>NCD</italic>) method (Bitarello et al. 2018). This 433 bp deletion (esv3607090), which is 2 million years old and common across populations, deletes part of an intron of the <italic>STK32A</italic> gene. This could be an interesting subject for future studies. Regardless, a vast majority of common ancient deletions (73%) were not reported previously as balancing selection candidates and thus are novel targets for future studies.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Please provide some more justification/assessment for the classification of the shared polymorphisms as recurrent, recently introgressed, or ancient shared by descent and the use of SNPs with r2 &gt; 0.9.</p></disp-quote><p>We used r<sup>2</sup> = 0.9 as an arbitrary but conservative threshold regarding the recurrent variants. Specifically, the higher the r<sup>2</sup> threshold, the lower the chances of us categorizing a recurrent variant as an ancient one. Given that this is a crucial issue and a major point raised by the reviewers, we conducted additional analyses considering CpG sites and allele frequency spectra to ensure that recurrent mutations do not bias our results. We described these new analyses in the Results section as follows:</p><p>“There is a remote possibility that we are observing an empirical excess of ancient polymorphisms owing to a high incidence of recurrent mutations in the AMH and archaic hominin lineages that remained undetected by the linkage-disequilibrium-based approach we used to identify them. Since CpG sites may be particularly prone to recurrent mutations, we calculated the proportion of empirical ancient polymorphisms again using only A<sub>⇄</sub>T SNVs. This analysis yielded a proportion of 14.24%, not much different from the previously calculated 13.7%. Moreover, if recurrence was the main cause of the observed excess of ancient polymorphisms, we would expect this excess (relative to the simulated distribution) to be more pronounced among polymorphisms with low derived allele frequencies. To test if this is the case, we repeated our analysis using the base model for simulations, dividing the empirical and simulated SNVs into derived allele frequency bins (Figure S1). We observed that the excess of ancient polymorphisms is, in fact, most pronounced at high derived allele frequency. Both these results combined suggest that our results are not biased due to undetected recurrent mutations.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. If the authors can show that there is statistical enrichment of functional deletions among the ancient set, that would strengthen the conclusion and their &quot;27%&quot; statement in the abstract.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment (and the related comments in individual reviews) because it helped us to acquire novel and meaningful results, improving our understanding of these deletions substantially. We described these findings in a new section and figures. We added a new section describing these results. It reads:</p><p>“We did not observe a significant increase in either the proportion of exonic (ancient=5.6%; non-ancient=3.6%) or GWAS-associated (ancient=19.1%; non-ancient=16.4%) ancient deletion, relative to non-ancient deletions (Figure 5B). However, when we classify a deletion as functional more conservatively, <italic>i.e.,</italic> it both intersects an exon and has a GWAS association (<italic>i.e.,</italic> one of the SNVs linked to it has a GWAS association), we observe a 4.2-fold enrichment (p=0.003) of functional variants among ancient deletions (Figure 5B). In fact, out of the 18 common deletions (frequency&gt;5%) that both intersect genes and have GWAS associations, 9 (50%) are ancient. Further, we observed a phenotypic enrichment among ancient deletions for some GWAS trait categories: a 12.5-fold enrichment (p=10<sup>-5</sup>) of traits related to inflammatory response and a 2.8-fold enrichment (p=0.003) of traits related to metabolism (Figure 5C).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The reasons why the authors use a random subset of variants to measure allele sharing instead of using all SNV variants available are very important and needs to be extensively explained in the main text. Is it to avoid the confounding effect of linkage blocs?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes. The reviewer is completely right that we tried to avoid linkage blocks. We now explicitly state that in the main text as follows:</p><p>“We focused on random SNVs instead of all the SNVs in order to mitigate the biases that would be introduced due to linkage.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors already have the Relate allele age estimates. In addition to allele sharing, the authors could also compare the distribution of ages of shared alleles under the neutral simulations with those observed in the genome.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good suggestion. However, since our simulation framework for this study is ms-based, where we essentially simulated allele frequencies across different lineages. Thus, we were not able to use haplotype-based measures of age. Having said that, as discussed in the next response, we conducted a more thorough analysis of allele frequency distributions, which are correlated with the age of the allele, between simulated and empirical data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be great to have Figure 1B and its distributions of allele sharing, but multiple times, each time for a separate bin of derived allele frequencies, for example 0-0.05, 0.05-0.1, 0.1-0.2, 0.2-0.3,…..0.8-0.9, 0.9-0.95, 0.95-1. Even if the authors mention that simple overdominance does not seem to explain the results, it is important to be able to check that the excess of shared alleles is not concentrated on low minor allele frequencies.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this suggestion. We conducted this analysis, and concordant with our expectations, we observed that the excess allele sharing is much stronger among common alleles as compared to rare alleles. We also did not observe an enrichment of sharing among intermediate allele frequency alleles.

Regarding the classification of the shared variants as recurrent, ancient shared by descent, and recently introgressed:</p><p>– In the SNP analysis, were CpG polymorphisms included? Usually these need to be carefully considered as they are more likely to be recurrent mutations. Is this proportion still elevated among the ancient set, and is there still an excess of ancient polymorphisms if CpG sites are excluded from both dataset and simulations?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point. We now tested this and added this to our Results:</p><p>“Since CpG sites may be particularly prone to recurrent mutations, we calculated the proportion of empirical ancient polymorphisms again using only A<sub>⇄</sub>T SNVs. This analysis yielded a proportion of 14.24%, not much different from the previously calculated 13.7%.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Perhaps the first issue, and eliminating recurrent events more generally, is resolved by using the LD criteria. However, this is not directly addressed by the authors but rather assumed to be the case. The polymorphisms are considered ancient when there is the same SNP in high LD (r2 &gt; 0.9) in both modern human and archaic genomes. How good is this at differentiating ancient from recurrent cases? I.e., how often do you expect to have a SNP in this LD in both populations if recurrent? How often do you expect not to have a SNP in LD if shared by descent? Why was 0.9 chosen? If the deletions are truly shared by descent, they should have the same breakpoints – was this always the case to the resolution that could be assessed?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that these are important issues. To address these concerns, we conducted additional analysis on recurrence as described in the Results section (please refer to our response to the general reviews). Briefly, we expect recurrent mutations to have lower allele frequencies. We found an opposing trend among ancient deletions (Figure S1). We also repeated our pipeline while ignoring the CpG sites, which are more prone to recurrence, and found similar results. In addition, we conducted our analysis with perfect LD (R<sup>2</sup>=1) and showed that our results remain nearly identical (results not shown). We refrained from breakpoint analysis, even though it may be informative because the breakpoint resolution is very poor in the fragmented short reads of ancient genomes. Overall, these additional analyses boosted our confidence that our pipeline to filter recurrent deletions are robust.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The selection of variants by looking only at YRI, CEU, and CHB seems odd, both because CHB has ~ half the sample size of the other populations and it seems that any/all populations could be used. If there is a reason for this, it would be good to include it.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right that we could have used other populations. However, the populations that we selected have been historically well described, and detailed parameters for their demographic histories are available. The CHB (n=103) has a similar sample size to YRI (n=108) and CEU (n=99) in our analysis. We now added the sample size from these populations in the Methods to clarify this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors suggest that requiring a SNP to be in high LD (r2&gt;0.9) with the deletions does not introduce any bias in the proportion shared by common descent. One concern could be that this would bias towards regions of low recombination, although I'm not sure what effect that would have on either proportion shared by common descent or recurrent mutation, though the effects of background selection might be greater. The authors could test whether there is a bias to regions of low recombination and if so how that could affect the analysis. Is there any effect on the length of the deletions (and more generally, what is the distribution of lengths of these deletions in the three classes)?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We now considered recombination more carefully and added the following to our Methods section:</p><p>“There seems to be one bias that may be introduced by eliminating polymorphisms with no SNVs in LD in AMHs: this would bias our analysis to regions with low recombination rates. In these regions, we would expect higher background selection due to the Hill-Robertson effect, leading to a deflation in the proportion of ancient polymorphisms. Since we observe a larger than expected proportion of ancient polymorphisms despite this bias, we can conclude that this bias only makes our analysis more conservative.”</p><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion on size distribution analysis, which now leads to novel insights. Specifically, we now described our results as follows in the manuscript:</p><p>“…we expect that larger deletions should, on average, experience more intense negative selection. Since most large ancient deletions would have been purged by negative selection, we expect surviving ancient deletions to be, on average, smaller than non-ancient deletions. We test this using common deletions (frequency &gt; 5% in YRI, CEU, and CHB combined). Ancient deletions are indeed 14% shorter than non-ancient deletions (p=0.02; permutation test). Nevertheless, there is an excess of long deletions among ancient deletions relative to non-ancient deletions (Figure 7A). In particular, the 95th and 98th size percentiles of ancient deletions are 33% (p=0.04; permutation test) and 128% (p=0.005; permutation test) larger than non-ancient deletions, respectively (see Methods). This excess of longer deletions is inconsistent with evolution under neutrality or negative selection. Therefore, the longest 5% of ancient deletions are excellent targets for future studies of balancing selection. In fact, 3 out of the 9 GWAS-associated common exonic deletions intersecting <italic>SIRPB1</italic>, <italic>LCE3A</italic>, <italic>LCE3B</italic>, and <italic>UGT2B28</italic> are in the 95th percentile of the size distribution of ancient deletions.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Along these same lines, it is not stated in the main text (unless I missed it) but the detail is relevant that the ages are for the SNP in LD, not the deletion itself. It should be clearer that this is being used as a proxy (not just in methods) and also some indication of how close these age estimates are expected to be with r2=0.9.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right. We now state this in the Results sections as follows:</p><p>“To confirm that our pipeline for identifying ancient deletions has high accuracy, we estimated the ages of the deletions, based on the ages of SNVs in LD.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Writing comments</p><p>5. An explanation of what &quot;sharing with archaics&quot; means was lacking in the main text – it is only late in the methods that it says the four genomes are 3 Neandertals and 1 Denisovan genome, and whether this sharing had to be with all or any of them, heterozygous or homozygous, to be considered as shared. Given how key this is to understanding what the set of variants analysed consists of, I think it needs to be briefly stated when the dataset is introduced in the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We now clearly stated this early in the Results section as follows: “A variant was classified as ancient if the derived allele was shared, by common descent, with at least one of the four high-coverage archaic hominin genomes (three Neanderthals and one Denisovan) (Mafessoni et al., 2020; Meyer et al., 2012; Prüfer et al., 2014, 2017)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The methods are also in a very different order than the results are presented (e.g., simulations for the non-synonymous variants are first in the results but late in the methods, association with biobank phenotypes is early in the methods but late in the results).
