Photosystem II (PSII) is the initial site of photosynthetic electron transfer by water oxidation. Light in excess, however, causes the simultaneous production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to photo-oxidative damage in PSII. To maintain photosynthetic activity, the PSII reaction center protein D1, which is the primary target of unavoidable photo-oxidative damage, is efficiently degraded by FtsH protease. In PSII subunits, photo-oxidative modifications of several amino acids such as Trp have been indeed documented, whereas the linkage between such modifications and D1 degradation remains elusive. Here, we show that an oxidative post-translational modification of Trp residue at the N-terminal tail of D1 is correlated with D1 degradation by FtsH during high-light stress. We revealed that <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutant lacking FtsH2 had increased levels of oxidative Trp residues in D1, among which an N-terminal Trp-14 was distinctively localized in the stromal side. Further characterization of Trp-14 using chloroplast transformation in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> indicated that substitution of D1 Trp-14 to Phe, mimicking Trp oxidation enhanced FtsH-mediated D1 degradation under high light, although the substitution did not affect protein stability and PSII activity. Molecular dynamics simulation of PSII implies that both Trp-14 oxidation and Phe substitution cause fluctuation of D1 N-terminal tail. Furthermore, Trp-14 to Phe modification appeared to have an additive effect in the interaction between FtsH and PSII core in vivo. Together, our results suggest that the Trp oxidation at its N-terminus of D1 may be one of the key oxidations in the PSII repair, leading to processive degradation by FtsH.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Light energy is essential for photosynthesis, which sustains our environment on Earth by generating oxygen and chemical energy for carbon fixation. The first step of photosynthetic electron transfer in the thylakoid membrane occurs at Photosystem II (PSII), where light energy is transferred to P<sub>680</sub> chlorophyll molecules to drive water oxidation, and electron is transferred to plastoquinone. PSII core complex is formed by two reaction center proteins D1 (PsbA) and D2 (PsbD), along with core antenna CP43 (PsbC) and CP47 (PsbB). However, light energy is known to cause photooxidative damage in PSII, especially reaction center protein D1. Photo-damaged D1 needs to be degraded to replace it with a newly synthesized one in the PSII repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lindahl et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bailey et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Silva et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kato et al., 2009</xref>). When photooxidative damage in PSII exceeds the capacity of PSII repair, it ultimately leads to the status called ‘photoinhibition’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aro et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Murata et al., 2007</xref>). PSII repair proceeds with the following steps, (i) oxidative damage to D1 protein in the PSII complex, (ii) migration of photo-damaged PSII laterally from grana stacks to non-appressed regions of thylakoid membranes, (iii) detachment of CP43 from photo-damaged PSII allows for access of protease degrading damaged D1, and (iv) concomitant D1 synthesis and reassembly of PSII into grana thylakoid. Substantial efforts to understand the mechanisms of PSII repair suggest that reversible phosphorylation of PSII core subunits is involved in fine-tuning the photo-damaged D1 turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barber et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fristedt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kato and Sakamoto, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Our previous studies along with those from other groups have shown that the fundamental D1 degradation in PSII repair is performed by FtsH, a membrane-bound ATP-dependent zinc metalloprotease that degrades membrane proteins in a processive manner, although several Deg proteases seem to facilitate the effective degradation by creating additional recognition sites for FtsH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lindahl et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bailey et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sakamoto et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Silva et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kato et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kato and Sakamoto, 2014</xref>). These proteins are universally conserved in prokaryotes and eukaryotic organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Janska and Malgorzata Kwasniaka, 2013</xref>). Photosynthetic organisms have hetero-hexameric FtsH complex in the thylakoid membrane, which is composed of type A and type B subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kato and Sakamoto, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yi et al., 2022</xref>). In the thylakoid membrane of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, for example, FtsH1 or FtsH5 (type A) and FtsH2 or FtsH8 (type B) form functional FtsH complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zaltsman et al., 2005</xref>). <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutants lacking FtsH5 or FtsH2 are, though viable, highly vulnerable to PSII photodamage under high light and are named <italic>yellow variegated1</italic> (<italic>var1</italic>) and <italic>var2</italic> from the characteristic variegated phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Takechi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sakamoto et al., 2002</xref>). This variegated phenotype implies that FtsH is required for proper protein quality control during proplastid-to-chloroplast differentiation in seed plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Miura et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sakamoto et al., 2009</xref>). Similarly, the FtsH complex in the thylakoid membranes of <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> consists of FtsH1 (type A) and FtsH2 (type B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Malnoë et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> studies revealed that FtsH is also involved in the degradation of cytochrome <italic>b<sub>6</sub>f</italic> complex and light-harvesting antenna of photosystem I (PSI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Malnoë et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bujaldon et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, recent studies suggest that increased turnover of FtsH is crucial for their function under high-light stress. That is compensated by upregulated <italic>FtsH</italic> gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kato et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, FtsH was shown to recognize either N- or C-terminal tail of membrane protein substrates to pull their substrates and push them into the protease chamber by ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ito and Akiyama, 2005</xref>). Similarly, the fact that both D1’s N-terminal end and the catalytic site of FtsH are exposed to the stromal side implies D1 to be recognized by FtsH from its N-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Umena et al., 2011</xref>). Supporting this, processive degradation of D1 by FtsH was shown to be attenuated by the loss of N-terminal tail of D1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Komenda et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Michoux et al., 2016</xref>). While these observations suggest involvement of the N-terminal region in D1, whether D1 undergoes oxidative modification at its N-terminal region has not been investigated.</p><p>What is the disorder of photosystems leading to photo-oxidative damage in PSII? Light energy frequently leads to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as singlet oxygen at around PSII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ohnishi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tyystjarvi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yamamoto et al., 2008</xref>), which may cause oxidative post-translational modification (OPTM) of subunit proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li and Kim, 2022</xref>). It is noteworthy that light-dependent oxidation of amino acids, either in free forms or as peptide residues, has been reported, including thiol-containing (Cys and Met) and aromatic (Tyr, Phe, Trp) amino acids. For example, Cys and Met are prone to oxidation, whereas the oxidized Cys and Met can be reduced enzymatically. In contrast to these reversible OPTMs, OPTM of Trp is irreversible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rinalducci et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ehrenshaft et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, the only way to remove irreversible oxidized residues is proteolytic degradation, implying that Trp oxidation might trigger D1 degradation, either directly or indirectly in the PSII repair. As summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, oxidation of Trp side chain results in the formation of oxindolylalanine (OIA), N-formylkynurenine (NFK), and kynurenine (KYN). ROS attacks and opens the pyrrole ring of Trp, and forms a di-oxidized Trp derivative, NFK. Indeed, Trp residues in photosynthetic protein components were shown to be oxidized both in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dreaden et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dreaden Kasson et al., 2012</xref>). However, although oxidative modification of D1 and other subunits has been documented previously, how these molecules are recognized and undergo degradation remains elusive. In this study, we investigated whether Trp oxidation in PSII core proteins influences D1 degradation mediated by FtsH. Our integrative approaches to address this question, by mass-spectrometry, site-directed mutagenesis, D1 degradation assay, and simulation model suggest that an N-terminal Trp oxidation is likely to be a key OPTM to trigger D1 degradation in the PSII repair.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The Oxidized Trp residues in PSII complex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Trp-oxidation pathway.

As an important step in the PSII repair, PSII complex is partially disassembled by CP43 detachment, and this process likely allows FtsH to access photo-damaged D1. Therefore, Trp oxidation in CP43 may play a role in PSII disassembly and D1 degradation concomitantly. To test this, we substituted Trp-353 and Trp-375 for either Ala or Phe as carried out in D1. Transformants were generated by cotransformation of Fud7, using the vector harboring wild-type <italic>psbA</italic> gene and the vector harboring the mutated <italic>psbC</italic> gene. Consequently, we obtained four single mutants (W353A, W353F, W375A, and W375F) and two double mutants (W353A/W375A and W353A/W375F; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Mixotrophic growth on TAP plates was comparable among all transformants and control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

Supporting normal growth, immunoblot analysis showed normal accumulation of PSII core proteins, D1 and CP43, in all lines except for the double mutant W353A/W375A. On the other hand, D1 and CP43 were severely reduced in W353A/W375A, indicating that Ala substitution in these residues resulted in highly unstable or impaired PSII complex formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Further analysis of these mutants under high light showed that the transformants except for W353F did not increase high-light sensitivity on their growth. Only W353F, but not W353F/W375F, showed a slight reduction in their growth under high-light conditions. This is consistent with a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2002</xref>).

In contrast, D1 levels in W317F were similar to those in control cells. When the PSII repair engages properly, high-light irradiation does not alter D1 levels because rapid D1 synthesis compensates turnover of photo-damaged D1. Given decreased D1 under high light, W14F was likely to cause faster D1 degradation. To confirm this possibility, D1 degradation in the presence of CAM was measured. PSII activity in all Trp-substituted lines fell at similar rates compared with control cells in the presence of the CAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), indicating the light-induced damage was at the similar level among all Trp-substituted lines and the control.

Along this line, we investigated Trp oxidation in PSII in this study, and attempted to address whether any modification in amino acid residues was correlated with the PSII repair. PSII is one of the major sites for ROS generation due to photoinhibition, and oxidized amino acid residues in PSII core proteins have been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kale et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frankel et al., 2012</xref>). In general, Met and Cys are sensitive amino acid residues for ROS-mediated oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rinalducci et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ehrenshaft et al., 2015</xref>). However, those OPTMs can be converted back in reduced forms by methionine sulfoxide reductase and disulfide reductase, respectively. In contrast, Trp oxidation is irreversible, and its replacement requires whole protein degradation and de novo synthesis, implicating Trp suitable for flagging photo-oxidative damaged proteins that undergo degradation in the PSII repair.</p><p>Previous studies have reported OPTM of several Trp residues in PSII core proteins in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dreaden Kasson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dreaden et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2002</xref>). In addition, Dogra et al. confirmed several oxidized Trp residues in PSII core proteins of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dogra et al., 2019</xref>). Our mass-spectrometry in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> further indicated that oxidation in some of the Trp residues was detected among algae and land plants. It is noteworthy that a majority of Trp residues are located on the lumenal side (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>) in the vicinity of the Mn<sub>4</sub>O<sub>5</sub>Ca cluster, consistent with the previous observations that amino acid residues around the Mn<sub>4</sub>O<sub>5</sub>Ca cluster are oxidized at the early stage of photoinhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kale et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frankel et al., 2012</xref>). However, OPTM is not limited to the lumenal side but also found in the stromal side, which accounts for photoinhibition at the electron acceptor side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vass, 2012</xref>). Our data indicated the presence of commonly oxidized Trp residues as represented by Trp-14 and Trp-317 in D1 protein. These are in fact Trp residues highly conserved among photosynthetic organisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Technically, detection of light-dependent OPTM was considered to be difficult; an extensive OPTM leads to fully inactive PSII, whereas D1 degradation in the PSII repair may diminish OPTM under optimal light conditions. We therefore assumed that OPTM associated with PSII repair might accumulate significantly in the mutant that is defective in FtsH. Supporting this, our quantitative mass spectrometry indicated that <italic>var2</italic> lacking FtsH2 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> had increased levels of oxidation in Trp residues, particularly in Trp-14 and Trp-317. Although indirect, these results strongly suggested an interconnection between Trp oxidation and D1 degradation.</p><p>OPTM of Trp residues causes irreversible modification and is likely to mark photo-damaged D1 protein as a substrate for degradation. In the PSII repair, a series of events including migration of photo-damaged PSII to non-appressed regions of thylakoid membranes, release of CP43 from the PSII, and recognition of photo-damaged D1 for selective D1 degradation, are essential. In this scenario, FtsH interacts with a partially disassembled PSII complex lacking CP43 protein, called RC47 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kato and Sakamoto, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Järvi et al., 2015</xref>). Close access to the photo-damaged D1, followed by the recognition of its N-terminal region, is concomitantly necessary for FtsH to proceed with processive D1 degradation. Therefore, the OPTM would be involved in the CP43 disassembly or the recognition of damaged D1 protein. A recent study showed that exogenous ROS treatment leads to PSII disassembly supports this model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McKenzie and Puthiyaveetil, 2023</xref>). Krynická et al. indicate that the accessibility to PSII core proteins drives selective protein degradation by FtsH in the cyanobacterium <italic>Synechocystis</italic> PCC 6803 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Krynická et al., 2015</xref>). This observation suggests that D1 protein in the RC47 complex is promptly degraded even if D1 did not suffer from photodamage. On the other hand, all site-directed mutants mimicking Trp oxidation by Trp to Phe substitution have stable and functional PSII complexes under growth light, suggesting that the OPTM would not induce the disassembly of CP43. We also tested whether Trp oxidation in CP43 affects PSII repair by site-directed mutagenesis. Similarly to the case in D1, none of Trp substitutions at the site of OPTM in CP43 (Trp-353 and Trp-375) affected the D1 degradation. Additionally, the CP43 transformants did not show the increased photosensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Our results somewhat appear to contradict the previous report in cyanobacterium that the mutants in which Trp-353 (Trp-352 in <italic>Synechocystis</italic> 6803) was substituted to Leu, Cys, or Ala increased photo-sensitivity under high-light conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2002</xref>). This might be due to the use of extremely high-light irradiation (5000 µmol photons m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>), under which severe photo-damage in PSII complex was rendered. We consider that irreversible Trp oxidation in CP43, if to be repaired, may require a rapid turnover rate comparable to D1 degradation, which is not the case. Although further study is necessary to elucidate the disassembly mechanisms of CP43 during the PSII repair cycle, Trp oxidation in D1, rather than CP43 disassembly, might be important for the recognition of FtsH.</p><p>To examine its effect on D1 degradation, we performed site-directed mutagenesis of the corresponding Trp residues using <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> chloroplast transformation. While Trp to Ala substitution in these sites (W14A or W317A) appeared to compromise PSII complex formation, Trp to Phe substitution (W14F and W317) gave us a hint in the critical role of OPTM. We showed that W14F, but not W317F, caused higher photo-sensitivity with the rapid decrease of D1 under high-light irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Given that W14F affected neither D1 synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), stability of PSII complex formation, nor PSII activity under non-photoinhibitory conditions, it was concluded that the mutation results in enhanced D1 degradation. In our D1 degradation assay of wild type, generally, D1 turnover is too fast to detect unless inhibitor of chloroplast protein synthesis (CAM) is added. In sharp contrast, W14F proceeds with rapid D1 degradation even without CAM. Reportedly, numerous amino acid substitutions have been introduced in D1, which may or may not compromise PSII activity. To our knowledge, however, mutations that accelerate D1 degradation have not been found except for W14F in this study. We thus consider that Trp-14 is particularly important, at least for FtsH to recognize photodamaged D1 as described below.</p><p>Because FtsH-mediated D1 degradation is crucial for the PSII repair cycle, recognition of photodamaged D1 by FtsH protease is a critical step. Following observations suggest that Trp-14 oxidation is one of the key OPTMs for degrading photodamaged D1. First, enhanced D1 degradation in W14F well fits the notion that PTM in the N-terminus of D1 is important to execute processive degradation by FtsH, as proposed previously. For example, the lack of an N-terminal helix attenuates proper D1 degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Komenda et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Michoux et al., 2016</xref>). The excision of N-terminal Met by organellar Met aminopeptidase and prokaryotic-like peptide deformylase was shown to be required for FtsH-mediated D1 degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam et al., 2011</xref>). Phosphorylation of the D1 N-terminus was also shown to affect proteolysis and contribute to the spatiotemporal regulation of D1 degradation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Koivuniemi et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rintamäki et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kato and Sakamoto, 2014</xref>). Together with these, it is possible that Trp-14 oxidation is likely to play a role in ‘photodamage-dependent’ degradation, although we cannot rule out the possibility that other OPTMs may have additive effects. Second, our MD simulation strongly suggests that W14F is similar to Trp-14 oxidation W14* (modified as NFK) in terms of allowing a regional conformational change around the N-terminal helix, thereby increasing fluctuation of the side chain. This fluctuation appears to be manifested by losing hydrogen bonding with Ser-25 of PsbI, a short peptide localized close to D1 and CP43 in the PSII core complex. Although further studies are needed, our simulation is consistent with our notion that Trp-14 is a target of OPTM that alters subtle but critical structural change at the N-terminus of D1.</p><p>Based on these observations, we propose a working model of ‘photodamaged D1 recognition’ in which Trp oxidation plays a role in processive degradation by FtsH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). As a consequence of photoinhibition, ROS is produced around PSII and leads to OPTM of numerous residues. Among these, Trp-14 and Trp-317 are prone to oxidation likely due to their relative positions in PSII. While oxidation takes place in both, Trp-14 causes a conformational change at the N-terminus, which triggers enhanced access of FtsH for subsequent processive degradation. Supporting this, we observed augmented association between D1 and FtsH in W14F/W317F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). It is unlikely, however, that Trp-14 oxidation alone is sufficient to drive degradation of photodamaged D1, because a stepwise dissociation of PSII core complexes is prerequisite. It is also possible that other oxidative modifications are synergistically involved in D1 degradation. A recent study using <italic>Thermosynechococcus vulcanus</italic> suggests that an oxidative modification of Phe at the DE-loop of the D1 protein disrupts the interaction between the PsbT and D1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Forsman and Eaton-Rye, 2021</xref>). The stroma-exposed DE-loop of D1 is one of the possible cleavage sites by Deg protease, which facilitates the effective D1 degradation by FtsH in photoinhibitory conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kato et al., 2012</xref>). Although W14 oxidation would be a key signal for D1 degradation by FtsH, other oxidative modifications in D1 could serve as a general degradation signal. Further study to directly monitor the oxidized D1 captured by FtsH will address these questions.</p><p>OPTM of Trp residues has been observed in various proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kasson and Barry, 2012</xref>). For example, Trp oxidation has been identified in ATP synthase alpha subunit in mitochondria, one of the target proteins for oxidative stress in the mitochondrial inner membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rexroth et al., 2012</xref>). In this case, the oxidation is not random but selectively targets specific Trp. The oxidized ATP synthase might be degraded by mitochondrial FtsH homologs, m-AAA and i-AAA proteases, which have an essential role in the quality control of aberrant proteins in mitochondrial membranes. Furthermore, a previous study in chloroplasts suggests the Trp oxidation in the stress responses related to singlet oxygen; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dogra et al., 2019</xref> report specific oxidation of Trp in EXECUTER1 (EX1), a sensor protein of singlet oxygen in plastid signaling. The oxidation of specific Trp residue is required for ROS signaling mediated by light-dependent EX1 degradation by FtsH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dogra et al., 2019</xref>). Together with our results, these reports imply a general mechanism between oxidized modification of target protein and substrate recognition by FtsH. Future proteomic approaches for investigating OPTM will reveal the general substrate recognition mechanisms by FtsH in the thylakoid membranes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Detection of Trp oxidation in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic></title><p>Chloroplasts were isolated from 3-week-old plants of WT and <italic>var2</italic> (SAIL_253_A03) grown under continuous light (80 µmol photons m<sup>–2</sup>s<sup>–1</sup> at 20 ± 2°C) conditions.

An NheI/EcoRV-digested fragment from the pSXY504 was ligated into XbaI/EcoRV-digested pSRE6 to generate pSXY518.</p><p>A chloroplast transformation vector for <italic>psbA</italic> mutagenesis was generated by inserting Mva1269I/ApaI-digested fragment from a plasmid, which contains <italic>psbA</italic> exon 5 and 3' flanking region between EcoRI and XhoI sites, into Mva1269I/ApaI-digested pR12-EX-50-AAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Takahashi et al., 1996</xref>) to generate pSXY235. A BamHI/BglII fragment from pSXY518 was inserted into BamHI-digested pSXY235 to generate pSXY236A, in which <italic>psbA</italic> and <italic>aadA</italic> were transcribed in the same orientation. Orientation of the <italic>aadA</italic> was confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion.</p><p>To introduce a point mutation at the D1-W14 codon, an EcoRI/NspI fragment from plasmid pR12-EX-50-AAD, which contains <italic>psbA</italic> exon 1, was cloned into pBluescript KS<sup>-</sup> to generate pSXY232. A PCR-amplified DNA fragment from AflII/Bpu10I-digested pSXY232 using primers On#5 and On#6 was inserted into NdeI-digested pSXY232 using In-Fusion HD cloning kit to generate pSXY233. A DNA fragment that contains D1-W14A codon was amplified from total <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> DNA by PCR using primers On#7 and On#8. A DNA fragment that contains D1-W14F codon was amplified from total <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> DNA by PCR using primers On#7 and On#9. Each DNA fragment that contains mutated D1-W14A codon or D1-W14F codon was inserted into AfeI-digested pSXY233 using In-Fusion HD cloning kit to generate pSXY237 and pSXY238, respectively. An AflII/NsiI-digested fragment from pSXY237 and pSXY238 was ligated into AflII/NsiI-digested pSXY236A to generate transformation vectors pSXY239A (D1-W14A) and pSXY240A (D1-W14F), respectively. The DNA segments amplified by PCR was confirmed by DNA sequencing using a primer On#10.</p><p>To substitute D1-W317 codon by Alanine (A) codon, a PCR-amplified fragment from total <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> DNA using primers On#11 and On#12 and a PCR-amplified fragment from total <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> DNA using primers On#13 and On#14 were simultaneously inserted into Mva1269I/SexAI-digested pSXY236A to generate pSXY241A (D1-W317A). A transformation vector pSXY243A for D1-W14A/D1-W317A double mutant was constructed by inserting AflII/NsiI-digested fragment into AflII/NsiI site of the pSXY241A. To substitute D1-W317 codon by Phenylalanine (F) codon, a PCR-amplified fragment from total <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> DNA using primers On#11 and On#15 and a PCR-amplified fragment from total <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> DNA using primers On#13 and On#14 were simultaneously inserted into Mva1269I/SexAI-digested pSXY236A to generate pSXY242A (D1-W317F). A transformation vector pSXY244A for D1-W14F/D1-W317F double mutant was constructed by inserting AflII/NsiI-digested fragment into AflII/NsiI site of the pSXY242A. The DNA segments amplified by PCR was confirmed by DNA sequencing using a primer On#16.</p><p>To generate CP43 mutants, we first deleted <italic>psbC</italic> from chloroplast genome of the Fud7. Plasmid P-578 obtained from Chlamydomonas Resource Center (University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN) was digested with EcoRI and SnaBI, and cloned into the EcoRI-HincII site of pBluescript KS- to generate pSXY1001. Plasmid pSXY1001 was digested with EcoRI and HincII, and cloned into the EcoRI-SwaI site of pBluescript KS- to generate pSXY1002. Two PCR products were amplified from the pSXY1002 using primers On#18/On#19 or On#17/On#20, digested with EcoRI or PmlI and then simultaneously inserted into the EcoRI-PmlI site of the pSXY1002 to generate pSXY1003. An PCR product was amplified from pSXY1001 using primers On#21 and On#22, digested with PmlI and cloned into the SwaI-PmlI site of the pSXY1003 to generate pSXY1004. An PCR product was amplified from the Fud7 total DNA using primers On#19 and On#23, digested with SwaI and EcoRI, and cloned into the SmaI-EcoRI site of the pSXY1004 to generate pSXY1005. A BamHI-EcoRI fragment of the pSXY1005 was cloned into the BamHI-EcoRI site of the pSXY1002 to generate pSXY1006. An PCR product was amplified from wild type Chlamydomonas total DNA using primers On#24 and On#25, digested with SacI and PacI, and cloned into the SacI-PacI site of the pSXY1006 to generate pSXY1007. To construct a recyclable aadA marker, an NsiI-BamHI fragment of the pSXY503 (Kuroda2021) was cloned into the PstI-BamHI site of pUC18 to generate pSXY506. A HindIII-SmaI fragment of the pSXY506 was cloned into the HindIII-PmlI site of the pSXY1007 to generate transformation vector pSXY1008 for deletion of the <italic>psbC</italic> gene.</p><p>To introduce a point mutation(s) at the CP43-W365 and the CP43-W387 codons, an inverse PCR product was amplified from the pSXY1002 using primers On#26 and On#27, and self-ligated to generate pSXY1032. An EcoRI-PmlI fragment of the pSXY1032 was cloned into the EcoRI-PmlI site of the pSXY1007 to generate pSXY1033. For CP43-W365 and CP43-W387 mutagenesis, each PCR product, which carried mutated CP43-W365 and/or mutated CP43-W387 codons, was amplified from wild type Chlamydomonas total DNA using primers On#28 to On#33, and introduced into PstI site of the pSXY1033 with In-Fusion HD cloning kit (Takara) to generate transformation vectors pSXY1034 to pSXY1039 (Seq: On#22).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Validation, Investigation, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Validation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Validation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Validation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Validation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Resources, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Data curation, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Validation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Validation, Writing – original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-88822-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files.

They study the turnover of plant photosystem II (PSII), a hetero-oligomeric membrane protein complex that undertakes the crucial light-driven water oxidation reaction in photosynthesis. The formidable water oxidation reaction makes PSII prone to photooxidative damage. PSII repair cycle is a protein repair pathway that replaces the photodamaged reaction center protein D1 with a new copy. The manuscript addresses an important question in PSII repair cycle - how is the damaged D1 protein recognized and selectively degraded by the membrane-bound ATP-dependent zinc metalloprotease FtsH in a processive manner? The authors show that oxidative post-translational modification (OPTM) of the D1 N-terminus is likely critical for the proper recognition and degradation of the damaged D1 by FtsH. Authors use a wide range of approaches and techniques to test their hypothesis that the singlet oxygen (1O2)-mediated oxidation of tryptophan 14 (W14) residue of D1 to N-formylkynurenine (NFK) facilitates the selective degradation of damaged D1. Overall, the authors propose an interesting new hypothesis for D1 degradation and their hypothesis is supported by most of the experimental data provided. The study certainly addresses an elusive aspect of PSII turnover and the data provided go some way in explaining the light-induced D1 turnover. However, some of the data are correlative and do not provide mechanistic insight. A rigorous demonstration of OPTM as a marker for D1 degradation is yet to be made in my opinion. Some strengths and weaknesses of the study are summarized below:</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>1. In support of their hypothesis, the authors find that FtsH mutants of Arabidopsis have increased OPTM, especially the formation of NFK at multiple Trp residues of D1 including the W14; a site-directed mutation of W14 to phenylalanine (W14F), mimicking NFK, results in accelerated D1 degradation in Chlamydomonas; accelerated D1 degradation of W14F mutant is mitigated in an ftsH1 mutant background of Chlamydomonas; and that the W14F mutation augmented the interaction between FtsH and the D1 substrate.</p><p>2. Authors raise an intriguing possibility that the OPTM disrupts the hydrogen bonding between W14 residue of D1 and the serine 25 (S25) of PsbI. According to the authors, this leads to an increased fluctuation of the D1 N-terminal tail, and as a consequence, recognition and binding of the photodamaged D1 by the protease. This is an interesting hypothesis and the authors provide some molecular dynamics simulation data in support of this. If this hypothesis is further supported, it represents a significant advancement.</p><p>3. The interdisciplinary experimental approach is certainly a strength of the study. The authors have successfully combined mass spectrometric analysis with several biochemical assays and molecular dynamics simulation. These, together with the generation of transplastomic algal cell lines, have enabled a clear test of the role of Trp oxidation in selective D1 degradation.</p><p>4. Trp oxidative modification as a degradation signal has precedent in chloroplasts. The authors cite the case of 1O2 sensor protein EXECUTER 1 (EX1), whose degradation by FtsH2, the same protease that degrades D1, requires prior oxidation of a Trp residue. The earlier observation of an attenuated degradation of a truncated D1 protein lacking the N-terminal tail is also consistent with authors' suggestion of the importance of the D1 N-terminus recognition by FtsH. It is also noteworthy that in light of the current study, D1 phosphorylation is unlikely to be a marker for degradation as posited by earlier studies.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>1. The study lacks some data that would have made the conclusions more rigorous and convincing. It is unclear why the level of Trp oxidation was not analyzed in the Chlamydomonas ftsH 1-1 mutant as done for the var 2 mutant. Increased oxidation of W14 OPTM in Chlamydomonas ftsH 1-1 is a key prediction of the hypothesis. It is also unclear to me what is the rationale for showing D1-FtsH interaction data only for the double mutant but not for the single mutant (W14F). Why is the FtsH pulldown of D2 not statistically significant (p value = {less than or equal to}0.1). Wouldn't one expect FtsH pulls down the RC47 complex containing D1, D2, and RC47. Probing the RC47 level would have been useful in settling this. A key proposition of the authors' is that the hydrogen bonding between D1 W14 and S25 of PsbI is disrupted by the oxidative modification of W14. Can this hypothesis be further tested by replacing the S25 of PsbI with Ala, for example?</p><p>2. Although most of the work described is in vivo analysis, which is desirable, some in vitro degradation assays would have strengthened the conclusions. An in vitro degradation assay using the recombinant FtsH and a synthetic peptide encompassing D1 N-terminus with and without OPTM will test the enhanced D1 degradation that the authors predict. This will also help to discern the possibility that whether CP43 detachment alone is sufficient for D1 degradation as suggested for cyanobacteria.</p><p>3. The rationale for analyzing a single oxidative modification (W14) as a D1 degradation signal is unclear. D1 N-terminus is modified at multiple sites. Please see Mckenzie and Puthiyaveetil, bioRxiv May 04 2023. Also, why is modification by only 1O2 considered while superoxide and hydroxide radicals can equally damage D1?</p><p>4. The D1 degradation assay seems not repeatable for the W14F mutant. High light minus CAM results in Fig. 3 shows a statistically significant decrease in D1 levels for W14F at multiple time points but the same assay in Fig. 4a does not produce a statistically significant decrease at 90 min of incubation. Why is this? Accelerated D1 degradation in the Phe mutant under high light is key evidence that the authors cite in support of their hypothesis.</p><p>5. The description of results at times is not nuanced enough, for e.g. lines 116-117 state &quot;The oxidation levels in Trp-14 and Trp-314 increased 1.8-fold and 1.4-fold in var2 compared to the wild type, respectively (Fig. 1c)&quot; while an inspection of the figure reveals that modification at W314 is significant only for NFK and not for KYN and OIA. Likewise, the authors write that CP43 mutant W353F has no growth phenotype under high light but Figure S6 reveals otherwise. The slow growth of this mutant is in line with the earlier observation made by Anderson et al., 2002. In lines 162-163, the authors talk about unchanged electron transport in some site-directed mutants and cite Fig. 2c but this figure only shows chl fluorescence trace and nothing else.</p><p>6. The authors rightly discuss an alternate hypothesis that the simple disassembly of the monomeric core into RC47 and CP43 alone may be sufficient for selective D1 degradation as in cyanobacteria. This hypothesis cannot yet be ruled out completely given the lack of some in vitro degradation data as mentioned in point 2. Oxidative protein modification indeed drives the disassembly of the monomeric core (Mckenzie and Puthiyaveetil, bioRxiv May 04 2023).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.88822.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Light energy drives photosynthesis. However, excessive light can damage (i.e., photo-damage) and thus inactivate the photosynthetic process. A major target site of photo-damage is photosystem II (PSII). In particular, one component of PSII, the reaction center protein, D1, is very suspectable to photo-damage, however, this protein is maintained efficiently by an elaborate multi-step PSII-D1 turnover/repair cycle. Two proteases, FtsH and Deg, are known to contribute to this process, respectively, by efficient degradation of photo-damaged D1 protein processively and endoproteolytically. In this manuscript, Kato et al., propose an additional step (an early step) in the D1 degradation/repair pathway. They propose that &quot;Tryptophan oxidation&quot; at the N-terminus of D1 may be one of the key oxidations in the PSII repair, leading to processive degradation of D1 by FtsH. Both, their data and arguments are very compelling.</p><p>The D1 protein repair/degradation pathway in its simplest form can be defined essentially by five steps: (1) migration of damaged PSII core complex to the stroma thylakoid, (2) partial PSII disassembly of the PSII core monomer, (3) access of protease degrading damaged D1, (4) concomitant D1 synthesis, and (5) reassembly of PSII into grana thylakoid. An enormous amount of work has already been done to define and characterize these various steps. Kato et al., in this manuscript, are proposing a very early yet novel critical step in D1 protein turnover in which Tryptophan(Trp) oxidation in PSII core proteins influences D1 degradation mediated by FtsH.</p><p>Using a variety of approaches, such as mass-spectrometry (Table 1), site-directed mutagenesis (Figures 2-4), D1 degradation assays (Figures 3, and 4), and simulation modeling (Figure 5), Kato et al., provide both strong evidence and reasonable arguments that an N-terminal Trp oxidation may be likely to be a 'key' oxidative post-translational modification (OPTM) that is involved in triggering D1 degradation and thus activating the PSII repair pathway. Consequently, from their accumulated data, the authors propose a scenario in which the unraveling of the N-terminal of the D1 protein facilitated by Trp oxidation plays a critical 'recognition' role in alerting the plant that the D1 protein is photo-damaged and thus to kick start the processive degradation pathway initiated possibly by FtsH. Coincidently, Forsman and Eaton-Rye (Biochemistry 2021, 60, 1, 53-63), while working with the thermophilic cyanobacterium, Thermosynechococcus vulcanus, showed that when the N-terminal DE-loop of the D1 protein is photo-damaged a disruption of the interaction between the PsbT subunit and D1 occurs which may serve as a signal for PSII to undergo repair following photodamage. While the activation of the processive degradation pathways in Chlamydomonas versus Thermosynechococcus vulcanus have significant mechanistic differences, it's interesting to note and speculate that the stability of the N-terminal of their respective D1 proteins seems to play a critical role in 'signaling' the PSII repair system to be activated and initiate repair. But it's complicated. For instance, significant Trp oxidation also occurs on the lumen side of other PSII subunits which may also play a significant role in activating the repair processes as well. Indeed, Kato et al.,( Photosynthesis Research volume 126, pages 409-416 (2015)) proposed a two-step model whereby the primary event is disruption of a Mn-cluster in PSII on the lumen side. A secondary event is damage to D1 caused by energy that is absorbed by chlorophyll. But models adapt, change, and get updated. And the data provided by Kato et al., in this manuscript, gives us a unique glimpse/snapshot into the importance of the stability of the N-terminal during photo-damage and its role in D1-turnover. For instance, the author's use site-directed mutagenesis of Trp residues undergoing OPTM in the D1 protein coupled with their D1 degradation assays (Figure 3 and 4), provides evidence that Trp oxidation (in particular the oxidation of Trp14) in coordination with FtsH results in the degradation of D1 protein. Indeed, their D1 degradation assays coupled with the use of a ftsh mutant provide further significant support that Trp14 oxidation and FtsH activity are strongly linked. But for FstH to degrade D1 protein it needs to gain access to photo-damaged D1. FtsH access to D1 is achieved by having CP43 partially dissociate from the PSII complex. Hence, the authors also addressed the possibility that Trp oxidation may also play a role in CP43 disassembly from the PSII complex thereby giving FtsH access to D1. Using a site-directed mutagenesis approach, they showed that Trp oxidation in CP43 appeared to have little impact on the PSII repair (Supplemental Figure S6). This result shows that D1-Trp14 oxidation appears to be playing a role in D1 turnover that occurs after CP43 disassembly from the PSII complex. Alternatively, the authors cannot exclude the possibility that D1-Trp14 oxidation in some way facilitates CP43 dissociation. Further investigation is needed on this point. However, D1-Trp14 oxidation is causing an internal disruption of the D1 protein possibly at the N-terminus of the protein. Consequently, the role of Trp14 oxidation in disrupting the stability of the N-terminal domain of the D1 protein was analyzed computationally. Using a molecular dynamics approach (Figure 5), the authors attempted to create a mechanistic model to explain why when D1 protein Trp14 undergoes oxidation the N-terminal domain of D1protein becomes unraveled. Specifically, the authors propose that the interaction between D1 protein Trp14 with PsbI Ser25 becomes disrupted upon oxidation of Trp14. Consequently, the authors concluded from their molecular dynamics simulation analysis that &quot; the increased fluctuation of the first α-helix of D1 would give a chance to recognize the photo-damaged D1 by FtsH protease&quot;. Hence, the author's experimental and computational approaches employed here develop a compelling early-stage repair model that integrates (1) Trp14 oxidation, (2) FtsH activation and (3) D1- turnover being initiated at its N-terminal domain. However, a word of caution should be emphasized here. This model is just a snapshot of the very early stages of the D1 protein turnover process. The data presented here gives us just a small glimpse into the unique relationship between Trp oxidation of the D1 protein which may trigger significant N-terminal structural changes of the D1 protein that both signals and provides an opportunity for FstH to begin protease digestion of the D1 protein. However, the authors go to great lengths in their discussion section to not overstate solely the role of Trp14 oxidation in the complicated process of D1 turnover. The authors certainly recognize that there are a lot of moving parts involved in D1 turnover. And while Trp14 oxidation is the major focus of this paper, the authors show in Supplemental Fig S4 the structural positions of various additional oxidized Trp residues in the Thermosynecoccocus vulcans PSII core proteins. Indeed, this figure shows that the majority of oxidized Trps are located on the luminal side of PSII complex clustered around the oxygen-evolving complex. So, while oxidized Trp14 may be involved in the early stages of D1 turnover certainly oxidized Trps on the lumen side are also more than likely playing a role in D1 turnover as well. To untangle this complex process will require additional research.</p><p>Nevertheless, identifying and characterizing the role of oxidative modification of tryptophan (Trp) residues, in particular, Trp14, in the PSII core provides another critical step in an already intricate multi-step process of D1 protein turnover during photo-damage.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article

Authors raise an intriguing possibility that the OPTM disrupts the hydrogen bonding between W14 residue of D1 and the serine 25 (S25) of PsbI. According to the authors, this leads to an increased fluctuation of the D1 N-terminal tail, and as a consequence, recognition and binding of the photodamaged D1 by the protease. This is an interesting hypothesis and the authors provide some molecular dynamics simulation data in support of this. If this hypothesis is further supported, it represents a significant advancement.</p><p>1. The interdisciplinary experimental approach is certainly a strength of the study. The authors have successfully combined mass spectrometric analysis with several biochemical assays and molecular dynamics simulation. These, together with the generation of transplastomic algal cell lines, have enabled a clear test of the role of Trp oxidation in selective D1 degradation.</p><p>1. Trp oxidative modification as a degradation signal has precedent in chloroplasts. The authors cite the case of 1O2 sensor protein EXECUTER 1 (EX1), whose degradation by FtsH2, the same protease that degrades D1, requires prior oxidation of a Trp residue. The earlier observation of an attenuated degradation of a truncated D1 protein lacking the N-terminal tail is also consistent with authors' suggestion of the importance of the D1 N-terminus recognition by FtsH. It is also noteworthy that in light of the current study, D1 phosphorylation is unlikely to be a marker for degradation as posited by earlier studies.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>1. The study lacks some data that would have made the conclusions more rigorous and convincing. It is unclear why the level of Trp oxidation was not analyzed in the Chlamydomonas ftsH 1-1 mutant as done for the var 2 mutant. Increased oxidation of W14 OPTM in Chlamydomonas ftsH 1-1 is a key prediction of the hypothesis.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this valuable comment. We agree with the reviewer that the analysis of oxidized Trp level will reinforce the importance of Trp oxidation in the N-terminal of D1.In our preliminary experiment, we observed a trend toward increase of the kynurenine in Trp-14 in Chlamydomonas ftsH1-1 strain. However, we found large errors, and we could not conclude that this trend is significant. A possible reason for the large error was that the signal intensity of oxidized Trp was insufficient for quantification in a series of Chlamydomonas experiment. In addition, the fact that the amount of D1 in each culture was not stable also might be one reason. On the other hand, we keep note of a previous result that more fragmentation of D1 protein was observed in the Chlamydomonas ftsH1-1 mutant compared to that in Arabidopsis (Malnoë et al., Plant Cell 2014). This result suggests that an alternative D1 degradation pathway involving other proteases is more active in the Chlamydomonas ftsH1-1 mutant than in Arabidopsis var2 mutant. Furthermore, the Chlamydomonas ftsH1-1 mutant, caused by an amino acid substitution, still has a significant FtsH1/FtsH2 heterohexamer, and the level of FtsH1 and FtsH2 proteins increases significantly under high light irradiation. This is a significant difference from the Arabidopsis var2 mutant lacking FtsH2 subunit and showed reduced protein accumulation. These factors may explain to the lower detection levels of oxidized Trp in Chlamydomonas. We believe that improved sensitivity for detection of oxidized Trp peptides and more sophisticated experimental systems could solve this issue in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is also unclear to me what is the rationale for showing D1-FtsH interaction data only for the double mutant but not for the single mutant (W14F).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. As suggested by the reviewer, the analysis of the mutant crossing ftsH and W14F single mutation will provide more convincing evidence. Fig.3 showed that the photosensitivity in both W14F and W14FW317F was caused by the enhanced D1 degradation observed, which was due to the W14F mutation. Therefore, we crossed the ftsH mutant with W14FW317F, which has a more severe phenotype, to confirm whether FtsH is involved in this D1 degradation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Why is the FtsH pulldown of D2 not statistically significant (p value = {less than or equal to}0.1). Wouldn't one expect FtsH pulls down the RC47 complex containing D1, D2, and RC47. Probing the RC47 level would have been useful in settling this.</p></disp-quote><p>For the immunoblot result of D2 and its statistical analysis, we answered in the following comment; No.2 in the reviewer's comment in Recommendations For The Authors.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer's suggestion that further immunoblot analysis for CP47 protein would help our understanding of FtsH and RC47 interaction. Indeed, we attempted the immunoblot analysis of CP47 after the FtsH Co-IP experiment. However, the detection of CP43 protein was not sensitive enough. This reason may be due to the lower titer of the CP47 antibody compared to the D1 and D2 antibodies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A key proposition of the authors' is that the hydrogen bonding between D1 W14 and S25 of PsbI is disrupted by the oxidative modification of W14. Can this hypothesis be further tested by replacing the S25 of PsbI with Ala, for example?</p></disp-quote><p>It is an interesting question whether amino acid substitution in PsbI-S25 affects the stability of D1-N-term and its degradation by FtsH. We would like to analyze the possibility in the future. We thank the reviewer for this helpful suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Although most of the work described is in vivo analysis, which is desirable, some in vitro degradation assays would have strengthened the conclusions. An in vitro degradation assay using the recombinant FtsH and a synthetic peptide encompassing D1 N-terminus with and without OPTM will test the enhanced D1 degradation that the authors predict. This will also help to discern the possibility that whether CP43 detachment alone is sufficient for D1 degradation as suggested for cyanobacteria.</p></disp-quote><p>In vitro experimental systems are interesting. However, FtsH is known to function as a hexamer, which has not yet been successfully reconstituted in vitro. Therefore, it would not be easy to perform an in vitro experimental system using the N-terminal synthetic peptide of D1 as a substrate. Thank you for your valuable suggestions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The rationale for analyzing a single oxidative modification (W14) as a D1 degradation signal is unclear. D1 N-terminus is modified at multiple sites. Please see Mckenzie and Puthiyaveetil, bioRxiv May 04 2023. Also, why is modification by only 1O2 considered while superoxide and hydroxide radicals can equally damage D1?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the possibility that oxidative modifications in other amino acids are also involved in the D1 degradation, as pointed out by the reviewer. We also thank the reviewer for pointing us to the interesting article of Mckenzie and Puthiyaveetil et al. that showed additional oxidations occurred in the D1-Nterminus, which we had yet to be aware of when we submitted our manuscript. It will be interesting to see how these amino acid oxidations work with W14 oxidation on D1 degradation in the future. The oxidation of Trp by 1O2 can serve as a substrate for FtsH, as in the case of EX1, so we focused on the analysis of Trp oxidation. Single oxygen is believed to be the potential reactive species of Trp oxidation. However, the detected oxidative modifications in this study were not exactly sure depended on singlet oxygen. Thus, we changed several sentences that mention tryptophan oxidation by single oxygen.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The D1 degradation assay seems not repeatable for the W14F mutant. High light minus CAM results in Fig. 3 shows a statistically significant decrease in D1 levels for W14F at multiple time points but the same assay in Fig. 4a does not produce a statistically significant decrease at 90 min of incubation. Why is this? Accelerated D1 degradation in the Phe mutant under high light is key evidence that the authors cite in support of their hypothesis.</p></disp-quote><p>In Fig. 4a, the p-value comparing the D1 level at 90 min between control and W14F was 0.1075. This value is slightly larger than 0.1. The result that one of the control experiments showed a decrease in D1 level relative to 0 h might cause this value. Given that the D1 level of the remaining three of the four replicates was unchanged in the control experiments, it can be considered an outlier. We believe the results do not affect our hypothesis that the earlier D1 degradation is occurred in W14F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The description of results at times is not nuanced enough, for e.g. lines 116-117 state &quot;The oxidation levels in Trp-14 and Trp-314 increased 1.8-fold and 1.4-fold in var2 compared to the wild type, respectively (Fig. 1c)&quot; while an inspection of the figure reveals that modification at W314 is significant only for NFK and not for KYN and OIA.</p></disp-quote><p>In this sentence, we described the result that is compared with the oxidized peptide levels calculated from all Trp-oxidized derivatives. However, as pointed out by the reviewer, it was not correct to explain the result of Fig.1C. We corrected the sentence following the reviewer's suggestion as below;“The levels of Trp-oxidized derivatives, OIA, NFK, and KYN in Trp-14 and the level of KYN in Trp-314 were significantly increased in var2 compared to the wild type, respectively (Fig. 1c). &quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Likewise, the authors write that CP43 mutant W353F has no growth phenotype under high light but Figure S6 reveals otherwise. The slow growth of this mutant is in line with the earlier observation made by Anderson et al., 2002.</p></disp-quote><p>As pointed out by the reviewer, the growth of W353F seems to be a little slow under HL. We have changed our description of the result part. However, we still conclude that CP43 had little impact on the PSII repair, because the impaired growth in W353F is not as severe as those in W14F and W14F/W317F under HL</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In lines 162-163, the authors talk about unchanged electron transport in some site-directed mutants and cite Fig. 2c but this figure only shows chl fluorescence trace and nothing else.</p></disp-quote><p>We agreed with the reviewer's suggestion and changed the sentence. In this study, we did not perform detailed photosynthetic analysis. Based on the analysis of phototrophic growth, oxygen-evolving activity, and Chl fluorescence, we concluded that overall photosynthetic activity was not a significant difference in the mutants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The authors rightly discuss an alternate hypothesis that the simple disassembly of the monomeric core into RC47 and CP43 alone may be sufficient for selective D1 degradation as in cyanobacteria. This hypothesis cannot yet be ruled out completely given the lack of some in vitro degradation data as mentioned in point 2. Oxidative protein modification indeed drives the disassembly of the monomeric core (Mckenzie and Puthiyaveetil, bioRxiv May 04 2023).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your suggestion. We added a discussion of PSII disassembly by ROS-induced oxidation to the discussion part, and the reference is added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Light energy drives photosynthesis. However, excessive light can damage (i.e., photo-damage) and thus inactivate the photosynthetic process. A major target site of photo-damage is photosystem II (PSII). In particular, one component of PSII, the reaction center protein, D1, is very suspectable to photo-damage, however, this protein is maintained efficiently by an elaborate multi-step PSII-D1 turnover/repair cycle. Two proteases, FtsH and Deg, are known to contribute to this process, respectively, by efficient degradation of photo-damaged D1 protein processively and endoproteolytically. In this manuscript, Kato et al., propose an additional step (an early step) in the D1 degradation/repair pathway. They propose that &quot;Tryptophan oxidation&quot; at the N-terminus of D1 may be one of the key oxidations in the PSII repair, leading to processive degradation of D1 by FtsH. Both, their data and arguments are very compelling.</p><p>The D1 protein repair/degradation pathway in its simplest form can be defined essentially by five steps: (1) migration of damaged PSII core complex to the stroma thylakoid, (2) partial PSII disassembly of the PSII core monomer, (3) access of protease degrading damaged D1, (4) concomitant D1 synthesis, and (5) reassembly of PSII into grana thylakoid. An enormous amount of work has already been done to define and characterize these various steps. Kato et al., in this manuscript, are proposing a very early yet novel critical step in D1 protein turnover in which Tryptophan(Trp) oxidation in PSII core proteins influences D1 degradation mediated by FtsH.</p><p>Using a variety of approaches, such as mass-spectrometry (Table 1), site-directed mutagenesis (Figures 2-4), D1 degradation assays (Figures 3, and 4), and simulation modeling (Figure 5), Kato et al., provide both strong evidence and reasonable arguments that an N-terminal Trp oxidation may be likely to be a 'key' oxidative post-translational modification (OPTM) that is involved in triggering D1 degradation and thus activating the PSII repair pathway. Consequently, from their accumulated data, the authors propose a scenario in which the unraveling of the N-terminal of the D1 protein facilitated by Trp oxidation plays a critical 'recognition' role in alerting the plant that the D1 protein is photo-damaged and thus to kick start the processive degradation pathway initiated possibly by FtsH. Coincidently, Forsman and Eaton-Rye (Biochemistry 2021, 60, 1, 53-63), while working with the thermophilic cyanobacterium, Thermosynechococcus vulcanus, showed that when the N-terminal DE-loop of the D1 protein is photo-damaged that occurs which may serve as a signal for PSII to undergo repair following photodamage. While the activation of the processive degradation pathways in Chlamydomonas versus Thermosynechococcus vulcanus have significant mechanistic differences, it's interesting to note and speculate that the stability of the N-terminal of their respective D1 proteins seems to play a critical role in 'signaling' the PSII repair system to be activated and initiate repair. But it's complicated. For instance, significant Trp oxidation also occurs on the lumen side of other PSII subunits which may also play a significant role in activating the repair processes as well. Indeed, Kato et al.,( Photosynthesis Research volume 126, pages 409-416 (2015)) proposed a two-step model whereby the primary event is disruption of a Mn-cluster in PSII on the lumen side.</p><p>A secondary event is damage to D1 caused by energy that is absorbed by chlorophyll. But models adapt, change, and get updated. And the data provided by Kato et al., in this manuscript, gives us a unique glimpse/snapshot into the importance of the stability of the N-terminal during photo-damage and its role in D1-turnover. For instance, the author's use site-directed mutagenesis of Trp residues undergoing OPTM in the D1 protein coupled with their D1 degradation assays (Figure 3 and 4), provides evidence that Trp oxidation (in particular the oxidation of Trp14) in coordination with FtsH results in the degradation of D1 protein. Indeed, their D1 degradation assays coupled with the use of a ftsh mutant provide further significant support that Trp14 oxidation and FtsH activity are strongly linked. But for FstH to degrade D1 protein it needs to gain access to photo-damaged D1. FtsH access to D1 is achieved by having CP43 partially dissociate from the PSII complex. Hence, the authors also addressed the possibility that Trp oxidation may also play a role in CP43 disassembly from the PSII complex thereby giving FtsH access to D1. Using a site-directed mutagenesis approach, they showed that Trp oxidation in CP43 appeared to have little impact on the PSII repair (Supplemental Figure S6). This result shows that D1-Trp14 oxidation appears to be playing a role in D1 turnover that occurs after CP43 disassembly from the PSII complex. Alternatively, the authors cannot exclude the possibility that D1-Trp14 oxidation in some way facilitates CP43 dissociation. Further investigation is needed on this point. However, D1-Trp14 oxidation is causing an internal disruption of the D1 protein possibly at the N-terminus of the protein. Consequently, the role of Trp14 oxidation in disrupting the stability of the N-terminal domain of the D1 protein was analyzed computationally. Using a molecular dynamics approach (Figure 5), the authors attempted to create a mechanistic model to explain why when D1 protein Trp14 undergoes oxidation the N-terminal domain of D1protein becomes unraveled. Specifically, the authors propose that the interaction between D1 protein Trp14 with PsbI Ser25 becomes disrupted upon oxidation of Trp14. Consequently, the authors concluded from their molecular dynamics simulation analysis that &quot; the increased fluctuation of the first α-helix of D1 would give a chance to recognize the photo-damaged D1 by FtsH protease&quot;. Hence, the author's experimental and computational approaches employed here develop a compelling early-stage repair model that integrates (1) Trp14 oxidation, (2) FtsH activation and (3) D1- turnover being initiated at its N-terminal domain. However, a word of caution should be emphasized here. This model is just a snapshot of the very early stages of the D1 protein turnover process. The data presented here gives us just a small glimpse into the unique relationship between Trp oxidation of the D1 protein which may trigger significant N-terminal structural changes of the D1 protein that both signals and provides an opportunity for FstH to begin protease digestion of the D1 protein.</p><p>However, the authors go to great lengths in their discussion section to not overstate solely the role of Trp14 oxidation in the complicated process of D1 turnover. The authors certainly recognize that there are a lot of moving parts involved in D1 turnover. And while Trp14 oxidation is the major focus of this paper, the authors show in Supplemental Fig S4 the structural positions of various additional oxidized Trp residues in the Thermosynecoccocus vulcans PSII core proteins. Indeed, this figure shows that the majority of oxidized Trps are located on the luminal side of PSII complex clustered around the oxygen-evolving complex. So, while oxidized Trp14 may be involved in the early stages of D1 turnover certainly oxidized Trps on the lumen side are also more than likely playing a role in D1 turnover as well. To untangle this complex process will require additional research.</p><p>Nevertheless, identifying and characterizing the role of oxidative modification of tryptophan (Trp) residues, in particular, Trp14, in the PSII core provides another critical step in an already intricate multi-step process of D1 protein turnover during photo-damage.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer #3 for all the helpful comments and their supportive review of the manuscript.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this interesting study that ROS might disrupt the interaction between the PsbT and D1 in Thermosynechococcus vulcanus.

Since the pulse-labeling experiment is affected D1 degradation as well as D1 synthesis, even if there is a difference in the rate of D1 synthesis under HL, we can not clearly distinguish whether the cause of reduced labeling is the increased D1 degradation seen in the W14F mutant or the delay in D1 synthesis.

I think this labeling is incorrect and needs to be +CAM.</p></disp-quote><p>Corrected</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This reviewer has a few comments/suggestions on the presentation of the sequence alignments showing the various positions of oxidized Trps within the D1(Figure 1), D2 and CP43 (Supplemental Figure S3) and CP47 (Supplemental Figure S3):</p><p>The authors should consider highlighting in red all the various Trps shown in Table 1 with the corresponding alignments shown in Figure 1 for D1 protein and corresponding alignments in Supplemental Figure S3 (for D2 and CP43) and Supplemental Figure S3 continued (For CP47). Highlighting the locations of oxidized Trps across various species is very informative but as presented here the red labeling somewhat is haphazard, confusing and thus these figures lose some of their impact factor. For instance, in Supplementary Fig. S4, the reader can visualize the structural positions of oxidized Trp residues in the Thermosynecoccocus vulcanus PSII core proteins. When one then looks at the various alignments presented by the authors, one can see that other species have a similar arrangement of oxidized Trp residues as well. Consequently, when you now collectively look at the data presented in Table 1, Figure 1, Supplemental Figure S3 and Supplemental Figure S4, a picture emerges that illustrates how common the phenomenon of overall Trp oxidation is and more specifically how oxidized Trp14 across species is playing a similar role in possibly activating D1 turnover. I think these Figures, if presented in a more comprehensive and unified fashion, will really add to the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. In this study, we tried to show the identified oxidized Trp by the MS-MS analysis, the residue conservation in the sequences, and its position in the structure. Since we have to show a lot of information, combining them into one figure is difficult. We hope you understand the reason for this.</p></body></sub-article></article>
