micro-environments. The initial steps of angiogenesis depend on robust differentiation of oligopotent endothelial cells into the Tip and Stalk phenotypic cell fates, controlled by NOTCH-dependent cell–cell communication. The dynamics of spatial patterning of this cell fate specification are only partially understood. Here, by combining a controlled experimental angiogenesis model with mathematical and computational analyses, we find that the regular spatial Tip–Stalk cell patterning can undergo an order–disorder transition at a relatively high input level of a pro-angiogenic factor VEGF. The resulting differentiation is robust but temporally unstable for most cells, with only a subset of presumptive Tip cells leading sprout extensions. We further find that sprouts form in a manner maximizing their mutual distance, consistent with a Turing-like model that may depend on local enrichment and depletion of fibronectin. Together, our data suggest that NOTCH signaling mediates a robust way of cell differentiation enabling but not instructing subsequent steps in angiogenic morphogenesis, which may require additional cues and self-organization mechanisms. This analysis can assist in further understanding of cell plasticity underlying angiogenesis and other complex morphogenic processes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Blood vessels are vital for transporting blood containing oxygen, nutrients and waste around the body. To maintain this function, new blood vessels are continually formed through a process called angiogenesis. Often triggered in areas requiring oxygen, new blood vessels form from existing vessels as ‘sprouts’ in response to elevated levels of a signaling molecule called vascular endothelial growth factor (or VEGF for short).</p><p>For ‘sprouting’ to occur, endothelial cells lining the parental blood vessel must become either ‘Tip’ or ‘Stalk’ cells. Tip cells lead the extension of the blood vessel sprouts, while Stalk cells proliferate rapidly, ensuring the growth of the sprout. Correct spatial arrangement of these different cell types is crucial for the development of functional blood vessels.</p><p>Previous work has shown that VEGF promotes differentiation of endothelial cells lining blood vessels into different cell types. In neighboring cells, a signaling pathway known as NOTCH is activated due to interactions between adjacent cells, promoting differentiation of Tip cells and Stalk cells. Ideally, Tip cells are spaced out by intervals of Stalk cells to allow separate sprouts to form. Throughout this process, a single cell can receive contradictory signals, with VEGF promoting Tip cell formation and NOTCH signaling promoting Stalk cell differentiation. It remained unclear how the right cells are formed in the right places when surrounded by these conflicting inputs.</p><p>To better understand these dynamics Kang, Bocci et al. combined a laboratory model of angiogenesis with mathematical modelling. Experiments using these approaches showed that the overall pattern of cell type specification induced by VEGF and NOTCH signaling is consistent with so-called order-disorder transition, commonly observed in crystals in other ordered structures. For blood vessel cells, this transition means that they can still robustly take on either the Tip or Stalk cell identities, but this fate selection is not stable in time. Additionally, the overall pattern is much more sensitive to additional cues and self-organization mechanisms. Further analysis revealed that one such cue can be local fluctuations the density of fibronectin, a key pro-angiogenic extracellular component, leading to formation of sprouts that tend to distance themselves as much as possible from other fully formed sprouts.</p><p>These findings provide a framework for understanding NOTCH-mediated patterning processes in the context of responding to a variety of environmental cues. This sensitivity in cell type specification is important for determining the dynamic nature of the initial steps of angiogenesis and may be crucial for understanding growth of new blood vessels in damaged organs, cancer and other diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>angiogenesis</kwd><kwd>NOTCH signaling</kwd><kwd>order–disorder transition</kwd><kwd>Tip–Stalk fate</kwd><kwd>Turing pattern</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>NIH</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NCI U54 CA209992</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Levchenko</surname><given-names>Andre</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Mia Neri Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kang</surname><given-names>Tae-Yun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>NSF</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PHY-2019745</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Onuchic</surname><given-names>José N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>NSF</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NSF-PHY-2210291</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Onuchic</surname><given-names>José N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004917</institution-id><institution>Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CPRIT Scholar in Cancer Research</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Onuchic</surname><given-names>José N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000893</institution-id><institution>Simons Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>594598</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nie</surname><given-names>Qing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>NSF</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DMS1763272</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bocci</surname><given-names>Federico</given-names></name><name><surname>Nie</surname><given-names>Qing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The transition from a restrictive patterning mechanism to one sensitive to a variety of environmental cues in NOTCH-mediated angiogenesis offers crucial insights into vascularization in damaged organs and cancer therapy.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Angiogenesis, that is, the formation of new blood vessels from the pre-existing ones, is a striking example of phenotypic plasticity in an adult differentiated endothelium. Pro-angiogenic factors secreted in response to hypoxic conditions, particularly the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), specify differentiation of endothelial cells lining blood vessels into diverse phenotypic states, including the pro-migratory Tip cell phenotype. Tip cells can initiate invasive cell migration into the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM), leading to sprouting and branching of the nascent vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams and Alitalo, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Potente et al., 2011</xref>). Tip cells are differentiated from Stalk cells, another phenotypic state, through juxtacrine cell–cell interaction between these cell types involving NOTCH1 signaling, triggered and modulated by induction of Dll4 and Jag1 ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benedito et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blanco and Gerhardt, 2013</xref>). Stalk cells can therefore form in immediate proximity of Tip cells, particularly, at the leading edge of an extending sprout, if the NOTCH signaling is sufficiently pronounced for the Tip–Stalk differentiation to occur. Proliferation of Stalk cells is as essential as the invasive migration of Tip cells for the emergence, extension and branching of growing sprouts, making the analysis of coordinated Tip and Stalk specification particularly important.</p><p>The inputs specifying the cell fate can be potentially contradictory, for example, with pro-angiogenic factors, such as VEGF, promoting the Tip cell fate, and the NOTCH signaling activated by the neighboring cells promoting the Stalk cell fate and thus suppressing the Tip cell identity in the same cell. These and other signaling inputs can thus be incoherent in terms of cell fate specification and can result in complex dynamic outcomes that are still poorly understood. Further elucidation of these processes thus requires high-resolution, quantitative experimental measurements tightly coupled with computational analysis. Since such measurements are still challenging in vivo, particularly in mammalian tissues, use of tissue models recapitulating the salient features of the developing vasculature is a key tool in the current analysis of angiogenesis and development of de novo vascular beds.</p><p>Previously, we and others have developed a set of micro-fabricated experimental angiogenesis models that have had progressively improved biomimetic characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nguyen et al., 2013</xref>). These characteristics include spatially and biochemically appropriate cell micro-environments, composed of components of the ECM and of gradients of growth factors and cytokines around the developing vasculature, which is composed of endothelial cells and pericytes.</p><p>We have previously used this approach to map different combinations of VEGF and an inflammatory cytokine, Tumor necrosis factor (TNF), onto pro- and anti-angiogenic outcomes, modeling frequently encountered angiogenesis conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kang et al., 2019</xref>). This analysis provided evidence that ‘mini-sprouts’ — one-cell structures protruding from the parental blood vessel into the surrounding matrix — were comprised of Tip cells. However, it was not clear whether all such ‘mini-sprouts’ would ultimately develop into more mature multicellular sprouts with defined lumens and the potential to form new blood vessels. Furthermore, although our analysis was successful in explaining the fraction of Tip cells formed under different conditions, it was not clear how to account for the spatial aspects of the Tip cell and mature sprout specification, such as their mutual separation and density.</p><p>We address these challenges here by extending our analysis to a higher temporal and spatial resolution, both in experimental and mathematical models of angiogenic sprouting. Surprisingly, we found that the formation of mini-sprouts was a highly dynamic process, in which they could either retract after extension or form full-fledged sprouts. Furthermore, the experimentally determined spatial positioning of mini-sprouts was well explained by the predicted locations of the Tip cells in the mathematical model but the model could not account for which of the mini-sprouts would become fully formed sprouts. Further analysis revealed that the stable sprout formation from mini-sprouts can be enabled by the local fluctuations of the density of fibronectin, a key pro-angiogenic ECM component, leading to sparse patterns where sprouts tend to maximally distance themselves from other fully formed sprouts. These results reveal some of the key mechanisms that may define the density of the angiogenically formed vascular beds under diverse conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Dynamic angiogenesis can be explored in a 3D biomimetic experimental setup</title><p>To investigate the properties of angiogenic patterning and cell fate specification, we used an experimental model previously employed to assess the crosStalk between pro-angiogenic and pro-inflammatory stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kang et al., 2019</xref>). In this experimental setup, angiogenesis occurs from a 3D parental engineered endothelial vessel embedded in the collagen matrix and exposed to exogenously supplied VEGF and other pro-angiogenic factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). In agreement with prior observations, we found that this setup resulted in formation of both one-cell extensions into the matrix (mini-sprouts) and full-fledged multicellular sprouts containing detectable lumens and pronounced leading Tip cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Sprouts displayed a variety of growth stages, including the very early ones, composed of one lumenized cell or pairs of connected cells, also forming a lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Although mini-sprouts formed throughout the observation area of the vessel, sprouts developed within specific zones, while other zones remained devoid of detectable sprout formation over the course of the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>). These observations suggested that cell fate specification and sprout formation are dynamic processes that may display diverse local outcomes. We therefore set out to characterize these processes in the context of an accessible and well-defined analysis tool that can allow to contrast experimental findings with mathematical models of angiogenic patterning, particularly those based on the commonly assumed NOTCH receptor-mediated cell–cell interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Analysis of temporal and spatial regulation of angiogenic fate specification in a 3D biomimetic experimental setup.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) 3D vessel model for inducing angiogenesis in response to a gradient of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).

In the new model, we replicated within each cell the signaling network incorporating the NOTCH and VEGF pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Prior analysis of this model on the level of two adjacent cells predicted the emergence of bistability between a (high NOTCH, low Delta) Stalk phenotype and a (low NOTCH, high Delta) Tip phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boareto et al., 2015b</xref>). This result is consistent with the overall expectation of the differentiation effect of Delta–NOTCH signaling, which in 2D is further expected to generate ‘salt-and-pepper’ patterns, with a single Tip cell surrounded by six Stalk cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bocci et al., 2020</xref>), yielding the overall fraction of Tip cells in this arrangement of 25%. However, this simple bistability and spatial patterning picture can be altered by signaling inputs that potentially conflict with those involved in Delta–NOTCH signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). For example, the VEGF pro-angiogenic factor promoting the Tip cell fate, can conflict with the NOTCH signaling activated by the neighboring cells that instead promotes the Stalk cell fate while suppressing the Tip cell identity. This might result in disordered patterns with adjacent Tip cells that deviate from the archetypical salt-and-pepper configuration. To explore the properties of this disordering effect, we ran simulations, in which the VEGF–NOTCH signaling occurred in all individual cells within a hexagonal array of the model multicellular endothelium, starting from randomized initial conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The fully equilibrated patterns were then analyzed for distributions of the simulated Delta and NOTCH expression across the cells. We found for a wide range of VEGF inputs that the distributions of Delta and NOTCH displayed largely bimodal distributions, and the levels of the average Delta expression increased with the increasing input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>) due to positive effect of the activated VEGF receptor on Delta (see again the circuit in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Nevertheless, the clear overall bimodality allowed us to consistently classify cells into the Delta-high (Tip) and Delta-low (Stalk) cell states and examine the spatial distribution of these cellular subtypes (see Method: Definition of Tip cells in the model).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Robust differentiation and order–disorder transition are suggested by mathematical and experimental analyses.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Right: An example of a pattern after full equilibration on a 30 × 30 hexagonal lattice.

At relatively low VEGF levels, the patterns were mostly ordered, with small deviations from the expected ‘salt-and-paper’ geometry with a 25–75% ratio of Tip–Stalk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). However, as the VEGF input increased, the fraction of Tips grew and the patterns became sharply more disordered over a relatively narrow range of magnitude of the VEGF input, which could be identified as a highly sensitive area separating more ‘ordered-like’ and ‘disordered-like’ patterns. Finally, increasing VEGF stimuli beyond the highly sensitive area further increased the disorder of the patterns, but with a lower VEGF sensitivity, over several more orders of magnitude of VEGF inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D, E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Spatial patterns in the disordered phase at high VEGF input levels were characterized by much higher fractions of Tip cells that were frequently in contact with each other as quantified by a ‘disorder index’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>). This transition was reminiscent of the order–disorder transition commonly observed and studied in the change of the order of atoms in various substances as a function of temperature, and in other chemical systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bu et al., 2022</xref>). As expected for these types of transitions, increasing or decreasing the order-stabilizing Delta–NOTCH cell–cell signaling, resulted in the corresponding shifts of the ranges of VEGF inputs, over which the sharp order–disorder transition occurred. For example, a small increment or decrease in the cellular production of the Delta ligand shifted the order–disorder transition to either lower or higher VEGF inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). As the broad sweep of the VEGF inputs simulated in the mathematical model is likely beyond the range of receptor sensitivity for the experimental VEGF signaling, we contrasted the predicted fractions of Tip cells with the previously made observations in the 3D experimental angiogenesis model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. We found that, for the VEGF = 10 ng/ml<italic>,</italic> the experimentally determined fraction of the Tip cells was 0.02 ± 0.08 (mean ± standard deviation [SD]), that is, encompassing the fraction of 0.25 expected for the completely ordered, ‘salt-and-pepper’ Tip cell distribution pattern. However, for VEGF = 100 ng<italic>/</italic>ml the experimentally observed Tip cell fraction was 0.32 ± 0.01 (mean ± SD), which corresponded to the disordered state predicted by the model under higher VEGF inputs. We therefore concluded that the transition between order and disorder can occur in the 10–100 ng/ml range of VEGF concentration, allowing us to investigate the properties of the disordered state and its relationship to the spatial frequency of sprout formation. Based on the Tip/Stalk cell ratio, we calibrated the model’s parameters so that a VEGF input of 100 ng/ml matched the experimentally observed Tip/Stalk fractions at the same experimental VEGF input (see Methods: Mathematical model of VEGF/NOTCH signaling).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Precise quantification of Tip cell spatial arrangement suggests disordered patterning in the engineered angiogenesis model</title><p>To enable the comparison between the modeling predictions and experimental observations, we first quantified the spatial patterning characteristics of the inferred positions of the Tip cells in the experimental angiogenesis model. As in our prior analysis using this experimental approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kang et al., 2019</xref>), we identified Tip cells based on their key <italic>phenotypic</italic> characteristic — invasive migration into the surrounding collagen matrix. As suggested above, Tip cells can either be present in the form of ‘mini-sprouts’ or be at the Tips of sprouts containing recognizable lumens (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> for examples of this classification). Since formation of both mini-sprouts and lumenized sprouts involved emergence of Tip cells specified in endothelial cell monolayer lining the parental vessel, we constructed a two-dimensional map of the experimentally inferred spatial positions of Tip cells at the location of all mini-sprouts and sprouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A , B</xref>). This mapping (see Methods: Quantification of Tip–Tip cell distance in experiments) assumed that the Stalk cells found in the extending sprouts emerge through cell proliferation, rather by Stalk cell migration from the parental vessel. Experimentally, we used nuclear staining to identify non-Tip cells. Since the results above suggested that the cell fates and their patterns in our experimental setup were consistent with the ordered or somewhat disordered ‘salt-and-paper’ patterns, we further assumed that all the non-Tip cells adopted the Stalk fates (in the sense of Delta-low, NOTCH-high status, alternative to the Tip cell fate). The resulting map of experimentally specified Tip and Stalk cell locations was then used to calculate the shortest distances between Tip cells, measured in ‘cell hops’, that is, the minimal number of intermediate cells between randomly chosen pairs of Tip cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). These distances included Stalk cells exclusively, and no intermediate Tip cells. If two or more Tip cells were at equal distance from a given other Tip cell, their distance ranking was assigned randomly (e.g., two Tip cells at the equal minimal distance to a given Tip cell, would be randomly assigned the ranking of the closest and second closest Tip cell). We then analyzed these data for the VEGF<sub>EXT</sub> = 100 ng/ml experimental input which resulted in the most robust sprouting, comparing the results with the predictions of our mathematical model for the same input level that, when averaging over multiple simulations, matched the experimentally measured fraction of Tip cells. Finally, we quantified the shortest paths separating Tip cells in the equilibrated patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and Methods: Quantification of Tip–Tip cell distance in modeling).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Experimentally measured spatial distribution of Tip cells defined as constituting mini-sprouts and leading sprouts is consistent with the mathematical model predictions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Analysis pipeline to infer the 2D Tip–Stalk arrangements from 3D experimental images: experimental labeling of the nuclei of sprout/mini-sprout cells (above the plane of the parental vessel) and of the Stalk cells (below the plane of the parental vessel) is used to ‘compress’ the cells in each sprout or mini-sprout into a single Tip cell.

We found that these distance distributions closely agreed with the modeling predictions, particularly for the distances up to the fourth closest neighbor, differing substantially from the predictions for the ordered ‘salt-and-pepper’ patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). A key finding was that, in agreement with the expectation from the disordered pattern model, there were frequent cases of direct contact between two Tip cells, making the average distance to the closest Tip cell around 0.5 cells in the model. In contrast, two Tip cells were always separated by at least one Stalk cell in ‘traditional’ ‘salt-and-pepper’ models. As a baseline comparison, the mathematical model with a 100-fold reduction of VEGF stimulus (1 ng/ml) exhibited a Tip–Tip distance statistics more closely comparable with the ‘salt-and-pepper’ models. Further analysis of the experimental distributions of Tip cell distances revealed that Tip cells were adjacent to at least one other Tip cell with 80% chance, and with at least two other Tip cells with 40% chance, and with at least three other Tip cells with 20% chance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). These Tip cell distance distributions were again in agreement with the modeling results. Taken together these findings provided strong evidence for the predicted partially disordered pattern of Tip cell specification. In our experiments, the observed cell–cell contact area varied, spanning from almost corner-to-corner contact up to approximately 50 µm. Previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shaya et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kwak et al., 2022</xref>) have clearly demonstrated the influence of the cell–cell contact area on NOTCH signaling, but the values get nosy in the middle range, particularly when excluding extremely low cell–cell contact areas. Reflecting these findings, we excluded the corner contacts, which might correspond to extremely low cell–cell contact areas, from the Tip–Tip distance measurements as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>. We also made an assumption that variations in cell–cell contact size within tens of microns correlate weakly with the strength of NOTCH signaling. This assumption did not impede our effort to compare the overall trends with results from modeling using hexagonal cells, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D, E</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Dynamic tracking of angiogenic cell fate specification</title><p>The integrative, computational, and experimental analysis presented above suggested that the spatial Tip cell distribution can be well explained by the model of a partially disordered ‘salt-and-pepper’ mechanism. However, it is not clear whether all such Tip cells would spearhead the formation of a new sprout, or retract back to an alternative (Stalk) cell fate. We addressed this question by dynamically tracking the fates of mini-sprouts to examine whether this state is an intermediate step toward the sprout formation. Specifically, we imaged the progress of sprouting in the same areas of a live parental vessel at different time points of 1, 3, 7, and 28 hr of incubation in 100 ng/ml of VEGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–H</xref>). We found that all sprouts formed either directly from Stalks or from mini-sprouts, suggesting a non-observed transition from Stalk to mini-sprout due to observational timeframe limitations. Strikingly, however, not all mini-sprouts persisted and initiated sprout formation. Instead, many mini-sprouts retracted and new mini-sprouts formed during the time-course of the analysis. We then tracked a group of 118 cells that adopted the mini-sprout phenotype at least once over a period of 28 hr after VEGF exposure. Their state change dynamics was visualized using the Sankey diagram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). The initial state of any sprouts or mini-sprouts was classified as the Stalk cell to reflect the hypothesized ‘salt-and-pepper’ patterning structure, entirely consisting of either Tip or Stalk cells. When a mini-sprout retracted, it was newly marked as a Stalk cell. By the final time point of 28 hr of VEGF exposure, 45.8% of the cells that displayed the mini-sprout phenotype at least once during the experiment retracted back to the Stalk state, illustrating the highly dynamic phenotype of mini-sprout extensions and retractions. Of the remaining cells, 41.5% and 12.7% were classified to be either in the mini-sprout or sprout-leading Tip cell states, respectively. Although sprout formation continued throughout the experiment, the rate of conversion of mini-sprouts to full-fledged sprouts gradually decreased over time, with 13.6%, 2.9%, and 7.5% of mini-sprouts becoming sprout-leading Tip cells in the time ranges of 1–3, 3–7, and 7–28 hr, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K–M</xref>). In most cases (86.7%), sprouts emerged from <italic>newly formed</italic> mini-sprouts (i.e., the cells that were Stalk cells and then mini-sprouts in the preceding two time points), suggesting that mini-sprouts represent transient states rapidly converting to either the fully committed sprout state or to the Stalk state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4O</xref>). These observations raised the question of what might define the commitment of a mini-sprout to the sprout differentiation. We next addressed this question by analyzing the spatial distribution of fully formed sprouts over the observed area of the parental vessel.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The dynamics of mini-sprout and sprout formation suggest frequent mini-sprout retractions, since only a subset of mini-sprouts becoming fully formed sprouts.</title><p>Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing endothelium in the 3D vessel setup captured 1 hr (<bold>A</bold>), 3 hr (<bold>B</bold>), 7 hr (<bold>C</bold>), and 28 hr (<bold>D</bold>) after 100 ng/ml of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment.

To identify the underlying principles of sprout initiation, we thus integrated the multicell model with several alternative phenomenological hypotheses (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–D</xref>). We then tested these hypotheses against the measured distributions of distances between sprouts and, in particular, the observation that sprouts were always separated by at least one non-sprout cell (blue bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). In these tests, we ensured that the results were normalized to the overall density of sprouts observed experimentally (see Method: Phenomenological models of Sprout selection). The first straightforward hypothesis was that mini-sprouts commit to the sprout phenotype independently of the location of other forming sprouts, constituting the ‘cell-autonomous sprout selection’ model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, B</xref>). In this case, however, the corresponding model predicted multiple contacts between sprouts (black line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), in sharp contrast with the experimental observation. The observation that most sprouts are in contact with at least another Tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>), but never in contact with another sprout, suggested a control mechanism where sprout selection inhibits nearby Tip cells from committing to the same fate. This led to two additional alternative hypotheses. In ‘repulsion between sprouts’ model, it was assumed that sprouts cannot be in contact; therefore, Tip cells cannot commit to the sprout phenotype if already in contact with a sprout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In the ‘random uniform’ model, it was assumed that sprouts are selected randomly, but maximizing their overall spread in the lattice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>; see Method: Phenomenological models of Sprout selection). While both models correctly predicted sprouts to never be in contact, the ‘random uniform’ model better described the cases where adjacent sprouts are separated by two or more cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>The phenomenological model favoring maximal sprout–sprout distances for a given number of sprouts (random uniform distribution) is most consistent with the experimental observations.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) An example of one-dimenstional Tip cell distribution, including a sprout and mini-sprouts, and Stalks pattern.

We focused on the ECM as a possible medium accounting for the positive and negative pattern-setting interactions. Indeed recently, it has been observed that collagen can be re-organized by the growing sprouts, so that it is concentrated around the extending sprouts and depleted elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Senk and Djonov, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kirkpatrick et al., 2007</xref>). We explored whether a similar distribution is also be observed for fibronectin, an ECM component that is critical for the formation of lumenized sprouts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alon et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wijelath et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Astrof and Hynes, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bayless et al., 2000</xref>). Fibronectin expression levels in the vicinity of individual cells comprising the parental vessel and the emerging sprouts was experimentally assessed by immunostaining, with simultaneous cell identification using induced cytoplasmic GFP expression and nuclear staining, followed by 3D reconstruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–H</xref>). Untreated quiescent cells (No treatment) and mini-sprouts showed similar levels of fibronectin expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). Interestingly, the fibronectin expression was highly enriched at the base but not the Tip areas of the extending sprouts, suggesting that it may be a key determinant of sprout induction but not extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B, C, H</xref>). We also examine the regional variation of fibronectin expression in larger areas, which was less variable and potentially more relevant to sprout extension. In particular, we accessed the ratio of cells having fibronectin levels higher than a threshold in groups of seven cells around sprouts and mini-sprouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I, J</xref>). The overall expression levels when all region types were combined was relatively uniform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>), third panel.

Specifically, the fibronectin expression levels around sprouts were higher than the threshold, whereas the fibronectin levels around mini-sprouts were lower than the threshold. Altogether, these results supported the model in which fibronectin can indeed serve as a mediator of Turing-like induction of sprouting patterns, through re-modeling that enriches it at the points of sprout induction and depletes it at the points where Tip cells (mini-sprouts) are not stabilized to form full-fledged, lumenized sprouting bodies.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Fibronectin distribution on parental and newly formed vessels reveals preferred distribution at the bases of sprouts.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic describing cross-sectional planes for subsequent confocal images: (i) for (<bold>B</bold>), (ii) for (<bold>C</bold>), and (iii) for (<bold>D</bold>).

In the context of angiogenesis, this challenge more specifically relates to enabling effective vascular morphogenesis through robust yet environmentally responsive differentiation of endothelial cells into Tip and Stalk cells states. This process is guided by the multiple pro-angiogenic cues, such as VEGF and by the local tissue organization and mediated by the paracrine Delta–NOTCH cell signaling. Recent mathematical models of this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Galbraith et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Koon et al., 2018</xref>) have considered the robustness of the Delta–NOTCH differentiation to molecular noise, concluding that noisy biochemical reactions can both disrupt and enhance the spatial differentiation patterns, depending on the magnitude and spatial distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Galbraith et al., 2022</xref>). The effect of pro-angiogenic cues, such as VEGF on robustness of spatial differentiation patterning remains substantially less explored. Furthermore, compiling between modeling predictions and experimental validation has been challenged by the complexity of in vivo angiogenesis analysis, both on cellular and molecular levels.</p><p>Here, we integrated engineered experimental angiogenic assay and a spatially resolved computational modeling analysis to explore the spatially and temporally resolved effects of VEGF on angiogenic cell specification. Our results suggest that VEGF can have a dual role in inducing the initial Tip–Stalk cell differentiation. On the one hand, a low level of exogenous VEGF is essential to induce Delta–NOTCH signaling and the classical ordered ‘salt-and-pepper’ pattern, with approximately 25% of the cells adopting the Tip cell fate, as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Collier et al., 1996</xref>). This role of VEGF is conceptually similar to the classical case of EGF induced NOTCH signaling in <italic>C. elegans</italic> vulva development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shin and Reiner, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yoo et al., 2004</xref>). On the other hand, our results also suggest that an increase of VEGF levels can introduce disorder into this pattern, similar to order–disorder transition for various composite materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bu et al., 2022</xref>), which may occur with increasing temperature and have the properties of a sharp phase transition. More specifically, high VEGF levels may play the role similar to an increased temperature in order–disorder transitions, leading to emergence of partially disordered ‘salt-and-pepper’ structures. These disordered structures are characterized by higher than expected fractions of Tip cells and, consequently, an increased occurrences of otherwise disallowed adjacent Tip cells. Importantly, for all VEGF input levels and the resulting spatial patterns, the Tip–Stalk cell specification continued to be robust, although the degree of induction of NOTCH signaling was dependent on the VEGF dose. These results suggested that cell specification patterns deviating from the expected ‘salt-and-pepper’ one can develop not only due to noisy NOTCH signaling, as suggested by prior models, but also due to the control of the fractions of alternative cell states by the magnitude the pro-differentiation cue.</p><p>In spite of the observation that disordered ‘salt-and-pepper’ patterns still display robust differentiation, the spatial patterns of cell co-localization can generate inherent instabilities, for example, due to two adjacent Tips mutually suppressing their fate selection through NOTCH signaling. Instabilities of this sort may increase the sensitivity of the differentiation process to additional cues and can also lead to facilitated dynamic switching of cell fates (e.g., Tip to Stalk and vice versa) over prolonged periods of time. Such instabilities might lead to oscillatory-like fluctuations of NOTCH signaling as observed in other differentiation processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Venzin and Oates, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kageyama et al., 2010</xref>) and in endothelial cell sheets under high VEGF concentration inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ubezio et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, these instabilities may also underlie the striking observation of the continuous retraction and extension of mini-sprouts (protruding Tip cells) observed in our study. This dynamic fate-switching behavior can thus represent a signature of an unstable differentiation process that may either stabilize, in response to additional cues, leading to a specific morphogenetic outcome, such as the extension of a stable sprout, or display a prolonged instability resulting in a lack of pronounced morphogenesis. Such poised but unstable states may be similar to the undifferentiated state of neurogenic progenitors displaying oscillatory NOTCH signaling, which can proceed to differentiation after the oscillation is resolved into a temporally stable NOTCH activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shimojo et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The cues stabilizing cellular differentiation and morphogenesis can vary and represent the signature of both global and local pro- and anti-angiogenic environments. For instance, our prior analysis indicated that exposure of model parental vessels to VEGF only rather than a more complete pro-angiogenic cocktail of various factors, can result in formation of mini-sprouts (and hence, effective Tip–Stalk cell differentiation), but not full-fledged sprouts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kang et al., 2019</xref>). Sprout formation may also be modulated by the presence of mural cells and pro-inflammatory cytokines, which can indirectly modulate the NOTCH activity, but could also have additional effects, serving to stabilize a specific differentiation outcome. However, even if sprouts do form, it is not clear how their spatial distribution may arise and be potentially controlled by the environmental inputs. Our results argue that, for a given number of sprouts forming in the parental vessel, their mutual distances are maximized. This spatial distribution is consistent with a Turing-like mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Turing, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Maini et al., 2006</xref>), implying the existence of a long-distance interaction inhibiting formation of new sprouts in the vicinity of the existing ones. Although the actual mechanism of putative Turning-like pattern formation is not fully elucidated here, our results are consistent with a variant of this regulatory behavior, in which a component of the ECM, fibronectin is actively redistributed by the nascent sprouts, with this ECM component being enriched at the points of sprout formation, but depleted in other zones, thus preventing sprout induction in the depleted areas. This redistribution is indeed equivalent to the classical Turing mechanisms that would involve generation of an explicitly inhibitory compound by the growing sprouts. Fibronectin has been implicated as a key pro-angiogenic ECM component, possibly due to its integration with VEGF, which further increases the plausibility of this mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wijelath et al., 2006</xref>). Interestingly, we find elevated levels of fibronectin at the bases of extending sprouts, but not at their Tips. This finding has two implications. First, fibronectin may be an important factor in the sprout induction rather than extension, hence the growing sprout can progress into the surrounding matrix beyond the area of enriched fibronectin, leaving it behind. Secondly, fibronectin can also promote lumen formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Astrof and Hynes, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bayless et al., 2000</xref>), thus its enrichment at the bases of extending sprouts can further contribute to their lumenized structure. Furthermore, this mechanism can help explain the dramatic influence of cytokines, such as TNF, in preventing sprout formation, which can happen in sharp, TNF dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kang et al., 2019</xref>). Indeed, TNF avidly binds to fibronectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alon et al., 1994</xref>) and therefore, at high enough concentrations, would have a particular anti-angiogenic effect in the areas of increased fibronectin density, which according to the proposed mechanism would be the areas of incipient sprouts. This would dramatically increase its anti-sprouting effect, even if the effect of this cytokine on the NOTCH-dependent cell specification is more muted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kang et al., 2019</xref>). Of note, another version of the Turing mechanism has recently been suggested to account for the branching of the sprouts, also involving formation of new Tip cells leading individual branches, although the molecular mechanism postulated in that analysis was distinct from the one proposed here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Xu et al., 2017</xref>). These models, though plausible, will need to be further tested to ascertain causality of the proposed mechanisms, although at this stage the Turing-like mechanisms appear to be the best candidates to explain the experimental results we obtained.</p><p>Overall, our analysis supports the following dynamic view of angiogenic induction. The VEGF input can induce NOTCH signaling and formation of Tip cells that can behave as mini-sprouts. At lower VEGF input, a more ordered pattern of Tip cell induction can lead to formation of approximately 25% of Tip cells, but relatively few of these will become sprouts, reflecting lower sensitivity to additional ambient cues, promoting sprout formation. On the other hand, at higher VEGF inputs, a greater disorder of Tip cell patterning permits higher sensitivity to external cues, such as fibronectin, that can stabilize the sprouting. In addition, a more frequent co-localization of Tip cells under this condition enables initiation of a sprout from two adjacent cells, as observed in a fraction of cases in our experiments (the case in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> involving formation of a sprout by two adjacent cells). The initial emergence of sprouts leads to a progressively less likely sprout formation and to the overall maximization of the distance between the sprouts. Both these observations are consistent with non-local inhibition of sprout formation around the sprouts that have already formed. A plausible mechanism for this inhibition and the overall pattern formation is the redistribution of fibronectin from the zones between sprouts toward the incipient sprouts, constituting both a positive and negative feedback loops, commonly assumed in a variant of the Turing patterns from action. This mechanism is very sensitive to various local inputs distinct from VEGF and fibronectin, which can further influence the location and density of the developing blood vessels. These may include the effects of pericytes or local inflammatory environments, as mentioned above, but also other ECM components, such as collagens, that may enhance the protrusion of Tip cells and thus stabilize the emergent sprouts both directly and indirectly. Endothelial fate induction process may be interesting to contrast with other complex multicellular processes, including collective epithelial migration, where NOTCH signaling similarly modulates fine-grained patterns of leader and follower cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vilchez Mercedes et al., 2021</xref>), and underscore the need in the future to develop more refined models that explicitly integrate the interconnections between biochemical and mechanical regulation of Tip–Stalk fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Stassen et al., 2020</xref>). The results in this study can further inform our understanding of angiogenesis in physiological and patho-physiological conditions. In particular, in many circumstances, the levels of VEGF are determined by the degree of hypoxia, which can be highly elevated following oxygen supply interruption, for example, in wound healing or ischemia, or due to progression of neoplastic growth. Our results suggest that in these cases, formation of sprouts can be dysregulated due to higher incidences of co-localizations of prospective Tip cells. In addition, since these conditions are frequently accompanied by altered synthesis of ECM, the sprout density can increase, which may lead to formation of denser and less developed vascular beds frequently observed as a result of tumor angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ruoslahti, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chung et al., 2010</xref>). Our results thus suggest that the disorder and higher plasticity of the endothelial cell fate speciation at higher VEGF inputs can be a key contributor to some pathological states associated with persistently hypoxic conditions.</p><p>The analysis presented here highlights the utility of combining experimental engineered vasculature models with mathematical analysis as integrated research platforms to gain a progressively better insight into angiogenesis in highly controlled micro-environments. Although, questions remain about the mechanistic underpinnings of the phenomena observed here and in related studies, the analysis enabled by these model systems can help formulate guiding hypotheses for further understanding of angiogenesis in vivo, while decoupling the complexities of the native angiogenic environments. We anticipate that the dynamic exploration presented here can help pave the way for further quantitative understanding of this key biological process.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant Anti-Fibronectin antibody<break/>(Rabbit monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">abcam</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ab268020</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IF (1:50)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Goat anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L) Highly Cross-Adsorbed Secondary Antibody, Alexa Fluor Plus 594<break/>(Goat polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Invitrogen</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">A32740</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IF (1:100)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Animal-Free Recombinant Human FGF-basic (bFGF)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PeproTech</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AF10018B</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">VEGF Recombinant Human Protein</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Life Technologies</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PHC9394</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sphingosine-1-phosphate</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">S9666</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Phorbol myristate acetate</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">P1585</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Biological sample (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells transfected with GFP-expressing lentivirial particles.</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Angio-Proteomie</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">cAP-0002GFP</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Isolated from normal human brain tissue</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IMARIS 9.8.0</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Bitplane</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imaris.oxinst.com">https://imaris.oxinst.com</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PRISM 9.0.0</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GraphPad</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.graphpad.com/features">https://www.graphpad.com/features</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jupyter Notebook 6.1.6</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Project Jupyter</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://jupyter.org/install">https://jupyter.org/install</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Python 3.12.1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Python Software Foundation</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.python.org">https://www.python.org</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Other</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Hoechst 33342</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Thermo Fisher</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">H3570</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IF (5 µg/ml)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fabrication of 3D vessel chip</title><p>Chips for mimicking 3D angiogenesis in vitro were fabricated as introduced in our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kang et al., 2019</xref>).

rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). A strong NOTCH–Jagged interaction can suppress Tip–Stalk differentiation and instead lead to a hybrid Tip/Stalk phenotype, which is beyond the scope of the current study. For completeness, we maintained the integrity of the entire circuit structure including NOTCH–Jagged interactions (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3">Equation 1c</xref>) but fixed the production rate of Jagged at a low level that does not interfere with the bistable behavior of the VEGF/NOTCH circuit.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Definition of Tip cells in the model</title><p>Tip cells — usually defined as high Delta, low NOTCH cells — are defined in this model as cells with Delta levels larger than 10<sup>3</sup> molecules. This definition is motivated by observing that the distribution of cellular Delta at steady state in the multicell model is always bimodal irrespectively of the level of external VEGF input (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), with a large separation between the population of cells with low Delta levels (the Stalk cells) and the population of cells with high Delta levels (the Tip cells). This phenomenological definition suffices here due to the deterministic nature of the model; otherwise, more complex approaches would be necessary in presence of stochastic fluctuations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Galbraith et al., 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Simulation details</title><p>All results are calculated on a 30 × 30 hexagonal lattice with periodic boundary conditions.

Afterwards, the lattice equilibrates for 100 hr without any VEGF input to simulate the seeding of endothelial cells before VEGF is provided.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Quantification of Tip–Tip distance in experiments</title><p>Fluorescence microscopy images of Hoechst 33342/phalloidin staining from our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kang et al., 2019</xref>), two images for each VEGF condition, were used to quantify the distance between Tips. Before counting Tip–Tip distance, images were pre-processed to clean up intricate 3D images as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> with IMARIS (Bitplane). First, all newly formed vessels were separated from parental vessels, identified as surface entities, and labeled with different colors depending on lumen formation: red for sprout and blue for mini-sprout. And all nuclei were detected as spots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, label nuclei on the parental vessel and Tip region). In this step, nuclei on the parental vessel region were marked as Stalks and the nuclei in sprout or mini-sprout surfaces were marked as Tips. Second, the nuclei of Stalks on the parental vessel region were re-examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), Re-label Tip and Stalk nuclei. If they are connected to sprout or mini-sprout surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams and Alitalo, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Potente et al., 2011</xref>), they were re-labeled as nuclei of sprouts or mini-sprouts and all other nuclei in the sprout or the mini-sprout were deleted. If a nucleus of a sprout or a mini-sprout is not in the parental vessel, the closest nucleus to the parental vessel was labeled as a sprout or a mini-sprout and all other nuclei were deleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). By going through these steps, we could derive 2D conceptual Tip–Stalk arrangements from 3D images, which are comparable to 2D Tip–Stalk patterns from mathematical modeling. The pre-process is based on our assumption that the Stalk cells found in the extending sprouts emerge de novo through cell proliferation, rather by Stalk cell migration from the parental vessel.</p><p>In this study, we defined the distance between two Tips as the number of cells measured in ‘cell hops’, that is, the minimal number of intermediate cells between randomly chosen pairs of Tip cells. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, the distances from Tip 1 to Tip 2 and to Tip 3 are 0 and 1, respectively. From Tip 1 to Tip 4, the distance is 3 in the minimal cell hops marked with gray arrows which pass through another Tip. Another cell hops marked with red arrows does not include any Tips, but the distance is 4. In this case, we discarded Tip 4 in the quantification of Tip–Tip distance from Tip 1. The same rule was applied in analyzing Tip–Tip distance from mathematical modeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Quantification of Tip–Tip distance in modeling</title><p>Upon complete lattice equilibration, cells naturally separate into two distinct groups based on low or high expression of Delta irrespectively of the external VEGF input (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Therefore, high-Delta cells are labeled as Tips and low-Delta cells are labeled as Stalk. The algorithm to compute distances between Tip cells on the hexagonal lattice follows the following two steps: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams and Alitalo, 2007</xref>) Computing the shortest path between a given pair of cells on the hexagonal grid; and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Potente et al., 2011</xref>) filtering out the measurement if the cell pair is ‘shielded’ by another Tip cell. First, the shortest path is defined as the minimum number of intermediate cells that connect the two cells of interest. Considering two cells with coordinates (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf44"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>) and (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf45"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>), their distance has different values based on the cells relative position.

Next, to maintain consistency with the experimental statistics, the distance is not included in the Tip cell distribution if there is at least one intermediate Tip cell ‘shielding’ the two Tip cells of interest. In the experimental protocol, an intermediate cell ‘shields’ the two Tip cells if the straight line connecting the centers of the two cells passes through the shielding cell. Therefore, we search the intercept between the line connecting the pair of Tip cells and a circle centered at the position of the shielding cell with radius of 0.5. Assuming a circular geometry for the shielding cell removes artifacts emerging due to the polygonal shape of cells in the hexagonal lattice. The sprout–sprout distance statistics presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> are similarly computed by applying the same algorithm to the set of Sprout cells in the lattice (see the following section for details of sprout selection).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Phenomenological models of sprout selection</title><p>We developed three separate models of sprout selection: ‘Cell-autonomous’, ‘Repulsion’, and ‘Random uniform distribution’. For all three cases, cells equilibrate in the hexagonal lattice. Then, Tip cells are defined based on high-Delta expression. This analysis produces a discrete snapshot of Tip and Stalk cells on the hexagonal lattice. When comparing the model prediction to the 100 ng/ml VEGF dosage experiment, we constrain the sprout selection models to reproduce the experimental sprout fraction. In the ‘Cell-autonomous’ model, a fraction of the Tip cells is randomly selected and defined as Sprouts independently from the phenotype of their neighbors. In the ‘Repulsion’ model, a fraction of Tip cells is randomly selected as Sprouts with the additional constraint that Sprouts cannot be in direct contact. To implement this constraint, we iteratively select Tips one at a time. If the selected Tip is not already in contact with a previously selected Sprout, it is promoted to the Sprout state; otherwise, a new Tip cell is selected. The iteration stops when the target number of Sprouts is reached. Finally, in the ‘Random uniform distribution’ model, Tips are selected as Sprouts to maximize their overall spread in the lattice. To implement this constraint, we first select a random Tip and promote it to the Sprout state. Then, the furthest Tip from the newly selected Sprout is selected and promoted to the Sprout state as well. Afterwards, a max-distance function is defined as the sum of pairwise distances between all Sprouts already selected in the lattice. At each following iteration, the Tip cell that maximizes the distance function is selected as a Sprout. The iteration stops when the target number of Sprouts is reached.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Sprout/mini-sprout tracking and analysis</title><p>3D vessel chips were kept in a CO<sub>2</sub> incubator at 37°C and taken out only for imaging at the time point depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D</xref>.

Ten sprouts, 11 mini-sprouts induced by VEGF 100 ng/ml, and 10 quiescent cells without VEGF treatment were selected to compare fibronectin intensity values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). Sprouts often had two compartments of a leading cell and following cells where lumenization occurs. We distinguished the leading sprout and the following sprout for the fibronectin intensity comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). If a sprout was composed of a single cell with lumen, the cell was classified as the following cell. Seven neighboring cells including a sprout or a mini-sprout in each image were grouped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>) to analyze the distribution of the ratio of cells having fibronectin levels higher than a threshold value of 30 (dashed line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). From 10 images, 21 groups were acquired and used for the analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>One-way ANOVA analysis was performed in GraphPad Prism 9.0.0 followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test.

For this, they use their earlier experimental setup of engineered blood vessels in combination with a modified spatio-temporal model for Notch signalling. The authors first study the role of VEGF on Tip (Delta-rich) and Stalk (Notch-rich) patterning. The Tip cells are further examined for their space-time dynamics as Mini-sprouts and mature Sprouts. The Notch signalling model is later supplemented with a phenomenological _random uniform model_ for Sprout selection as a plausible mechanism for Sprout formation from Mini-Sprouts. Finally, the authors look into the role of fibronectin in the Sprout formation process. Overall, the authors propose that VEGF interacts with Notch signalling in blood vessels to generate spatially disordered and co-localized Tip cells. VEGF and fibronectin then provide external cues to dynamically modulate mature Sprout formation from Mini-Sprouts that could control the location and density of developing blood vessels with a process that is consistent with a Turing-like mechanism.</p><p>Strengths and Weaknesses</p><p>In this manuscript, work motivation, problem definition, experimental procedures, analysis techniques, mathematical methods (including the parameters), and findings are all presented quite clearly. Moreover, the authors carefully indicate whenever they make any assumptions, and do not mix unproven hypothesis with deduced or known facts. The experimental techniques and most of the mathematical methods used in this paper are borrowed from the earlier works of the corresponding authors, and thus are not completely novel. However, the use of these ideas to provide a simple elucidation of the role of VEGF and fibronectin in Sprout formation, in an otherwise complex system, is very interesting and useful. Some of the data analysis methods presented in the paper - (i) quantification of Tip spatial patterns (Fig. 3) and (ii) Sprout temporal dynamics using Sankey diagram (Fig. 4) - seem quite novel to me in the context of Notch signalling literature. Similarly, the authors also provide a new mechanism (VEGF) to obtain disordered Delta-Notch patterning without explicitly including _noise_ in the system (Fig. 2 and Fig. S1). The authors also systematically quantify the statistics of spacing between the Sprouts and show that the Sprouts have a tendency to be away from each other, something that they could also partially recapitulate by additionally including a novel _random uniform model_ for Sprout selection (Fig. 5). Although the association between fibronectin and angiogenesis is known in the literature, in this manuscript, the authors could clearly demonstrate that fibronectin is present in high and low levels, respectively, around Sprouts and Mini-sprouts (Fig. 6). A combination of these findings could then motivate the authors to hypothesize, as mentioned above, a Turing-like mechanism for Sprout formation, something that I find interesting.</p><p>Although I find the relative simplicity of the experimental system and theoretical model and the clear findings they generate appealing, some aspects raise a few questions. The authors experimentally find 20 +- 0.08 percent of Tip cells in the model blood-vessels that is consistent with the salt-and-pepper pattern seen in Notch signalling model (~25 %). However, it is not clear to me if the reverse is true, i.e., 25% of Tip cells automatically imply a salt-and-pepper pattern - the authors do not seem to provide a direct experimental evidence. Furthermore, the authors use their Notch signalling model on a regular hexagonal lattice, but there is a large variability in the cell sizes (Fig. 3) in the experimental system. Since it is observed in the literature that signalling depends on the contact area between the neighbouring cells, it is not clear how that would affect the findings presented in this paper. Similarly, since some of the cells are quite small compared to the others, I worry how appropriate it is to express the distance between the Tip cells in terms of _cell numbers_ (Fig. 3). Regarding Sprout classification, as per Table 1, a bridge of two cells is formed as per early-stage-I mechanism for Sprout. On the other hand, the entire data interpretation of experiments seems to be based on early Stage II and matured stage in that same table (also Figs. 3 and 4) in which only one Tip cell seems to be counted per mature Sprout. However, if some Sprouts are formed via early stage-I mechanism, a projection in 2D for analysis would give a count of __two__ adjacent Tip cells, but corresponding to a __single__ Sprout. It could be possible that the presence of such two-cell Sprouts affects the statistics of inter-Sprout distances (Fig. 5). Finally, I find the proposed mechanism of Sprout formation dynamics to be somewhat unsatisfactory. Other than the experimental evidence regarding the spacing of Sprouts and the fibronectin levels around Sprouts and Mini-sprouts (Figs. 4 and 5), there is very little evidence to support the hypothesis about a Turing-like mechanism for Sprouting. Moreover, it seems to me that Turing patterns can appear in a wide variety of settings and could be applied to the current problem in an abstract manner without making any meaningful connections with the system variables. Also, from a modeling point of view, cell migration and mechanics, are expected to take a major part in Sprout formation, while cell division and inclusion would most likely influence Tip-Stalk cell formation. However, it seems that in the present work, these effects are coarse-grained into Notch signalling parameters and the Sprout selection model, thus making any experimental connection quite vague.</p><p>Overall Assessment</p><p>I feel that the authors, on the whole, do achieve their main goals. Although I have a few concerns that I have raised above, overall, I find the work presented in this manuscript to be a solid addition to the broad field of collective cell dynamics. The authors use well established experimental and mathematical methods while adding a few novel analysis techniques and modeling ideas to provide a compelling, albeit incomplete, picture of Sprout formation during angiogenesis. While the direct application of this work in the context of angiogenesis is obvious, the broad set of ideas and techniques (discussed above) in this work would also be useful to researchers who work on Notch signalling in morphogenesis, collective cell migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal-transition.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89262.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author Response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kang</surname><given-names>Tae-Yun</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Yale University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">New Haven</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bocci</surname><given-names>Federico</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California, Irvine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Irvine</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Nie</surname><given-names>Qing</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California, Irvine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Irvine</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Onuchic</surname><given-names>Jose N</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Rice University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Houston</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Levchenko</surname><given-names>Andre</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Yale University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">New Haven</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>1. A more thorough analysis of transition boundaries between different types of patterns would further strengthen the conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the transition between different patterning regimes should be discussed more quantitatively in the manuscript. Specifically, we identified a highly sensitive parameter range where the disorder in the patterns rapidly increases as a function of the VEGF stimulus. We have improved our discussion of the transition between ‘orderedlike’ patterns and ‘disordered-like’ patterns in the main text as follows: “At relatively low VEGF levels, the patterns were mostly ordered, with small deviations from the expected ‘salt and paper’ geometry with a 25%-75% ratio of TipStalk (Fig. 2D). However, as the VEGF input increased, the fraction of Tips grew and the patterns became sharply more disordered over a relatively narrow range of magnitude of the VEGF input, which could be identified as a highly sensitive area separating more ‘ordered-like’ and ‘disordered-like’ patterns. Finally, increasing VEGF stimuli beyond the highly sensitive area further increased the disorder of the patterns, but with a lower VEGF sensitivity, over several more orders of magnitude of VEGF inputs”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Please refer to the Public Comments above for a broad review. Below, I provide specific concerns that could be addressed.</p><p>Main comments</p><p>1. Is the salt-and-pepper model observed for the case when there is no VEGF in the experiments? It would be good to confirm the same. If not, the analysis presented in Fig. 3 could be performed for this case and used as a baseline while referring to the data in Fig. 3.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the referee for the interesting suggestion. The pattern predicted by the model is not strictly salt-and-pepper in absence of VEGF, but the disorder quantified in terms of “incorrect” contacts between Tip cells is considerably lower (see for example the disorder quantification in supplementary figure 1C). We have included the Tip-Tip contact statistics for a case of VEGF=1 ng/ml (100-fold lower that the level used in Fig. 3 compare between model and experiment). In this case, there is clearly more spacing between Tip cells, thus demonstrating how high VEGF stimuli increase the probability of contacts between Tip cells. In the main text, we commented: “As a baseline comparison, the mathematical model with a 100-fold reduction of VEGF stimulus (1 ng/ml) exhibited a Tip-Tip distance statistics more closely comparable with the ‘salt-and-pepper’ model”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

The model used here still exhibits a bistable behavior between the low-Delta and high-Delta cell states even in the absence of VEGF input, as seen for example in the cell state distribution of Fig. 2B, and in agreement with the original model by Boareto et al. This behavior is reflective of the more general applicability of the model, as it describes Delta-NOTCH interactions in various systems. For endothelial cells, VEGF is indeed required to trigger this interaction, but this was not the primary focus of the paper, hence the original model was used. In the text referred to by the reviewer, we are discussing the role,of VEGF based in its known biological effects as well as modeling results. We anticipate that the future further adaptation of the model to,endothelial cells will refine its description of of cell interactions in the absence of VEGF.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The size of cells (or spacing between cell nuclei) is highly variable (Fig. 3). Since it is known that the size of cell-cell junctions influences signalling, it would good to at least comment on the same, considering that the model in the paper consists of regular static hexagons. Similarly, it seems desirable to comment on expressing the distance between Tip cells (Fig. 3) in cell length units, when the cell lengths are so variable.</p></disp-quote><p>We concur with the suggestion that our consideration of the cell-cell contact size in NOTCH signaling should be clarified in the manuscript.</p><p>Sprinzak et al. reported in their 2017 article published in Developmental Cell that the cell-cell contact area does influence NOTCH Signaling. In this article, they found that NOTCH trans-endocytosis (TEC) for pairs with a larger contact width (25µm) is up to five times higher than for pairs with a smaller contact (2.5µm), as observed through the two-cell TEC assay. While TEC correlates with contact width across a range from 1 to 40µm, the values fluctuate significantly in the middle range, particularly when excluding extremely low cell-cell contact areas.</p><p>In our experiments, we observed that the cell-cell contact area ranges from essentially infinitesimal corner-to-corner contact to roughly 50µm. We excluded the corner contacts, which might correspond to extremely low cell-cell contact areas, from the Tip-Tip distance measurements as depicted in Fig. 3B. We also made the assumption that variations in cell-cell contact size within tens of microns correlate weakly with the strength of NOTCH signaling. This assumption did not impede our effort to compare the overall trends with results from modeling using hexagonal cells, as shown in Figs 6 D&amp;E. We have included this comment and the corresponding reference to elucidate our assumption in the results as follows: In our experiments, the observed cell-cell contact area varied, spanning from very low (cell corner-to-corner contact) up to approximately 50µm. Previous studies(14, 15) have clearly demonstrated the influence of the cell-cell contact area on NOTCH Signaling, but the values get nosy in the middle range, particularly when excluding extremely low cell-cell contact areas. Reflecting these findings, we excluded the corner contacts, which might correspond to extremely low cell-cell contact areas, from the Tip-Tip distance measurements as depicted in Fig. 3B. We also made an assumption that variations in cell-cell contact size within tens of microns correlate weakly with the strength of NOTCH signaling. This assumption did not impede our effort to compare the overall trends with results from modeling using hexagonal cells, as shown in Figs 3 D&amp;E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The results presented in Fig. 6J are quite striking. However, the number of samples N = 10 and N = 11 seem somewhat low. How does one justify that the findings are not influenced by low number fluctuations?</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge the reviewer's concerns regarding potential biases stemming from a limited number of samples. The analysis presented in Fig. 6J was specifically designed to complement and support the findings in Fig. 6H. In this context, the counts of sprout and mini-sprout dots correspond to the number of instances &quot;including a sprout&quot; and &quot;including a mini-sprout.&quot;</p><p>While the counts of sprouts and mini-sprouts in Fig. 6H might seem limited as highlighted by the reviewer, the statistical difference between the two groups was found to be significant. Nevertheless, we expanded our regions of interest to encompass neighboring cells, based on the rationale that the local environment might have closely interacting and similar features. The sample sizes in Figure 6J, represented as N=10 and N=11, equate to an examination of 70 cells and 77 cells, respectively. For instance, in the category &quot;including a sprout,&quot; five out of ten groups indicated that all seven neighboring cells in a group exhibited fibronectin levels exceeding a given threshold, translating to 35 cells with fibronectin levels above this threshold. Given that the observed trends in distribution were consistently reasonable across the examinations of both 70 and 77 cells, we would like to state that we are confident in our results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. It is written towards the end on pg. 5 that</p><p><code xml:space="preserve">... although all sprouts indeed formed from mini-sprouts, not all ...</code></p><p>. However, as can be seen from Fig. 4O, Sprouts can also be generated from Stalk cells. This should be corrected.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for highlighting the discrepancy between our statement on page 5 and the observations in Fig. 4O. While all sprouts undergo a mini-sprout phase, the transition from Stalk to mini-sprout is not always be observed due to the limitations of our observational timeframe. We acknowledge this oversight and adjusted our statement to clarify that sprouts appearing to form directly from Stalks likely passed through an unobserved intermediate mini-sprout stage as follows: We found that all sprouts formed either directly from Stalks or from mini-sprouts, suggesting a non-observed transition from Stalk to mini-sprout due to observational timeframe limitations. Strikingly, however, not all minisprouts persisted and initiated sprout formation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. No solid blue bars are shown in Fig. S2A as mentioned in the caption. Kindly correct.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the mistake. We have corrected the figure to show the blue bars depicting the experimental measurements for sprout distance probability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. How are the high-Delta cells or high-NOTCH cells decided in experiments or simulations? Does it happen that Delta and NOTCH levels are comparable? In that case, what is done? This point could be clarified in the main manuscript or Materials and Methods.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that Tip cell definition should be clarified. In the model, we define a threshold level for cellular Delta to distinguish Tip and Stalk cells, which is now explained in the Methods section “Definition of Tip cells in the model”. As elaborated in the new section, Delta and NOTCH levels are never comparable due to the circuit’s bistable behavior. In experiments, Tip cells based on their key phenotypic characteristic — invasive migration into the surrounding collagen matrix rather than Delta or NOTCH levels. The details can be found in “Precise quantification of Tip cell spatial arrangement suggests disordered patterning in the engineered angiogenesis model” section and Figure 3A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments</p><p>There are a good number of typos in the paper.

In particular, in many circumstances, the levels of VEGF is determined by the degree of hypoxia, which can be highly elevated following oxygen supply interruption, e.g., in wound healing or ischemia, or due to progression of neoplastic growth. Our results suggest that in these cases, formation of sprouts can be dysregulated due to higher incidences of co-localizations of prospective Tip cells. In addition, since these conditions are frequently accompanied by altered synthesis of ECM, the sprout density can increase, which may lead to formation of denser and less developed vascular beds frequently observed as a result of tumor angiogenesis(42, 43). Our results thus suggest that the disorder and higher plasticity of the endothelial cell fate speciation at higher VEGF inputs can be a key contributor to some pathological states associated with persistently hypoxic conditions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
