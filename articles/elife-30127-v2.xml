Remarkably, Tat transports fully folded proteins across these tightly sealed membrane systems. The well-studied Tat system of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> requires the three membrane proteins TatA, TatB and TatC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berks, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cline, 2015</xref>). Binding of substrate proteins to a TatBC receptor complex triggers the proton-motive force (PMF)-dependent oligomerization of TatA protomers from a membrane pool onto the substrate-TatBC complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alcock et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dabney-Smith et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Rose et al., 2013</xref>). The assembled TatA oligomer promotes translocation of the substrate protein across the membrane.</p><p>Elucidating the structure of the transiently formed TatA oligomer is key to understanding how folded proteins can cross a membrane bilayer. Although various models have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brüser and Sanders, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cline, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dabney-Smith et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gohlke et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Greene et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Palmer and Berks, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Rodriguez et al., 2013</xref>), the structure of the TatA oligomer remains enigmatic. A single TatA molecule comprises an N-terminal transmembrane helix (TMH), a basic amphipathic helix (APH) lying at the membrane surface, and a natively unstructured tail termed the densely charged region (DCR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Rodriguez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Walther et al., 2010</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30127.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The charge zipper model for TatA assembly.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon showing the TatA domain structure, comprising a transmembrane helix (TMH), an amphipathic helix (APH), and a densely-charged region (DCR).

Folding back the DCR against the APH is proposed to allow pairing of amino acids with complementary charges to form either intra-molecular or inter-molecular salt bridges. Three adjacent TatA protomers are shown with the residues of the acidic DDE motif and their potential salt bridge partners outlined in red and blue respectively. The charge zipper model does not predict which residue pairs would form inter- and intra-molecular salt bridges and one of several possible configurations is represented here. (<bold>D</bold>) The salt bridges shown in (<bold>C</bold>) are proposed to mediate self-assembly of multiple adjacent TatA molecules (1). The assembled APH/DCR units are then proposed to insert across the membrane to form the passage for substrate protein transport (2).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-30127-fig1-v2"/></fig><p>Walther and co-workers recently presented the concept of ‘charge zippers’ as a new structural principle to explain assembly of the TatA oligomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Walther et al., 2013</xref>). This model arises from the observation that the APH and DCR of TatA molecules have complementary charge patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Salt bridge formation between some of these oppositely charged residues was proposed to mediate folding and oligomerisation of TatA resulting in a transport pore as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>.</p><p>To experimentally test key predictions of the charge zipper model, Walther and co-workers disrupted proposed salt bridges of <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> TatAd. Single charge inversion substitutions were reported to impede TatA oligomerization. Crucially, for four of the seven predicted salt bridges, they reported that TatA assembly could be restored by simultaneously inverting the charge on the predicted partner residue, thereby re-establishing a salt bridge. These observations appear to provide strong support for the charge zipper model. However, these experiments were carried out in vitro, with the degree of TatA oligomerization assessed by blue native-PAGE of detergent-solubilized membranes. Whether TatA complexes observed in detergent solution can be directly related to physiological TatA oligomers remains a matter of debate since TatA complexes can be observed in detergent extracts in the absence of substrate proteins, or the TatBC complex, or the PMF, all of which are required for formation of native TatA oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gohlke et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Palmer and Berks, 2012</xref>). In addition, the oligomeric states of TatA observed in detergent solution are known to be influenced by the detergent to protein ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cline and Mori, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Rodriguez et al., 2013</xref>) casting doubt on whether detergent extraction accurately captures the TatA oligomeric state present in the membrane before solubilization. In order to address these concerns we have revisited Walther and co-workers’ tests of the charge zipper model but in a native physiological context.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Analysis of Tat transport activity in strains lacking one or more charge zipper pairs</title><p>The predicted salt bridge pairs of <italic>E. coli</italic> TatA are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Walther et al., 2013</xref>). We examined the four potential salt bridge pairs where both partners are in the functionally essential first 50 residues of TatA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Warren et al., 2009</xref>). Because amino acid substitutions which prevent translocase assembly should also block transport we examined the Tat transport activity of variants at these target salt bridges.</p><p>Transport activities were assessed using three established assays. First, we overproduced the <italic>E. coli</italic> Tat substrate CueO and assessed how much of the protein reached the periplasm. Second, we measured growth rates with the anaerobic electron acceptor trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), which is metabolized by Tat-dependent periplasmic enzymes. Third, we analysed cell growth on SDS-containing medium because Tat null strains have a defective cell envelope that renders them sensitive to SDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Stanley et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>We first examined the proposed salt bridge between residues D31 and K49. The expectation from the charge zipper model is that removing either end of a proposed salt bridge would result in identical Tat transport phenotypes. However, while a D31K variant was unable to export CueO or grow on TMAO, as anticipated if D31 is part of a zipper bridge, a K49D substitution still permitted significant transport of CueO and close to wild-type growth on TMAO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). The previous in vitro tests of the charge zipper model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Walther et al., 2013</xref>) led us to expect that simultaneous charge reversal at both ends of the salt bridge will restore salt bridge function. However, combining the K49D substitution with the inactivating D31K substitution failed to restore export of CueO or growth on TMAO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). When these various salt bridge variants were assessed using the SDS growth assay, which can detect very low levels of Tat activity, transport was now observed for D31K-substituted Tat, although at lower levels than with the wild-type protein. Nevertheless, the D31K/K49D variant, rather than restoring wild-type Tat transport activity to D31K as predicted by the charge zipper model, exhibited even poorer growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). To account for the possibility that the salt bridge partner of D31 had been misassigned, we also considered K52 as a potential partner. However, we found that, as with K49D, a K52D substitution had only a moderate effect on Tat transport and did not restore activity to the D31K variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). Taken together these experiments provide no evidence that the decreased activity of TatA D31K results from disrupting a salt bridge.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30127.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Transport activity of TatA charge zipper variants.</title><p>All TatA variants were expressed from the phage lambda attachment site in the Δ<italic>tatA</italic> Δ<italic>tatE</italic> strain JARV16.

Disrupting these three salt bridge pairs on the APH side (EDD variant) or the DCR side (KKK variant) abolished activity in our CueO export and TMAO growth assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). Nevertheless, a TatA EDD/KKK variant, which inverts the potential salt bridges, failed to restore detectable activity. Using the more sensitive SDS assay, TatA EDD exhibited a low level of Tat transport activity that was clearly greater than the negative control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). However, restoration of the predicted charge pairs in TatA EDD/KKK completely abolished Tat transport instead of recovering activity. Thus, in contrast to the earlier in vitro analysis of the charge zipper model, restoring putative salt bridges by complementary charge reversal in the DCR not only fails to bring back transport activity to the APH variants, but even further reduces their activity.</p><p>Immunoblotting confirmed that each variant analysed was present in the membrane at a comparable level to the wild-type TatA protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Direct observation of TatA assembly in charge zipper mutants</title><p>We used live cell imaging of a previously described TatA-YFP fusion to directly test the ability of the TatA charge zipper variants to undergo substrate-induced oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alcock et al., 2013</xref>).

Our in-cell results fail to substantiate key outcomes of Walther and co-workers’ tests.</p><p>Firstly, and most fundamentally, Walther and co-workers report that charge zipper substitutions affect TatA oligomerization. We found that none of our charge zipper substitutions prevented TatA oligomerization in live cells, even though the majority of our variants were confirmed to have severe functional defects. Secondly, Walther and co-workers report that TatA assembly defects caused by charge reversal substitutions at one end of a salt bridge can be repaired by reforming the salt bridge through concurrent charge reversal at the other end of the bridge. However we were unable to replicate these observations when assessing Tat transport activity. Finally, ablation of either end of a predicted charge zipper salt bridge should give rise to the same structural and functional defects. Yet for some of the putative salt bridge variants tested (D31K versus K49D or K52D) we see large differences in transport and oligomerization behavior between substitutions at each end of the salt bridge. Our variants target almost all of the charged residues in the APH and early DCR, so it is highly implausible that we have failed to affect the intermolecular charge zippers if these exist.</p><p>Our in vivo observations cast considerable doubt on the charge zipper model as a plausible mechanism for the assembly of TatA or other membrane protein homo-oligomers. Nevertheless, our data do show that the charged residues in the TatA APH and proximal DCR are critical for Tat transport. Substitutions of these amino acids were observed to perturb the Tat transport cycle resulting in TatA oligomers that are resistant to loss of the PMF, and that form even without substrate overproduction. The same behavior has previously been reported following substitution of the highly conserved and functionally essential APH residue Phe39 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alcock et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hicks et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hicks et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, several substitutions in the APH lead to the accumulation of TatA in a stable oligomeric state. In each case the observed TatA oligomerization is not spontaneous, but triggered by endogenous Tat substrates, as demonstrated by the dependence on TatBC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alcock et al., 2013</xref>)). The subsequent accumulation of stably assembled TatA oligomers is most parsimoniously explained by suggesting that the APH is required for a step in the transport cycle between TatA oligomerization and TatA disassembly, and that this step is disrupted in the APH variants. Logically, this mechanistic step is likely to be the physical movement of the substrate protein across the membrane bilayer.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

The charge zipper model proposes that salt bridges formed between the APH and DCR segments of TatA are involved in formation of TatA oligomers which serve as the transport pore for Tat substrates. The Tat system goes through a cycle of activity that includes substrate binding to the BC complex, recruitment of TatA to BC and TatA oligomerization, then transport of the substrate and disassembly. Each step in the process has been extensively studied, yet no consensus for a mechanism has emerged. Berks and colleagues were the first to observe that the TatA APH segment was particularly sensitive to substitution mutations. Walther et al. conducted experiments that suggested that APH mutations reflect the requirement for salt bridges between APH and the DCR segment for assembly of TatA into oligomers. In some sense this hypothesis drew upon a flawed study by Gohlke et al. that TatA existed as a population of pore shaped oligomers that could be responsible for the transport of substrate with varying diameter. Even at the time of the Walther report, the detergent extraction methods employed were suspect and likely reported non-physiological states of TatA. In the intervening years better methods, both in vitro and in vivo, have reported on the blocks in the TatABC cycle and the assembly status of TatA. To their credit, the authors' 2013 paper (Rodrigues et al. 2013) pretty much laid to rest the notion that detergent solubilized TatA reflected the in situ form of TatA. Here Alcock et al. report sophisticated in vivo methods to determine if specific charged mutations in the APH and DCR affect TatA assembly and Tat substrate transport. The methodology is first rate, the conclusions straightforward and clear. The manuscript addresses an important controversy in the Tat transport field. As the 'charge zipper' model has been recently expanded to apply to other systems, an investigation of this model is timely. The reviewers concluded that a revised version of this manuscript would be appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Sometimes these &quot;refutation&quot; papers don't get the most important point across. For this work, I think that the most important point is that the APH plays a crucial role in the translocation step. It further substantiates the point proposed in the earlier Alcock et al. 2013 paper that mutations in the APH causes an arrest at the assembled step and that the assembled state is stable even without the PMF, unless the substrate is transported.</p><p>2) The authors did a good job in the Alcock et al. 2013 paper explaining why assembly can be seen in an uninduced system (i.e. no overexpressed substrate) if the transport step is impaired. That argument is important in the present manuscript and should at least be referred to in the Discussion. The authors don't want to leave the impression that TatA assembles without substrate. Triggering of assembly by substrate binding is generally accepted in the field.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. The spheroplast fraction of several mutants (TatA K49D and TatA K52D) has a band that comigrates with processed CueO. Is this band an aborted transport product? This band is not present or very faint in samples from the most defective mutants (TatA EDD/KKK) so it doesn't seem to be a cross-reactive protein or a cytosolic CueO degradation product. The authors should comment on this band particularly if it provides some insight into the arrested state.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30127.008</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Sometimes these &quot;refutation&quot; papers don't get the most important point across.
