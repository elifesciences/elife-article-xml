relationships during development are largely unexplored. To address this gap, we employed RNA staining of the FB marker gene <italic>Col1a1</italic> together with the CM marker gene <italic>Actn2</italic> and the Vas_EC marker gene <italic>Cdh5</italic> at various stages of mouse heart development. This approach enabled us to discern the anatomical pattern of cardiac FBs and identify approximately one EC and four CMs directly interacting with each FB. Molecularly, through the analysis of single-cell mRNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, we unveiled collagen as the top signaling molecule derived from FBs influencing CM and Vas_EC development. Subsequently, we used a <italic>Pdgfra-CreER</italic> controlled diphtheria toxin A (DTA) system to ablate the FBs at different stages. We found that the ablation of FBs disrupted myocardium and vasculature development and led to embryonic heart defects. Using scRNA-seq, we further profiled the ablated hearts and identified molecular defects in their ventricular CMs and Vas_ECs compared to control hearts. Moreover, we identified a reduction of collagen in the ablated hearts and predicted collagen as the major signaling pathway regulating the differentially expressed genes in the ablated ventricular CMs. Finally, we performed both short-term and long-term FB ablation at the neonatal stage. We found that short-term ablation caused a reduction in collagen and Vas_EC density, while long-term ablation may induce compensatory collagen expression without causing heart function reduction. In summary, our study has identified the function of FBs in regulating myocardium and vasculature development in the mouse heart and implicated an important role for the collagen pathway in this process.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>fibroblast</kwd><kwd>extracellular matrix</kwd><kwd>ablation</kwd><kwd>heart</kwd><kwd>single cell</kwd><kwd>myocardium</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP2HL163745</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Guang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00HL133472</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Guang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100020415</institution-id><institution>Additional Ventures</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SVRF grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Guang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cardiac fibroblasts play a critical role throughout the various phases of murine heart development ranging from the embryonic to the neonatal stage.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Fibroblast (FB) is one of the most abundant cardiac cell types and plays important roles in normal heart function and pathological heart remodeling at the adult stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hall et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tallquist and Molkentin, 2017</xref>). The FB composition in the heart has been analyzed with multiple approaches such as flow cytometry, with a focus on the left ventricle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhou and Pu, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pinto et al., 2016</xref>). However, the anatomical location of FBs in the heart along the developmental progression is still unclear. The heart in mice starts to develop into a four-chambered structure at E9.5. The atrial and ventricular chambers are connected by the atrioventricular canal (AVC), a transient structure that develops into the septum and valve cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Vlaming et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">O’Donnell and Yutzey, 2020</xref>). Although the main FB population does not develop until E13.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tallquist, 2020</xref>), FB-like cells with the expression of <italic>Col1a1</italic> and other FB genes start to develop in the AVC at E9.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">O’Donnell and Yutzey, 2020</xref>).</p><p>CM and Vas_EC are the other two major cell types in the heart. Vas_EC developed at about the same time as FB, while CM developed before the appearance of FB at the chambers. FB has been shown to couple with CM through gap junctions and promote their maturation in human three-dimensional micro-tissue consisting of FB, CM, and EC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Giacomelli et al., 2020</xref>). In mice, epicardium-derived cells, mostly FBs, have been reported to serve as guidepost cells by secreting the chemokine <italic>Slit2</italic>, guiding Vas_EC to the correct anatomical locations and promoting their maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Quijada et al., 2021</xref>). However, the lack of direct assessment of FB function in vivo prevents a comprehensive understanding of its role in regulating CM and Vas_EC development.</p><p>To study the function of a cell type rather than a gene, toxin genes such as NTR and DTA have been engineered into conditional ablation systems to eliminate specific groups of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ivanova et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Curado et al., 2008</xref>). The DTA system has been used in mice to ablate cardiac progenitor cells and cardiomyocytes at early developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sturzu et al., 2015</xref>). Recently, a group of proliferating FBs with the expression of <italic>Postn</italic> was identified in neonatal hearts. Further elimination of this cell population using the DTA ablation system showed its importance in promoting cardiomyocyte maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hortells et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, the DTA system has been used to ablate FBs at the adult stage to assess their function in adverse cardiac remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kuwabara et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kaur et al., 2016</xref>). However, the function of the primary FB population during embryonic and neonatal stages remains unclear.</p><p>One of the major functions of FB is to synthesize and secrete extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, which influence the behavior of other cell lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tallquist and Molkentin, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ivey and Tallquist, 2016</xref>). The ECM is heterogeneous and composed of various types, such as collagen, fibronectin, elastin, and laminin, each with different subtypes. For example, collagen has 28 genes in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Frantz et al., 2010</xref>). The ECM plays important roles in heart development and regeneration. For instance, <italic>hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein 1 (Hapln1</italic>) is critical in regulating myocardial compaction and heart regeneration in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sun et al., 2022</xref>). ECM has also been found to regulate mouse CM proliferation through β1-integrin signaling in a cell co-culture assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ieda et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, collagen has been shown to be essential for heart regeneration in adult zebrafish and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Simões et al., 2020</xref>). However, the heterogeneity and function of ECM genes in mouse heart development remain unclear.</p><p>In this study, we identified the anatomical patterns of cardiac FB, CM, and Vas_EC during embryonic development. We further examined the ligand-receptor interactions among these cell types and identified collagen as the top signaling pathway. Additionally, we investigated FB function at different embryonic stages using a cell ablation system and analyzed the resulting molecular defects with scRNA-seq. Finally, we performed short-term and long-term FB ablation at the neonatal stage and found that FBs are dispensable for normal heart function development. In summary, this study provides a comprehensive understanding of the role of cardiac fibroblasts in myocardium and coronary vasculature development during embryonic and neonatal stages.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cellular analysis of cardiac FB anatomical location at different stages</title><p>To understand the spatial distribution of cardiac FBs along the developmental progression, we stained the FB marker gene <italic>Col1a1</italic> on heart sections at different stages from E11.5 to P3. We observed a strong expression of <italic>Col1a1</italic> in epicardial cells at all analyzed stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Inside the heart, we found <italic>Col1a1</italic>-positive cells enriched at the boundary of the atrial and ventricular regions in E11.5 and 12.5 hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating their presence in the atrioventricular canal (AVC). By E13.5 and 14.5, the AVC cells had developed into valve structures, and the valve interstitial cells highly expressed <italic>Col1a1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In the ventricles, a small proportion of <italic>Col1a1</italic>-positive cells were observed adjacent to the epicardium. In contrast, few <italic>Col1a1</italic> signals were found in the atrium at this stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). At E15.5 and 16.5, both ventricles were filled with <italic>Col1a1</italic>-positive cells, but the middle of the ventricular septum remained devoid of such cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). FBs were also found in the atrium, but the signal at the tips of both atrial chambers was sparser (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The distribution of FBs at E17.5 and E18.5 was highly similar to that observed at E16.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, we analyzed the <italic>Col1a1</italic> signal in P0, P2, and P3 hearts and found dense <italic>Col1a1</italic> expression at the valves and in all four chambers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In summary, this analysis revealed the spatial location of cardiac FBs along the developmental stages. Specifically, we found that the FBs developed first in the AVC and valve, then at the ventricular wall and atrial, and last at the ventricular septum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Anatomical location of cardiac fibroblasts (FBs) and their spatial relationship with cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells at different stages.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) RNA staining of <italic>Col1a1</italic> revealed the spatial pattern of cardiac FBs at different developmental stages.

Consistent with the previously described pattern, we observed that FB were mainly enriched in valves and began to develop at the edges of ventricular chambers at E13.5. We also found that FB were intermingled with CM populations and spatially adjacent to ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Next, we stained the three lineage markers on E17.5 and P3 heart sections. We observed consistent results as E13.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Given that FB starts emerging at E13.5, we primarily quantified the contacts at E17.5 and P3. The quantification results showed that each FB was in contact with approximately one Vas_EC and four CMs at both stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). These results suggest that cardiac FBs are physically close to CMs and ECs, likely facilitating signal communications that impact their development.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Identification of heterogeneity in cardiac FBs through the analysis of scRNA-seq data</title><p>Through the analysis of scRNA-seq data at 18 stages of developing hearts from CD1 mice, we investigated the expression of <italic>Col1a1</italic> and observed high expression in epicardial cells and FBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). This is consistent with the findings from RNA staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Subsequently, we reanalyzed the FBs and identified four distinct populations comprising 13 clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D</xref>). Gene expression analysis revealed that all cells in these populations exhibited high expression of <italic>Col1a1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Moreover, through differential gene expression analysis between the populations, we discovered that one group of cells highly expressed <italic>Hapln1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B, D, E</xref>), a marker gene associated with valves. This indicates that these cells are valve interstitial cells. We also found another group of cells expressing <italic>Cdh5</italic> and <italic>Tie1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B, D, E</xref>), genes associated with the endothelial cell lineage. This suggests that these cells may represent FBs derived from EDCs. Additionally, we identified a third group of FBs expressing <italic>Sox10</italic> and <italic>Phox2b</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B, D, E</xref>), genes associated with the neural crest cell lineage. This suggests that these cells may originate from neural crest cells. Finally, the rest of the cells formed a main population that likely represents epicardial cell-derived FBs in the chambers, as they expressed <italic>Tcf21</italic> and other marker genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D, E</xref>). Interestingly, further analysis of the cell cycle phases in these FBs revealed that each population consisted of cells in all three phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>), indicating active proliferation during the early stages.</p><p>Next, to understand the anatomical location of these FB populations, we performed RNA in situ hybridizations on postnatal heart sections. Firstly, we stained <italic>Hapln1</italic> together with <italic>Dcn</italic>, another Pan-FB marker gene. We found that <italic>Hapln1</italic> was highly expressed in valves, and most of its signal overlapped with <italic>Dcn</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3Fi</xref>), suggesting its expression in valve interstitial cells (FB-like cells in valves). We also stained <italic>Cdh5</italic> with <italic>Col1a1</italic> and observed a small cluster of cells with the expression of both genes, mostly located at the boundary of large vessels and ventricular chambers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3Fii</xref>). Finally, we co-stained <italic>Sox10</italic> and <italic>Col1a1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3Fiii</xref>). As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ali et al., 2014</xref>), we identified double-positive cells in the outflow tract-derived large vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3Fiii_1</xref>). However, interestingly, we also observed their presence in coronary vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3Fiii_2</xref>), suggesting that these cells may have a broader function than previously thought. In summary, through the analysis of scRNA-seq data and in situ hybridizations, we identified different populations of cardiac FBs, which differentially expressed lineage genes likely from their precursor cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Molecular analysis of the signaling communications between FBs and the other cardiac cell types</title><p>To understand the interactions between FB and other cardiac cell types, we analyzed scRNA-seq data from developing CD1 hearts at 18 stages ranging from E9.5 to P9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Feng et al., 2022</xref>). By quantifying the number and strength of these interactions, we found that each cell type, except blood cells, had a similar number of interactions. However, in terms of interaction strength, FB exhibited the highest values compared to those of other cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Next, we analyzed the signaling pathways secreted from FB to ventricular cardiomyocytes (Ven_CM) and Vas_EC. Interestingly, we found that the collagen pathway was the predominant pathway in both FB-VenCM and FB-VasEC interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In addition to collagen, we identified other signaling molecules such as laminin, Ptn, MK, Fn1, and Thbs, which are mostly extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, as being secreted by FB to function in Ven_CM and Vas_EC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Within the collagen pathway, we further analyzed the detailed ligand-receptor interactions and found more interaction pairs in FB-VasEC than in FB-VenCM. Some interactions were shared between the two cell types, but most were distinct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

Interestingly, we identified five groups of ECM genes that displayed stage or chamber-specific expression in both datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Specifically, we found one group of genes (G1) that was highly expressed at stages before E14.5. This gene group includes signaling molecules such as <italic>Slit2</italic> and <italic>Wnt5a</italic>, and collagen genes such as <italic>Col13a1</italic> and <italic>Col26a1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">4</xref>). We found the second group of genes (G2) was mainly expressed in the LV and RV from E14.5 onwards with a significant increase at the neonatal stage. This gene group includes collagen genes such as <italic>Col5a1</italic>, <italic>Col6a1</italic>, and <italic>Col6a2</italic>, and metalloproteinase genes such as <italic>Adamts13</italic> and <italic>Adamts14</italic>. Additionally, we identified that the third group of genes was highly expressed in the LA and RA at most stages, which includes <italic>Col12a1</italic>, <italic>Adamts1</italic>, and <italic>Adamts4</italic>. Interestingly, <italic>Fn1</italic> also exists in this group, suggesting that it has an important function in atrial FB development. Furthermore, we found the fourth group of genes was preferentially expressed in the other three chambers than the RA and was mainly expressed at late neonatal stages after P5 in certain chambers. This group of genes includes <italic>Col4a4</italic>, <italic>Col4a5</italic>, <italic>Col4a6</italic>, and <italic>Ntn4</italic>. Finally, we identified the fifth group of genes displayed universal expression in all four chambers at most stages.

In summary, we identified five groups of ECM genes displaying stage- and chamber-specific expression patterns in FB and observed that each gene group includes different collagen pathway members. Additionally, we analyzed the ligand-receptor interactions between FB and Ven_CM or Vas_EC at each stage. We found collagen pathway interactions were also enriched at most analyzed stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). These results together suggested the importance of the collagen pathway in mediating the FB function in heart development.</p><p>Furthermore, we studied collagen deposition dynamics in developing hearts. We used collagen hybridizing peptide (CHP) to stain the total collagen after denaturing it via an antigen retrieval process. Consistent with <italic>Col1a1</italic> expression, we observed strong collagen signals in the epicardium at all analyzed stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Interestingly, at E11.5, we observed collagen in both AVC and ventricular chambers. Given that FBs in the chambers have not developed yet at this stage, the observed collagen is likely derived from other cell types, such as endocardial endothelial cells. At E14.5, we observed a strong collagen signal in the ventricular free walls, while the signal in the ventricular septum and atrium was relatively weaker. At E16.5, the collagen signal became brighter and denser throughout the heart, including the ventricular free wall, septum, and atrium. This distribution was slightly broader compared to the fibroblast distribution at the same stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). By P3, the collagen signal had further increased and formed stripe patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In summary, we found that the progression of collagen accumulation largely coincided with the development of FBs.</p><p>Lastly, we analyzed the signaling interactions among human cardiac cells using a human embryonic heart scRNA-seq dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asp et al., 2019</xref>). Consistent with the mouse analysis results, we identified strong interactions between FB and other cardiac cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Additionally, we found collagen to be the most enriched pathway in FB-VasEC interactions. However, interestingly, we did not observe the collagen pathway among the top enriched pathways in FB-VenCM interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5C</xref>).

After 3 days, we harvested the embryos and observed that all the embryos with ablated FBs (<italic>Pdgfra-CreER+/-; Rosa-DTA+/-</italic>) had perished, while the control embryos remained unaffected.

Our findings revealed that the ablated embryos exhibited smaller sizes compared to the control embryos, although the size of the ablated hearts did not significantly differ from that of the control hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Additionally, we conducted TUNEL analysis to assess cell death in both control and ablated hearts and observed a significantly higher number of TUNEL-positive dots in the valve and chamber regions of the ablated hearts compared to the control hearts, confirming the successful ablation of FBs in the experimental hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>, B). Furthermore, we examined the anatomical structure of the hearts but did not identify obvious defects in the ablated groups compared to control groups. However, we observed a reduction in endothelial cell density in the ablated hearts, as indicated by the CD31 staining signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Additionally, we measured the thickness of the compact and trabecular myocardium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Our observations revealed that, compared to the control hearts, the ablated hearts exhibited a thinner left ventricular (LV) compact myocardium, while the thickness of the LV trabecular myocardium remained similar. Furthermore, we noted an elevated ratio of LV trabecular to compact myocardium in the ablated hearts compared to the control hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). However, no similar differences were observed in the right ventricle (RV). Finally, we examined cell proliferation post-ablation using pHH3 staining. We observed a reduction in pHH3-positive cells in the ventricular region, but not in the atrial region, of the ablated hearts compared to the control hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>).

We did not observe obvious differences in the size of the embryos and hearts between the ablated group and the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4B</xref>). However, the CD31 staining of heart sections revealed large holes in the ablated atrium but not in the ablated ventricles or control hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4C</xref>). Additionally, quantification of the compact and trabecular myocardium thickness in the LV and RV revealed a thinner LV compact myocardium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4D</xref>).

These results indicated that both the LV and RV of the ablated hearts have subtle defects. Moreover, we analyzed cell proliferation by staining pHH3 and found no significant differences between the ablated and control ventricles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4F</xref>).</p><p>Given that the animals did not show obvious morphological changes after one dose of tamoxifen treatment, we increased the tamoxifen treatment to three consecutive days, ranging from E15.5 to E17.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). We harvested the embryos at E18.5 and found that both the ablated embryos and their hearts were notably smaller in size compared to the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Next, to confirm the ablation efficiency, we analyzed <italic>Col1a1</italic> expression with RNA staining and found that the ablated hearts lost almost all of their <italic>Col1a1</italic> signal in the four chambers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4G</xref>), indicating a high ablation efficiency with three doses of tamoxifen treatments. We further analyzed their valve structures and observed that the valves in the ablated hearts were not severely affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Moreover, by conducting a staining analysis of CD31 in the control and ablated heart sections, we discovered that the ablated hearts exhibited a significantly lower endothelial cell density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>). Further quantification of the LV compact and trabecular myocardium thickness showed a significant reduction in the ablated hearts compared to control hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). However, interestingly, the ratio of trabecular to compact myocardium thickness in the LV did not differ between the control and ablated hearts, indicating a proportional reduction in both compact and trabecular myocardium thickness in the ablated hearts. Finally, we found that the ablated ventricles had less pHH3 signal than the control ventricles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4F</xref>), indicating impaired cell proliferation in the ventricles following FB ablation.

All these FB groups contained cells from both control and ablated samples. In contrast, we identified another group of cells exclusively derived from the ablated samples, which expressed cell death-related genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We named this group dying fibroblasts (dying_fb).</p><p>In addition to FB, we analyzed Ven_CM and found that cells from control and ablated hearts were highly overlapped on the UMAP plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). We quantified the proportions of cells at each cell cycle phase and found that the ablated samples had slightly higher percentages of cells in the G1 phase compared to control samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

Gene ontology analysis of the upregulated genes in the ablated CMs showed enrichment in various pathways, including heart development, sarcomere organization, heart tube morphogenesis, and cell proliferation. In contrast, the downregulated genes were enriched in pathways related to chaperone-dependent protein folding, mitochondrial membrane permeability, fatty acid import, and mitochondrial ATP transmembrane transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). These results indicated that ablated Ven_CMs upregulated genes associated with heart development and cell proliferation while downregulating genes related to cell maturation, including those involved in mitochondrial function and cell metabolism.</p><p>Furthermore, we selected Vas_EC for further analysis. We did not observe distinct populations between control and ablated samples on the UMAP plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

Gene ontology analysis of these genes revealed that they were primarily involved in immune response pathways, including type I and II interferon production, interleukin-27-mediated pathways, NLRP3 inflammasome assembly, and cellular responses to exogenous dsRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L</xref>).

In addition to collagens, we also identified other ligands, such as TGF-beta, IGF, and BMP, which were derived from FB and regulate the expression of differentially expressed genes in control and ablated Ven_CMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

Understanding the role of these altered signaling pathways from dying_fb in contributing to heart defects will be an interesting area for future research.

Their roles as structural proteins in heart development are critical and contribute to the heart phenotype observed in the ablated hearts.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4-3"><title>Functional analysis of FBs at neonatal stages</title><p>Next, we assessed the FB function at neonatal stage. We treated the mice with tamoxifen at P1 and harvested them at P4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

However, CD31 staining of heart sections revealed defects in the atrium, which had a thinner and segmented atrial wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We further quantified the compact and trabecular myocardium in both the LV and RV but did not observe differences between control and ablated hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We also did not find differences in the ratio of trabecular to compact myocardium thickness between control and ablated hearts in the LV and RV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Finally, we analyzed cell proliferation by staining pHH3 and did not observe differences between the two conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Next, we increased the tamoxifen treatments to three times, ranging from P1 to P3, and collected hearts at P4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The heart morphology and size did not reveal obvious differences between control and ablated groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The CD31 staining revealed a reduction in endothelial cell density in the ablated hearts when compared to the control hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). These reductions in both LV and RV were further confirmed through quantifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

However, a significant amount of stripe-patterned collagen was still observed in the ventricular free wall, although the overall signal was sparser (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).

We observed that approximately two-thirds of the ablated mice had perished before P17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>), and the surviving mice were significantly smaller than the control mice. Quantification revealed reduced heart rates and body weights, but a similar heart-to-body ratio in the ablated mice compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). A detailed examination of the major tissues showed reduced organ sizes in the ablated mice, including smaller hearts, lungs, brains, kidneys, and livers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Additionally, we assessed mouse heart function using echocardiography before sacrificing them. Interestingly, we found that heart function, including ejection fraction (EF) and fractional shortening (FS), was not reduced in the ablated mice compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H, I</xref>). Furthermore, we evaluated collagen levels in the ablated hearts and did not observe a clear reduction or pattern change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). This finding contrasts with our observations at P4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) and suggests potential collagen expression compensation at later stages. In contrast, we found that the lungs of the ablated mice exhibited reduced collagen levels and larger empty spaces compared to the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3B</xref>). These findings suggest that FBs play a crucial role in the growth of multiple tissues during the neonatal phase. Additionally, it will be interesting to explore the mechanisms underlying the preservation of heart function when FBs are eliminated in future studies.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we investigated the cellular and molecular interactions between FB and CM or Vas_EC, identifying collagen as the primary signaling molecule. We also analyzed the role of FB in embryonic heart development using a cell ablation system. Additionally, we employed scRNA-seq to identify the molecular defects in CM and Vas_EC within the ablated hearts. Finally, we examined the function of FB in neonatal heart development through both short-term and long-term ablation experiments. Altogether, our study represents the first comprehensive analysis of FB function in heart development. The insights we gained from the study will not only enhance our understanding of the role of this major cardiac cell type in heart development but also shed light on its function in adult cardiac remodeling, as well as other tissue development and regeneration.</p><p>Through RNA staining of the three lineage genes, we found that each FB directly interacts with approximately one Vas_EC and four CMs. Given that the quantification was conducted on 2D tissue sections, the number of contacts may be underestimated. Considering that Vas_EC and FB emerged around the same time, it will be important to understand in the future how their connections are established at the single-cell level and what these connections mean for the development of each lineage. Two studies in mice and zebrafish have shown that epicardial cells or epicardium-derived cells regulate Vas_EC development through the expression of <italic>Hapln1</italic> or <italic>Slit2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Quijada et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sun et al., 2022</xref>). It would be interesting to test whether collagen or other FB-derived ECM proteins have similar roles. Additionally, in vitro culture experiments have demonstrated that FBs interact with CMs through gap junction proteins or integrins to regulate their proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Giacomelli et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ieda et al., 2009</xref>). Future studies should aim to clarify how these interactions are established in vivo and how they evolve during developmental progression.</p><p>Collagen, as the major ECM family, consists of 28 members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Frantz et al., 2010</xref>). In addition to collagen, there are many other types of ECM genes. Our scRNA-seq data revealed the temporal and spatial expression patterns of ECM genes in cardiac FBs. Future research should investigate their differential functions. For example, we found that most ECM genes in group 4 upregulate their expression by postnatal day 7, when mouse hearts begin to lose their regenerative capacity, suggesting a potential role in heart regeneration. This warrants further investigation. Additionally, while we have analyzed the collagen pathway as a whole in this study, our scRNA-seq analysis indicated that collagen genes in different groups exhibit distinct expression patterns. It will be essential to explore their unique roles in heart development in future studies. Furthermore, we found that collagen is the primary signaling molecule in FB_CM and FB_VasEC pairs in mice; however, we only observed it in the FB_VasEC pair in humans. This discrepancy may be due to the loss of collagen receptors in human CMs, which merits further exploration.</p><p>The DTA-based cell ablation system has been used to ablate cardiac progenitors and cardiomyocytes before. It revealed that a robust regeneration response occurred after cell ablation at early stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sturzu et al., 2015</xref>). However, in our study, based on the pHH3 staining, we did not observe an increase in cell proliferation after cell ablation. This could be due to multiple possibilities. First, the <italic>Pdgfra-CreER; Rosa-DTA</italic>-based ablation may be too severe to initiate the response to cell loss. Considering that ablation at E13.5 and ablation with three doses of tamoxifen at E15.5 both led to smaller embryos, the ablation of a large number of cells may compromise the compensation mechanisms. However, it is difficult to explain the embryos at E15.5 with one dose of tamoxifen treatment, which did not display obvious defects after ablation and have no increase in cell proliferation. Second, unlike cardiomyocytes, FBs may have a limited compensatory response to their own ablation, although they can respond to CM loss at both neonatal and adult stages.</p><p>ScRNA-seq results revealed the upregulation of inflammation-related pathways in Vas_EC in the ablated hearts. It will be important to investigate whether these pathways are initiated by the ablation process or the loss of FBs in the future. Given that these pathways were primarily upregulated in Vas_EC but not in CM, this suggests a cell-type-specific response. Studying the function of these signals in vascular development will be essential. Moreover, pathway analysis revealed both upregulation and downregulation of signaling pathways associated with dying FBs. Further studies on these pathways are important, as they could offer valuable insights into the cell death process during normal heart development and heart injury and repair.</p><p>FB ablation at the neonatal stage led to two-thirds of the mice experiencing a lethal outcome, while the remaining mice developed a dwarf phenotype. Functional analysis of the mouse hearts showed preserved cardiac function post-ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H, I</xref>), suggesting that the lethal phenotype may be due to defects in other tissues, such as the lungs, which exhibited disrupted structures.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental methods</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Mouse strains</title><p>The animal experiments have been approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).

Since the ablated mouse embryos at both stages were smaller than the control embryos, we selected one control and one ablated embryo from each stage for heart dissection. The genotype of the selected embryos was further validated using PCR. The hearts, with four chambers, were dissociated into single cells and labeled with MULTI-seq barcodes. The pooled libraries were then loaded onto the 10 X Genomics Chromium iX and profiled using the single-cell 3' V3.1 kit. The generated libraries were sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq X Plus platform. The experiments were repeated twice.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-10"><title>Echo imaging</title><p>Echocardiography was performed using a standard protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). Briefly, heart function of awake mice at P17 was assessed using the Vevo 3100 micro imaging platform (FUJIFILM Visual Sonics Inc, Canada). The measurements were conducted at the level of the papillary muscle in M mode. Heart rates, ejection fraction (EF), and fractional shortening (FS) were calculated from the 2D short-axis view.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-11"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>To quantify pHH3 signal, compact, and trabecular myocardium thickness, we used two to three sections from each heart and more than three hearts per genotype. The exact number of embryos profiled can be found in each figure legend. Statistical analyses were conducted using ImageJ and Prism 9 software, employing a two-tailed Student’s t-test to compare groups. p-Values below 0.05 were considered significant.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Data analysis</title><sec id="s4-2-1"><title>ScRNA-seq data analysis</title><p>ScRNA-seq data were mapped to the mouse genome mm10 using CellRanger and further de-multiplexed with the R package deMULTIplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McGinnis et al., 2019</xref>). Cell types in the newly generated scRNA-seq data were annotated using lineage genes previously published by our team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Feng et al., 2022</xref>). We performed quality control by removing cells with fewer than 200 genes and those with more than 40% mitochondrial content. Experimental batch integration was conducted using Harmony 1.2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Korsunsky et al., 2019</xref>), followed by unsupervised clustering with Seurat V5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hao et al., 2024</xref>). Next, we utilized the Cell Cycle Scoring function in Seurat to annotate the cell cycle phases for each individual cell. Finally, we applied the FindMarkers function in Seurat with default settings to identify genes that were differentially expressed in Ven_CM or Vas_EC under control and ablation conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2"><title>Extracellular matrix genes expression analysis</title><p>We downloaded the extracellular matrix genes from the Jackson Laboratory under the term ‘extracellular matrix’ and gene ontology ID 0031012 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.informatics.jax.org/go/term/GO">https://www.informatics.jax.org/go/term/GO</ext-link>:0031012; Download date: 2023-07-07). After downloading, we cleaned the gene list by removing duplicates and filtering out genes with null expression, resulting in a total of 440 genes. Next, we assessed the enrichment of each gene in the main population of FBs at each stage and chamber using the R package AUCell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aibar et al., 2017</xref>), with heatmaps drawn with the R package ggplot2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-3"><title>Ligand-receptor interaction analysis</title><p>To identify ligand-receptor interactions across stages and zones for FBs and cardiomyocytes, we analyzed relevant subsets of the CD1 data, including the main population of FB, ventricular CM, and Vas_EC using CellPhoneDB v3.34 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Efremova et al., 2020</xref>). We used a p-value threshold of 0.2 and ran the analysis with 10 threads, while keeping the rest of the parameters at their default settings. The significant mean value of all interactive partners (log2) and enrichment p-values (-log10) obtained from the CellPhoneDB outputs were plotted as dot plots in R.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-4"><title>CellChat analysis</title><p>The Seurat object containing mouse CD1 single-cell mRNA sequencing data was converted into a CellChat object in R. Default settings in CellChat 1.6.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jin et al., 2021</xref>) were used to identify the number and strength of interactions among cell types. FB were designated as sender cells, while Ven_CM and Vas_EC were designated as receiver cells to identify signaling between these related cell types. The same default settings were applied to analyze signaling pathways among human cardiac cell types. For pathway analysis in control and DTA-ablated cardiac cells, their respective scRNA-seq objects were utilized.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-5"><title>NicheNet analysis</title><p>Nichenetr 2.1.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Browaeys et al., 2020</xref>) was used for the analysis with default settings. First, we identified differentially expressed genes between control and ablated cells. Due to the varying number of recovered cells in each cell type under different conditions, we selected different staged samples for comparison and assessed their consistency across the remaining samples. For Ven_CMs, we used the E16.5_control_1 and E16.5_DTA_1 samples, while for Vas_EC, we included all four E16.5 samples. Next, we designated the control sample as the background condition and the ablated sample as the experimental condition, using main_fb as the sending cells and Ven_CM or Vas_EC as the receiving cells to predict their regulatory potential.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Software, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Primer sequences for PLISH probes.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-102305-supp1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>The interaction strength values among the different cell types in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-102305-supp2-v1.csv" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="octet-stream"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>The enrichment score of extracellular matrix genes in CD1 main population fibroblasts.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-102305-supp3-v1.csv" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="octet-stream"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp4"><label>Supplementary file 4.</label><caption><title>The enrichment score of extracellular matrix genes in C57BL/6 main population fibroblasts.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-102305-supp4-v1.csv" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="octet-stream"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp5"><label>Supplementary file 5.</label><caption><title>The list of ligand-receptor interactions between the main population of fibroblast and ventricular cardiomycocytes in CD1 dataset.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-102305-supp5-v1.csv" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="octet-stream"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp6"><label>Supplementary file 6.</label><caption><title>The list of ligand-receptor interactions between the main population of fibroblast and Vas_EC in CD1 dataset.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-102305-supp6-v1.csv" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="octet-stream"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp7"><label>Supplementary file 7.</label><caption><title>The list of genes that differentially expressed in control and ablated Ven_CMs at e16.5 stage.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-102305-supp7-v1.csv" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="octet-stream"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp8"><label>Supplementary file 8.</label><caption><title>The list of genes that differentially expressed in control and ablated Ven_CMs at e18.5 stage.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-102305-supp8-v1.csv" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="octet-stream"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp9"><label>Supplementary file 9.</label><caption><title>The list of genes that differentially expressed in control and ablated Vas_ECs.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-102305-supp9-v1.csv" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="octet-stream"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-102305-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>The newly generated scRNA-seq datasets have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under the accession number GSE272048.

This focus is significant, given that fibroblasts, cardiomyocytes, and vascular endothelial cells are the three primary cell types in the heart. The authors employed a Pdgfra-CreER-controlled diphtheria toxin A (DTA) system to ablate fibroblasts at various embryonic and postnatal stages, characterizing the resulting cardiac defects, particularly in myocardium and vasculature development. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of the ablated hearts identified collagen as a crucial signaling molecule from fibroblasts that influences the development of cardiomyocytes and vascular endothelial cells.</p><p>This is an interesting manuscript; however, there are several major issues, including an over-reliance on the scRNA-seq data, which shows inconsistencies between replicates.</p><p>Some of the major issues are described below.</p><p>(1) The CD31 immunostaining data (Figure 3B-G) indicate a reduction in endothelial cell numbers following fibroblast deletion using PdgfraCreER+/-; RosaDTA+/- mice. However, the scRNA-seq data show no percentage change in the endothelial cell population (Figure 4D). Furthermore, while the percentage of Vas_ECs decreased in ablated samples at E16.5, the results at E18.5 were inconsistent, showing an increase in one replicate and a decrease in another, raising concerns about the reliability of the RNA-seq findings.</p><p>(2) Similarly, while the percentage of Ven_CMs increased at E18.5, it exhibited differing trends at E16.5 (Fig. 4E), further highlighting the inconsistency of the scRNA-seq analysis with the other data.</p><p>(3) Furthermore, the authors noted that the ablated samples had slightly higher percentages of cardiomyocytes in the G1 phase compared to controls (Fig. 4H, S11D), which aligns with the enrichment of pathways related to heart development, sarcomere organization, heart tube morphogenesis, and cell proliferation. However, it is unclear how this correlates with heart development, given that the hearts of ablated mice are significantly smaller than those of controls (Figure 3E). Additionally, the heart sections from ablated samples used for CD31/DAPI staining in Figure 3F appear much larger than those of the controls, raising further inconsistencies in the manuscript.</p><p>(4) The manuscript relies heavily on the scRNA-seq dataset, which shows inconsistencies between the two replicates. Furthermore, the morphological and histological analyses do not align with the scRNA-seq findings.</p><p>(5) There is a lack of mechanistic insight into how collagen, as a key signaling molecule from fibroblasts, affects the development of cardiomyocytes and vascular endothelial cells.</p><p>(6) In Figure 1B, Col1a1 expression is observed in the epicardial cells (Figure 1A, E11.5), but this is not represented in the accompanying cartoon.</p><p>(7) Do the PdgfraCreER+/-; RosaDTA+/- mice survive after birth when induced at E15.5, and do they exhibit any cardiac defects?</p><p>Comments on Revised Version (from BRE):</p><p>The manuscript has greatly improved following the revision, and I have no additional comments to offer.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.102305.4.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors investigated fibroblasts' communication with key cell types in developing and neonatal hearts, with focus on critical roles of fibroblast-cardiomyocyte and fibroblast-endothelial cells network in cardiac morphogenesis. They tried to map the spatial distribution of these cell types and reported the major pathways and signaling molecules driving the communication. They also used Cre-DTA system to ablate Pdgfra labeled cells and observed myocardial and endothelial cell defects at development. They screened the pathways and genes using sequencing data of ablated heart. Lastly they reported a compensatory collagen expression in long term ablated neonate heart. Overall, this study provides us with important insight on fibroblasts' roles in cardiac development and will be a powerful resource for collagens and ECM focused research.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors utilized good analyzing tools to investigate on multiple database of single cell sequencing and Multi-seq. They identified significant pathways, cellular and molecular interactions of fibroblasts. Additionally, they compared some of their analytic findings with human database, and identified several groups of ECM genes with varying roles in mice.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>This study is majorly based on sequencing data analysis. At the bench, they used very strident technique to study fibroblast functions by ablating one of the major cell population of heart. Also, experimental validation of their analyzed downstream pathways will be required eventually.</p><p>Comments on Revised Version (from BRE):</p><p>The authors did a good job addressing the questions asked at first review. However, I have some minor concerns.</p><p>(1) The paper notes that collagen signaling is observed in FB-VasEC in humans, but not in FB-VenCM, unlike mice. Did the authors analyze predictive ligand receptor interaction as they did with control and ablated mice heart? This could add valuable new insights that how FB regulate ventricular CM in human heart.</p><p>(2) The authors provided data on Defect in CD31 expression in several models. Did they observe any other phenotypes associated with defective endothelial or vascular system? Such as, blood accumulation in pericardium, larger/smaller capillaries? Did they also examine percentage of Cdh5+ cells?</p><p>(3) Please mention the sample age of Figure 2A-C.</p><p>(4) Please follow the same style to describe X axis in graphs in Figure 3D (and all similar graphs in the manuscript) as followed in 3G.</p><p>(5) It is important to provide echocardiographic M mode images with a comparable number of cardiac cycles in control and ablated (Fig. 6H).</p><p>(6) In the long-term neonatal ablation experiments, collagen expressions return to normal.

The work includes extensive gene expression profiling and bioinformatic analysis. The prenatal fibroblast ablation studies show new information on the requirement of these cells on heart maturation before birth.</p><p>The strengths of the manuscript are the new single cell datasets and comprehensive approach to ablating cardiac fibroblasts in pre and postnatal development in mice. Extensive data are presented on mouse embryo fibroblast diversity and morphology in response to fibroblast ablation. Histological data support localization of major cardiac cell types and effects of fibroblast ablation on cardiac gene expression at different times of development.</p><p>A weakness of the study is that the major conclusions regarding collagen signaling and heart maturation are based on gene expression patterns and are not functionally validated.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>This study aims to elucidate the role of fibroblasts in regulating myocardium and vascular development through signaling to cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells. This focus is significant, given that fibroblasts, cardiomyocytes, and vascular endothelial cells are the three primary cell types in the heart. The authors employed a Pdgfra-CreER-controlled diphtheria toxin A (DTA) system to ablate fibroblasts at various embryonic and postnatal stages, characterizing the resulting cardiac defects, particularly in myocardium and vasculature development. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of the ablated hearts identified collagen as a crucial signaling molecule from fibroblasts that influences the development of cardiomyocytes and vascular endothelial cells.</p><p>This is an interesting manuscript; however, there are several major issues, including an over-reliance on the scRNA-seq data, which shows inconsistencies between replicates.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for carefully reading our revised manuscript. All of the questions listed below were raised in the previous round and have been addressed in the current revision. As noted in the “Recommendations for the Authors” section, the reviewer has no additional comments at this time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some of the major issues are described below.</p><p>(1) The CD31 immunostaining data (Figure 3B-G) indicate a reduction in endothelial cell numbers following fibroblast deletion using PdgfraCreER+/-; RosaDTA+/- mice. However, the scRNA-seq data show no percentage change in the endothelial cell population (Figure 4D). Furthermore, while the percentage of Vas_ECs decreased in ablated samples at E16.5, the results at E18.5 were inconsistent, showing an increase in one replicate and a decrease in another, raising concerns about the reliability of the RNA-seq findings.</p><p>(2) Similarly, while the percentage of Ven_CMs increased at E18.5, it exhibited differing trends at E16.5 (Fig. 4E), further highlighting the inconsistency of the scRNA-seq analysis with the other data.</p><p>(3) Furthermore, the authors noted that the ablated samples had slightly higher percentages of cardiomyocytes in the G1 phase compared to controls (Fig. 4H, S11D), which aligns with the enrichment of pathways related to heart development, sarcomere organization, heart tube morphogenesis, and cell proliferation. However, it is unclear how this correlates with heart development, given that the hearts of ablated mice are significantly smaller than those of controls (Figure 3E). Additionally, the heart sections from ablated samples used for CD31/DAPI staining in Figure 3F appear much larger than those of the controls, raising further inconsistencies in the manuscript.</p><p>(4) The manuscript relies heavily on the scRNA-seq dataset, which shows inconsistencies between the two replicates. Furthermore, the morphological and histological analyses do not align with the scRNA-seq findings.</p><p>(5) There is a lack of mechanistic insight into how collagen, as a key signaling molecule from fibroblasts, affects the development of cardiomyocytes and vascular endothelial cells.</p><p>(6) In Figure 1B, Col1a1 expression is observed in the epicardial cells (Figure 1A, E11.5), but this is not represented in the accompanying cartoon.</p><p>(7) Do the PdgfraCreER+/-; RosaDTA+/- mice survive after birth when induced at E15.5, and do they exhibit any cardiac defects?</p><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors investigated fibroblasts' communication with key cell types in developing and neonatal hearts, with focus on critical roles of fibroblast-cardiomyocyte and fibroblast-endothelial cells network in cardiac morphogenesis. They tried to map the spatial distribution of these cell types and reported the major pathways and signaling molecules driving the communication. They also used Cre-DTA system to ablate Pdgfra labeled cells and observed myocardial and endothelial cell defects at development. They screened the pathways and genes using sequencing data of ablated heart. Lastly they reported a compensatory collagen expression in long term ablated neonate heart. Overall, this study provides us with important insight on fibroblasts' roles in cardiac development and will be a powerful resource for collagens and ECM focused research.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors utilized good analyzing tools to investigate on multiple database of single cell sequencing and Multi-seq. They identified significant pathways, cellular and molecular interactions of fibroblasts. Additionally, they compared some of their analytic findings with human database, and identified several groups of ECM genes with varying roles in mice.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>This study is majorly based on sequencing data analysis. At the bench, they used very strident technique to study fibroblast functions by ablating one of the major cell population of heart. Also, experimental validation of their analyzed downstream pathways will be required eventually.</p><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Most of my comments have been adequately addressed. Additional comments on new data in the revised manuscript are below.</p><p>(1) In the new figure S11, it is not really possible to draw major conclusions on mitral valve morphology and maturation since the planes of sections to not seem comparable. Observations regarding attachment to the papillary muscle might be dependent on the particular section being evaluated. However, it is useful to see that the valves are not severely affected in the ablated animals.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment and agree with the reviewer’s observation. Accordingly, we have updated the manuscript by removing the original conclusion-related statement and instead highlighting that the valves were not severely affected in the ablated animals (page 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In the last supplemental figure S19, it is not possible to determine if results are or are not statistically significant for n=2 as shown for FS and EF for the ablated animals and controls. The text says that there is a trend of improved heart function, but evaluation of additional animals is needed to support this conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment and agree that a sample size of n = 2 is too small to draw meaningful conclusions. As previously suggested by the reviewer, we have removed this result from the manuscript (page 10).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>The manuscript has greatly improved following the revision, and I have no additional comments to offer.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Authors did a good job addressing questions asked at first review. However, I have some minor concerns.</p><p>(1) The paper notes that collagen signaling is observed in FB-VasEC in humans, but not in FB-VenCM, unlike mice. Did authors analyze predictive ligand receptor interaction as they did with control and ablated mice heart? This could add valuable new insights that how FB regulate ventricular CM in human heart.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. We have analyzed the predicted ligand-receptor interactions between Fb and Ven_CM, as well as between Fb and Vas_EC, using human scRNA-seq data. The results are provided as a supplemental figure (Fig. S8C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors provided data on Defect in CD31 expression in several models. Did they observed any other phenotypes associated with defective endothelial or vascular system? Such as, blood accumulation in pericardium, larger/smaller capillaries? Did they also examined percentage of Cdh5+ cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the questions. We did not observe clear evidence of blood accumulation in the pericardium of the ablated hearts, as shown in figure 3B, 3E, 6B, and 6F. Additionally, we did not perform Cdh5 staining in either the control or ablated hearts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Please mention the sample age of Figure 2A-C.</p></disp-quote><p>These are single-cell mRNA sequencing data from CD1 mice across 18 developmental stages, ranging from E9.5 to P9. We have added this information to the manuscript (page 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Please follow the same style to describe X axis in graphs in Figure 3D (and all similar graphs in manuscript) as followed in 3G.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. We assume the reviewer was referring to the descriptions in the relevant figure legends. We have updated the legend for Figure 3D to ensure consistency with the description provided for Figure 3G (page 15).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) It is important to provide echocardiographic M mode images with a comparable number of cardiac cycles in control and ablated (Fig. 6H).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. As explained in our previous response, the echocardiographic data for both control and mutant mice were collected in conscious animals. The differences in their cardiac cycles reflect variations in heart rate, which represent a disease phenotype and cannot be altered. Therefore, we are unable to provide M-mode images with a similar number of cardiac cycles for control and ablated mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) In the long-term neonatal ablation experiments, collagen expressions return to normal. The manuscript attributes this to possible &quot;compensatory expression,&quot; Do they have any thoughts how this is regulated? Are other cell types stepping in, or are surviving FBs proliferating?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the question. As suggested, the compensatory collagen expression could be driven by surviving fibroblasts or other cell types. Since we currently lack evidence to exclude either possibility, we believe both could be contributing factors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) While collagen is shown to be a dominant signaling molecule, its centrality is inferred primarily from scRNAseq and ligand-receptor predictions. Did authors try any functional rescue experiment (e.g., exogenous collagen supplementation or receptor blockade) to directly validate this pathway's role in vivo?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. As noted in our previous revision in response to similar questions from the other two reviewers, we agree that these rescue experiments are of interest but are beyond the scope of the current study. We plan to pursue these investigations in future work and share our findings when available.</p></body></sub-article></article>
