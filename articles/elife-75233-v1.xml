However, the subcellular localization and dynamics of MDGAs, or their specific action mode in neurons remain unclear. Here, surface immunostaining of endogenous MDGAs and single molecule tracking of recombinant MDGAs in dissociated hippocampal neurons reveal that MDGAs are homogeneously distributed and exhibit fast membrane diffusion, with a small reduction in mobility across neuronal maturation. Knocking-down/out MDGAs using shRNAs and CRISPR/Cas9 strategies increases the density of excitatory synapses, the membrane confinement of neuroligin-1, and the phosphotyrosine level of neuroligins associated with excitatory post-synaptic differentiation. Finally, MDGA silencing reduces the mobility of AMPA receptors, increases the frequency of miniature EPSCs (but not IPSCs), and selectively enhances evoked AMPA-receptor-mediated EPSCs in CA1 pyramidal neurons. Overall, our results support a mechanism by which interactions between MDGAs and neuroligin-1 delays the assembly of functional excitatory synapses containing AMPA receptors.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>synapse development</kwd><kwd>adhesion molecules</kwd><kwd>hippocampal cultures</kwd><kwd>single molecule tracking</kwd><kwd>Electrophysiology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-13-PDOC-0012-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Letellier</surname><given-names>Mathieu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-17-CE16-0028-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thoumine</surname><given-names>Olivier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-15-NEUR-0007-04</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Choquet</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-LABX-43</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Choquet</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DEQ20160334916</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thoumine</surname><given-names>Olivier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>MDGAs are highly diffusive molecules that alter both neuroligin-1 and AMPA receptor dynamics and function, thereby significantly delaying the differentiation of excitatory post-synapses.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During brain development, synapse assembly and maturation are critical processes involving several families of adhesion molecules, among which the neurexin-neuroligin complex has been one of the most extensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bemben et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chanda et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Letellier et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Südhof, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wu et al., 2019</xref>). Neuroligins (NLGNs) are post-synaptic proteins that comprise four members in rodents (NLGN1-4), NLGN1 being primarily localized at excitatory synapses, NLGN2 and NLGN4 at inhibitory synapses, and NLGN3 at both types of synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Budreck and Scheiffele, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Varoqueaux et al., 2004</xref>). At the structural level, NLGNs form both homo- and hetero-dimers through <italic>cis</italic>-interactions between their acetylcholinesterase (AchE)-like domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Araç et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dean et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fabrichny et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Poulopoulos et al., 2012</xref>). NLGNs also contain a stalk region that can be cleaved by proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Peixoto et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Suzuki et al., 2012</xref>), a single pass transmembrane domain, and a conserved intracellular tail whose binding to post-synaptic scaffolding molecules can be modulated by phosphorylation and thereby influence AMPA receptor (AMPAR) recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antonelli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bemben et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bemben et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Giannone et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Letellier et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Letellier et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Poulopoulos et al., 2009</xref>). Post-synaptic NLGNs bind pre-synaptic neurexins (NRXNs) through extracellular interactions, thus making a bridge between sub-micron adhesive modules across the synaptic cleft that precisely position AMPARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chamma et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Haas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Trotter et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Apart from NRXNs, few direct NLGN binding partners have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Südhof, 2017</xref>). Recently, MAM-domain GPI-anchored molecules (MDGAs) were reported to bind in cis to NLGNs with high affinity and compete with their binding to NRXNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Connor et al., 2019</xref>). In the co-culture assay, the expression of MDGAs together with NLGNs in heterologous cells impairs the synapse-inducing activity of NLGNs on contacting axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Elegheert et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pettem et al., 2013</xref>). Crystal structures of MDGA-NLGN complexes revealed that MDGAs bind through their first Ig1-Ig2 domains to the two lobes of the NLGN extracellular dimer, at sites which overlap with the NRXN binding interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Elegheert et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gangwar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kim et al., 2017</xref>). Manipulations of MDGA1 protein levels by over-expression (OE), knock-down (KD), or knock-out (KO) in neurons have led to the common view that MDGA1 selectively inhibits inhibitory synapse formation by primarily repressing NLGN2-NRXN interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Connor et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Loh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pettem et al., 2013</xref>). Similar studies performed on MDGA2 have led to more debated results, i.e. some reports showing that MDGA2 KO specifically inhibits excitatory synapse formation in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Connor et al., 2016</xref>), while others showing no effect of MDGA2 KD on either excitatory or inhibitory synapses in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Loh et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, there are still a number of critical questions that need to be answered in order to get a more complete picture of the role of MDGAs in synapse differentiation and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Connor et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Thoumine and Marchot, 2017</xref>). 1 / What is the surface dynamics and nanoscale localization of endogenous MDGAs at the neuronal membrane? Indeed, in the absence of highly specific and efficient antibodies to MDGAs allowing reliable immunostaining in tissue, over-expression approaches have yielded contrasting results about the presence of MDGA1 and MDGA2 at excitatory versus inhibitory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Loh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pettem et al., 2013</xref>). Given the absence of an intracellular domain with potential synaptic retention motifs, MDGAs are in fact expected to display fast membrane diffusion and not accumulate at synapses. 2 / Considering that the binding of MDGAs and NRXNs to NLGNs is mutually exclusive, what is the effect of MDGAs on the dynamic distribution of NLGN in dendrites and on the NLGN-dependent phosphotyrosine signaling pathway known to regulate post-synaptic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Giannone et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Letellier et al., 2018</xref>)? 3 / Consequently, what is the impact of MDGAs on AMPAR surface dynamics and synaptic function, which were shown to be tightly regulated by NLGN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Czöndör et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Haas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Letellier et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mondin et al., 2011</xref>)?</p><p>To address those questions, we examined the surface localization and dynamics of MDGAs, using both custom-made antibodies to endogenous MDGA1 as well as replacement strategies with recombinant MDGAs bearing small tags and labelled with monomeric fluorescent probes. Using a combination of single-molecule imaging and electrophysiology, we also assessed the effects of single-cell MDGA knock-down or knock-out on NLGN1 and AMPAR membrane diffusion and localization in relation to synapse maturation, as well as on synaptic transmission. Finally, we examined the impact of MDGA knock-down on endogenous NLGN phosphotyrosine levels by biochemistry. Together, our data indicate that MDGAs are highly mobile and homogeneously distributed molecules, that alter both NLGN1 and AMPAR dynamics, localization, and function, thereby significantly delaying the differentiation of excitatory post-synapses.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Endogenous MDGA1 is homogeneously distributed in hippocampal pyramidal neurons</title><p>To examine the localization of endogenous MDGAs in neurons, we produced and purified full-length recombinant Fc-tagged MDGA1 and MDGA2, and custom-ordered the generation of rabbit polyclonal antibodies against those proteins. We then characterized the collected antisera using immunohistochemistry and western blots. The MDGA1 antiserum recognized recombinant HA-MDGA1 (but not HA-MDGA2) extracted from HEK-293T cells as a 130 kDa band on immunoblots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), above the molecular weight of 101 kDa expected from the amino-acid sequence, suggesting glycosylation of the protein i.e. through the addition of N-linked sugar chains. The reactivity to MDGA1 was abolished by pre-incubation of the antiserum with an excess of recombinant MDGA1-Fc antigen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The MDGA1 antiserum recognized a single band around 130 kDa in brain homogenates from wild-type mice, which was not present in brain homogenates from <italic>Mdga1</italic> KO mice, demonstrating antibody specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In some samples, the MDGA1 antibody recognized a doublet of bands, which may suggest a differential glycosylation pattern seemingly regulated across neuronal development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Immunohistochemistry on brain sections showed abundant MDGA1 localization in the hippocampus, with prominent labeling in CA3 and CA1 stratum radiatum and stratum oriens containing pyramidal neuron dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). MDGA1 staining was absent in brain sections from <italic>Mdga1</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ishikawa et al., 2011</xref>), showing antibody specificity in tissue. MDGA1 was detected both in pre-synaptic and post-synaptic fractions from synaptosome preparations, revealing its presence in synaptic compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Unfortunately, the MDGA2 antiserum was not specific enough to be further used. However, we detected abundant levels of MDGA2 mRNAs by RT-qPCR in hippocampal cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>), in agreement with previous in situ hybridization and β-galactosidase staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Connor et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lee et al., 2013</xref>), together suggesting that the MDGA2 protein is also expressed.

Live labelling with the MDGA1 antibody was first tested in COS-7 cells expressing recombinant MDGA1 or MDGA2 molecules. Strong surface staining with the MDGA1 antiserum was observed in cells expressing MDGA1, but not in cells expressing MDGA2, validating this application and demonstrating no cross-reactivity of the antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). In neurons, the MDGA1 staining revealed many sub-micron clusters, most likely a consequence of artifactual MDGA1 aggregation due to live incubation with the divalent polyclonal antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chamma et al., 2016a</xref>). Those small MDGA1 puncta were distributed all over the dendritic shaft, with relatively constant total fluorescence intensity and cluster area over the developmental period analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), and a small decrease in MDGA1 cluster intensity at DIV 21, in accordance to an overall decrease of total cellular MDGA1 level at later time points, as shown by RT-qPCR and western blot analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-D</xref>). MDGA1 clusters were present, but not particularly enriched, at excitatory or inhibitory synapses. Quantitatively, the fraction of excitatory post-synapses containing MDGA1 clusters was 45% and 40% at DIV 7 and 14, respectively, and decreased to 25% at DIV 21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), while the proportion of inhibitory post-synapses containing MDGA1 was 20% at DIV 10 and increased to 30% at DIV 14 and 21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>), suggesting that MDGA1 partially redistributes from excitatory to inhibitory synapses upon neuronal maturation. Overall, among synapses that contained MDGA1, the area overlap between PSD-95 and MDGA1, or between gephyrin and MDGA1 was around 15–30% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H and K</xref>), pointing to a minor occupancy of both excitatory and inhibitory synapses by MDGA1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Recombinant MDGA1 and MDGA2 are homogeneously distributed in dendrites at the nanoscale level</title><p>Next, we examined the nanoscale membrane organization of MDGAs using super-resolution microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The formation of small endogenous MDGA1 aggregates observed upon live antibody labelling prevented a reliable estimation of MDGA distribution, as previously documented for NLGN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chamma et al., 2016a</xref>). Moreover, we were lacking a good antibody to MDGA2 for surface staining. Thus, to monitor the precise localization of MDGAs expressed at near endogenous levels, we replaced native MDGAs by recombinant tagged counterparts allowing for their detection at the ensemble and single molecule levels. To knock down native MDGAs, we used previously published shRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Loh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pettem et al., 2013</xref>). The efficiency and specificity of MDGA1 and MDGA2 silencing in our conditions was first assessed in COS-7 cells by co-expressing shRNAs to MDGA1 or MDGA2 with recombinant MDGA1 or MDGA2 followed by Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In neurons, we measured a 75% decrease of surface MDGA1 immunofluorescence level in cells expressing shMDGA1 as compared with non-electroporated cells or cells expressing shCTRL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A,C</xref>). In neurons electroporated with shMDGA2, we estimated a 40% reduction in mRNA level as compared with shCTRL by RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E</xref>). We then rescued endogenous MDGAs with recombinant rat MDGA1 or MDGA2 bearing the short N-terminal biotin acceptor peptide (AP), which is biotinylated upon the co-expression of biotin ligase (BirA<sup>ER</sup>) allowing for its detection with streptavidin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Howarth et al., 2005</xref>). Neurons co-expressing shMDGA1 and rescue AP-MDGA1 showed a 1.5-fold increase in MDGA1 surface immunostaining compared to non-electroporated cells, reflecting a mild over-expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B, D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Nanoscale distribution of MDGA1 and MDGA2 in the neuronal membrane.</title><p>Hippocampal neurons were electroporated at DIV 0 with a combination of shRNAs to MDGA1 or MDGA2, rescue AP-MDGA1 or AP-MDGA2 (respectively), biotin ligase BirA<sup>ER</sup>, and Homer1c-DsRed.

Since MDGAs are GPI-anchored membrane molecules, we electroporated neurons with GFP-GPI as a control, and labeled them with an anti-GFP nanobody also conjugated to Alexa 647, a strategy previously validated for GFP-NRXN1β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chamma et al., 2016a</xref>). Using this approach, AP-MDGA1 and AP-MDGA2 displayed a fairly uniform distribution at DIV 10 and 14, filling the whole dendritic shaft without specific accumulation at synapses, similarly to the negative control GFP-GPI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and C</xref>). In post-synapses labeled by Homer1c-DsRed, MDGAs and GFP-GPI displayed a disperse localization (insets). For comparison, AP-NLGN1 expressed under similar replacement conditions (shRNA + rescue) and labeled identically with mSA-Alexa 647, showed a strong accumulation at synapses as previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chamma et al., 2016a</xref>). Synaptic enrichment at DIV 10 and 14 was around 1.3 and 1.5 for both MDGAs and GFP-GPI, and significantly higher for NLGN1 (2.3 and 2.7, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and D</xref>). These data show that MDGAs are not particularly enriched at excitatory synapses, and their differential localization with respect to NLGN1 suggest that the majority of NLGN1 molecules accumulated at post-synapses are not associated to MDGAs.</p><p>To rule out the possibility that the mSA probe was hindering the binding of MDGAs to NLGNs, and hence the penetration of MDGAs in synapses, we performed a series of control biochemical and immunocytochemical experiments. Streptavidin pull-down of proteins extracted from COS-7 cells expressing AP-MDGA1, BirA<sup>ER</sup>, and HA-NLGN1, followed by anti-MDGA1 and anti-NLGN1 immunoblots, revealed that biotinylated AP-MDGA1 strongly recruits HA-NLGN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>). This finding suggests that mSA, which is four times smaller than regular streptavidin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Demonte et al., 2013</xref>), should easily access AP-tagged MDGAs bound to endogenous NLGN1 in neurons. Given the high sequence and structure similarity between MDGA1 and MDGA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Elegheert et al., 2017</xref>), we expect AP-MDGA2 to also bind NLGN1 in this assay. To confirm that the interaction between MDGAs and NLGN1 also occurs when these molecules are bound to external probes in living cells, we performed cross-linking experiments using a mixture of a primary mouse anti-biotin and secondary anti-mouse antibodies in COS-7 cells expressing AP-MDGA1, HA-NLGN1 and BirA<sup>ER</sup>, or in cells expressing HA-MDGA2, AP-NLGN1 and BirA<sup>ER</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C-F</xref>). In both cases, the fluorescent antibody clusters that aggregated AP-tagged proteins contained the HA-tagged co-expressed protein, demonstrating no hindrance caused by antibodies (which are much larger than mSA) on the MDGA-NLGN1 interaction. Strengthened by these controls, our dSTORM data clearly indicate that MDGAs are not enriched at post-synapses, supporting the concept that MDGAs do not bind NRXN-occupied NLGNs at synapses.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Individual recombinant MDGA1 and MDGA2 are highly diffusive in the neuronal membrane</title><p>To characterize the surface dynamics of MDGAs at the individual level, we sparsely labelled biotinylated AP-MDGAs at the cell membrane using 1 nM mSA conjugated to the robust fluorophore STAR 635 P, and performed single-molecule tracking by universal Point Accumulation In Nanoscale Topography (uPAINT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chamma et al., 2016a</xref>).

The presence of the AP tag and labeling with mSA should not interfere with the binding of NLGN1 to native MDGAs, as shown by streptavidin pull-down of proteins extracted from COS-7 cells expressing AP-NLGN1 and HA-MDGA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>). By comparing neurons at DIV 10 and 14, there was a shift in NLGN1 mobility towards lower diffusion coefficients, which reflects a synaptic immobilization of NLGN1 upon neuronal maturation, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chamma et al., 2016a</xref>). In DIV 10 neurons, shMDGA2 had no effect on the NLGN1 diffusion coefficient, whose distribution looked very similar to the shCTRL condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>). In contrast, at DIV 14, shMDGA2 decreased the global diffusion coefficient of NLGN1 as compared to shCTRL, in particular by reducing the mobile pool of NLGN1 molecules (the peak centered at D = 0.1 µm²/s), and concomitantly raising the fraction of confined NLGN1 molecules (peak at D = 0.01 µm²/s) that are most likely retained at synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–H</xref>). This effect was reversed upon the co-expression of an HA-MDGA2 construct resistant to shMDGA2.

In neurons co-expressing a MDGA2 construct resistant to the shRNA, the AP-NLGN1 synaptic enrichment was at the control level at both DIV 10 and 14. Taken together, uPAINT and dSTORM data suggest that MDGA2 impairs the immobilization of NLGN1 at newly formed synapses, but not its intrinsic post-synaptic accumulation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Effect of MDGA2 knock-down on NLGN1 nanoscale membrane localization and phosphorylation.</title><p>(<bold>A, C</bold>) Neurons were electroporated at DIV 0 with AP-NLGN1, BirA<sup>ER</sup>, and Homer1c-DsRed, plus shCTRL, shMDGA2, or shMDGA2 + rescue HA-MDGA2, and imaged at DIV 10 or 14 using dSTORM after high density labelling with Alexa 647-conjugated mSA.

Our rationale was that by shielding NLGN1, MDGAs could impair the NLGN1 phosphorylation signaling mechanism which is dependent on NRXN binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Giannone et al., 2013</xref>). We electroporated neurons at DIV 0 with shMDGA2 or shCTRL and analyzed the phosphotyrosine level of immunoprecipitated NLGNs by performing immunoblot at DIV 10, when NLGN phosphorylation is maximal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Letellier et al., 2018</xref>). The NLGN phosphotyrosine level was almost two-fold higher in neurons expressing shMDGA2 compared to shCTRL, with no change in the total amount of NLGNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–G</xref>). This result demonstrates that endogenous MDGAs negatively regulate NLGN tyrosine phosphorylation.</p><p>Given that NLGN1 tyrosine phosphorylation is likely influenced by NRXN binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Giannone et al., 2013</xref>) and that MDGA2 inhibits NLGN1 binding to NRXNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Elegheert et al., 2017</xref>), we characterized the dynamics of GFP-NRXN1β in axons making contacts with the dendrites of neurons in which MDGA2 was knocked-down, expecting a preferential reduction in mobility and/or increase in confinement of GFP-NRXN1β at contact sites. To this aim, we co-cultured neurons electroporated with GFP-NRXN1β with neurons electroporated with shMDGA2 or shCTRL (both containing an EBFP2 reporter) plus an intrabody to PSD-95 as a post-synaptic marker (Xph20-mRuby2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rimbault et al., 2019</xref>), and searched at DIV 10 for GFP-NRXN1β positive axons contacting EBFP2-positive dendrites. Then, we analyzed the GFP-NRXN1β enrichment at axon-dendrite contact sites, or we sparsely labelled GFP-NRXN1β with Atto 647N-conjugated anti-GFP nanobody and performed uPAINT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chamma et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Klatt et al., 2021</xref>). The GFP-NRXN1β enrichment at pre-synapses was around 2 whether axons made contacts with dendrites expressing shMDGA2 or shCTRL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). In addition, the global diffusion coefficient of GFP-NRXN1β followed a broad distribution reflecting both fast diffusion in the axon and confinement at pre-synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chamma et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Klatt et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Neupert et al., 2015</xref>), but this distribution was not altered by the presence of contacting dendrites from neurons expressing either shMDGA2 or shCTRL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). Even though these results might suggest that MDGA KD does not directly affect the trans-synaptic NRXN1β-NLGN interaction, we have to moderate this explanation by considering that GFP-NRXN1β expressing axons make simultaneous contacts with dendrites from many neurons, such that the effect of shMDGA2 in sparsely electroporated cells is diluted.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>MDGA2 knock-down reduces AMPAR diffusion</title><p>Given the previously reported effects of NLGN1 expression level and phosphotyrosine signaling on AMPAR surface trafficking and synaptic recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Haas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Letellier et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Letellier et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mondin et al., 2011</xref>), and seeing here the impact of MDGA2 knock-down on NLGN1 dynamics and phosphotyrosine level, we then questioned the role of MDGA2 on AMPAR surface diffusion. We electroporated hippocampal neurons at DIV 0 with shMDGA2 or shCTRL and tracked native AMPARs at the single molecule level by uPAINT upon sparse labeling with an antibody to the GluA2 N-terminal domain conjugated to Atto 647 N (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Czöndör et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Haas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nair et al., 2013</xref>). Expression of shMDGA2 significantly decreased the global AMPAR diffusion coefficient at DIV 10 compared to shCTRL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–D</xref>). Specifically, the mobile pool of AMPARs (D centered at 0.1 µm²/s) was reduced to the profit of slowly diffusing AMPARs (D &lt; 0.01 µm²/s), most likely corresponding to synaptic receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nair et al., 2013</xref>). This effect is consistent with the fact that shMDGA2 simultaneously increases the density of post-synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), which act as trapping elements for surface-diffusing AMPARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Czöndör et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mondin et al., 2011</xref>), resulting in an overall decrease in AMPAR mobility. At DIV 14, the distribution of AMPAR diffusion coefficients was shifted to the left as compared to DIV 10, reflecting AMPAR trapping at new synapses formed during this time interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E–H</xref>). Expression of shMDGA2 caused a further small decrease in diffusion coefficient, matching the observation that neurons expressing shMDGA2 show slightly higher numbers of excitatory synapses at DIV 14 as compared to neurons expressing shCTRL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Effect of MDGA2 knock-down on AMPAR membrane mobility.</title><p>Neurons were electroporated at DIV 0 with shCTRL-GFP or shMDGA2-GFP, and imaged at DIV 10 or DIV 14 with uPAINT.

Specifically, hippocampal neurons were electroporated at DIV 0 with vectors containing the Cas9 gene, a guide RNA targeting either MDGA1, MDGA2, or a control sequence, plus a GFP or nuclear EBFP reporter. We first verified by genomic DNA cleavage that Cas9 was cutting the expected region of MDGA1 or MDGA2 genes only when the respective gRNA was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We also performed an extensive patch-seq analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cadwell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fuzik et al., 2016</xref>) of MDGA mRNAs and off target genes potentially affected by the electroporation of neurons with CRISPR/Cas9 constructs against MDGA1 or MDGA2 (Tables 1 and 2).

Those effects of gRNA to MDGA2 on both PSD-95 and VGLUT1 cluster density were abolished by the co-expression of a rescue MDGA2 vector, demonstrating the specificity of the mechanism.

We demonstrate that both MDGA1 and MDGA2 are essentially non-synaptically enriched molecules that exhibit fast diffusion in the dendritic membrane. Moreover, the knock-down of MDGAs selectively increases excitatory synapse density and as a consequence reduces the surface mobility of both NLGN1 and AMPARs, increases AMPAR-mediated mEPSC frequency and evoked EPSC amplitude, as well as NLGN1 phosphosignaling. Thus, by shielding a fraction of NLGN1 from binding to pre-synaptic NRXNs, MDGAs negatively regulates NLGN function in excitatory synaptic differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>).</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Working model for the role of MDGAs in excitatory synapse differentiation.</title><p>Since NRXNs and MDGAs compete for the binding to NLGN1, the MDGA concentration acts as a key regulator of the signaling events downstream of the NRXN-NLGN1 interaction. When the MDGA level is low in response to KD or KO (right panels), the preferential interaction of NLGN1 with NRXN favors NLGN1 tyrosine phosphorylation and the associated development of excitatory synapses containing AMPARs. When the MDGA level is high (left panel), the NRXN-NLGN1 interaction is weakened and the formation of excitatory synapses is delayed. In dissociated neurons, MDGAs primarily regulate the overall density of NLGN1 and AMPAR modules, but not the actual amount of these molecules at individual synapses (arrow ‘synaptogenesis’). In organotypic slices, MDGAs tend to keep synapses in a silent state with low amounts of AMPARs, and single-cell KO of either MDGA1 or MDGA2 in CA1 neurons promotes the selective recruitment of AMPARs (arrow ‘unsilencing’).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-75233-fig10-v1.tif"/></fig><p>We first examined the localization of MDGAs in hippocampal tissue and dissociated cultures. The generation of specific antibodies allowed us to examine the distribution of native MDGA1, which showed strong expression levels in the neuropil of the CA region of the hippocampus, confirming previously shown results of in situ hybridization of MDGA1 mRNAs and staining of β-galactosidase activity expressed from the <italic>Mdga1</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Connor et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Connor et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lee et al., 2013</xref>). MDGA1 immunostaining in dissociated cultures at DIV 14 showed that a large fraction of excitatory synapses did not contain MDGA1. Recombinant MDGA1 and MDGA2 expressed by rescuing endogenous MDGA levels also showed no preferential retention at Homer1c-positive puncta, in contrast with the positive controls NLGN1 and LRRTM2 labeled similarly and showing strong post-synaptic accumulation, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chamma et al., 2016a</xref>). Previous studies also reported a small colocalization extent of either YFP-MDGA1 or HRP-MDGA2 with excitatory synaptic markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Loh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pettem et al., 2013</xref>). Our results show that individual MDGAs often localized as transient sub-micron clusters at the periphery of Homer1c puncta, representing the confinement area of a small number of labeled molecules. The nature of these domains is unclear, but might represent a transition zone where NLGN1 could switch between MDGA-bound and NRXN-bound states, with the potential existence of mixed NLGN1 dimers that would exhibit specific mobility properties. In any case, the sum of this MDGA-rich peri-synaptic compartment plus the diffusive pool of MDGAs in synapses might represent enough material to be detected in synaptosomes (this study) and in the synaptic cleft proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Loh et al., 2016</xref>). When sampled at saturating labeling density using dSTORM, MDGAs showed a rather diffuse localization in the shaft and at synapses both at DIV 10 and 14, with modest synaptic enrichment as the negative control GFP-GPI. As compared to uPAINT, which gives information on the membrane dynamics of a subset of sparsely labeled molecules, dSTORM performed after saturating live labeling provides a snapshot of the whole population of MDGAs that integrates over time many transient confinement areas into a single 2D projection image. Thus the localization of molecules observed in dSTORM seems naturally more homogeneous, as previously reported for NLGN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chamma et al., 2016a</xref>).</p><p>In addition, AP-MDGA1 and AP-MDGA2 exhibited fast membrane diffusion throughout dendrites, even within post-synaptic sites, indicating no particular molecular retention at synapses. These observations are compatible with the fact that MDGAs lack an intracellular C-terminal domain such as those present in NLGN1 or AMPAR auxiliary subunits, which bind PDZ domain-containing scaffolding proteins that stabilize them at synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bats et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Irie et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mondin et al., 2011</xref>). A mild confinement of MDGAs outside synapses was observed upon neuronal maturation, which might be due to the fact that a fraction of MDGAs bind to extra-synaptic NLGN clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gerrow et al., 2006</xref>) or to another unknown protein, e.g. through their Ig4-6 domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lee et al., 2013</xref>). These domains might also be due to interactions of the GPI anchor of MDGAs to the lipid microenvironment present in some membrane microdomains such as lipid rafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Díaz-López et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Renner et al., 2009</xref>). By comparing side by side the distributions of diffusion coefficients for MDGAs and NLGN1, we estimate that around 12% of the highly mobile extra-synaptic MDGAs are not bound to NLGN1, otherwise MDGAs would naturally adopt the slower diffusion of NLGN1. Furthermore, the fact that MDGAs do not accumulate at synapses like NLGN1 over neuronal development (from DIV 10–14) suggests that synaptic NLGN1 is not bound to MDGAs, but instead to NRXNs which display high local concentration at pre-synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chamma et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chamma et al., 2016b</xref>). Thus, by preventing dendritic NLGN1 from aberrantly binding to the fraction of freely-diffusing NRXNs at the surface of contacting axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chamma et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Neupert et al., 2015</xref>), native MDGAs seem to protect neurons from forming synapses too quickly.</p><p>Using either previously reported shRNAs or newly generated CRIPSR/Cas9 constructs, we showed that MDGA2 delays excitatory synaptic development and AMPAR-dependent transmission, consistent with the in vivo KO of <italic>Mdga2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Connor et al., 2016</xref>). These effects were accompanied by a global decrease of NLGN1 diffusion, supporting the idea that by losing its MDGA partner, NLGN1 is more available to bind axonal NRXNs and thereby accelerates synapse formation. Indeed, the effects of MDGA2 KD and KO were more prominent at DIV 10 during the active phase of synaptogenesis, and barely detectable at DIV 14, in agreement with the lack of effect of shMDGA2 previously seen on excitatory synapse density in DIV 15 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Loh et al., 2016</xref>). Upon MDGA2 knock-down, there was no significant increase in the synaptic enrichment of either NRXN1β or NLGN1, suggesting that synapses can be newly assembled using a fixed number of those trans-synaptic adhesion molecules. We found more contrasted results with MDGA1, that is the CRISPR/Cas9 strategy significantly increased excitatory post-synaptic density and AMPAR-mediated mEPSC frequency at DIV 10 in dissociated neurons, as well as evoked AMPAR-mediated EPSCs in organotypic slices, while shRNA to MDGA1 had little effect at both DIV 10 and DIV 14, in agreement with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pettem et al., 2013</xref>). The discrepancy might be due to the fact that CRISPR/Cas9 represses MDGA1 expression more strongly than shMDGA1. Indeed, in previous studies, effects of MDGAs on excitatory and inhibitory synapse development were seen only when both MDGA1 and MDGA2 were knocked down (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Loh et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that MDGA1 and MDGA2 might compensate for each other’s loss such that the important parameter in these experiments is the overall MDGA level. The selective increase in inhibitory - but not excitatory - synapses in hippocampal CA1 neurons of full <italic>Mdga1</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Connor et al., 2017</xref>) might come from the fact that MDGA1 is silenced throughout the whole animal lifetime, which might lead to compensatory effects. Furthermore, MDGA1 knock-out affects all cell types, including both pyramidal neurons and astrocytes that also express MDGA1 and NLGNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Stogsdill et al., 2017</xref>), which might overall cause mixed effects on hippocampal circuitry. A difference in the results obtained by global gene knock-out in mice and sparse single-neuron silencing was also seen for NLGN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chih et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Varoqueaux et al., 2006</xref>), suggesting that adhesion-dependent competition between neurons regulates synaptogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kwon et al., 2012</xref>), although sparsely knocking out NLGN1 did not reduce synapse number in another study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chanda et al., 2017</xref>). Strikingly, the phenotypes we saw with single cell MDGA2 KO (e.g. increases in post-synapse numbers and AMPAR-mediated mEPSC frequency in dissociated neurons) resembles the ones we previously observed by over-expressing NLGN1, thereby reinforcing the view that neurons compete for synapse formation through NRXN-NLGN adhesion. MDGA1 KO had more subtle effects, that is it significantly increased AMPAR-mediated mEPSC frequency but not the density of VGlut1 or GluA1 puncta, which might be due to the fact that electrophysiology is a more sensitive technique than immunostaining to detect AMPAR-dependent synaptic changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Letellier et al., 2018</xref>). In any case, crystal structures and affinity measurements support the concept of a stable MDGA1-NLGN1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Elegheert et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gangwar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kim et al., 2017</xref>), which should be compatible with the fact that endogenous MDGA1 can interact with NLGN1 as strongly as MDGA2 to impair excitatory synapse formation.</p><p>We also demonstrated a selective increase in the phosphotyrosine level of NLGNs upon MDGA2 knock-down. This observation relates to our previous findings that NLGN1 can be phosphorylated at a unique intracellular tyrosine residue (Y782), and that the NLGN1 phosphotyrosine level regulates the assembly of excitatory post-synaptic scaffolds in a NRXN-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Giannone et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, using either the expression of NLGN1 point mutants or the optogenetic stimulation of endogenous NLGN1 phosphorylation, we showed that a high NLGN1 phosphotyrosine level is associated with the selective increase in excitatory synapse number and AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Letellier et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Letellier et al., 2018</xref>). Strikingly, single-cell MDGA KO in CA1 neurons selectively enhanced AMPAR- (but not NMDAR-) mediated synaptic transmission, further implicating NLGN in the recruitment of AMPARs at nascent synapses. We thus propose the model that by occupying NLGN1, MDGAs inhibit the NRXN-induced phosphotyrosine signaling pathway associated with NLGN1 and thereby delay the assembly of functional excitatory synapses containing AMPARs. In this context, we were surprised not to observe any impact of MDGA KD on the global diffusion or pre-synaptic accumulation of GFP-NRXN1β in axons contacting neurons expressing shMDGA2, but these effects might have been obscured by the limited number of contacts between these cells or by NRXN1β over-expression. Future single-molecule tracking experiments on NRXN1-α or -β expressed at endogenous levels may allow one to clarify this issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Klatt et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Neupert et al., 2015</xref>). The enhancement of NLGN tyrosine phosphorylation caused by MDGA2 KD might be linked to the increased number of synapses, leading to enhanced local concentration of receptor tyrosine kinases such as Trk family members that are able to phosphorylate native NLGNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Letellier et al., 2018</xref>). Since NLGN3 can also be tyrosine phosphorylated in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Letellier et al., 2018</xref>), a contribution of NLGN3 to the increase in phosphotyrosine level seen upon MDGA2 KD is possible given that we used a pan NLGN antibody to reach efficient immunoprecipitation. However, the fact that MDGA binds 10-fold more weakly to NLGN3 than to NLGN1 in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Elegheert et al., 2017</xref>), and that the effects of NLGN tyrosine phosphorylation on post-synaptic differentiation are not seen in cultures from <italic>NLGN1</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Letellier et al., 2020</xref>) suggest that NLGN3 might only play a minor role in this process.</p><p>The decrease in global AMPAR diffusion observed upon MDGA2 knock-down can be linked to the parallel increase in the number of synaptic puncta. Indeed, a similar decrease in AMPAR diffusion was seen across neuronal development in culture or upon the over-expression of NLGN1, which both enhance the number of post-synapses that act as trapping elements for surface diffusing AMPARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Czöndör et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mondin et al., 2011</xref>). Upon MDGA2 knock-down, a transient immobilization of surface-diffusing AMPARs is expected to occur at newly formed synapses enriched in NLGN1, resembling what was previously observed at micro-patterned dots coated with NRXN1β-Fc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Czöndör et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, the actual content of AMPARs per post-synapse did not seem to be modified by MDGA KO in dissociated neurons, since both the synaptic AMPAR enrichment and the amplitude of AMPAR-mediated mEPSCs remained similar to control conditions. However, the density of synaptic puncta as well as the frequency of AMPAR-mediated mEPSCs were significantly enhanced by MDGA KO, suggesting that the new synapses that had appeared contained functional AMPARs. This situation is similar to NLGN1 over-expression that increases the number of synapses and the frequency, but not the amplitude, of AMPAR-mediated mEPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Letellier et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Levinson et al., 2005</xref>). In both cases (MDGA knock-down or NLGN overexpression), AMPARs seem to be inserted in novel synapses as individual units or modules, most likely influenced by the presence of NLGN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Haas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hruska et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">MacGillavry et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nair et al., 2013</xref>). In organotypic slices, MDGA KO selectively enhanced the AMPA/NMDA ratio in CA1 neurons but did not affect NMDAR-mediated EPSCs, indicating no net change in synapse number but instead an unsilencing mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kerchner and Nicoll, 2008</xref>). This process might also occur in dissociated neurons where the increase in the frequency of AMPAR-mediated mEPSCs upon MDGA KD (3-fold) was much larger than the enhancement in synapse number (50%). In any case, the robust recruitment of AMPARs through synaptogenic and/or unsilencing mechanisms ressembles the effects previously observed upon direct manipulation of NLGN1 expression or signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Letellier et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Letellier et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mondin et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that MDGAs act through a regulation of NLGN1 function.</p><p>Given the strong effects caused by MDGA loss-of-function on synaptic differentiation, the next challenge would be to determine which biological processes regulate endogenous MDGA levels in specific neuron types across development. One interesting factor might be constitutive neuronal activity that can influence synaptic protein expression levels, for example by modulating microRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dubes et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Letellier et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, MDGA1 transcripts were recently found to be regulated in response to chronic synaptic activity blockade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Silva et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, the action of MDGAs might be finely tuned by other proteins associated to the NRXN-NLGN trans-synaptic complex, including hevin and SPARC that are secreted by astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fan et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, the presence of NLGNs in astrocytes offers an additional level of regulation of synapse development through such a network of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Stogsdill et al., 2017</xref>). Finally, genetic mutations identified in patients with autism and leading to alterations in MDGA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bucan et al., 2009</xref>), are expected to cause profound changes in synapse differentiation such as the ones shown here.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

from A.M.

Mouse AP-tagged NLGN1, biotin ligase (BirA<sup>ER</sup>), shMDGA2, and mApple-V5-MDGA2 rescue plasmids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Loh et al., 2016</xref>) were gifts from A. Ting (Stanford University, CA). AP-MDGA1 and AP-MDGA2 were generated by replacing the V5 tag of the V5-MDGA1 and V5-MDGA2 constructs, respectively, by the 15 amino acids AP tag (<named-content content-type="sequence">5´-GGCCTGAACGATATCTTCGAGGCCCAGAAGATCGAGTGGCACGAG-3´</named-content>) using the HD-In-Fusion kit (Takara). The linker <named-content content-type="sequence">5´-GGAGGATCAGGAGGATCA-3´</named-content> was added after the AP tag. AP-MDGA1 and AP-MDGA2 rescue constructs were generated by inserting the mutations responsible for the resistance to the respective shRNAs obtained from HA-MDGA1 and mApple-V5-MDGA2 rescue constructs, respectively, using the HD-In-Fusion kit. HA-MDGA2 rescue was created by replacing the AP tag from the AP-MGDA2 rescue construct by the HA tag using the HD-In-Fusion kit.</p><p>The CRISPR target sequences were all 20-nucleotide long and followed by a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). The first step in the design of gRNAs involved identification of the best sequence to target. For MDGA1, we chose the more efficient gRNA proposed by the online software ChopChop (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://chopchop.cbu.uib.no/">https://chopchop.cbu.uib.no/</ext-link>). For MDGA2, we chose to target the exon1, near ATG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Labun et al., 2019</xref>). The guide RNA (gRNA) sequence was<named-content content-type="sequence"> 5’-CTTCAACGTACGAGCCCGGG-3’ </named-content>for MDGA1 and<named-content content-type="sequence"> 5’-ATTTAGTGTACGGTCTCGTG-3’ </named-content>for MDGA2. As a control we used a sequence from a gecko bank: <named-content content-type="sequence">5’-ATATTTCGGCAGTTGCAGCA-3’</named-content>. We took particular care to select gRNAs not sharing homology with any other sequence in the genome, even considering 0, 1, 2, or 3 mismatches, and with high efficiency scores (cutting frequency determination, CFD = 98/100).

Then, the total length of the dendrite was measured with the free line drawing tool of MetaMorph, and the linear pre- and postsynaptic density was calculated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Single molecule tracking (UPAINT)</title><p>Universal Point Accumulation in Nanoscale Topography (uPAINT) experiments were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chamma et al., 2016a</xref>). In brief, neuronal cultures were placed in a Inox Ludin chamber (Life Imaging Services) containing pre-warmed Tyrode solution supplemented with 1% biotin-free BSA (Roth #0163.4). The chamber was placed on a motorized inverted microscope (Nikon Ti-E Eclipse) enclosed in a thermostatic box (Life Imaging Services) providing air at 37 °C. Biotinylated AP tags in MDGA1, MDGA2 and NLGN1 were labelled with STAR 635P-conjugated mSA at a concentration of 1 nM; N-terminal V5 tags in MDGA1, MDGA2 and LRRTM2 were labeled with 1 nM recombinant Fab fragment coupled to STAR 635 P (Abnova, #RAB00032). GFP-GPI or GFP-NRXN1β were labeled with 1 nM anti-GFP nanobody conjugated to Atto 647 N. Endogenous AMPARs were labelled with a low concentration (~1 nM) of Atto 647N-conjugated anti-GluA2 antibodies. A four-color laser bench (405; 491; 561; and 647 nm, 100 mW each; Roper Scientific) is connected through an optical fiber to the TIRF illumination arm of the microscope and laser powers are controlled through acousto-optical tunable filters driven by Metamorph. The fluorophores STAR 635 P and Atto 647 N were excited with the 647 nm laser line through a four-band beam splitter (BS R405/488/561/635, SemRock). Samples were imaged by oblique laser illumination, allowing the excitation of individual fluorescent probes (mSA, V5 Fab, anti-GluA2) bound to the neuron surface, with minimal background coming from the probes in solution. Fluorescence light was collected through a 100 X/1.49 NA PL-APO objective using a FF01-676/29 nm emission filter (SemRock), placed on a filter wheel (Suter Instruments). Image stacks of 2000–4000 consecutive frames with an integration time of 20 ms, were acquired with an EMCCD camera working at 10 MHz and Gain 300 (Evolve, Photometrics).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>dSTORM</title><p>AP-tagged proteins were labelled for dSTORM using 100 nM mSA-Alexa 647 in Tyrode solution containing 1% biotin free-BSA (Roth #0163.4) for 10 min at 37 °C. V5-tagged proteins were labelled using 100 nM Alexa 647-conjugated anti-V5 Fab. GFP-GPI was labeled using 100 nM anti-GFP nanobody conjugated to Alexa 647. Cells were rinsed and fixed with 4% PFA–0.2% glutaraldehyde in PBS-sucrose 4% for 10 min at RT, then kept in PBS at 4 °C until dSTORM acquisitions. Neurons were imaged in Tris‐HCl buffer (pH 7.5), containing 10% glycerol, 10% glucose, 0.5 mg.mL<sup>–1</sup> glucose oxidase (Sigma), 40 mg.mL<sup>–1</sup> catalase (Sigma C100-0,1% w/v) and 50 mM β-mercaptoethylamine (MEA) (Sigma M6500) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Heilemann et al., 2008</xref>). The same microscope described above for uPAINT was used. This microscope is further equipped with a perfect focus system preventing drift in the z-axis during long acquisition times. Pumping of Alexa 647 dyes into their triplet state was performed for several seconds using ~ 60 mW of the 647 nm laser at the objective front lens. Then, a lower power (~30 mW) was applied to detect the stochastic emission of single-molecule fluorescence, which was collected using the same optics and detector as described above. Multicolour Tetraspec fluorescent 100 nm beads (Invitrogen, #T7279) or nano-diamonds (Adamas Nanotechnologies #ND-NV140 nm) were added to the sample for later registration of images and lateral drift correction. Single-molecule detection was performed online with automatic feedback control of the lasers using the WaveTracer module running in Metamorph, enabling optimal single-molecule density during the acquisition. Acquisition sequences of 64,000 frames were acquired in streaming mode at 50 frames per second (20 ms exposure time), thus representing a total time of 1280 s = 21 min.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Offline single-molecule detection, trajectory analysis, and image reconstruction</title><p>Analysis of the image stacks generated by uPAINT and dSTORM was made offline under Metamorph, using the PALM-Tracer program based on wavelet segmentation for single-molecule localization and simulated annealing algorithms for tracking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Izeddin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kechkar et al., 2013</xref>). For the analysis of uPAINT experiments, the instantaneous diffusion coefficient, D, was calculated for each trajectory from linear fits of the first 4 points of the mean square displacement (MSD) function versus time, for trajectories containing at least 10 points. For very confined trajectories, the fit of the MSD function can give negative values for diffusion coefficients: in that case, D is arbitrarily set at 10<sup>–5</sup> µm²/s. The uPAINT sequences were also represented as density maps integrating all individual molecule detections. These super-resolved images were constructed using a zoom factor of 5, that is with a pixel size of 32 nm which is five times smaller than that of the original image (0.16 µm) and corresponds to the pointing accuracy of our system. To sort individual trajectories among synaptic and extra-synaptic compartments, post-synapses were identified by wavelet-based image segmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Racine et al., 2006</xref>) of the Homer1c-DsRed signal, and the corresponding binary masks were transferred to the single-molecule images for analysis. Synaptic coverage was determined from super-resolved detection maps as the ratio between segmented areas containing detections over the whole synaptic region determined from the low resolution Homer1c-DsRed image. dSTORM stacks were analyzed using the PALM-Tracer program, allowing the reconstruction of a unique super-resolved image of 32 nm pixel size (zoom 5 compared to the original images) by summing the intensities of all localized single molecules (1 detection per frame is coded by an intensity value of 1). The localization precision of our imaging system in dSTORM conditions is around 60 nm (FWHM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lagardère et al., 2020</xref>). To analyze protein enrichment at post-synapses, the average number of detections within Homer1c puncta was divided by the the average number of extra-synaptic detections, both normalized per unit area.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Organotypic slice culture and single-cell electroporation</title><p>Organotypic hippocampal slice cultures were prepared from postnatal day 2 Sprague-Dawley rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stoppini et al., 1991</xref>). Animals were quickly decapitated and brains placed in ice-cold Gey’s balanced salt solution under sterile conditions. Hippocampi were dissected out and coronal slices (350 µm) were cut using a tissue chopper (McIlwain) and incubated at 35 °C with serum-containing medium on Millicell culture inserts (CM, Millipore). The medium was replaced every 2–3 days. After 2 days in culture, organotypic slices were transferred to an artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing (in mM): 130 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2.2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.5 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 D-glucose, 10 HEPES (pH 7.35, osmolarity adjusted to 300 mOsm). CA1 pyramidal cells were then processed for single cell electroporation using glass micropipets containing 20 ng.µL<sup>–1</sup> plasmids encoding CRISPR/Cas9 + gRNA to MDGA1, MDGA2, or CTRL containing a nuclear BFP reporter + 6 ng.µL<sup>–1</sup> plasmid encoding tdTomato. Micropipets were pulled from 1 mm borosilicate capillaries (Harvard Apparatus) with a vertical puller (Narishige). Electroporation was performed by applying 4 square pulses of negative voltage (–2.5 V, 25 ms duration) at 1 Hz, then the pipet was gently removed. 10–20 neurons were electroporated per slice, and slices were placed back in the incubator for 7 days before electrophysiology. We checked by confocal microscopy performed on sister slices that tdTomato-positive neurons also expressed the nuclear BFP reporter of CRISPR constructs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>Electrophysiological recordings were carried out at RT using an upright microscope (Nikon Eclipse FN1) equipped with a motorized 2D stage and micromanipulators (Scientifica), and amplifiers driven by software (Axon Instruments). Whole-cell patch-clamp was performed using micropipettes pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (Clark Electromedical) using a micropipette puller (Narishige). Pipettes had a resistance in the range of 4–6 MΩ. The recording chamber was continuously perfused with aCSF containing (in mM): 130 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2.2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.5 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 D-glucose, 10 HEPES, and 0.02 bicuculline (pH 7.35, osmolarity adjusted to 300 mOsm), while the internal solution contained (in mM): 135 Cs-MeSO<sub>4</sub>, 8 CsCl, 10 HEPES, 0.3 EGTA, 4 MgATP, 0.3 NaGTP, and 5 QX-314. Salts were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and drugs from Tocris.</p><p>For the measurement of miniature excitatory and inhibitory currents, primary hippocampal neurons electroporated with CRIPSR/Cas9 and either CTRL, MDGA1, or MDGA2 gRNAs (all containing a GFP volume reporter) were cultured on 18 mm coverslips. GFP-positive neurons were voltage-clamped at a membrane potential of −70 mV to record AMPAR-mediated mEPSCs for 5 min, then clamped at +10 mV to record GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated IPSCs for another 5 min, in the presence of 0.5 μM tetrodotoxin to block action potentials. We verified that CNQX (20 μM) and bicuculline (20 µM) abolished the recorded mEPSCs and mIPSCs, respectively.</p><p>For the measurement of evoked AMPAR- and NMDAR-mediated currents in organotypic slices, CA1 pyramidal neurons were imaged with DIC and electroporated neurons were identified from the tdTomato fluorescence. The recording chamber was continuously perfused with ACSF bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub> / 5% CO<sub>2</sub> containing (in mM): 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 25 glucose. 20 µM bicuculline and 100 nM DNQX were added to block inhibitory synaptic transmission and reduce epileptiform activity, respectively. The series resistance Rs was left uncompensated, and recordings with Rs higher than 30 MΩ were discarded. EPSCs were evoked in an electroporated neuron and a nearby non-electroporated neuron (non-electro) every 10 s for 5 min using a bipolar electrode in borosilicate theta glass filled with ACSF and placed in the stratum radiatum. The stimulating electrode was linked to a generator (ISO-STIM 01D, NPI) and voltage pulses of 10–100 V and duration 100–500 µs were imposed. Voltage-clamp recordings were digitized using the Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Axon Instruments) and acquired using the Clampex software (Axon Instruments). AMPAR-mediated currents were recorded at –70 mV and NMDAR-mediated currents were recorded at + 40 mV and measured 50 ms after the stimulus, when AMPAR-mediated EPSCs are back to baseline. EPSCs amplitude measurements were performed using Clampfit (Axon Instruments).</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Patch-Seq analysis of neurons expressing CRISPR-Cas9 against MDGAs</title><p>To investigate the efficiency and potential off-target effects of the CRISPR-Cas9 strategy against MDGA1 and MDGA2, we used the Patch-seq technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cadwell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fuzik et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, CRISPR-Cas9 positive neurons were selected based on the expression of the GFP reporter and cells were patched using the following RNA-preserving internal solution, which contained (in mM): 120 CsMeSO<sub>4</sub>, 10 BAPTA, 3 TEA-Cl, 2 Na<sub>2</sub>-ATP, 2 Mg-ATP, 0.2 Na-GTP, 10 Na<sub>2</sub>-Phosphocreatin (Calbiochem 2380), 320 U/mL Ribolock, 290 mOsm, pH = 7.34. The cytoplasm and the nucleus were harvested using gentle negative pressure and expelled in a lysis solution containing RNase inhibitor (Ribolock, ThermoFisher). Reverse transcription into double stranded cDNA was performed using template switching oligo (LNA-TSO) with sequence <named-content content-type="sequence">5′-AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTACrGrG + G-3</named-content>′, in which rG indicates riboguanosines and + G indicates a locked nucleic acid (LNA)-modified guanosine, Eurogentec. The quality of these cDNA libraries was first tested using capillary-gel electrophoresis system (Labchip GX Touch, Perkin Elmer), then sequencing libraries were synthesized using NEXTFLEX Rapid 2.0 (Perkin Elmer).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that your work will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>. Although all three reviewers agreed on the quality and impact of the datasets, they raised substantial concerns about the limitations in key control experiments and validation of the approaches taken. However, if the authors choose to address all of the review comments and resubmit the manuscript, the manuscript could be re-considered for review.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This study reports the roles of MDGAs in the regulation of surface dynamics and synaptic localization of NLGN1 and GluA1 in cultured neurons. The results suggest that endogenous MDGAs are largely non-synaptic and strongly diffusable and that MDGAs negatively regulate surface dynamics of NLGN1 and GluA1 and excitatory synapse development. The authors use multiple high-end imaging approaches such as single-molecule dynamics (uPAINT) and nano-scale synapse imaging (dSTORM) to support the main conclusions, which are largely convincing. The authors succeeded in demonstrating, by live imaging experiments in cultured neurons, that how MDGAs negatively regulate excitatory synapse organization mediated by NLGN1 and GluA1. Given the increasing importance of molecular and cellular synapse organization, negative regulators of excitatory synapse development, and related brain disorders such as autism, this study is an important step forward in synapse-related neuroscience fields.</p><p>1. The authors mainly use knockdown and knockout approaches to draw the main conclusions, including the negative influences of MDGAs on excitatory synaptic trafficking and retention of NLGN1 and GluA1. However, the manuscript is lacking data from MDGA overexpression, which could substantially increase the strength of the study.</p><p>2. This study uses several rescue MDGA constructs that resistant to the knockdown/knockout. But it could be argued that the rescue effects could still be indirect. Given that the crystal structure of MDGA-NLGN complexes is known, if some of the rescue constructs with mutations disrupting the MDGA-NLGN interaction fail to rescue diffusion/synaptic localization of NLGN1/GluA1, it could be strong support for the main conclusions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript by Toledo, Thoumine and colleagues employed immunostaining and single molecule tracking analyses in cultured hippocampal neurons to address some previously unresolved issues on MDGA molecules that are regarded as negative regulators of synapse development. The authors also employed both knockdown and CRISPR/CAS9-based knockout mice for MDGA1 and MDGA2. They found that MDGAs are highly mobile and homogenously distributed in cultured neurons. They further showed that localization and dynamics of NLGN1 and GluA2 are altered upon loss of MDGA2. Overall, the data appear to be okay, but I am not persuaded that of the conceptual advance given the limitation of major approaches employed.</p><p>1. All the experiments were performed in dissociated cultured hippocampal neurons. I do not see that major questions the authors tried to address in the current study could be convincingly tackled in this rather limited system.</p><p>2. The authors used AP (biotin acceptor peptide)-conjugated MDGAs, instead of MDGA2 antibodies that are not suitable for detecting endogenous proteins. However, this approach is essentially similar to that used by Ting and colleagues (Loh et al., 2016, Cell) that obviously contrasts with conclusion of Connors et al. (2016 Neuron). Without further rigorous validation of recombinant MDGA1 and MDGA2, concern about overexpression artifact cannot be eliminated.</p><p>3. The authors did not provide evidence to eliminate potential off-target effects from CRISPR/CAS9-based deletion of MDGA proteins, apart from showing knockout efficiency. Thus, conclusion that deletion of both MDGA1 and MDGA2 alters excitatory postsynapse maturation cannot be justified. These results obtained from dissociated cultured neurons also contrast with Connors et al. 2017 Cell Reports, showing that MDGA1 specifically acts as a negative regulator at GABAergic hippocampal CA1 synapses in vivo.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This work by Toledo and colleagues characterizes the synaptic localization of MDGA1/2 and their effects on Neuroligin 1 and AMPA receptor surface dynamics during development in dissociated neuronal cultures. MDGA1/2 are analyzed using KO, knockdown with molecular replacement, and CRISPR targeting. The data support that endogenous MDGA1 is partially synaptic but that MDGA1/2 are not enriched at excitatory synapses and become less abundant at excitatory postsynaptic sites as neurons mature. In agreement, they diffuse very fast in dendritic membranes. Detection of Homer density and tracking of Nlgn1 and GluA2 after MDGA2 knockdown support that both MDGAs (tested by CRISPR) restrict in young neurons synapse number and that MDGA2 loss reduces Nlgn1 and AMPA receptor surface mobility in more mature neurons. A role of MDGA2 in restricting Nlgn1 Tyr phosphorylation is shown as well. Functional effects on synapse maturation are measured by electrophysiological recordings in the cultures. In agreement with the Homer data representing an increase in functional synapse number, CRISPR targeting of MDGA1 or MDGA2 increased the frequency of mEPSCs. No effect on mEPSC amplitudes was found.</p><p>Maturation-dependent changes in the localization and dynamics of MDGAs, Nlgn1, and AMPA receptors are well characterized, including by strong super-resolution imaging. The model that MDGAs serve as restrictive factors in synapse development through altering Nlgn1 mobility is interesting to gain new insights into the negative control of synapse assembly.</p><p>Several points need to be addressed to further support the conclusions.</p><p>1. The data support that MDGAs restrict the formation of excitatory synapses. The authors propose that this due to an effect on Neurexin/Neuroligin complex stability, as expected from the literature. Can the authors show that postsynaptic manipulation of MDGAs indeed alters the mobility of Neurexins and the extent of their presynaptic retention in maturing neurons?</p><p>2. Why does targeting MDGA1 or 2 not alter synaptic strength measured as mEPSC amplitudes? Their role in controlling AMPA receptor mobility should predict that.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;MDGAs are fast-diffusing molecules that delay excitatory synapse development by altering neuroligin behavior&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewer are overall satisfied that the manuscript will eventually be publishable in <italic>eLife</italic>, providing that you can address the remaining concerns. We expect that you will be able to address these concerns with existing data or with careful revisions of the text. Depending on your response, we will decide whether to handle the revisions editorially or request re-review.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Rescue experiments for MDGA2 knockdown: there are cases where rescue effects were not clear (e.g. Figure 5F). Statistics should be performed between shMDGA2 and shMDGA2+res to ensure significance in this comparison.</p><p>2. Neuron morphologies: the authors argue that the cultures were relatively of early stages for some images. However, it is difficult to discern clear dendritic spine structures in many fluorescent images obtained from DIV14 cultures (e.g., Figure 5—figure supplement 1). This is still a lingering problem.</p><p>3. Validation of CRISPR knockout approach: the authors nicely provided with convincing in silico evidences, arguing against potential no off-target effects. However, the authors need to provide data (e.g. qPCRs), showing no changes in expression levels of some neuronal genes from cultured neurons or N2a cells expressing sgMDGA1 or sgMDGA2.</p><p>4. Interpretation of Figure 6—figure supplement 1: the reasonable conclusion seems to be that MDGA2 is NOT required for Nlgn1/Nrxn1beta contact. Please discuss.</p><p>5. Discussion: The authors' argument is not convincing about adhesion-dependent competition between neurons with citing Kwon et al. 2012. Indeed, Sudhof and colleagues later demonstrated in cultured neurons that sparsely knocking out Nlgn1 did not produce any phenotypes in synapse numbers (Chandra et al., 2017 J Neurosci). The authors need to consider revising the Discussion section to reconcile the discrepancy with previous observations.</p><p>6. The authors could discuss in the manuscript the new data in Figure 6 – —figure supplement 1. While they do not show an effect of MDGA knockdown on Nrx1beta, future studies can test whether the Nrx overexpression approach obscures effects of MDGA knockdown, or whether MDGA knockdown preferentially affects Nrx1alpha. The added discussion points provide interesting ideas into developmental mechanisms controlling MDGA functions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.75233.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

Indeed, <italic>Pettem et al. (J. Cell Biol, 2013)</italic> found that over-expressing HA-MDGA1 caused a 40% decrease in VGAT and gephyrin puncta in DIV 14 hippocampal neurons, without affecting PSD-95/VGLUT1 puncta. In agreement with those results, <italic>Kim et al.</italic> (PNAS, 2013) found by electrophysiology that MDGA1 overexpression decreased by 40% the density of VGAT puncta (but not VGLUT1 puncta) and mIPSC (but not mEPSC) frequency in cultured cortical neurons. In contrast, <italic>Loh et al. (Cell, 2016)</italic> reported that over-expressing Venus-MDGA1 did not induce any change in either excitatory or inhibitory synapse density, while over-expressing Venus-MDGA2 surprisingly increased by 50% inhibitory synapse density and did not affect excitatory synapse density. The cause of the discrepancy between those studies is unclear, and might come from the fact that the N-terminal Venus tag (25 kD) used by <italic>Loh et al.</italic> is quite large compared to MDGA itself (130 kD) and might interfere with NLGN binding, thereby affecting the localization and/or function of the recombinant MDGAs expressed in neurons.</p><p>Nevertheless, in initial exploratory experiments we transfected DIV 7 hippocampal cultures with V5-MDGA1 or V5-MDGA2 using calcium phosphate, to explore the effect of MDGA overexpression on AP-NLGN1 localization and mobility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). We hypothesized that overexpressing MDGAs would compete with NLGN1 binding to NRXN and thus lead to a lower NLGN1 synaptic enrichment and a corresponding increase in NLGN1 diffusion at the membrane. However, opposite to our predictions, MDGA1 or MDGA2 overexpression both led to a reduction in NLGN1 diffusion, with no apparent increase of NLGN1 confinement in synapses. One explanation for these counter-intuitive effects might be that NLGN1 and MDGAs form extrasynaptic aggregates in the membrane due to the strong overexpression of MDGAs achieved by calcium phosphate transfection, which could result in a decrease of NLG1 mobility. Whichever the mechanism, the difficulty to interpret those results led us for the rest of the study to stay away from over-expression approaches, focusing instead on the dynamics of MDGAs using replacement strategies, and designing new CRISPR/Cas9 constructs to achieve full single cell KO of MDGAs compared to partial KD induced by previously characterized shRNAs.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>AP-NLGN1 mobility upon MDGA1 and MDGA2 overexpression.</title><p>Neurons were transfected using calcium phosphate with AP-NLGN1, Homer1c-GFP, BirAER, and V5-MDGA1 or V5-MDGA2 at DIV 7 and imaged at DIV 14.

Indeed, two recent papers that described the crystal structure of the MDGA1-NLGN2 complex <italic>(Kim et al., Neuron 2017; Gangwar et al., Neuron 2017)</italic> have reported a series of critical mutations in MDGA1 that abolish binding to NLGN2, including R105A/D/E, Y107A, and R123D in the Ig1 domain, and F154A, R156A, Y187A, and K200E in the Ig2 domain. Based on these data, and focusing on MDGA2 which shows the most robust effects in our assays, we designed an MDGA2 construct carrying mutations R107E and Y109E in Ig1, and F156E and Y189A in Ig2, knowing that there is a 2 amino-acid difference between MDGA1 and MDGA2 sequences. Considering the remote positions of the mutations, we adopted a molecular strategy based on outsourced gene synthesis, but unfortunately, we experienced a significant delay in the reception of this mutant gene (&gt; 2 months). Given the amount of work required for the characterization of this new MDGA2 mutant (in particular regarding its binding capacity to NLGN1) before running the actual experiments on NLGN1 and AMPAR diffusion, and considering that the post-doctoral fellow who is first author on the paper was reaching the end of her contract in the lab, we decided to stop the generation of this construct. Therefore, we are sorry will not be able to provide these data for the revisions of this paper.</p><p>Instead, we had initiated uPAINT and STORM experiments with a NLGN1 mutant which was reported not to bind MDGA1 in SPR experiments <italic>(Elegheert et al., Neuron 2017)</italic>. This mutant called NLGN1-ΔsiteII carries 5 mutations in the extracellular domain (D429A, F430A, S433A, N434A and R450A). Given the common sequence similarity between MDGA1 and MDGA2 and similar binding mechanisms to NLGN1 and NLGN2, we reasoned that these mutations in NLGN1 would impair binding to both MDGA1 and MDGA2. We were expecting this NLGN1-ΔsiteII mutant to show lower mobility and stronger synaptic enrichment than NLGN1 WT. However, even though the data show a trend towards higher NLGN1 synaptic enrichment in neurons expressing NLGN1ΔsiteII compared to NLGN1-WT (in replacement conditions), these differences turned out not be significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>). One possible explanation can be that mutant NLGN1-ΔsiteII forms heterodimers with either a fraction of wild type NLGN1 which is not totally silenced by the shRNA, or with endogenous NLGN3 <italic>(Shipman et al., Neuron 2012; Bemben et al., Trends in Neurosci 2015)</italic> that could still interact with MDGAs, thereby attenuating the effect of the mutation.

The authors also employed both knockdown and CRISPR/CAS9-based knockout mice for MDGA1 and MDGA2. They found that MDGAs are highly mobile and homogenously distributed in cultured neurons. They further showed that localization and dynamics of NLGN1 and GluA2 are altered upon loss of MDGA2. Overall, the data appear to be okay, but I am not persuaded that of the conceptual advance given the limitation of major approaches employed.</p></disp-quote><p>We are sorry to hear that, in contrast to reviewers 1 and 3, this second reviewer did not appreciate more our experimental approaches. Nevertheless, we believe that the data we provide on MDGA diffusion and nanoscale localization using high-end single molecule detection of MDGAs expressed at near-endogenous levels are highly original with respect to the existing literature. Finally, the design and characterization of new CRISPR/Cas9 constructs offered us the possibility to achieve single-cell KO of MDGAs over a specific developmental window, and thereby reveal the role played by both MDGA1 and MDGA2 in excitatory synapse differentiation, by regulating NLGN1 signaling and AMPAR dynamics. We discuss below the specific points raised by the reviewer, in particular the discrepancy between our results and previous in vivo studies, which we partly addressed by performing new electrophysiology experiments in organotypic hippocampal slices.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. All the experiments were performed in dissociated cultured hippocampal neurons. I do not see that major questions the authors tried to address in the current study could be convincingly tackled in this rather limited system.</p></disp-quote><p>First, the original questions we raised regarding the nanoscale localization and surface mobility of MDGAs, NLGN1, and AMPARs can only be addressed in dissociated neurons due to technical limitations, in particular the use of oblique illumination that allows us to detect single molecules at the cell membrane (uPAINT and dSTORM paradigms). At present, these types of measurements in more complex 3D tissues are technically extremely challenging. On the other hand, in vivo studies where proteins are knocked-out throughout mouse development are prone to compensatory effects and lack the temporal resolution accessible in culture systems where subtle roles of those molecules can be identified. For example, primary neuronal cultures allowed us to reveal that MDGAs operate in a narrow developmental window, between DIV 10 and 14, where they delay excitatory synaptic differentiation. Another aspect of full KO studies is that MDGAs are silenced in all cell types, including neurons and astrocytes. However, recent reports indicate that NLGNs are expressed not only in neurons but also in astrocytes where they play an important role in astrocyte morphogenesis and synapse development <italic>(Stogsdill et al., Nature 2017)</italic>. Interestingly, we found by qRT-PCR that both MDGA1 and MDGA2 are expressed in astrocytic cultures at the mRNA level (Figure 1 —figure supplement 1A,B). Thus, the KO of MDGAs in astrocytes, by affecting selective NRXN-NLGN interactions at tripartite synapses, might differentially regulate excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in vivo. This might be one reason why MDGA1 KO in vivo affects essentially inhibitory synaptic transmission <italic>(Connor et al., Cell Rep 2017)</italic>. In our Banker cultures, MDGAs were selectively silenced in neurons since astrocytes do not survive or proliferate on the coverslips where neurons are plated after electroporation.</p><p>Finally, global vs sparse KD of proteins have shown different effects in diverse systems. Notably, full KO of NLGN1 in hippocampus was shown not to alter synaptic density <italic>(Varoqueaux et al., Neuron 2006),</italic> while KD of NLGN1 in individual primary neurons causes a strong reduction in synapse density <italic>(Chih et al., Science 2005)</italic>. Sparse silencing of NLGN1 in the hippocampus further revealed that NLGN1-dependent competition between neurons regulates synaptogenesis <italic>(Kwon et al., Nat Neurosci. 2012)</italic>. In a similar way, we can speculate that when MDGA1 is lost in all cells of the hippocampus <italic>(Connor et al., Cell Reports 2017)</italic>, the effects observed mostly on inhibitory synaptic transmission would be different from those observed when MDGA1 levels are reduced only in isolated cells (while remaining constant in surrounding neighbors), revealing instead a role in excitatory synapse development <italic>(this study)</italic>. Strikingly, the phenotypes we saw with single cell MDGA1/2 KO (e.g. increases in post-synapse numbers and AMPAR-mediated mEPSC frequency) resembles the ones we previously observed by over-expressing NLGN1, thereby reinforcing the concept that neurons compete for synapse formation through NRXN-NLGN adhesion.</p><p>Between these two extreme systems (in vivo and in vitro), organotypic slice cultures are an ex vivo preparation which offer the possibility to manipulate protein expression level in a relatively restricted time frame, while preserving synaptic connectivity. To address the reviewer’s concern, we thus decided to down-regulate MDGAs in organotypic hippocampal slices. We used single cell electroporation to deliver CRISPR/Cas9 constructs against MDGA1 or MDGA2 into CA1 pyramidal neurons, and studied the effects on excitatory synaptic transmission using dual-patch clamp electrophysiological recordings. Specifically, we measured the amplitude of both AMPA and NMDA-receptor mediated EPSCs in CA1 neurons, upon stimulation of Schaffer’s collaterals, normalized to values measured simultaneously in neighboring non-electroporated neurons. Strikingly, both gRNAs to MDGA1 and MDGA2 increased AMPAR-mediated EPSCs without affecting NMDA receptor-mediated EPSCs, as compared to non-electroporated controls (Figure 9B-D and Figure 9 —figure supplement 1A,B). As a result, the ratio between AMPAR and NMDAR-mediated EPSCs was significantly elevated in both MDGA1 and MDGA2 KO neurons (Figure 9E), supporting a synaptic unsilencing mechanism (Figure 10, lower panel). No significant effect of gRNA CTRL on either AMPAR- or NMDAR-mediated EPSCs, or on the AMPA/NMDA ratio was observed when compared to non-electroporated neurons (Figure 9B-E), validating the normalization procedure and the absence of off-target effects of the control gRNA. No effect of CRISPR to MDGA1 or MDGA2 on the paired pulse ratio was observed (Figure 9 —figure supplement 1C,D), ruling out pre-synaptic mechanisms. Together, those results strengthen the concept that both MDGA1 and MDGA2 down-regulate AMPAR recruitment during excitatory synapse development. These new data are presented in the Results section pp. 11-12 and discussed p. 15.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors used AP (biotin acceptor peptide)-conjugated MDGAs, instead of MDGA2 antibodies that are not suitable for detecting endogenous proteins. However, this approach is essentially similar to that used by Ting and colleagues (Loh et al., 2016, Cell) that obviously contrasts with conclusion of Connors et al. (2016 Neuron). Without further rigorous validation of recombinant MDGA1 and MDGA2, concern about overexpression artifact cannot be eliminated.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment and share some of the reviewer’s concerns. <italic>Loh et al. (Cell, 2016)</italic> used constructs where a large HRP protein (44 kDa) was fused to the N-terminus of MDGA1 and MDGA2, allowing their subsequent biotinylation and detection with tetrameric fluorescent streptavidin. Alternatively, they used a Venus N-terminal tag, which is also quite prominent (25 kDa). These large tags compared to MDGA itself (130 kDa) can potentially hinder the binding of MDGAs to NLGN1 since the MDGA N-terminus lies very close to the binding interface <italic>(Kim et al., Neuron 2017; Gwangar et al., Neuron 2017; Elegheert et al., Neuron 2017)</italic>. This concern, in addition to the fact that the authors over-expressed HRP- or Venus-tagged MDGA proteins might be responsible for mislocalization artifacts. In contrast, we were careful in our study to use much smaller N-terminal tags (V5 and AP, 15 aa each), and introduced a flexible linker so as to preserve MDGA binding to NLGN1, even in the presence of labeling probes such as V5 Fab or monomeric streptavidin (mSA). We checked by streptavidin pull-down and surface cross-linking experiments with anti-biotin antibodies that biotinylated AP-tagged MDGAs were indeed able to bind NLGN1 (Figure Supplement 6).</p><p>Regarding MDGA1 expression levels, we now clearly show by MDGA1 immunostaining that shMDGA1 reduces the expression levels of endogenous MDGA1 by 75% in dissociated hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>). When rescuing the expression of native MDGA1 with shRNAresistant AP-MDGA1 in the same conditions as the ones shown in Figures 2 and 3 of the manuscript, there is only a mild overexpression (~1.5 fold) of AP-MDGA1 with respect to endogenous MDGA1, while over-expression leads to a 3-fold higher level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4</xref>). Although we lack a good antibody against MDGA2 to show that rescue AP-MDGA2 is expressed at similar levels as native MDGA2, our electrophysiological recordings clearly demonstrate that the expression of rescue AP-MDGA2 in combination with CRISPR/Cas9 + gRNA to MDGA2 blocks the increase in AMPAR-mediated mEPSC frequency observed upon MDGA2 single-cell KO (Figure 8F,H). This indicates that the expression level and functionality of recombinant APMDGA2 are likely to match those of endogenous MDGA2.

Nat Methods 2018; Haeussler, Cell Biol Toxicol. 2020; Kim et al., Nat Methods 2015).</italic> A search of the genome for sequence homology with the gRNA used to knock-out a certain gene with CRISPR/Cas9, might give several results if mismatches in this sequence are considered. However, even if some mismatches in the target sequence can be tolerated for the binding of the gRNA, mutations closer to the PAM sequence (protospacer adjacent motif sequence) are much less tolerated and a maximum of three mismatches can be tolerated for cleavage <italic>(Cong et al., Science 2013)</italic>. Interestingly, whole genome sequencing of CRISPR/Cas9 edited genomes have shown that indels are rarely detected above deep-sequencing error rates (<italic>Kim et al., Nat Methods 2015)</italic>. However, a more recent study of high-throughput screening showed that similar sequences to the gRNA are recognized but not cleaved in the genome, and the tolerance for sequence mismatches here rises up to 5 base pairs (<italic>Tsai et al., Nat Biotechnol 2015</italic>). In this sense, during the design of our CRISPR tools with the Chochop software, we took particular care to select potential gRNAs that do not share homology with any other sequence in the genome, even considering 0, 1, 2 or 3 mismatches (MM, MM2, MM3 in TABLES 1 and 2), and with high efficiency scores (based on the “G20” system) (Moreno-Mateos et al.

targeted by the Cas9 activity, this happens with very low probability thus the affected genes are likely to be different from one cell to the other, and from experiment to experiment. Moreover, neurons do not divide in culture so there is no possibility of clonal expansion of potential off-target mutated genes. Considering all the above-mentioned evidence, we think that even though the occurrence of off-target events cannot be completely ruled out, we are confident that our results come from the specific KO of MDGA1 and MDGA2. Of note is the rescue of the phenotype found in MDGA2 KO when we expressed a gRNA resistant variant of MDGA2 (Figure 8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>These results obtained from dissociated cultured neurons also contrast with Connors et al. 2017 Cell Reports, showing that MDGA1 specifically acts as a negative regulator at GABAergic hippocampal CA1 synapses in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, our results in dissociated cultures using single cell KO of MDGA1 by CRISPR/Cas9 show an enhancement of the density of excitatory post-synapses and the frequency of AMPARmediated mEPSCs (Figure 8). Our latest data obtained using organotypic slices confirm these results by showing that both CRISPR/Cas9 against MDGA1 and MDGA2 selectively enhance AMPAR-dependent synaptic transmission in CA1 neurons (Figure 9 and Figure 9 —figure supplement 1). Finally, we did not observe any change in either gephyrin puncta density or mIPSC frequency in neurons expressing gRNA to MDGA1, compared to neurons expressing control gRNA (Figure 1 —figure supplement 3), thereby not supporting a role of MDGA1 in inhibitory synapse differentiation during this developmental window (DIV 0-10). Taken together, our data are at odds with the study of Connor et al. (Cell Reports 2017), which shows a selective increase of inhibitory synaptic transmission in the hippocampus upon full MDGA1 KO.</p><p>The discrepancies between the two studies might come from the quite different experimental paradigms, i.e. single cell knock-down/out of MDGAs in neuronal cultures for a limited period of time, versus full KO of MDGAs in all cell types throughout the mouse lifetime. In the full KO, MDGA1 is silenced in all cell types, including both pyramidal neurons and astrocytes which also express MDGA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig5">Author response image 5</xref> and Figure 1 —figure supplement 1A) and NLGNs (Stogsdill et al., Nature 2017), which might overall cause mixed effects on hippocampal circuitry and increase inhibitory synaptic transmission. In this context, it would be interesting to generate MDGA1/2 Flox mice to be able to knock-out MDGAs for determined periods of time in single neurons or astrocytes using cre-recombinase, as done for NLGNs (Chanda et al., J. Neurosci 2017; Wu et al., Neuron 2019), and determine cell-specific effects of silencing MDGAs on synaptic differentiation.

MDGA1/2 are analyzed using KO, knockdown with molecular replacement, and CRISPR targeting. The data support that endogenous MDGA1 is partially synaptic but that MDGA1/2 are not enriched at excitatory synapses and become less abundant at excitatory postsynaptic sites as neurons mature. In agreement, they diffuse very fast in dendritic membranes. Detection of Homer density and tracking of Nlgn1 and GluA2 after MDGA2 knockdown support that both MDGAs (tested by CRISPR) restrict in young neurons synapse number and that MDGA2 loss reduces Nlgn1 and AMPA receptor surface mobility in more mature neurons. A role of MDGA2 in restricting Nlgn1 Tyr phosphorylation is shown as well. Functional effects on synapse maturation are measured by electrophysiological recordings in the cultures. In agreement with the Homer data representing an increase in functional synapse number, CRISPR targeting of MDGA1 or MDGA2 increased the frequency of mEPSCs. No effect on mEPSC amplitudes was found.</p><p>Maturation-dependent changes in the localization and dynamics of MDGAs, Nlgn1, and AMPA receptors are well characterized, including by strong super-resolution imaging. The model that MDGAs serve as restrictive factors in synapse development through altering Nlgn1 mobility is interesting to gain new insights into the negative control of synapse assembly.</p><p>Several points need to be addressed to further support the conclusions.</p><p>1. The data support that MDGAs restrict the formation of excitatory synapses. The authors propose that this due to an effect on Neurexin/Neuroligin complex stability, as expected from the literature. Can the authors show that postsynaptic manipulation of MDGAs indeed alters the mobility of Neurexins and the extent of their presynaptic retention in maturing neurons?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this interesting suggestion, which has indeed been part of our concerns. We have tried to detect changes in endogenous NRXN localization in axons facing MDGA KO dendrites but none of the antibodies tested (anti NRXN1β Abcam cat#77596 or anti pan-NRXN1 Millipore cat#ABN161-I) gave specific signals in our hands. Thus, we decided to detect NRXN by electroporating recombinant GFP-NRXN1β. The introduction of a relatively large GFP tag on the N-terminal part of NRXN1β does not alter its axonal function or binding to NLGN1, as previously demonstrated <italic>(Schneider et al., J. Neurosci 2015; Lagardère et al., Sci Rep 2020; Klatt et al., Cell Reports 2021</italic>). We co-plated the GFP-NRXN1β electroporated neurons with neurons electroporated with shCTRL or shMDGA2, both containing an EBFP2 reporter, plus a postsynaptic marker (Xph20-mRuby2). At DIV 10, we searched for GFP-NRXN1β positive axons contacting EBFP2-positive dendrites. Then, we analyzed the GFP-NRXN1β enrichment at axondendrite contact sites or we sparsely labelled it with an anti-GFP nanobody conjugated to the Atto647N fluorophore, to perform uPAINT as previously reported <italic>(Chamma et al., Nat Commun 2016; Lagardère et al., Sci Rep 2020)</italic>.</p><p>Our results do not show any change in NRXN1β enrichment at pre-synapses, nor a change in NRXN1β dynamics at the cell membrane (Figure 6—figure supplement 1). GFP-NRXN1β expressing axons contact several neurons, some of them expressing sh-EBFP2 and others not being electroporated. One explanation for this lack of change in global NRXN1β mobility is that the average number of GFP-NRXN1β presynaptic dots on axons is not increased in the shMDGA2 condition in such sparse electroporating conditions. On the other hand, at the level of individual synapses, we did not see an increase in the enrichment of NRXN1β, which is in accordance with the absence of AP-NLGN1 enrichment change found in shMDGA2 expressing neurons (Figure 6 A-C). Overall our results point to a global effect of MDGA KD/KO resulting in an increase in the total number of synapses in dissociated neurons, without affecting the protein enrichment/localization of either NRXN1β, NLGN1, or AMPARs at individual synapses (Figure 10, upper panel).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Why does targeting MDGA1 or 2 not alter synaptic strength measured as mEPSC amplitudes? Their role in controlling AMPA receptor mobility should predict that.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this point raised by the reviewer, which apparently we failed to explicit well enough in the discussion or model schematics (Figure 10, upper panel). We explain the reduction in global AMPAR mobility observed upon MDGA2 KD in dissociated cultured neurons by an increase in the total number of synapses, not by an increase in the actual AMPAR content per synapse. Indeed, MDGA2 KD caused no change in AMPAR accumulation at each synapse (labeled by GluA1 antibody), and correspondingly no change in AMPAR-mediated mEPSC amplitude. A twofold reduction in global AMPAR diffusion was previously observed as a function of neuronal age in culture (from DIV 8-15), or upon NLGN1 over-expression, both of which resulting in a doubling of the number of synapses <italic>(Czöndör et al. PNAS 2012)</italic>. In these experimental situations, the AMPAR mEPSC frequency strongly increased, but the mEPSC amplitude stayed constant <italic>(Chanda et al. J. Neurosci 2017; Letellier et al. Nat Commun 2018</italic>). Thus, these three experimental paradigms (neuronal maturation, NLGN1 OE, and MDGA2 KD) all increase the number of synapses, but not the actual content of AMPARs per synapse. It seems therefore that AMPARs come to individual synapses as quantal packets, potentially in the form of nanodomains, associated to the post-synaptic scaffold, as previously reported <italic>(McGillavry et al. Neuron 2013; Nair et al., J. Neurosci 2013)</italic>.</p><p>In relation to this point (also motivated by the response to reviewer 2), we now provide additional electrophysiology data obtained in organotypic slices, where we knocked out MDGA1 or MDGA2 in single CA1 neurons, and recorded both AMPAR- and NMDAR-mediated EPSCs upon stimulation of Schaffer’s collaterals, normalized to values measured simultaneously in neighboring non-electroporated neurons. Strikingly, both gRNAs to MDGA1 and MDGA2 increased AMPARmediated EPSCs without affecting NMDAR-mediated EPSCs, as compared to non-electroporated controls (Figure 9B-D and Figure 9—figure supplement 1A,B). As a result, the ratio between AMPAR- and NMDAR-mediated EPSCs was significantly elevated in both MDGA1 and MDGA2 KO neurons (Figure 9E), supporting a synaptic unsilencing mechanism (Figure 10, lower panel). No effect of CRISPR to MDGA1 or MDGA2 on the paired pulse ratio was observed (Figure 9 —figure supplement 1C,D), ruling out pre-synaptic mechanisms. Together, those results strengthen the concept that both MDGA1 and MDGA2 down-regulate AMPAR recruitment during excitatory synapse development, although the mechanisms might be slightly different between dissociated and organotypic cultures. These points are discussed p. 15.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Rescue experiments for MDGA2 knockdown: there are cases where rescue effects were not clear (e.g. Figure 5F). Statistics should be performed between shMDGA2 and shMDGA2+res to ensure significance in this comparison.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 5F, the average median diffusion coefficient is 0.021 µm²/s for shCTRL, 0.0098 µm²/s for shMDGA2, and 0.0148 µm²/s for shMDGA2 + rescue MDGA2 which lies between the two other conditions. One can see from the average distribution in Figure 5E that the shMDGA2 reduces the peak of mobile NLGN1 molecules compared to the two other conditions. But statistically, there is only a significant difference between shCTRL and shMDGA2 conditions (P &lt; 0.05) and not between shMDGA2 and rescue MDGA2, or between shCTRL and rescue MDGA2. This is likely due to the smaller data sample (n = 9 neurons) in the shMDGA2 + rescue MDGA2 condition, associated to the variable degree of expression level of the rescue MDGA2 construct. Indeed, the standard deviation is 0.006 µm²/s for the shMDGA2 data while it is 0.011 µm²/s for sh + rescue MDGA2, i.e. almost double. The difference in sample size comes from the difficulty to find neurons expressing the three plasmids simultaneously (shRNA + post-synaptic marker + rescue construct).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Neuron morphologies: the authors argue that the cultures were relatively of early stages for some images. However, it is difficult to discern clear dendritic spine structures in many fluorescent images obtained from DIV14 cultures (e.g., Figure 5—figure supplement 1). This is still a lingering problem.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the dendritic segment chosen to illustrate the shMDGA1 condition at DIV14 did not exhibit very clear dendritic spines. We chose another image of this condition, with nice spines bulging out of the dendrite shaft, all containing Homer1c-dsRed positive puncta (new Figure 5 —figure supplement 1). The other panels look good to us.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Validation of CRISPR knockout approach: the authors nicely provided with convincing in silico evidences, arguing against potential no off-target effects. However, the authors need to provide data (e.g. qPCRs), showing no changes in expression levels of some neuronal genes from cultured neurons or N2a cells expressing sgMDGA1 or sgMDGA2.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this interesting remark, which stimulated us to perform a thorough patchseq analysis of neurons electroporated with CRISPR MDGA1/2 constructs. It took us a while to perform these experiments and analysis, thereby explaining the reason why we come back quite late with this revised manuscript. Because there are a variety of off-target genes potentially recognized by MDGA1 or MDGA2 gRNAs and consequently excised by the Cas9 enzyme, we turned to global RNA sequencing instead of classical qRT-PCR. Moreover, because of the large size of the plasmids used (Cas9 + gRNA + GFP reporter), the fraction of electroporated neurons can be quite modest in dissociated cultures. Therefore, to make sure of the CRISPR effects in those cells, we decided to isolate a limited number of GFP-positive neurons by patch-clamp, extract their RNA, and perform RNA-sequencing, as previously described (<italic>Fusik et al., Nat Biotech 2015; Cadwell et al., Nat Biotech 2015</italic>). The results are shown in new Figure 8 – figure supplement 2.</p><p>First, we checked that all patched neurons contained detectable mRNA levels of the GFP reporter, validating the single-cell mRNA extraction procedure (Figure 8 – figure supplement 2A). Second, MDGA1 and MDGA2 mRNA levels were selectively reduced by CRISPR MDGA1 and CRISPR MDGA2, respectively, compared to the CRISPR CTRL condition where those two transcripts are well detected (Figure 8 – figure supplement 2B,C). These results confirm for MDGA1 the loss in protein level seen previously (Figure 8 —figure supplement 1B,C), and establishes the efficacy of MDGA2 KO by CRISPR at the mRNA level. Third, to address potential off-target effects, we performed a principal component analysis (PCA) of the top 200 variable genes expressed in all neurons, which shows that genes are not particularly affected by CRISPR MDGA1 or MDGA2 compared to CRISPR CTRL (Figure 8 – figure supplement 2D). Third, we plotted the mRNA levels of the genes detected in neurons expressing CRISPR MDGA1 or CRISPR MDGA2, versus the same genes measured in neurons expressing CRISPR CTRL (Figure 8 —figure supplement 2E). The data are tightly correlated (r &gt; 0.7) , giving no evidence for off-target genes that would be selectively affected by MDGA1 or MDGA2 KO. Finally, we analyzed a subset of genes theoretically predicted to be potential off-target genes of CRISPR MDGA1 and CRISPR MDGA2 (i.e. with &gt; nucleotide 4 mismatches) (Tables 1 and 2), and found no significant difference in mRNA levels when compared to neurons expressing CRISPR CTRL (Figure 8 —figure supplement 2F,G). All this evidence strengthens the selectivity of our CRISPR MDGA1 and MDGA2 strategy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Interpretation of Figure 6—figure supplement 1: the reasonable conclusion seems to be that MDGA2 is NOT required for Nlgn1/Nrxn1beta contact. Please discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a sentence in the Results section p. 9 under the paragraph entitled “MDGA knock-down enhances NLGN tyrosine phosphorylation”. The end of the paragraph now reads : “Even though these results might suggest that MDGA KD does not directly affect the trans-synaptic NRXN1β-NLGN interaction, we have to moderate this explanation by considering that GFP-NRXN1β expressing axons make simultaneous contacts with dendrites from many neurons, such that the effect of shMDGA2 in sparsely electroporated cells is diluted”. Other possibilities are given in the discussion p. 15, as mentioned in our response to point 6 below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Discussion: The authors' argument is not convincing about adhesion-dependent competition between neurons with citing Kwon et al. 2012. Indeed, Sudhof and colleagues later demonstrated in cultured neurons that sparsely knocking out Nlgn1 did not produce any phenotypes in synapse numbers (Chandra et al., 2017 J Neurosci). The authors need to consider revising the Discussion section to reconcile the discrepancy with previous observations.</p></disp-quote><p>We modified the sentence in the discussion p. 14 to address this controversial point. It now reads : “A difference in the results obtained by global gene knock-out in mice and sparse single-neuron silencing was also seen for NLGN1 (<italic>Chih et al., 2005; Varoqueaux et al., 2006</italic>), suggesting that adhesiondependent competition between neurons regulates synaptogenesis (<italic>Kwon et al., 2012</italic>), although sparsely knocking out NLGN1 did not reduce synapse number in another study (<italic>Chanda et al., 2017</italic>)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The authors could discuss in the manuscript the new data in Figure 6 – figure supplement 1. While they do not show an effect of MDGA knockdown on Nrx1beta, future studies can test whether the Nrx overexpression approach obscures effects of MDGA knockdown, or whether MDGA knockdown preferentially affects Nrx1alpha. The added discussion points provide interesting ideas into developmental mechanisms controlling MDGA functions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this interpretation and added a sentence in the discussion about these points (p. 15). It now reads : “In this context, we were surprised not to observe any impact of MDGA KD on the global diffusion or pre-synaptic accumulation of GFP-NRXN1β in axons contacting neurons expressing shMDGA2, but these effects might have been obscured by the limited number of contacts between these cells or by NRXN1β over-expression. Future single molecule tracking experiments on NRXN1-α or -β expressed at endogenous levels may allow one to clarify this issue (<italic>Klatt et al., 2021; Neupert et al., 2015</italic>).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
