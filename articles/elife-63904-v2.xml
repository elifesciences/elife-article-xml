cells give rise to neurons, then to astrocytes following the gliogenic switch. Timely regulation of the switch, operated by several transcription factors, is fundamental for allowing coordinated interactions between neurons and glia. We deleted the gene for one such factor, SOX9, early during mouse brain development and observed a significantly compromised dentate gyrus (DG). We dissected the origin of the defect, targeting embryonic <italic>Sox9</italic> deletion to either the DG neuronal progenitor domain or the adjacent cortical hem (CH). We identified in the latter previously uncharacterized ALDH1L1+ astrocytic progenitors, which form a fimbrial-specific glial scaffold necessary for neuronal progenitor migration toward the developing DG. Our results highlight an early crucial role of SOX9 for DG development through regulation of astroglial potential acquisition in the CH. Moreover, we illustrate how formation of a local network, amidst astrocytic and neuronal progenitors originating from adjacent domains, underlays brain morphogenesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dentate gyrus</kwd><kwd>sox9</kwd><kwd>embryo</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U117512772</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lovell-Badge</surname><given-names>Robin</given-names></name><name><surname>Lovell-Badge</surname><given-names>Robin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U117562207</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lovell-Badge</surname><given-names>Robin</given-names></name><name><surname>Lovell-Badge</surname><given-names>Robin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U117570590</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lovell-Badge</surname><given-names>Robin</given-names></name><name><surname>Lovell-Badge</surname><given-names>Robin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FC001107</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lovell-Badge</surname><given-names>Robin</given-names></name><name><surname>Lovell-Badge</surname><given-names>Robin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FC001107</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lovell-Badge</surname><given-names>Robin</given-names></name><name><surname>Lovell-Badge</surname><given-names>Robin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An astrocytic scaffold that depends on SOX9 guides embryonic neuronal progenitors toward the developing dentate gyrus.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neuroepithelial cells (NECs) are the origin of all neurons, glia and stem cells found in the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Paridaen and Huttner, 2014</xref>). During early CNS development, NEC potential is initially restricted to a neuronal fate. But, at around E10.5 in the mouse, NECs undergo an irreversible switch, becoming radial glial cells (RGCs), which enable them to later generate astrocyte and oligodendrocyte progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Malatesta et al., 2008</xref>). Spatio-temporal control of the gliogenic switch is crucial because it regulates emergence and abundance of each cell type, enabling local establishment of fundamental neuron-glia interactions which are necessary for achieving correct CNS cytoarchitecture and functionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Orduz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nichols et al., 2018</xref>). Amongst other roles, these interactions are essential to support the migration of differentiating neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cooper, 2013</xref>). RGCs are known to guide migration of their neuronal progeny, while in the adult brain, astrocytes guide neuronal progenitors from the subventricular zone to the olfactory bulb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lois et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gengatharan et al., 2016</xref>). However, because astrocytic commitment has been difficult to monitor in the embryo, since specific markers to distinguish these from RGCs were lacking until recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Molofsky et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Weng et al., 2019</xref>) (notably ALDH1L1, previously known as FDH, 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Krupenko, 2009</xref>]), a role for astrocytes to support migration in the embryo had not been established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nguyen et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus, is a packed V-shaped layer of granule neurons involved in spatial memory formation and pattern separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hainmueller and Bartos, 2020</xref>), which hosts a niche of radial glia-like cells supporting adult neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ghosh, 2019</xref>). During embryonic development, DG granule neuron progenitors originate from the dentate neuroepithelium (DNE) or primary (1ry) matrix of the archicortex, corresponding to the ventricular zone above the cortical hem (CH;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">UrbÃ¡n and Guillemot, 2014</xref>). From E14.5 in the mouse, pioneer intermediate progenitors (IPs), followed by neural stem cells (NSCs), at least some of which will likely form RG-like cells in the adult DG, delaminate to migrate extensively within the parenchyma, along the Dentate Migratory Stream (DMS) or 2ry matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nelson et al., 2020</xref>). From E16.5, this mixed cell population, which also comprises post-mitotic neurons at this stage, ultimately reaches the brain midline forming the 3ry matrix, where they distribute in the upper then lower blades of the DG, and differentiate into PROX1+ granule neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">UrbÃ¡n and Guillemot, 2014</xref>). This process continues until after birth, when 1ry and 2ry matrices eventually disappear, and formation of new granule neurons will exclusively rely on local adult neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nicola et al., 2015</xref>). The CH, which is adjacent to the DNE and subsequently develops into the underlying fimbria, is a fundamental hippocampal organizer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yoshida et al., 2006</xref>). It gives rise to Cajal-Retzius (CR) cells, which regulate DG progenitor migration via secretion of Reelin and SDF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sibbe et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). Progenitor migration, along the DMS, follows the track of a GFAP+ glial scaffold, which stretches from both the DNE and fimbrial epithelium toward and around the forming DG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rickmann et al., 1987</xref>). Although definitive proof is lacking, the shape and directionality of GFAP+ filaments within the scaffold suggest a supportive role for progenitor migration, both along the 2ry matrix and within the 3ry matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sibbe et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barry et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Piper et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhou et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Galichet et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Frotscher et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heng et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, GFAP expression suggests that the glial scaffold is formed of differentiating astrocytes, because GFAP is not expressed in RGCs in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Malatesta et al., 2008</xref>). Deletion of the genes encoding the transcription factors NF1A/B, which regulate astrocyte gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kang et al., 2012</xref>), partly affects formation of the scaffold, also suggesting an astrocytic contribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barry et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Piper et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brunne et al., 2010</xref>). However, direct evidence of astrocytes supporting neuronal progenitor migration during embryonic development has never been reported before. It is formally possible that these astrocytic cells, or at least some of them, could be RGCs, which are known to guide migration. However, we have no evidence for this given the absence of reliable distinguishing markers. The mechanisms explaining the formation of the scaffold also remain ambiguous: it has been suggested to have a dual origin with a proximal fimbrial part deriving from the fimbrial glioepithelium, and a distal supragranular domain originating from DNE progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barry et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heng et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, direct evidence of its role and its regional and cellular origin are lacking.</p><p>SOX9, an SRY-related high mobility group (HMG) box (SOX) transcription factor, starts to be expressed in NECs around E9.5, just before their transition to RGCs and neuro-to-glia switch. We and others showed that SOX9 is required for this process, both within the embryonic brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Scott et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hashimoto et al., 2016</xref>) and spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stolt et al., 2003</xref>), because generation of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes is affected by its deletion. The role of SOX9 during early CNS development has been analyzed, in particular by conditional deletion using <italic>Nestin-Cre</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tronche et al., 1999</xref>). However, this Cre-driver only becomes active from E10.5, after the onset of SOX9 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Scott et al., 2010</xref>). Consequently, the relatively mild effect of <italic>Sox9</italic> loss on astrogenesis in <italic>Sox9<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Nestin-Cre</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stolt et al., 2003</xref>) might also be explained by its early, albeit temporary expression.</p><p>To better understand the role of SOX9 in CNS development, including at early stages, we performed conditional deletion using <italic>Sox1<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic>, which is active from E8.5 almost exclusively in the neural tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Takashima et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wood and Episkopou, 1999</xref>), and compared these with <italic>Sox9<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Nestin-Cre</italic> mutants. In contrast with the latter model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tronche et al., 1999</xref>), all <italic>Sox9<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Sox1<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> mutant mice survived, allowing post-natal analysis. Reduced DG size was the most prominent defect in adult <italic>Sox9<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Sox1<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> mutant brains, but not in the few surviving <italic>Sox9<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Nestin-Cre</italic> animals, and this was already visible in newborns, suggesting an earlier developmental defect. While the emergence and differentiation of granule neuron progenitors were not affected in either <italic>Sox9</italic> mutant embryos, we observed that their migration within the developing DG was compromised, particularly in <italic>Sox9<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Sox1<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> mutants. We then showed that formation of the fimbrial glial scaffold, which is likely supporting neuronal progenitor migration toward the forming DG, was delayed in <italic>Sox9<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Sox1<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> mutants. We furthermore identified ALDH1L1+ astrocytic progenitors in the adjacent CH as the origin of the fimbrial glial scaffold. Accordingly, formation of these progenitors is significantly compromised in <italic>Sox9<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Sox1<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> mutants, but not in their <italic>Sox9<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Nestin-Cre</italic> counterparts, because <italic>Nestin-Cre</italic> is not active in the CH. Consequently, fimbrial glial scaffold and DG formation are less affected in these mutants. Exclusive deletion of <italic>Sox9</italic> in the CH, using <italic>Wnt3a<sup>iresCre</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yoshida et al., 2006</xref>), further confirmed that SOX9 is required for astrocyte progenitor emergence and hence fimbrial glial scaffold formation, allowing neuron progenitor migration. Ultimately, our results highlight the crucial importance of the timely emergence of glial progenitors in the CH for the establishment of a local supporting cellular network underlying neuronal migration during DG morphogenesis, and that, through its role in acquisition of astroglial potential, SOX9 is critical for this.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Adult DG morphology is sensitive to precise patterns of <italic>Sox9</italic> deletion in the archicortex</title><p>To further characterize the role of SOX9 during CNS development, we first performed an early CNS-specific conditional deletion of the gene by crossing <italic>Sox9<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akiyama et al., 2002</xref>) with <italic>Sox1<sup>Cre</sup></italic>, which is active from E8.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Takashima et al., 2007</xref>) prior to the onset of SOX9 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Scott et al., 2010</xref>). The birth, growth, and survival of <italic>Sox9<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Sox1<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> mice were not overtly affected. However, histological analyses of adult <italic>Sox9</italic> mutant brains revealed that the hippocampus was particularly affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1i,ii</xref>). However, the DG emerges as the most affected region, and quantification of its size shows it was significantly reduced in adult <italic>Sox9<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Sox1<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> mice compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ai,ii;B</xref>). Furthermore, deletion of one copy of <italic>Sox9</italic> in <italic>Sox9<sup>fl/+</sup>;Sox1<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> mice does not affect DG size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). DG size reduction was already evident at P2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Aivâv,C</xref>), indicating this phenotype might arise earlier, due to the absence of SOX9 during DG embryonic development. Because the adult DG controls formation of new memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hainmueller and Bartos, 2020</xref>), we assessed memory formation abilities in adult <italic>Sox9<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Sox1<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> mice by performing a Novel Object Recognition Test (NORT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Failure to recognise a new object over a familiar one, detected as spending more time to investigate the new object, was demonstrated in <italic>Sox9<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Sox1<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Because deficiency in memory formation could also be caused by reduced exploration of the arena due to anxiety-like behaviors, we performed in parallel an open-field test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3A</xref>). This did not reveal any significant difference between control and mutant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3B,C</xref>). Taken together, these results show that embryonic deletion of <italic>Sox9</italic> affects memory-forming abilities. This suggests that functionality of DG is affected, albeit we cannot exclude that defects in other regions of the mutant brains explain or exacerbate this behavioral deficiency.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Dentate gyrus (DG) morphogenesis is differentially affected in <italic>Sox1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> versus <italic>Sox9<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Nestin-Cre</italic> mutants.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) H and E staining of 3-month-old (i-iii) and P2 (iv-vi) brain sections of <italic>Sox9<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Sox1<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Sox9<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Nestin-Cre</italic> mutants compared to <italic>Sox9<sup>fl/+</sup></italic> controls.

Therefore, activity of <italic>Nestin-Cre</italic> outside the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bernal and Arranz, 2018</xref>), in tissues where SOX9 is required, such as pancreatic islets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Seymour et al., 2007</xref>), heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akiyama et al., 2004</xref>), and/or kidneys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Reginensi et al., 2011</xref>), likely explains mortality in these mutants.

To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the activity of the <italic>Sox1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> and <italic>Nestin-Cre</italic> by lineage tracing using an <italic>R26R<sup>eYFP</sup></italic> allele and in parallel examined SOX9 expression.

However, in <italic>Sox9<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Sox1<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> mutant archicortices, we detected some rare <italic>Sox9-</italic>positive cells by in situ hybridization (arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1âfigure supplement 5Aviii</xref>, see also Figure 5Gv), demonstrating that recombination of the <italic>Sox9</italic> allele is not quite ubiquitous. In contrast, <italic>Nestin-Cre</italic> is only active ventrally at E11.5, gradually progressing dorsally later in gestation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Fvâx</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1âfigure supplement 5Aiii,vi,ix</xref>), as previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vernay et al., 2005</xref>).

To quantify the size of the ectopic cluster, which can be indicative of the migration defect, we calculated the percentage of TBR2+ cells clustering in the ectopic cluster relative to the total number of TBR2+ cells in the 2ry matrix. The size of the ectopic cluster represents a significant proportion of TBR2+ cells within the 2ry matrix and was similar in both <italic>Sox9<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Sox1<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> (34.1 Â± 2.3%) and <italic>Sox9<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Nestin-Cre</italic> (28.4 Â± 3.1%) mutants at E18.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Ei</xref>).

To further analyze this aspect, lineage tracing of progenitors was performed using in utero electroporation in wild-type and <italic>Sox9<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Sox1<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> mutants. Progenitors facing the ventricle were electroporated at E15.5 with a plasmid-expressing dsRed and the distribution of dsRed+ cells within the three matrices was analyzed 7 days later at P2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,G</xref>). The total number of dsRed+ cells within the developing DG at P2 was significantly lower in <italic>Sox9<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Sox1<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> mutants compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). We did not observe excess cell death in electroporated mutants compared either to the contralateral side, or to controls at this stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). However, electroporated mutant progenitors, whose survival may have been compromised by lack of SOX9, may have been lost earlier. In controls, 33.4 Â± 7.26% of dsRed+ cells were PROX1+. In mutants, an average of 16.4 Â± 15.11% of dsRed+ cells were PROX1+, and this was not significantly different from controls. However, this proportion was variable. This may be explained by variability in the domain targeted by the electroporation since our previous data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>) showed that loss of SOX9 does not have an effect on granule neuron differentiation. We then analyzed the distribution of dsRed+ cells in each matrix (represented by dotted white lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). In P2 controls, the highest proportion of dsRed+ cells was observed in the 3ry matrix (51.27 Â± 14.20%), demonstrating that an important fraction of E15.5 electroporated progenitors had given rise to migrating granule neurons that successfully reached their destination in the developing DG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G,J</xref>, arrowheads in G). In contrast, in <italic>Sox9<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Sox1<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> mutants, the highest proportion of dsRed+ cells was found in the 2ry matrix (39.18 Â± 13.59%) and the fraction of cells remaining in the 1ry matrix was significantly higher than in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G,J</xref>). This suggests that, in <italic>Sox9</italic> mutants, a proportion of electroporated progenitors remained trapped near the DNE (arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Gii</xref>). These results are thus in agreement with impaired neuronal progenitor migration in the developing DG of <italic>Sox9</italic> mutants.

We aimed to further assess its functionality in this context by closely examining the distribution of TBR2 progenitors in relation to the GFAP+ scaffold at E18.5 when the scaffold first appears (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4DâF</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref>â<xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">4</xref>). Close to the DNE, the GFAP+ fimbrial scaffold appears well separated from both the intermediate DNE progenitors and those migrating in the 2ry matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Fa</xref>). Along the migratory stream in the 2ry matrix, progenitors start being more closely associated with the GFAP+ scaffold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Fb</xref>). Finally, from the distal part of the fimbria, progenitors and scaffold appear completely intermingled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Fc</xref>). We observe a similar association in the 3ry matrix between IPs and the GFAP supragranular scaffold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Fd</xref>). The position of IPs relative to the glial scaffold suggest close contacts between these cell populations, supporting a functional role for the glial scaffold in promoting progenitor migration, particularly within the 2ry matrix. Consequently, delayed formation of the glial scaffold in <italic>Sox9</italic> mutants is likely implicated in the defective migration of DG progenitor.</p><media id="video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-63904-video1.mp4"><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Movie of 3D reconstruction of progenitors at the primary matrix level.</title><p>GFAP+ fimbrial scaffold (red) and 1ry matrix TBR2+ progenitors (in green) are initially separated.</p></caption></media><media id="video2" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-63904-video2.mp4"><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>Movie of 3D reconstruction of migrating progenitors at the secondary matrix level.</title><p>TBR2+ migrating progenitors (green) in the 2ry matrix start to intermingle with GFAP+ fibers (red).</p></caption></media><media id="video3" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-63904-video3.mp4"><label>Video 3.</label><caption><title>Movie of 3D reconstruction of migrating progenitors as the secondary matrix elongates.</title><p>Intermingling of TBR+ migrating progenitors (green) and GFAP+ fibers (red) in the distal part of the 2ry matrix.</p></caption></media><media id="video4" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-63904-video4.mp4"><label>Video 4.</label><caption><title>Movie of 3D reconstruction of migrating progenitors at the tertiary matrix level.</title><p>Distribution of TBR2+ progenitors (green) within the GFAP+ supragranular scaffold (red).</p></caption></media><p>Because SOX9 directly regulates the expression of <italic>Gfap</italic> in the developing spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kang et al., 2012</xref>), absence of GFAP expression in <italic>Sox9</italic> mutants may simply reflect downregulation of the gene. Therefore, to confirm the transient defect in glial scaffold formation, we examined the expression of ALDH1L1, an astrocyte-specific marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cahoy et al., 2008</xref>). At E18.5, ALDH1L1 expression pattern overlaps with that of GFAP, particularly within the fimbria where we see many GFAP+; ALDH1L1+ fibers (arrowheads in inset b in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Ai</xref>). In contrast, we observe GFAP+ALDH1L1- fibers around the developing DG (arrowheads in inset a in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Ai</xref>). At E16.5, before upregulation of GFAP, the ALDH1L1 expression pattern is reminiscent of that at E18.5, as mostly confined to the fimbria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Aii</xref>). ALDH1L1+ cells are found as early as E13.5 in the archicortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Aiii</xref>) and also at this stage, they are specifically localized in the LEF1-negative;SOX2<sup>high</sup> CH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sugiyama et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,Ciâii</xref>).

Differential patterns of gene deletion in the archicortex had marked consequences on adult DG morphology, and functionality, and we were consequently able to establish that SOX9 is required for proper DG morphogenesis. More precisely, our results highlight the crucial role of SOX9 for timely induction of the gliogenic switch in the CH, allowing emergence of astrocytic progenitors and subsequent formation of the fimbrial glial scaffold. Moreover, we show that this portion of the scaffold, which is closely associated with granule neuron progenitors, is necessary for their migration toward the forming DG. Furthermore, while partial recovery of the scaffold is observed early post-natally in <italic>Sox9</italic> mutants, DG morphogenesis is permanently affected, strongly suggesting that the glial scaffold is required, albeit transiently. In conclusion, our study unravels the cascade of events orchestrating the establishment of supportive astrocytic-neural interactions required for DG morphogenesis, highlighting its sensitivity to timing and dependence on SOX9.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Dual origin, function and nature of the DG glial scaffold</title><p>Lineage tracing experiments using <italic>Wnt3a<sup>iresCre</sup></italic> demonstrate here that the fimbrial part of the glial scaffold has a CH originÂ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).

At early stages of DG development (E13.5), granule neuron progenitors undergo delamination from the 1ry matrix and form the 2ry matrix (migration direction depicted by arrow 1). This initial step is hypothesized to be independent of the glial scaffold because it is not affected in its absence in <italic>Sox9</italic> mutants. From E18.5, progenitor migration toward the forming DG/3ry matrix relies on the fimbrial scaffold (red lines, arrow 2). This fimbrial scaffold derives from astrocytic progenitors located in the CH (red area). At the same time, the dentate scaffold around the DG (blue lines) provides support for granule neuron positioning within upper and lower blades of the forming DG (arrows 3). Cells giving rise to this second scaffold are DNE derived (blue area).

However, the presence of some labeled fibers suggests a CH contribution. Beside a different cellular composition, the supragranular scaffold has also been suggested to have a distinct function from the fimbrial one, where the former guides granule neuron migration within DG upper and lower blades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heng et al., 2012</xref>)Â (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). In agreement, in <italic>Sox9<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Wnt3a<sup>iresCre/+</sup></italic> mutants, where SOX9 is deleted exclusively in the CHÂ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>), the supragranular scaffold and consequently distribution of granule neurons in the 3ry matrix of the developing DG, appear normal. In contrast, we observe a transient impairment of the supragranular scaffold in both <italic>Sox9<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Sox1<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>)Â and, to a lesser extent, in <italic>Sox9<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Nestin-Cre</italic> mutantsÂ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>), along with an altered upper/lower blade distribution of granule neurons. These results are in accord with a different role for this part of the scaffold as well as its predominant DNE origin since both <italic>Sox1</italic> and <italic>Nestin-Cre</italic> drivers are active in this domain. However, we observe a milder alteration in DG upper/lower blade granule neuron distribution in <italic>Sox9<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Nestin-Cre</italic>. Because <italic>Nestin-Cre</italic> is mostly not active in the CH, this result may be explained by a contribution of CH-derived SOX9+ glial cells to formation of the supragranular scaffold, in further agreement of a mixed DNE/CH origin for this distal scaffold.</p><p>ALDH1L1, GLAST, BLBP, and GFAP co-expression in the fimbrial scaffold and its CH progenitors argue strongly for an astrocytic identity, demonstrating for the first time a migratory support role for this lineage in the mouse embryo. CH lineage tracing using <italic>Wnt3a<sup>iresCre</sup></italic> further supports the astrocytic rather than multipotent radial glia nature of the scaffold because, following an early neurogenic phase, when CR cells are produced, CH progenitors then give rise to the GFAP+ scaffold, but not to granule neurons or OPCs. In the spinal cord, <italic>Aldh1l1</italic>-GFP is first detected at E12.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tien et al., 2012</xref>) and we observe a similar onset of expression of ALDH1L1 in the CH astrocytic progenitors, which we suggest may represent the fimbrial glioepithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barry et al., 2008</xref>). This is in contrast with what is observed elsewhere in the developing forebrain where astrocytes are known to arise around E16.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bayraktar et al., 2014</xref>), and suggests an earlier emergence in this region. Interestingly, CH-derived CR cells are the first neurons generated in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Takiguchi-Hayashi et al., 2004</xref>). Since the gliogenic switch is also controlled by differentiating neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">BarnabÃ©-Heider et al., 2005</xref>), it is tempting to speculate that the initial emergence of CR cells may explain early gliogenic induction in the CH. Finally, in the supragranular scaffold, ALDH1L1 and GFAP are both present but they do not colocalise. This supports a mixed origin for this part of the scaffold, and furthermore suggests a different cellular composition. In fact, exclusive expression of GFAP in some cells suggests that, in this domain, DNE-derived RGCs may support neuronal migration, in addition to some CH-derived astrocytic progenitors.</p><p>Other migration cues are necessary for granule neuron guidance. CH-derived CR cells play an important role through the release of chemokines, such as Reelin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Frotscher et al., 2003</xref>) and SDF1 (CXCL12) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berger et al., 2007</xref>). We did not observe any significant alteration in <italic>Reelin</italic> and <italic>Cxcl12</italic> expression indicating that CR cells are not affected by <italic>Sox9</italic> deletion. Therefore, our work highlights a crucial role for the fimbrial glial scaffold for 1ry-to-3ry matrix progenitor migration from E18.5, whereas the supragranular scaffold facilitate 3ry matrix cell distributionÂ (FigureÂ 8E,F). Detailed investigations are needed to characterize how the fimbrial glial scaffold interact with progenitors and support their migration and/or delamination from the DNE.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Role of SOX9 during DG morphogenesis</title><p>Impairment of DNE progenitor migration in <italic>Sox9<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Wnt3a<sup>iresCre/+</sup></italic> mutants demonstrates that loss of SOX9 in these cells does not explain the migration defect. However, this does not rule out a role for SOX9 in DNE progenitors. Indeed, while we did not observe a significant alteration in progenitor emergence, differentiation, and survival embryonically, there is a significant decrease in IP numbers early post-natally. This reduction coincides with formation of the ectopic cluster, where 35% of TBR2+ progenitors are unable to reach the developing DG in <italic>Sox9<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Sox1<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Ei</xref>). Because their survival and expansion might be affected due to their ectopic location, this might account for the reduction in total progenitor numbers. While we did not detect a significant increase in apoptosis in the ectopic cluster at P2, these cells are absent in the adult brain, suggesting a postnatal loss. Further analyses are required to understand their fate, for example, whether their migration resumes, and whether this follows the scaffold or not. Alternatively, reduction of TBR2+ cells could indicate that SOX9 is required for maintenance and/or expansion of migrating progenitors and NSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nelson et al., 2020</xref>). Loss of <italic>Sox9</italic> in these cells could furthermore lead to postnatal reduction of a pool of newly formed TBR2 cells that was not detected by our analysis. The milder phenotype in <italic>Sox9<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Nestin-Cre</italic> embryos could thus be explained by a cell autonomous requirement for SOX9 in DNE cells. Additionally, early and transient expression of SOX9 in these mutants could underlay the lesser defects.</p><p>In support of a role of SOX9 in the DNE, adult DG functionality is affected by embryonic deletion of SOX9, because we observe compromised memory formation abilities in <italic>Sox9<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Sox1<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> adults. This is the most straightforward explanation; however, we cannot exclude that other brain regions potentially affected by <italic>Sox9</italic> deletion may also impact on this impaired behavior (e.g. altered locomotion, smell or sight). We (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Scott et al., 2010</xref>) and others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hashimoto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">GÃ¼ven et al., 2020</xref> have indeed previously shown that SOX9 regulates progenitor formation and expansion. However, in other contexts, such a role was not observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stolt et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martini et al., 2013</xref>). This variability may depend on the cellular context, but timing of the deletion is also relevant. Compensation by other members of the SOXE family, in particular SOX8, has been shown to explain recovery of some defects due to <italic>Sox9</italic> loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Weider and Wegner, 2017</xref>). In our context, it is likely that both compensatory mechanisms and timing contribute to the difference in the severity of the defects observed after <italic>Sox9</italic> loss in different models. Analysis of SOX9/SOX8 double mutants would clarify this possibility. Finally, SOX9 is also expressed in adult DG NSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shin et al., 2015</xref>), where it might be required for their maintenance, as shown for SVZ NSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Scott et al., 2010</xref>). As discussed above, compromised memory-forming abilities are observed in <italic>Sox9<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Sox1<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> adults, which could well reflect the reduced numbers of neuronal progenitors reaching the DG. However, impaired adult neurogenesis could contribute to this phenotype, and although it is beyond the scope of the current study, this warrants further investigation. Moreover, as discussed above, SOX9 is likely to be required in DNE progenitors for formation of the supragranular scaffold, most likely as an inducer of gliogenic or RGCs fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Scott et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stolt et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>The importance of SOX9 for the acquisition of gliogenic potential is demonstrated by the loss of the fimbrial scaffold in <italic>Sox9<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Wnt3a<sup>iresCre/+</sup></italic> mutants. In the astrocytic lineage, SOX9 expression is maintained at high levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sun et al., 2017</xref>) and it is required for astrocytic specification in the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kang et al., 2012</xref>) and anterior CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Scott et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nagao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">GÃ¼ven et al., 2020</xref>). In the spinal cord it has been shown to induce expression of NFIA, with which it then interacts to activate expression of astrocytic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kang et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, we show here that NF1A/B expression is not affected in the developing forebrain following <italic>Sox9</italic> deletion. Therefore other factors and pathways must be involved for induction of <italic>Nf1a</italic> expression, which could include BRN2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Glasgow et al., 2017</xref>), WNT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hasenpusch-Theil et al., 2012</xref>), and/or NOTCH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Namihira et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, as shown in the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kang et al., 2012</xref>), gliogenesis in CH is simply delayed in <italic>Sox9<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Sox1<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Sox9<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Nestin-Cre</italic> mutants. This could reflect a reduced transcriptional activity of NF1 factors without SOX9, as previously shown for NF1A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kang et al., 2012</xref>). As discussed above, recovery could also be due to compensatory expression of SOX8. Further analyses are required to understand the mechanisms underlying recovery of the fimbrial scaffold.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The ability of the fimbrial glial scaffold to support 1ry-to-3ry matrix progenitor migration is an exciting new finding.

However, we found around 6.5% of granule neurons in the <italic>Wnt3a<sup>iresCre</sup>;R26R<sup>eYFP</sup></italic> lineage, suggesting that either <italic>Wnt3a<sup>iresCre</sup></italic> is ectopically active in the DNE, or that a proportion of neuronal progenitors may originate from the CH. This latter exciting possibility requires further confirmation with additional lineage tracing analyses; it also suggests that this subpopulation may have different characteristics. Whether other cells forming the adult DG, such as adult NSCs, also originate from the CH, is unknown and requires further investigation.</p><p>In conclusion, SOX9 plays sequential roles during CNS development as cells progress from a NSC fate, in which the protein is required for induction and also maintenance, to acquisition of gliogenic potential. Experimental manipulation of its expression levels highlights aspects of its function, according to the cellular context and also timing, which is presumably explained by the pattern of expression of redundant SOXE members, and its different interactors. Here, we reveal that DG development is particularly sensitive to early loss of <italic>Sox9</italic> and that this is at least in part due to the failure to generate an astrocytic scaffold that aids neuronal migration. Extensive cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Treves et al., 2008</xref>) and progenitor pool expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Martin et al., 2002</xref>) might underlay the vulnerability of this region, illustrated by the lasting consequences of transiently impaired cell migration.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

A 40 Ã 40 cm arena made of white Plexiglas was built by the Francis Crick Institute mechanical engineering facility. Pairs of different objects were switch between cohorts of animals to avoid biases due to object conformation. Logitech 910C webcam and software were used to record behavioral tests and videos were used for analyses. Mice were acclimatized to the testing room for 1 hr before starting the test. The operator was alone with the mice during the duration of the test to avoid any disturbance. The behavioral test was performed on 3 consecutive days, and each mouse spends 5 min in the arena per day. On the first day, mice were placed in an empty arena for adaptation. On the second day, mice were exposed to two identical objects, for training. On the third final day, mice were confronted to one familiar object (used the previous day) and a new, different object. Arena and objects were disinfected and rinsed before every run. Objects location within the arena was consistent among animals. The recordings from the first day of NORT (adaptation day) were used to perform open field test. Ethovision XT (Noldus) was used for the analysis of video recordings. For NORT, in each video, a circular area of 4 cm radius around each object was considered as object âexploration areaâ. Time spent in this area was considered as âexploration timeâ. Mice that did not explore both objects on the second day were excluded from further analysis. For the open-field test, the arena center was considered as a central square area 4 cm apart from the arena borders. Time spent in this area was considered as âtime spend it centerâ and was calculated with Ethovision XT.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>EdU injection</title><p>For cell birth-dating experiments, 10 mg/ml EdU solution, from Click-iT EdU imaging kit, was injected intraperitoneally in pregnant females at a dose of 30 Âµg/g body weight.

More precisely, average cycle threshold (Avg Ct) was first calculated among technical triplicates or duplicates of each sample. Average delta Ct (Avg ÎCt) was then deduced by subtracting GAPDH Avg Ct to sample Avg Ct. The relative quantification (RQ) of cDNA for each gene was calculated as 2<sup>-AvgÎCt</sup>. The fold change of each sample was calculated in reference to the average RQ of control samples group (control RQ) as: sample RQ/control RQ. The qPCR final results are shown as histograms, where each bar shows the average fold change of experimental replicates. Error bars are represented as standard error of the mean (SEM).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title><italic>In utero</italic> electroporation</title><p>For <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation (IUE), the <italic>piggyBac</italic> transposon system was used to avoid episomal plasmid loss upon cell division. pCAG-hyPBase and pPB-CAG-DsRed plasmids were kindly donated by Dr. Lucas Baltussen and have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mikuni et al., 2016</xref>). Plasmids was amplified with <italic>E. coli</italic> culture, purified with EndoFree Plasmid Maxi kit and mixed together at a concentration of 1 Âµg/Âµl per plasmid, with 0.05% of FastGreen in injectable water.</p><p>IUE was performed on E15.5 embryos. One before surgery, analgesia (Carprofen, dose 50 mg/ml) was administered via drinking water to single caged pregnant females. On surgery day, pregnant females were anesthetised using isoflurane and subcutaneous injection (10 mg/kg of meloxicam and 0.1 mg/kg of buprenorphine in injectable water). Femalesâ eyes were kept moist using Viscotears eye gel. Anesthetized female was shaved on the abdomen, cleaned with chlorhexidine and moved to surgical area, where body temperature was monitored on a heating pad. Laparotomy and exteriorization of the uterus were then performed. Ten Âµl of DNA was loaded using micro loader tips into Ethylene Oxide (EtO) gas sterilized borosilicate glass capillaries (1.0 OD x 0.58 ID x 100 L mm) which were pulled with a micropipette puller and the tip was broken using forceps. One Âµl of solution containing the plasmid DNA was injected into the lateral ventricle of each embryos using a Femtojet pico dispenser, followed by electroporation (5 pulses 38V of 50 ms with 1 s interval) with EtO gas sterilized 5 mm paddle type electrodes. The uterus was gently reinserted into the abdomen, then abdominal wall and skin were sutured separately. Mice were placed in a recovery chamber for a few hours. Analgesia (Carprofen, dose 50 mg/ml) was administrated in drinking water for the following 48 hr. Electroporated embryos were harvested at P2.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Software for cell migration analysis</title><p>Distance.gui software was used to analyse PROX1+ cells distribution within the forming DG. It was written by Dr. Vivien Labat-gest and kindly donated by Prof. Federico Luzzati. The software calculates the distance in pixels between a point and line, which in this case are single PROX1+ cells and their migration line, respectively (schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2N</xref>). Therefore, the software input files for each image are the ImageJ cell counter result .<italic>xml</italic> file (representing PROX1+ cells point coordinates) and the XY coordinates of the reference line extracted from ImageJ as a .<italic>txt</italic> file (representing the migration line). The output file is a .<italic>txt</italic> file containing a list of numbers representing the distance in pixel of each PROX1+ cell from the migration line. For each picture, the range of PROX1+ cell distribution (most distant cell from the migration line) was used to divide the forming DG area in 10 bins, then percentage of PROX1+ cell per bin was calculated and plotted as a line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2N</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7C</xref>). Cells in bins #1â5 would be closer to the migration line, therefore representing the lower DG blade, compared to cells in bins #6â10, representing the upper DG blade.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistical and image analysis</title><p>H and E and <italic>ISH-</italic>stained sections were acquired with Leica DM750 light microscope, and LAS (Leica Application Suite) EZ software was used for acquisition. Sections processed for EdU, TUNEL, and immunofluorescence staining were imaged using Leica TCS SPE confocal microscope with Ã10, Ã20, and Ã40 objectives. LAS AF software was used for acquisition. Acquisitions were performed as 1.5 Âµm Z-stacks, with bidirectional X. For image analysis and counting, ImageJ and QuPath softwares were used. For cell quantification, five different images were acquired and counted per analysed area for each sample. GFAP immunofluorescence was quantified based on positive pixel area after setting a threshold, using ImageJ. For 3D reconstructions, acquisitions were performed as 1 Âµm Z-stacks with bidirectional X. IMARIS was used image processing.</p><p>Statistical analysis of cell number quantification and qPCR analysis was performed on Prism 7 (Graphpad), calculating studentâs two-sided unpaired <italic>t</italic> tests, when comparing two groups, or ordinary one-way ANOVA, when comparing one variable in three or more groups, or ordinary two-way ANOVA, when comparing two variables in three or more groups. When performing ANOVA, multiple comparison between each experimental group was then performed with Tukeyâs test or Sidakâs test, respectively. Analyses were performed parametrically, upon confirmation of samples normal distribution (performed on Prism). When the majority of sample groups within one analysis are not normally distributed (two out of three), statistical analysis was performed using Kruskal-Wallis test. Full details of statistical analyses can be found in the source data.</p><p>Histograms represent average quantification from the indicated number of biological replicates (n, minimum 3). Error bars for cell number quantification represent standard deviation (SD). Error bars for qPCR fold change analysis represent standard error of the mean (SEM).

Please take note of the points below and we hope you will continue to support <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Dentate gyrus development requires a cortical hem-derived astrocytic scaffold&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Michael Piper (Reviewer #2); Robert F Hevner (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The study by Caramello et al. demonstrates the importance of the fimbrial-specific glial scaffold in the migration of granule neuron progenitors towards dentate gyrus, and that the formation of such scaffold depends on SOX9. Using different Cre drivers, the authors reported solid phenotypes in the <italic>Sox9</italic> mutants, including the ectopic cluster of neuronal progenitors outside DNE and the impaired glial scaffold formation at the fimbria. The role of fimbria glia scaffold in the migration of DG neuronal progenitors was suggested previously but without concrete evidence. It is an important advance to show that the glial scaffold arises from both CH and DNE origins, with preferential localization of each along the fimbrial and distal DG (&quot;supragranular glial scaffold&quot;) regions, respectively. Perhaps, there is something about the CH/DNE boundary that induces glial fiber differentiation. Quantification and statistics are used appropriately throughout and increases confidence. Therefore, the findings here are interesting and will be significant to the field. However, the proposed model lacks direct evidence and further experiments will be required to strengthen the current conclusions.</p><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>1) The primary finding of the manuscript is that SOX9-dependent fimbria glial scaffold guides the migration of granule neuron progenitors towards dentate gyrus. This is mainly supported by the phenotypic difference between <italic>Sox9</italic> knockout driven by <italic>Sox1-Cre</italic> and <italic>Nestin-Cre</italic>, with the former enables <italic>Sox9</italic> deletion at the cortical hem while the latter doesn't (Figure 1G). This makes proving the <italic>Nestin-Cre</italic> mutants have mild or no phenotypes particularly important. In several cases, the images actually suggest <italic>Nestin-Cre Sox9</italic> mutants do have a phenotype, but the statistical analysis indicate no significant difference (e.g. Figure 1A, the size of DG looks smaller but the graph indicates not; Figure 2G, no. of TBR2+ cells in the graph is reduced; Figure 4C, GFAP expression at E18.5 seems reduced in the graph). The authors should increase the sample size to provide more solid and consistent results. It would be useful to quantify GFAP fluorescence intensity in panel C, as was done in Figure 4.</p><p>2) Figure 1: Do the <italic>Sox9</italic>/<italic>Sox1cre</italic> heterozygous mice exhibit any morphological phenotypes? Also, for the hematoxylin analyses, were there any deficits in the conditional mutant mice within the CA regions of the hippocampus as well as the DG? Finally, It would be beneficial to quantify the fluorescence in panel F for SOX9, as was done in Figure 4.</p><p>3) Figure 7: A hemotoxylin analysis of the <italic>Wnt3a cre</italic> mutant strain would be very valuable here (similar to Figure. 1). Also, the data in Supplementary Figure 11 are very valuable, and I think they would be better served being included in this figure. Finally, the main phenotype the <italic>Wnt3a cre</italic> mice exhibit is a failure of the glial matrix arising from the fimbria to form. However, the formation and migration of TBR2 and PROX1 expressing cells appears relatively normal. As such, I think the Discussion of the manuscript need to be toned down to reflect this. For example, the first paragraph of the Discussion states that the fimbrial glial scaffold is necessary for the migration of granule neuron progenitors to the forming DG.</p><p>Revisions expected in follow-up work:</p><p>1) To demonstrate that fimbria glial scaffold defect is indeed the predominant cause of the phenotype, the authors need to provide addition data on (i) the fate of the ectopic cluster and (ii) smaller DG is not due to impaired adult neurogenesis.</p><p>a) What happens to those ectopic cluster of cells? The authors mentioned that those ectopic cells did not undergo cell death. Are they still there at 3 months old mice? Did they fail to migrate even the GFAP+ fimbria scaffold emerges after E18.5? If not, does this imply SOX9 controls some other important mechanisms that result in the reduced dentate gyrus phenotype? If so, the role of fimbria scaffold in brain morphogenesis may be overstated. Since the <italic>Wnt3a-CreSox9</italic> mutants die after E18.5, it is impossible to evaluate the contribution of <italic>Sox9</italic> loss in cortical hem to the reduced dentate gyrus phenotype. The authors may need to discuss on this issue.</p><p>b) The authors mentioned that the ectopic cells were absent in the adult brain without increased apoptosis. Again, when the glial scaffold emerged at P2 (Figure 4A-B), did the ectopic cells start to migrate so that the ectopic clusters disappeared later? Since <italic>Sox9</italic> are also expressed in the adult DG (Shin et al., 2015), it is possible that the smaller DG is due to loss of <italic>Sox9</italic> in the DG. The authors need to clarify this point, as the importance of the transient loss of fimbria glia scaffold may be exaggerated.</p><p>2) In Figure 4, the authors described that close to the DNE, the GFAP+ fimbria scaffold appears well separated from both DNE progenitors and those migrating in the 2ry matrix (Figure 4Fa). Along the migratory stream, progenitors start being more closely associated with the scaffold (Figure 4Fb). Finally, from the distal part of the fimbria, progenitors and scaffold appear completely intermingled (Figure 4Fc). From these, one can conclude that the fimbria scaffold is required for progenitor migration throughout the 2ry matrix. Indeed, the authors suggested in the model (Figure 8) that, progenitor migration towards the forming 3ry matrix relies on the fimbria scaffold. If so, one would expect cells that failed to migrate are found throughout the entire migration stream in the 2ry matrix. However, the ectopic cluster is only seen near the DNE. Does this imply only the delamination of progenitors is dependent on glia scaffold, rather than the continuous migration along the 2ry matrix? To answer this question, the authors could perform a sequential EdU/BrdU birthdate tracing of the cells found in the migration stream. If the migration really has defects, then one should be able to observe a different distribution of the birthdated cells in the migration stream. Also, in Figure 3Eii, the authors compared the % of TBR2+EdU+ cells in the ectopic cluster over total TBR2+Edu+ cells in 2ry matrix. This should be expanded to compare the % of such cells in the 1ry matrix, 2ry matrix, 3ry matrix over the total number of these cells in all matrices. This will provide much more information as to the migratory behavior of these cells.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.63904.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>1) The primary finding of the manuscript is that SOX9-dependent fimbria glial scaffold guides the migration of granule neuron progenitors towards dentate gyrus.

We agree that our conclusions rely on sometime delicate phenotypic differences. These are observed when <italic>Sox9</italic> is differentially deleted, in particular using <italic>Sox1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> and <italic>Nestin-Cre</italic>, but also supported by studies of <italic>Wnt3a<sup>iresCre</sup></italic> mutants. Some of the differences observed between <italic>Sox1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> and <italic>Nestin-Cre</italic> mutant are clear, especially when examining the fimbrial part of the glial scaffold at E18.5 (Figure 4A), and correlate with their differential activity (Figure 1G-H). However, since both mutants show a disruption of DG development, other aspects of the phenotype, such as retention of cells in the ectopic cluster (Figure 2F) or secondary matrix (Figure 2M), appear more similar. Our interpretation, supported by exclusive deletion of <italic>Sox9</italic> in the CH, where <italic>Nestin-Cre</italic> is not active, is that the fimbrial scaffold offers a necessary, albeit transient, support for progenitor migration. Partial and variable <italic>Nestin-Cre</italic> activity in the CH might also explain the variability of migration defects observed in <italic>Sox9<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Nestin-Cre</italic> mutants. Indeed, loss of <italic>Sox9</italic> in DNE migrating cells may have a cell-autonomous effect. However, this would be a relatively subtle effect since we were not able to quantify any difference by examining progenitor numbers, proliferation and fate acquisition. The Discussion has been amended to reflect these elements.</p><p>To make the differences and similarities between <italic>Sox1</italic> and <italic>Nestin-Cre</italic> clearer, we have now increased the number of samples. We re-examined DG size quantification at P2 by adding 1 sample in controls and <italic>Nestin-cre</italic> mutants and 2 in <italic>Sox9<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Sox1<sup>Cre/+</sup> </italic>in Figure 1C. We still observe a significant reduction of DG size in <italic>Sox1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mutants, but not in <italic>Nestin-Cre</italic> ones.</p><p>We also added one P2 sample in both <italic>Sox9<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Sox1<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Sox9<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Nestin-Cre</italic> groups to quantify the total number of TBR2 and PROX1 cells at P2. While a reduction is observed in <italic>Nestin-Cre</italic> mutants, this still does not reach statistical significance (Figure 2G and J). We have amended the text to comment on this reduction.</p><p>Finally, we quantified GFAP fluorescence intensity in <italic>Sox9<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Sox1<sup>Cre/+</sup>Sox9<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Nestin-Cre</italic> and <italic>Sox9<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Wnt3a<sup>iresCre/+</sup> </italic>embryos at E18.5 and compared it to controls. We examined the fimbrial and supragranular scaffolds separately (Figure 6F). This analysis shows that expression of GFAP in the fimbrial scaffold is significantly reduced compared to controls in <italic>Sox9<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Sox1<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Sox9<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Wnt3a<sup>iresCre/+</sup> </italic>embryos, but not in <italic>Nestin-Cre</italic> ones. Conversely, GFAP expression in the supragranular scaffold is only significantly downregulated in <italic>Sox9<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Sox1<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Sox9<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Nestin-Cre</italic> embryos, but not in <italic>Wnt3a<sup>iresCre</sup></italic> ones. This is consistent with our lineage tracing analyses demonstrating the fimbrial scaffold mostly derives from the CH while the supragranular part derives from the DNE. It is also consistent with a requirement for SOX9 in CH. A graph representing this analysis was added in Figure 6 (new panels E and F). We would like to thank the reviewers for this suggestion as this quantification further strengthens our results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 1: Do the <italic>Sox9/Sox1 cre</italic> heterozygous mice exhibit any morphological phenotypes?

We have found that while CA2 and CA3 layers looks slightly less compacted, the reduction in DG size is the most obvious defect in mutants. We have added this analysis to Figure 1âfigure supplement 1.</p><p>In our original manuscript, we examined expression of SOX9/<italic>Sox9</italic> (Figure 1F, Figure 1âfigure supplement 5A) and quantified expression of the gene by quantitative PCR (Figure 1âfigure supplement 5B). These three independent analyses show the same result: SOX9/<italic>Sox9</italic> is not completely deleted in the archicortex in <italic>Nestin-Cre</italic> mutants, as previously shown (Winkler et al., 2018). The same <italic>Nestin</italic> enhancer has moreover been used to drive GFP expression in mice, and this again shows incomplete expression, although it should be borne in mind that this will be a different transgenic insertion and it may not be directly comparable (Li et al., 2009). Nevertheless, we believe that quantification of the SOX9 immunofluorescence, would not add any new element to our already clear and concordant results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 7: A hemotoxylin analysis of the <italic>Wnt3a cre</italic> mutant strain would be very valuable here (similar to Figure. 1).

While the overall morphology of the developing DG in <italic>Sox9<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Wnt3a<sup>iresCre/+</sup> </italic>embryos does not appear affected, we confirmed the presence of the ectopic cluster.

However, migration of TBR2+ intermediate progenitors is also affected since these cells are retained in the secondary matrix (Figure 7F). While this supports the requirement of the scaffold for migration, we understand that further analysis of the DG phenotype in these mutants is required to make the conclusion that it is required for DG morphogenesis. As recommended, we have toned down the first paragraph of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions expected in follow-up work:</p><p>1) To demonstrate that fimbria glial scaffold defect is indeed the predominant cause of the phenotype, the authors need to provide addition data on (i) the fate of the ectopic cluster and (ii) smaller DG is not due to impaired adult neurogenesis.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it would be very interesting to determine the fate of the ectopic cluster once the glial scaffold is recovered, more precisely understand if the cells are able to resume migration, or if retention in this ectopic location has permanently compromised their potential. Attempts so far have simply enabled us to report absence of the cluster in the adult, as visible in Figure 1Aii. Determining timing and modalities of its disappearance will require further investigations which are beyond the scope of this study, as acknowledged by the reviewers and editor. However, we believe that our current results allow us to conclude that adult neurogenesis does not play an exclusive role in mutant DG size reduction, for two reasons. First, we observe a smaller DG in very young animals, at P2, when the NSCs niche of the SGZ is not yet established. Secondly, the presence of a normal DG when using <italic>Nestin-Cre</italic> (Figure 1A-C), which is known to be expressed in SGZ NSCs, further argues that <italic>Sox9</italic> deletion in these cells does not result in major defects in DG morphology. As mentioned in the Discussion, it is nevertheless very likely that <italic>Sox9</italic> deletion affects adult neurogenesis, as we have observed this previously in the SVZ, where the protein is required for NSC maintenance. Conditional deletion of <italic>Sox9</italic> in SGZ NSCs is now required to determine its specific role during adult DG neurogenesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>a) What happens to those ectopic cluster of cells?

The authors may need to discuss on this issue.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not observe apoptosis in the ectopic cluster, but we only tested this at P2 (Figure 1âfigure supplement 5); examinations at further stages are now required since the cluster is clearly absent in the adult (Figure 1Aii). As mentioned in the previous comment, it would be of interest to determine how it disappears and what happens to the cells. However, failure to migrate after retention in the ectopic cluster on the recovered scaffold may not only reflect a cell autonomous requirement for SOX9. The delay may permanently compromise the potential of the cells; for example, a signal, or sensitivity to it, could exist at E18.5 to promote migration, but not anymore at P2.</p><p>The loss of <italic>Wnt3a<sup>iresCre</sup></italic> mutants indeed prevents assessment of the post-natal DG phenotype. In these mutants, the retention of TBR2 progenitors in the secondary matrix (Figure 7F), the presence of the ectopic cluster (Figure 7D, G, H) and the absence of the fimbrial scaffold (Figure 7I), as mostly observed in <italic>Sox1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mutants, all strongly support the role of the CH, where the gene is exclusively deleted, while the affected cells (ectopic cluster, TBR2 migrating cells) all retain <italic>Sox9</italic> expression. However, we agree that while all this evidence is strongly supportive, it does not formally demonstrate that reduction of adult DG size is exclusively due to absence of the fimbrial scaffold. We have thus toned down our Discussion as detailed above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) The authors mentioned that the ectopic cells were absent in the adult brain without increased apoptosis. Again, when the glial scaffold emerged at P2 (Figure 4A-B), did the ectopic cells start to migrate so that the ectopic clusters disappeared later? Since <italic>Sox9</italic> are also expressed in the adult DG (Shin et al., 2015), it is possible that the smaller DG is due to loss of <italic>Sox9</italic> in the DG. The authors need to clarify this point, as the importance of the transient loss of fimbria glia scaffold may be exaggerated.</p></disp-quote><p>The cluster is still present at P2, despite the recovery of the glial scaffold. Furthermore, the DG is already smaller at this stage, demonstrating that the loss of <italic>Sox9</italic> at or, as we show, before P2 results in reduction of the DG. We did not examine migration at later stages in the mutants, which would be of interest. However, as mentioned above, presence of a normal DG in <italic>Nestin-Cre</italic> mutants strongly suggest that absence of <italic>Sox9</italic> post-natally in DG does not result in reduction of its size.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In Figure 4, the authors described that close to the DNE, the GFAP+ fimbria scaffold appears well separated from both DNE progenitors and those migrating in the 2ry matrix (Figure 4Fa). Along the migratory stream, progenitors start being more closely associated with the scaffold (Figure 4Fb). Finally, from the distal part of the fimbria, progenitors and scaffold appear completely intermingled (Figure 4Fc). From these, one can conclude that the fimbria scaffold is required for progenitor migration throughout the 2ry matrix. Indeed, the authors suggested in the model (Figure 8) that, progenitor migration towards the forming 3ry matrix relies on the fimbria scaffold. If so, one would expect cells that failed to migrate are found throughout the entire migration stream in the 2ry matrix. However, the ectopic cluster is only seen near the DNE. Does this imply only the delamination of progenitors is dependent on glia scaffold, rather than the continuous migration along the 2ry matrix? To answer this question, the authors could perform a sequential EdU/BrdU birthdate tracing of the cells found in the migration stream. If the migration really has defects, then one should be able to observe a different distribution of the birthdated cells in the migration stream. Also, in Figure 3Eii, the authors compared the % of TBR2+EdU+ cells in the ectopic cluster over total TBR2+Edu+ cells in 2ry matrix. This should be expanded to compare the % of such cells in the 1ry matrix, 2ry matrix, 3ry matrix over the total number of these cells in all matrices. This will provide much more information as to the migratory behavior of these cells.</p></disp-quote><p>The 3D examination of progenitor migration along the scaffold provides interesting information and also further questions about the modalities of this process. We would like to thank the reviewer for these suggestions that would definitely be useful to better examine how the scaffold support progenitors and allow us to discriminate between defective delamination versus migration.</p></body></sub-article></article>
