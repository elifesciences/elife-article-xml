Thymic homing of bone marrow-derived hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) is therefore a critical step. It was reported that HPCs enter the thymus via unique blood vessels that are surrounded by perivascular spaces (PVS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lind et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mori et al., 2007</xref>) primarily in the corticomedullary junction (CMJ) of the thymus. To understand how the unique blood vascular endothelial cells (ECs) are involved in thymic homing of HPCs is an important question in the field. Previously, we identified a specialized subset of P-selectin<sup>+</sup>Ly6C<sup>-</sup> thymic portal endothelial cells (TPECs) located in the CMJ region and associated with PVS structure, providing the cellular basis for thymic homing of HPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shi et al., 2016</xref>). Short-term HPC thymic homing assay confirmed that TPECs is highly associated with settling HPCs and lack of TPECs in lymphotoxin beta receptor-deficient mice resulted in dramatically impaired HPC thymic homing and reduced number of thymic early T cell progenitors (ETPs). Transcriptome analysis revealed that TPECs are enriched with transcripts related to cell adhesion and trafficking, supporting its critical role for thymic homing. However, the molecular basis of TPEC function and its underlying mechanism have not been experimentally determined.</p><p>Several molecules have been found to play important roles for thymic homing of HPCs. P-selectin and adhesion molecule VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, highly expressed on ECs, as also confirmed in our previous study, have been suggested to mediate adhesion of HPCs on ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lind et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mori et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rossi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Scimone et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, chemokines such as CCL25 and CCL19/CCL21 expressed by thymic ECs as well as thymic epithelial cells (TECs) are also involved in thymic homing of HPCs, probably via integrin activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Krueger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Misslitz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Parmo-Cabañas et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zlotoff et al., 2010</xref>). All the above-mentioned mechanisms regulate the multistep HPC homing at early invertible process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zlotoff and Bhandoola, 2011</xref>). Transendothelial migration (TEM) is the decisive step for migration of progenitors from blood into the thymus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zlotoff and Bhandoola, 2011</xref>). To accomplish the homing process, the barrier of endothelial junction must be opened. How this step is regulated in TPECs still remains unknown.</p><p>Signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPα) is a transmembrane protein that contains three Ig-like domains, a single transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic region. Ligation of SIRPα by its ligand CD47 transmits intracellular signal through its ITIM motifs. SIRPα is mainly expressed by myeloid cells such as monocytes, granulocytes, most tissue macrophages, and subsets of dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barclay and Van den Berg, 2014</xref>). On the other hand, CD47 is ubiquitously expressed but show fluctuating expression levels on different cell states or cell types. Elevated CD47 expression is detected on bone marrow cells and some of lymphoid subsets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jaiswal et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Van et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>SIRPα plays various roles in immune system. SIRPα on conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) maintains their survival and proper function via intracellular SHP2 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Iwamura et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Saito et al., 2010</xref>). On macrophages, upon CD47 ligation, SIRPα signaling activates intracellular SHP1 to inhibit Fcγ receptor-mediated phagocytosis toward target cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blazar et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ishikawa-Sekigami et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tsai and Discher, 2008</xref>). Elevated expression of CD47 on platelets, lymphocyte subsets, and hematopoietic cell subsets shows ‘self’ identity and protects them from being cleared by macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blazar et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jaiswal et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Olsson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yamao et al., 2002</xref>). Tumor cells express high level of CD47 to escape immune surveillance initiated by macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Majeti et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Willingham et al., 2012</xref>), which leads to the development of CD47-SIRPα blockade as a promising approach for cancer therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Feng et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>CD47-SIRPα has also been reported to play important roles in cell adhesion and migration. SIRPα expressed on cDCs, neutrophils, melanoma cells, and CHO cells has been reported to promote cell motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fukunaga et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Motegi et al., 2003</xref>) through SHP2-dependent activation of Rho GTPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wollenberg et al., 1996</xref>) and cytoskeleton reorganization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Inagaki et al., 2000</xref>). On the other hand, SIRPα expressed on neutrophils and monocytes has been shown to be the ligand for endothelial or epithelial CD47 and promotes junction opening through activating Rho family GTPase therefore permitting transmigration of the SIRPα-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Vries et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stefanidakis et al., 2008</xref>). However, the expression and function of SIRPα on ECs remain unknown.</p><p>In the present study, we uncovered a novel role of TPEC signature molecule SIRPα in thymic homing of progenitor cells, revealed that migrating cell-derived CD47 and EC-SIRPα intracellular signal induce junctional VE-cadherin endocytosis and promote TEM.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TPECs preferentially express SIRPα</title><p>To explore the molecular mechanisms for thymic homing of the progenitors through TPECs, we started with signature genes of TPECs based on previously published RNA-Seq data (GSE_83114) and focused on the genes related to cell adhesion and migration by intersecting with related gene sets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

SIRPα was barely detectable on Ly6C<sup>+</sup>P-selectin<sup>-</sup> ECs, the dominant population of thymic ECs. On Ly6C<sup>+</sup>P-selectin<sup>+</sup> ECs, the suggested precursor of TPECs, there was a substantial level of SIRPα expression. Among all three EC subsets, Ly6C<sup>-</sup>P-selectin<sup>+</sup> TPECs express the highest level of SIRPα at both mRNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). Immunofluorescence staining also confirmed the location of SIRPα expression on TPECs, although irrespective of PVS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Thus, SIRPα appears to be closely and positively related to thymic TPECs.</p><p>Given the preferential expression of SIRPα on TPECs, we asked whether signals affect TPEC development such as LT-LTβR would be required for SIRPα expression. However, the remaining TPECs in <italic>Ltbr<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice showed similar level of SIRPα expression compared to that in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Thymic stromal niche is another factor regulating thymic settling of progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Krueger, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Prockop and Petrie, 2004</xref>). Increased thymic stromal niche was found during irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zlotoff et al., 2011</xref>). However, this does not seem to alter SIRPα expression, either (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Whether SIRPα expression on TPECs is a constitutive event or regulatable upon thymic microenvironmental change remains to be tested in future.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>SIRPα is essential for ETP population maintenance, thymic progenitor homing, and proper T cell development</title><p>ETPs are the very first subset of bone marrow-derived progenitor cells that settle the thymus and are committed to T cell lineage.

Therefore, possibility exists that phagocytic activity may elevate toward circulating progenitor cells in <italic>Sirpa</italic><sup>-/-</sup> or <italic>Sirpa</italic> TEK-CKO mice before they reach the thymus, since <italic>Sirpa</italic> is deficient in hematopoietic cells of both mouse lines. To distinguish the role of hematopoietic cell-derived versus non-hematopoietic radioresistant stromal cell-derived SIRPα in the regulation of thymic ETPs, bone marrow chimeric mice were generated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Mice lacking SIRPα on radioresistant stromal cells demonstrated significantly reduced ETP population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>), whereas in mice lacking SIRPα on hematopoietic cells, ETP population remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E, F</xref>). Thus, together with the previous data, reduced thymic ETP population in <italic>Sirpa</italic><sup>-/-</sup> or <italic>Sirpa</italic> TEK-CKO mice is unlikely due to increased clearance of HPCs in the absence of hematopoietic SIRPα.

SIRPα deficiency on hematopoietic cells did not result in impaired thymic settling of bone marrow progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2G</xref>), nor did the number of progenitors retained in the periphery as represented by the number of progenitor cells in the spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2H</xref>).

T lymphocytes were labeled with different fluorescent antibodies, treated with CD47-blocking reagent (CV1) or control hIg, mixed equally and then infused into a flow chamber mimicking physiological blood flow.

VE-cadherin colocalization with CD31 under area of migrating cells was calculated and grouped by the different fluorescent labels on lymphocytes. The higher colocalization of VE-cadherin with CD31 indicates less VE-cadherin endocytosis. The test was performed on <italic>Cd47</italic><sup>-/-</sup> MS1 cells to exclude potential influence of CD47 on ECs. Significantly higher degree of VE-cadherin/CD31 colocalization was found under migrating cells that were pretreated with CV-1 compared to that under control treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F and G</xref>), suggesting the requirement of CD47 signal derived from migrating cells for induction of VE-cadherin endocytosis.

In our previous study, Ly6C<sup>-</sup>P-selectin<sup>+</sup> portal ECs, TPECs, were found to be the entry gate of HPCs to the thymus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shi et al., 2016</xref>). In current study, we have further extended the knowledge about how TPECs interact with progenitors and regulate their thymic entry.</p><p>SIRPα has been well recognized as a ‘don’t eat me’ receptor on myeloid cells. Interestingly, our current study reveals a previously totally unrecognized function of SIRPα on ECs for TEM regulation. SIRPα-CD47 interaction has been reported to regulate TEM of neutrophils and monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Vries et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stefanidakis et al., 2008</xref>). In these studies, CD47, but not SIRPα, is considered as the receptor-mediating signal transduction, while SIRPα expressed on neutrophils or monocytes is the ligand. SIRPα engagement of CD47 on epithelial cells or CEs activates Gi-protein-dependent pathway to facilitate transmigration or Rho family GTPase-dependent pathway to reorganize EC cytoskeleton. However, in our current work, we clearly showed that SIRPα downstream signal in ECs is required for VE-cadherin endocytosis and TEM. First, in bone marrow chimeric mice that were deficient in hematopoietic SIRPα, thymic ETP is normally maintained, while non-hematopoietic deficiency of SIRPα resulted in impaired thymic ETPs and thymic progenitor homing. These results exclude the possibility in the conventional view that SIRPα is derived from the migrating cells while CD47 is from endothelial compartment. Second, in the absence of functional intracellular region of SIRPα, while keeping extracellular region intact, <italic>Sirpa</italic>-ΔICD or <italic>Sirpa</italic>-Y4F EC monolayer showed deficiency of TEM comparable to that of <italic>Sirpa</italic><sup>-/-</sup> ECs, underlying the importance of EC-SIRPα downstream signal in controlling TEM. This was further confirmed by the fact that replenishment of WT <italic>Sirpa</italic> but not mutant <italic>Sirpa</italic>-Y4F can rescue TEM reduction in <italic>Sirpa</italic><sup>-/-</sup> ECs. Third, <italic>Sirpa</italic>-ΔICD ECs also had impaired endocytosis of VE-cadherin similar to that of <italic>Sirpa</italic><sup>-/-</sup> ECs, further supporting the role of EC-SIRPα downstream signaling in TEM.</p><p>The role of CD47 in this scenario might be complicated. CD47 is ubiquitously expressed in almost all cells, including immune cells and ECs both of which are involved in this trafficking process. Our data demonstrated that newly immigrated ETP expressed the highest level of CD47 than other subsets of hematopoietic cells during T cell development. The expression level of CD47 on ETPs is also significantly higher than that on TPECs. These data suggest that migrating cell-derived CD47 might play a major and active role in activating SIRPα on ECs for TEM. In fact, <italic>Cd47</italic>-deficient or blocked Lin<sup>-</sup> BMCs or lymphocytes transmigrate across ECs less efficiently compared to WT control cells when endothelial CD47 is absent. Whether physiologically low level of endothelial CD47 constantly work for TEM remains intriguing. Although lymphocyte transmigrate through WT endothelial monolayer more efficiently than <italic>Cd47</italic>-deficient endothelial monolayer, given the artificial hyperexpression of CD47 on immortalized WT MS1 cells, this does not necessarily reflect the physiological role of endothelial CD47 on thymic homing. Therefore, a more physiological experimental model is required for further elucidation on the role of endothelial CD47 during thymic HPC homing.</p><p>Our study reveals a novel mechanism regulating adherens junction VE-cadherin endocytosis. Both SHP2 and Src kinase have been reported to regulate VE-cadherin endocytosis, via modification of VE-cadherin in different manners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allingham et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wessel et al., 2014</xref>). However, how they are activated remains unclear. Here, our data suggest that CD47-SIRPα might be one of the upstream signals. In our study, deletion of SIRPα or its cytoplasmic domain results in significant deficiency of TEM and VE-cadherin endocytosis. Regeneration of constitutively activated SHP2 largely rescues TEM in <italic>Sirpa</italic><sup>-/-</sup> ECs, while regeneration of ITIM motif mutant SIRPα fails to do so. Together with the fact that ITIM motif activates cytosolic SHP2 phosphatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Motegi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tsuda et al., 1998</xref>), these data suggest that SIRPα signal-induced VE-cadherin endocytosis is at least in part through ITIM-SHP2 pathway. In addition, we have also found that CD47 engagement induces Src activation in ECs. Inhibition of Src kinase via PP2 results in significantly impaired TEM and VE-cadherin endocytosis in WT ECs, but not in <italic>Sirpa</italic><sup>-/-</sup> ECs. Thus, Src kinase is also involved in SIRPα signal-induced VE-cadherin endocytosis. It has been reported that SHP2 activation can regulate Src family kinase activity by controlling Csk recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that CD47-SIRPα signal activates SHP2-Src axis to control VE-cadherin endocytosis and TEM. It should be noted that the EC cell line we used here is not derived from or corresponding to TPECs. More proper cell lines or conditional gene-deficient mice might be used for further confirmation of this signaling mechanism in TPECs. On the other hand, whether this signaling mechanism is applicable in other settings is worthy of being investigated in future.</p><p>The defective thymic homing of progenitor cells in the absence of CD47-SIRPα signaling may lead to impaired thymic T cell development. In <italic>Sirpa</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, at steady state, thymocyte development shows slight and significant defect at DN stage compared to that in WT mice, while later stage development appears normal. In another scenario, upon Lin<sup>-</sup> BMC adoptive transfer, thymocyte development in <italic>Sirpa</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice is also significantly impaired at both DN and DP stages. While no statistical significance was achieved, there is a trend of reduction of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> SP thymocytes in <italic>Sirpa</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. The biological consequence of the impaired thymic T cell development remains to be determined in various scenarios in future.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Endothelial SIRPα signaling controls thymic progenitor homing for T cell regeneration and antitumor immunity&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Juan Carlos Zúñiga-Pflücker as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard White as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Jarrod A. Dudakov (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Overall, there was enthusiasm for the paper but some significant concerns remain. Below, I am listing what we consider essential revisions, but you can see the detailed reviewer comments below that so this can act as a guide for your experiments.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There was agreement by the reviewers that the results from the thymus reconstitution assay shown in Figure 7 require further analysis and controls for the conclusions to be supported. One recommendation is to remove this experimental approach and pursue it as part of a more complete study on the effects of CD47-SIRPa inhibition in immunotherapy.</p><p>2) The assays used to address thymus homing are not sufficiently strong to support the conclusions, and the use of a competitive mix bone marrow chimera would be more appropriate. As well as examining for Flt3+ ETPs as a better way to enumerate recently arrived ETPs.</p><p>3) It would be important for the authors to discuss or provide new insights as to the regulation of SIRPa expression by TPECs, is this regulated by ETP niche occupancy, LT signals, or some other mechanism.</p><p>4) Carefully check figure legends for reporting of individual mice and independent experiments for each panel, which will allow for a more rigorous reporting and data analysis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The work presented by the authors convincingly illustrates the role played by SIRPa in TPECs to facilitate TSP entry into the thymus.</p><p>1 – Given the important role played by chemokines in attracting TSPs to the thymus, it would be important to show whether absence of SIRPa affects the expression of key chemokines by TPECs, which could further explain the observed decrease in thymic recruitment. This was shown for VCAM1 (Figure 3E), which nicely excludes this other potential explanation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors should carefully check figure legends for reporting of individual mice and independent experiments for each panel. Frequently, 3 independent experiments with 3 mice each are reported and fewer dots for individual mice are shown. For instance, in figure 2, in some instances 4 dots per group are shown, which is more than an individual &quot;representative&quot; experiment but too few to be justified by elimination of outliers, as this would indicate more outliers than usable data points. The authors should check whether comparison of multiple groups requires ANOVA, such as in Figure 4A.</p><p>The authors report higher levels of CD47 on ETPs, when compared to bone-marrow progenitors and later stages. However, ETPs are already in the thymus, whereas the progenitors should be expected to have higher levels. The authors should reassess their interpretation of data. They could also subdivide ETPs according to Flt3 expression into young and old ETPs. CD47 flow cytometry only shows a minor shift over isotype even for ETPs (4E figure supplement 1). The authors should elaborate on their normalization procedure for cytometry data and also show primary data examples for cell types analyzed in Figure 4A.</p><p>For the experiments og thymus regeneration, it would strengthen the paper, if the authors performed additional homing assays such as those performed by Zlotoff et al., (2011) or used the conditional Tie2Cre-SIRPa-KO model.</p><p>The manuscript should be carefully checked for grammatical errors.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall this was a very well-conceived study with some important and novel findings. Although I do believe that the experiments detailed support the main conclusions of the manuscript, the following are a few questions/comments that would strengthen the manuscript if addressed.</p><p>– The authors have elegantly shown the importance of TPECs in guiding the entry of HPCs into the thymus, and in their previous work the authors have shown that TPECs associate with perivascular spaces. However, given that not all TPECs express Sirpa (Figure 1E), and in their previous work there are at least 20% of TPECs that do not associate with PVS (and it is not at all clear from their previous work what the proportion of TPECs are located at the CMJ where we expect HPCs to enter the thymus), it would be extremely beneficial to show the location of TPECs and Sirpa in the thymus in relation to other architectural features (such as PVS, CMJ etc.)</p><p>– In Figure 2 I appreciate the inclusion of BM progenitor subsets but it would be great if additional subsets could be retroactively included such as LMPPs. This is not critical but would strengthen the claims if possible.</p><p>– In Figure 7, is there any change in number of TOPECs in mice treated with CV1?</p><p>– As a stylistic note, specific figures/panels should not be called out in the discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69219.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There was agreement by the reviewers that the results from the thymus reconstitution assay shown in Figure 7 require further analysis and controls for the conclusions to be supported.

As CV1 inhibition arouse many other questions regarding immune checkpoint blockade, current approaches cannot thoroughly evaluate this effect and illuminate the mechanism behind. Therefore, these data were removed from this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The assays used to address thymus homing are not sufficiently strong to support the conclusions, and the use of a competitive mix bone marrow chimera would be more appropriate.

This made the approach more physiologically relevant, more straightforward and less interfered by other components in the total bone marrows.</p><p>b) We tried to construct mixed bone marrow chimeras.

This is likely due to the phagocytotic clearance of CD47 deficient cells by phagocytes (Jaiswal et al., 2009). Therefore, it currently remains a technical difficulty to address the role of CD47 on progenitor cells in thymic homing using mixed competitive bone marrow chimeras, or mixed progenitor cell adoptive transfer in non-irradiated hosts.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Development of WT and <italic>Cd47<sup>-/-</sup></italic> Lin<sup>-</sup> progenitors in non-irradiated hosts.</title><p>(A) Schematic view of the experiment.

In addition, comparison of Flt3<sup>+</sup> newly immigrated ETPs and Flt3<sup>-</sup> ETPs found higher CD47 expression on Flt3<sup>+</sup> ETPs, indicating the involvement of CD47-SIRP<sub>α</sub> signal in progenitor homing (new Figure 4B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It would be important for the authors to discuss or provide new insights as to the regulation of SIRPa expression by TPECs, is this regulated by ETP niche occupancy, LT signals, or some other mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>It’s an interesting and important question how SIRP<sub>α</sub> expression is regulated on TPECs.

Thymic stromal niche is another factor regulating thymic settling of progenitor cells (Krueger, 2018; Prockop and Petrie, 2004). Increased thymic stromal niche was found during irradiation (Zlotoff et al., 2011). We detected SIRP<sub>α</sub> expression on TEPCs at Day 14 after 5.5Gy total body sublethal irradiation and found no significant change in SIRP<sub>α</sub> expression upon irradiation (new Figure 1—figure supplement 1D). Whether SIRP<sub>α</sub> expression on TPECs is a constitutive event or regulatable upon thymic microenvironmental change remains to be tested in future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Carefully check figure legends for reporting of individual mice and independent experiments for each panel, which will allow for a more rigorous reporting and data analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the lack of clarity with these legends.

In mice, chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) and 9 (CCR9), especially the latter, play important roles for thymic homing of hematopoietic progenitors. Thymic ETP population was significantly reduced in CCR9 KO mice (about 7-fold) compared to WT mice at resting stage, while CCR7 KO mice show largely unchanged or even increased population of ETPs. More dramatic reduction of ETP population was found in CCR9 and CCR7 double KO mice (Krueger et al., 2010; Zlotoff et al., 2010). The corresponding chemokines, CCL25 and CCL19/CCL21, are expressed by both thymic ECs and thymic epithelial cells. To determine whether SIRP<sub>α</sub> may regulate the expression of these chemokines, TPECs were sorted from wild type or <italic>Sirp<sub>α</sub></italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice for quantitative RT-PCR assay. No change of <italic>Ccl25</italic> and <italic>Ccl19</italic> expression were found upon deficiency of Sirp<sub>α</sub>, and <italic>Ccl21a</italic> showed slight reduction. Considering unreduced thymic ETP population in CCR7 deficient mice, the reduced <italic>Ccl21a</italic> expression in <italic>Sirp<sub>α</sub></italic><sup>-/-</sup> EC unlikely explains the significant ETP reduction in <italic>Sirp<sub>α</sub></italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. These results have been updated as part of the manuscript in Figure 3— figure supplement 1D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors should carefully check figure legends for reporting of individual mice and independent experiments for each panel.

Due to the continuous expression of Flt3 on ETPs, CD47 expression is compared between top ¼ (Flt3hi) and bottom ¼ (Flt3lo) subsets.

Although I do believe that the experiments detailed support the main conclusions of the manuscript, the following are a few questions/comments that would strengthen the manuscript if addressed.</p><p>– The authors have elegantly shown the importance of TPECs in guiding the entry of HPCs into the thymus, and in their previous work the authors have shown that TPECs associate with perivascular spaces. However, given that not all TPECs express Sirpa (Figure 1E), and in their previous work there are at least 20% of TPECs that do not associate with PVS (and it is not at all clear from their previous work what the proportion of TPECs are located at the CMJ where we expect HPCs to enter the thymus), it would be extremely beneficial to show the location of TPECs and Sirpa in the thymus in relation to other architectural features (such as PVS, CMJ etc.)</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for your advice. For comparison of SIRP<sub>α</sub> expression in TPECs locating at various thymic structure, we conducted confocal microscopic detection of SIRP<sub>α</sub> expression on TPECs (CD31<sup>+</sup>Ly6C<sup>-</sup>) with perivascular spaces (PVS) surrounding the EC cavity or not. Regions of TPECs were automatically identified by CD31-expression area in ImageJ, SIRP<sub>α</sub> expression were then measured in the TPEC region. The expression of SIRP<sub>α</sub> in TPECs with or without PVS structure was in similar level, suggesting SIRP<sub>α</sub> expression may not be regulated by thymic microenvironment signal. This result has been presented as Figure 1—figure supplement 1A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In Figure 2 I appreciate the inclusion of BM progenitor subsets but it would be great if additional subsets could be retroactively included such as LMPPs.
