Although crystal structures are known, the densely packed pore region has precluded delineation of the ion pathway. Here we chart out the Fluc pore and characterize its chemical requirements for transport. A ladder of H-bond donating residues creates a ‘polar track’ demarking the ion-conduction pathway. Surprisingly, while track polarity is well conserved, polarity is nonetheless functionally dispensable at several positions. A threonine at one end of the pore engages in vital interactions through its β-branched methyl group. Two critical central phenylalanines that directly coordinate F<sup>-</sup> through a quadrupolar-ion interaction cannot be functionally substituted by aromatic, non-polar, or polar sidechains. The only functional replacement is methionine, which coordinates F<sup>-</sup> through its partially positive γ-methylene in mimicry of phenylalanine’s quadrupolar interaction. These results demonstrate the unusual chemical requirements for selectively transporting the strongly H-bonding F<sup>-</sup> anion.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ion channel</kwd><kwd>permeation</kwd><kwd>fluoride</kwd><kwd>H-bond</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Last</surname><given-names>Nicholas B</given-names></name><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>Christopher</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH GM107023</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Senmiao</given-names></name><name><surname>Pham</surname><given-names>Minh C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The ion-transport pathway of an unconventional bacterial fluoride channel is mapped out through combined crystallographic and functional experiments.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Aqueous fluoride ion is an omnipresent environmental xenobiotic that inhibits certain phosphoryl-transfer enzymes critical for energy production and nucleic acid synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Marquis et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Samygina et al., 2007</xref>). Two phylogenetically unrelated F<sup>-</sup> efflux systems are now known that resist the toxicity of cellular F<sup>-</sup>: the CLC<sup>F</sup> family of F<sup>-</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporters, and the Fluc family of F<sup>-</sup> ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Stockbridge et al., 2012</xref>). Fluc channels, present in all classes of life except higher animals, allow passive transit of F<sup>-</sup> ions across the membrane down their electrochemical gradient. Bacterial Fluc channels are constructed as small, dual-topology dimers; the two subunits, each of ~120 residues, span the membrane in opposite orientations to form the functional complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Stockbridge et al., 2013</xref>). These channels are notable for this unusual architecture as well as for exceptionally high F<sup>-</sup>/Cl<sup>-</sup>selectivity. Recent crystal structures of two Fluc channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Stockbridge et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Last et al., 2016</xref>) reveal four bound F<sup>-</sup> ions whose transmembrane disposition imply two antiparallel ion-permeation pathways, each occupied simultaneously by two F<sup>-</sup> ions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Each pathway was postulated to be extremely narrow, largely anhydrous, and filled up by side chains that hand off F<sup>-</sup> ions passing along it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). This unusual structural inference was confirmed functionally by substitutions of three conserved, ion-coordinating residues in this region – two phenylalanines and an asparagine – that fully inhibit F<sup>-</sup> transport.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31259.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Fluc-Ec2 channel structure.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Crystal structure of Ec2-S9 complex (PDB #5A43, re-refined) showing double-pore assembly, with F<sup>-</sup> ions in purple and subunits in cyan and yellow.

The lower ion approaches one of the wide aqueous vestibules on the two ends of the channel, while the other is deeply buried within the protein. The proposed critical pore-associated moieties are of two chemical types: aromatic rings of two conserved Phe residues contributed from different subunits, each of which coordinates a F<sup>-</sup> ion in an electropositive edge-on orientation, and dipolar H-bond donors arranged to satisfy the F<sup>-</sup> ion's H-bond accepting preference. These H-bonding residues were proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Stockbridge et al., 2015</xref>) to form a ‘polar track’ extending in both directions beyond the centrally located Phe rings, as indicated in the sequence alignment and structure of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Most polar track residues emanate from TM4, where they appear at every 4<sup>th</sup> position, and although not all are individually conserved, H-bond donors frequently appear here. Several of these coordinate F<sup>-</sup> ions in the crystal structures, while others lie close to the aqueous vestibules where crystallographically ordered waters are also observed. We emphasize that the structures do not show water-filled aqueous tunnels lined by polar groups, as in many other ion channels; instead, the pores are filled with a web of side chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>) that must be negotiated by ions translocating at rates on the order of 10<sup>6</sup>–10<sup>7</sup> ions/sec.</p><p>Our aim here is to further test this picture by mutating each of the residues thought to be involved in F<sup>-</sup> transport and to determine their chemical requirements for channel function. Results confirm that the mutation-sensitive positions do indeed trace along the trajectory expected, but we were surprised to find that the polar character of several of these residues is not required for channel activity. Positions that are functionally sensitive to mutagenesis require a specific, finely tuned sidechain, and a conserved Thr residue unexpectedly uses its β-branched methyl group rather than its H-bonding hydroxyl. An additional surprise is that no other aromatic or canonical polar group substituted at the conserved Phe residues supports channel activity, but Met at one of these positions leads to a fully active channel; this seemingly strange result is rationalized by an electrostatic argument that the Met side chain mimics the Phe ring, a prediction confirmed by a crystal structure of the mutant.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A Fluc homologue from an <italic>E. coli</italic> virulence plasmid, nicknamed ‘Ec2’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Stockbridge et al., 2013</xref>), was used for all experiments. Three strongly conserved, deeply buried residues spanning ~7 Å along the pore were previously found to be required for transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Stockbridge et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Last et al., 2016</xref>) in this and a different homologue: two Phe (F80, F83) and an Asn positioned between them (N41). To initially gauge the functional importance of the entire polar track, we mutated each of the four track residues on TM4 (S102, H106, S110, T114) to Ala as well as an additional residue, S84, which in the structure projects into the pore-region from TM3 of the partner subunit. Channel activity was assessed with an anion-efflux assay, wherein F<sup>-</sup> or Cl<sup>-</sup> transport by liposome-reconstituted Fluc was followed continuously with ion-specific electrodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Stockbridge et al., 2013</xref>). Because F<sup>-</sup> flux through WT channels is far faster than the electrode's time-response, this is effectively a binary assay of whether a construct is broadly functional or severely impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>); even a channel with a 95% inhibited transport rate will display a WT phenotype, completely emptying its liposomes of F<sup>-</sup> within the electrode's response time. For this reason, all mutants appearing active in the flux assay were also electrophysiologically examined in planar phospholipid bilayers for direct determination of single-channel conductance. Surprisingly, we find (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>) that F<sup>-</sup> robustly permeates three track mutants denuded of their hydroxyl groups - S84A, S102A, and S110A - with single-channel conductances within 25% of WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). In contrast, H106A and T114A, as well as alternative H-bonding substitutes H106S, H106Y, H106W, H106N, H106F, N41S, N41Q, and N41Y are completely nonfunctional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), representing &gt;10,000 fold rate-inhibition relative to WT. In crystal structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) H106 coordinates a partially hydrated F<sup>-</sup> ion located close to bulk solvent at one end of the narrow pore, T114 lies beyond the other F<sup>-</sup> ion at the opposite end, and the other residues tested reside between them. These functionally sensitive positions thus chart out a ~ 20 Å span connecting the deepest parts of the aqueous vestibules, as suggested from the structures alone. We now turn to the chemical requirements for three of the positions vital for transport.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31259.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Effect of polar track mutation on Fluc function.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) WT fluoride flux, limited by the response time of the measurement.

Removal of aromaticity by substitution of either Phe with Ile was previously shown to abolish both transport and F<sup>-</sup> occupancy at the site near the substitution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Last et al., 2016</xref>). We examined a variety of mutations to survey the chemical requirements for F<sup>-</sup> binding and transport at these central Phe positions. Aromatics (Y, W, H) were introduced as conservative substitutions, aliphatic H-bond donors (S, T, Q) as potential F<sup>-</sup>-coordination partners of alternative chemistry, and hydrophobic aliphatics (L, A) as additional controls. All eight mutations, most of them tested at both Phe residues, completely abolish channel activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

In such cases, non-canonical residues appearing in the alignment might either reflect a novel transport chemistry, or simply represent a functionally disrupted pore that no longer has strict residue requirements. Such an arrangement has been suggested from sequence analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Stockbridge et al., 2015</xref>) and indicated experimentally in a yeast Fluc channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Smith et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berbasova et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, both La and Sa heterodimers retain three of the central phenylalanines, but have either Leu or Met appear at the fourth position. Given that one pore in these dimers would still possess both phenylalanines, the altered residues may line an inactivated pore. The Mt heterodimer surprisingly loses both phenylalanines at the second position, replaced with either methionine or tryptophan. This leads to the unexpected hypothesis that that either Met or Trp are capable of coordinating and transporting fluoride in that construct.</p><p>Since alignments show Met occasionally appearing at the central Phe positions, we wondered if this might be functionally meaningful, despite ambiguities about heterodimeric sequences. In this context, Met can be viewed as a uniquely plausible non-aromatic substitute for Phe, since the electron-withdrawing sulfur is expected to produce a partial positive charge on the γ-methylene and terminal methyl groups, either of which might act as an electrostatic surrogate to coordinate F<sup>-</sup>. Accordingly, each central Phe was mutated to Met and tested for F<sup>-</sup> transport. Remarkably, F80M results in an active flux-phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>) and displays clean single-channel recordings with near-WT conductance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). In contrast, F83M is inactive.</p><p>We determined crystal structures of both Met mutants to test the prediction above regarding F<sup>-</sup> coordination. As with the Tyr substitute, the Met structures are virtually identical to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), and all residues surrounding the substitutions are unmoved (C<sub>α</sub> rmsd ~0.3 Å from WT, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). The Met side chains in both take on a twisted conformation, filling approximately the same space as the Phe ring in WT. As predicted, in both Met mutants F<sup>-</sup> ions are coordinated by the γ-methylenes located in nearly the same positions as the coordinating Phe ring carbons in WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">4</xref>), as though the substituted linear side chains attempt to mimic Phe’s aromatic ring in occupied volume and F<sup>-</sup>-binding electrostatics. As with the Tyr mutant, the similar structures offer no explanation why F80M is functionally active and F83M is not.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>A paradoxically polar position</title><p>As described above, the moderately conserved Thr114 lies at one end of the polar track, distant from bound F<sup>-</sup> ions, and its substitution by Ala abolishes channel activity, as if its hydroxyl group is necessary for ushering the anion into the narrow pore from the aqueous vestibule.

In the WT structure, this contacts the Gly49 C<sub>α</sub>, V85 C<sub>α</sub>, and F88 side chain, all from the partner subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, it is possible that the T114 methyl participates in a nonpolar interaction critical for stabilizing the conducting structure of WT (a structure that nevertheless is still observed in T114S crystals). We attempted mutating Phe88 to Ala (mutation of the backbone C<sub>α</sub>’s being unfeasible) to weaken the interaction with the opposite subunit. The height of the F88A flux kinetic is clearly smaller than that of WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>), demonstrating that a significant fraction of the channels, although apparently well-folded and dimeric off the gel-filtration column, are inactive. However, those channels that remain active have near WT levels of single channel flux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). These results are difficult to interpret, as the changes in the fraction of active F88A may be independent of any possible interaction with T114. Additionally, given that T114 also makes close contact with the F88 beta carbon (which would remain in the F88A construct, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>), interactions vital for flux may still remain even after mutation. We therefore conjecture, without compelling evidence beyond the crystal structure itself, that Thr114 contributes to the pore’s structural integrity but does not coordinate F<sup>-</sup> during its transit.</p><p>A striking feature of Fluc channels is their extreme (&gt;10,000 fold) selectivity against Cl<sup>-</sup> ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Stockbridge et al., 2013</xref>). This may simply reflect steric hindrance arising from a narrow bore of the conduction pathway, but no evidence currently informs this question pro or con. Whatever the mechanism of Cl<sup>-</sup> exclusion, though, it is preserved in all functional mutants described here; in no case do we observe any Cl<sup>-</sup> leakage through these channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), a result further supporting the structural propriety of the mutant channels independent of their crystal structures.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Despite functional experiments accompanied by crystal structures at resolution high enough to locate F<sup>-</sup> ions, revealing two parallel and independent pores, the F<sup>-</sup> permeation pathway of Fluc channels remains mysterious.

The failure of even Tyr to functionally substitute for Phe at either Ec2 position is particularly surprising in light of the F80Y crystal structure. The Tyr and Phe rings and the F<sup>-</sup> ions adopt identical positions, and the Tyr hydroxyl points away from the bound F<sup>-</sup>, its presence leaving other parts of the protein undisturbed. Modification of ring electrostatics by the polarizable hydroxyl may lead to a more tightly bound ion, inhibiting flux. If any sidechain movement is required during transport, the additional hydroxyl may introduce either steric clash or competing polar interactions in those alternate conformers. In the case of F80Y, favorable hydroxide-phenyl interactions with the neighboring F83 could also inhibit sidechain movement.</p><p>Also surprising is the full activity of the F80M substitution. This may be rationalized by the F<sup>-</sup>-coordinating γ-methylene, whose weakly electropositive character recalls the electropositive, edge-on presentation of the Phe ring to its coordinated F<sup>-</sup> ion. The Met side-chain configuration in the F80M structure is in striking agreement with this idea, but the functional impairment of F83M, which offers a similar configuration, remains puzzling. F83 coordinates its fluoride in conjunction with H106, which is the only other residue in this construct that will brook no substitution. This raises the possibility that more precise orientation is required here than at F80. While the Ec2 homologue studied here is inflexible at this location, different coordination schemes are clearly possible; <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>) replaces both the histidine and phenylalanine. It remains to be seen whether these alternate arrangements continue to be as finely tuned and unaccepting of modification.</p><p>Other aliphatic mutations at these critical Phe positions are known to eliminate transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), and this prohibition now extends to dipolar H-bond donors, with neither Ser, Thr, His, nor Gln supporting channel activity. Previous removal of the central phenylalanines (F80I, F83I) led to a loss of fluoride density in crystal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Last et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that the F83M and F80Y mutants inhibit transport via a mechanism fundamentally different from the simple loss of a binding site. The results establish that the center of the pore has an exceptionally strict requirement for F<sup>-</sup> coordination and transport, possibly reflecting a need for a geometrically precise, electrostatically weak binding partner for rapid transit of F<sup>-</sup> in this anhydrous region.</p><p>Along the conserved polar track, only two H-bond donors are required: N41 and H106. The N41 residue, among the most strictly conserved in the Fluc family, is oriented between the two F<sup>-</sup>-coordinating Phe, well positioned to hand off the anion between them. In coordinating a partially hydrated F<sup>-</sup> at the end of the pore, H106 could catalyze dehydration as the ion leaves bulk water in the vestibule. It is surprising, even alarming, that for the hydroxyl-bearing track residues - S84, S102, S110, and T114 - polarity and H-bonding are not directly involved in anion permeation, despite the conservation of polarity at these positions and their proximity to bound F<sup>-</sup> ions in the pore.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Baron Chanda as the Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor.

It is a logical continuation of earlier work from the Miller lab centered on characterization of bacterial ion channels with high selectivity for fluoride ion over chloride. Despite having the crystal structures of Fluc, the fluoride ion path in the pore remained unclear. Last and co-workers selected eight conserved residues along the hypothetical ion pathway, performed an extensive mutagenesis study (30 new mutants of Fluc-Ec2), identified which mutations perturb fluoride transport using a liposome assay and in-planner lipid bilayers recordings, and obtained four crystal structures of various mutants in an attempt to explain their observations. The most striking result is that Fluc remains active after mutation of conserved F80 residue to M but not to Y, H or W. In contrast, mutations of conserved F83 to any residue including M makes Fluc inactive. The crystal structures reported are for two inactive mutants, F80Y and F83M, and for one active F80M. All three structures have fluoride ions bound similar to WT, in contrast to a previous report where F80I and F83I lost the ability to coordinate fluoride ions. Another surprise is that mutations of &quot;polar track&quot; residues have unpredictable effect on channel activity. H106, which varies in Fluc alignment to nearly any polar residue, cannot be mutated even to S or N without perturbing channel activity. Mutation of similar polarity T114S made Fluc inactive, while hydrophobic substitutions of T114V and T114I yielded fully functional channels. The crystal structure of inactive T114S mutant looks identical to WT and the authors suggest the importance of T114 in stabilization of the conducting structure but not fluoride coordination during transit.</p><p>The manuscript is well written, the data is of the highest quality and the authors are thorough in their investigation of the mutants, determining crystal structures of several of the mutants and their effects on F- binding. The study uncovers several unexpected features and raises new questions about the mechanism of unusually high ion selectivity in these channels. It is very surprising, for instance, that none of the mutants altered the effective selectivity for F- over Cl<sup>-</sup> but many essentially eliminated the ability of the channel to conduct F-. One would typically expect to observe alterations in some channel property beyond this all-or-nothing effect for residues that line an ion conduction pore. Despite the fact that a clear picture does not yet emerge for the chemical requirements for F- permeation and selectivity, this study is the necessary starting point for further mechanistic studies and is worthy of publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The Materials and methods section pertaining to the functional studies is lacking sufficient detail. Details are needed regarding protein purification (buffers, detergents, methods). How are the lipids handled? (Dry down, re-suspend what buffer, sonicate? Detergent added to solubilize the lipids?). What dialysis membrane, temperature, dialysis volume, time? While many of the methods may be similar to Last et al. 2016, the methods of that publication, while slightly more detailed, could use clarification along the same lines.</p><p>2) The most confusing part of the paper is the phenylalanine mutants. It seems that there are three possible scenarios: 1) the protein transports fluoride, crystal structure has ion in the pore (WT and F80M); 2) protein does not transport fluoride, crystal structure has no ion in the pore (F80I and F83I, previous work, not discussed in current paper); and 3) protein does not transport fluoride, crystal structure has ion in the pore (F80Y and F83M). It suggests that some mutations do not let fluoride to get into the pore, and other mutations bind fluoride too tightly which blocks the pore. Some comments on that in the Discussion can be helpful in projecting the bigger picture especially in comparison to alignment showing naturally occurring M and W at the position equivalent to F83. It also seems important to mention in the Discussion the previous results with Fluc-Bpe (homolog from Bortedella pertusis) where Stockbridge et. al showed equivalent single mutants F82I and F85I transporting fluoride moderately well in liposome assays. It suggests that studies with different representatives from this divergent family of proteins can give unexpectedly different results.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31259.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The Materials and methods section pertaining to the functional studies is lacking sufficient detail.

We have added several statements (spread across three Discussion paragraphs) and referenced the F80I/F83I results in the Discussion in order to provide a broader perspective to the results. We have also posited some (hypothetical) explanations. We also expanded and clarified our discussion of the heterodimers and the observed non-canonical residues.</p><p>We believe that an additional focus on the Bpe homologue would not expand the discussion, and may make it less clear. Although the Bpe Phe→Ile constructs still permitted some flux, the flux was severely inhibited (&gt;100-fold), and thus we believe those results, while slightly different in magnitude, are not broadly divergent from the ones described here for Ec2.</p></body></sub-article></article>
