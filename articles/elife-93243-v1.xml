resistance. We studied rifampicin tolerance in isolates with or without isoniazid resistance (IR). Using a minimum duration of killing assay, we measured rifampicin survival in isoniazid-susceptible (IS, n=119) and resistant (IR, n=84) isolates, correlating tolerance with bacterial growth, rifampicin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), and isoniazid-resistant mutations. Longitudinal IR isolates were analyzed for changes in rifampicin tolerance and genetic variant emergence. The median time for rifampicin to reduce the bacterial population by 90% (MDK90) increased from 1.23 days (IS) and 1.31 days (IR) to 2.55 days (IS) and 1.98 days (IR) over 15–60 days of incubation, indicating fast and slow-growing tolerant sub-populations. A 6 log10-fold survival fraction classified tolerance as low, medium, or high, showing that IR is linked to increased tolerance and faster growth (OR = 2.68 for low vs. medium, OR = 4.42 for low vs. high, p-trend = 0.0003). High tolerance in IR isolates was associated with rifampicin treatment in patients and genetic microvariants. These findings suggest that IR tuberculosis should be assessed for high rifampicin tolerance to optimize treatment and prevent the development of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>tuberculosis</kwd><kwd>mycobacterium</kwd><kwd>rifampicin</kwd><kwd>tolerance</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.35802/206724</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thuong</surname><given-names>Nguyen Thuy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.35802/207487</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Javid</surname><given-names>Babak</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.35802/106680</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thwaites</surname><given-names>Guy E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21AI169005</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Javid</surname><given-names>Babak</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

Challenges to successful TB treatment include bacterial evolution and diversification under host stresses and antibiotics, leading to differential antibiotic susceptibility even among genetically susceptible <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Colangeli et al., 2018</xref>). Based on killing dynamics, the differential susceptibility can be classified into two phenomena, (1) antibiotic tolerance observed as a reduced rate of killing of the entire bacterial population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kwan et al., 2013</xref>), and (2) antibiotic persistence observed as a reduced rate of killing of sub-populations compared to more susceptible bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brauner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ronneau et al., 2021</xref>). Clinically susceptible isolates exposed to host stresses and antibiotic selection can exhibit increased antibiotic tolerance and persistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mishra et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gordhan et al., 2021</xref>), as seen by the emergence of mutations increasing tolerance or persistence among clinical <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Su et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Torrey et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hicks et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Recent studies have also implicated the antibiotic tolerance in clinical isolates as a risk factor for hard-to-treat infections and tolerance can also contribute to the emergence of resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lee et al., 2019</xref>) and relapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Imperial et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Emergence of rifampicin tolerance or persistence, a key drug in TB treatment is a major concern considering the emergence of multi-drug resistant (MDR, resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampicin) tuberculosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Grobbelaar et al., 2019</xref>). Several mechanisms lead to rifampicin tolerance, heteroresistance, or persistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adams et al., 2021</xref>). These include efflux pump overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2011</xref>), mistranslation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Javid et al., 2014</xref>), overexpression of rifampicin target <italic>rpoB</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>), cell size heterogeneity, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Vijay et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aldridge et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Rego et al., 2017</xref> and the redox heterogeneity in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Mishra et al., 2019</xref>). Rifampicin treatment can also result in differentially detectable sub-populations of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, which can grow only in liquid medium as compared to solid medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Saito et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, in determining the risk of post-treatment relapse, it is important to consider, alongside tolerance range, the degree of growth heterogeneity within tolerant subpopulations.</p><p>Apart from rifampicin susceptibility variation, another concern in standard TB treatment is the emergence of IR. There is globally around 10% prevalence of IR among clinical <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Thai et al., 2018</xref>). IR is difficult to rapidly diagnose during drug susceptibility testing, and is associated with worse treatment outcomes compared to isoniazid-susceptible (IS) <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Thai et al., 2018</xref>). Importantly, IR is also associated with the subsequent emergence of rifampicin resistance leading to MDR TB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Srinivasan et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Despite its potential importance for the TB treatment, the distribution of rifampicin tolerance among clinical <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates is unknown, and routine clinical microbiology diagnosis does not include any assays for tolerance. The growth fitness of rifampicin tolerant subpopulations, and the association of pre-existing IR with rifampicin tolerance is completely unknown.</p><p>To address this knowledge gap, we developed a most-probable number (MPN) based minimum duration of killing (MDK) assay to determine the rifampicin tolerance among clinical <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates in a medium-throughput manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Vijay et al., 2021</xref>). In the current study, we investigated the rifampicin tolerance in a large set of IS (n=119) and IR (n=84) clinical <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates and its correlation with bacterial growth rate, rifampicin MICs, IR mutations, and the rifampicin treatment selection in patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Study design</title><p>We investigated rifampicin tolerance and its association with isoniazid susceptibility among 242 clinical <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates. We treated susceptible isolates with rifampicin (2 µg/mL), a concentration several times higher than their MICs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) and also close to the serum rifampicin concentration observed in a patient during oral dose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Prakash et al., 2003</xref>), and at 0, 2, and 5 days determined fractional survival following 15, 30, and 60 days of culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Higher survival fractions indicate higher rifampicin tolerance, and differences in survival fraction determined between 15 and 60 days of incubation indicated greater growth heterogeneity in rifampicin tolerant sub-populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). 23 of the isolates grew poorly in the absence of antibiotics, and a further 10 had low initial MPN, making accurate determination of survival fractions difficult (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), and these 33 isolates were removed from further analysis. Of the remaining 209 isolates, 119 IS, 84 IR, and 6 were resistant to both rifampicin and isoniazid, MDR.

We did not further analyze 30 days incubation result, as it was similar to 60 days incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Following 5 days of rifampicin treatment, the average survival fraction reduced by 90–99% of the starting bacterial population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We calculated the time required for 90% survival fraction reduction (MDK<sub>90</sub>) for each isolate by determining the different lengths of the X-axis (Days post rifampicin treatment) corresponding to a 90% decline in survival fraction in the Y-axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Of note, the average time required for 90% survival fraction reduction (MDK<sub>90</sub>) was 1.23 (95%CI (Confidence interval) 1.11; 1.37) and 1.31 (95%CI 1.14; 1.48) days for IS and IR, respectively when survivors were incubated for 15 days, but rose to 2.55 (95%CI 2.04; 2.97) and 1.98 (95%CI 1.69; 2.56) days for 60 days for IS and IR isolates, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This shift in the MDK<sub>90</sub> indicated the presence of growth heterogeneity within the tolerant subpopulation – with both fast and slow-growing bacteria within tolerant subpopulations. For most of the isolates, MDK<sub>90</sub> time could be calculated but other parameters of tolerance and persistence such as MDK<sub>99</sub> (at 15 day = 81% (170/209), 60 day = 41% (86/209)) and MDK<sub>99.99</sub> (at 15 day = 11% (22/209), 60 day = 8% (17/209)) could be calculated for only a fraction of 209 isolates and the rest were beyond the assay limits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Intriguingly, we observed a significant difference in rifampicin tolerance between IS and IR isolates at 5 days of treatment– but only in the 15 days post-recovery. The difference had disappeared by 60 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Therefore, we decided to consider survival fractions with 15 and 60 days recovery for further analysis, the earliest and latest time points for determining the fast- and slowly-growing rifampicin-tolerant subpopulations.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Rifampicin survival curve in isoniazid susceptible and resistant clinical <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> isolates.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) The bacterial kill curve as measured by log10 survival fraction from data collected at 0, 2, and 5 days of rifampicin treatment followed by incubation for 15 and 60 days, respectively.

Overall clinical <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates showed higher levels of rifampicin tolerance than lab isolates as the average survival fraction post-rifampicin treatment decreased only by 90–99% over 5 days. We found that levels of rifampicin tolerance are widely distributed among isolates, with some genetically susceptible strains having similar susceptibility to rifampicin-mediated killing as <italic>bona fide</italic> rifampicin-resistant isolates, at least during the 5 days of rifampicin exposure of our assay condition. Furthermore, IR isolates were more likely to harbor fast-growing subpopulations with high levels of rifampicin tolerance.</p><p>Heterogeneity in regrowth following stress has been linked to a tradeoff between growth fitness and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Moreno-Gámez et al., 2020</xref>), and it is likely that in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> such diversification in growth rates among rifampicin-tolerant subpopulations represents such a balance between growth and persistence under antibiotic stress.</p><p>We also observed a variation in growth rate in the absence of antibiotic therapy. On average, IR isolates were slower growing than IS isolates, which likely represents a fitness cost due to isoniazid- resistance-causing mutations and strain genetic background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gagneux, 2009</xref>). As expected, IS isolates, with slower growth in the absence of a drug had a weak association with high levels of rifampicin tolerance at the 15- day time point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Pontes and Groisman, 2019</xref>) (representing rapidly growing recovered cells), whereas both IS and IR isolates with slower growth in the absence of drug were significantly associated with lesser rifampicin survival fraction levels at 60 days– representing slow growing rifampicin tolerant bacilli. These data suggest that slower growth (in absence of a drug) in both isoniazid susceptible and resistant isolates, perhaps due to the fitness cost of mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gagneux, 2009</xref>), may be associated with more persister-like tolerant subpopulations.</p><p>By contrast, the association between rifampicin MIC and rifampicin tolerance showed a contrasting trend with isoniazid susceptibility. IS isolates showed decreased tolerance with the increase in rifampicin MIC, but IR isolates did not show this association. This may indicate higher growth fitness of IR with rifampicin tolerance. Another important finding from our study is the emergence of higher rifampicin tolerance and growth fitness in longitudinal IR isolates under rifampicin treatment selection. This further supports the findings that multiple genetic microvariants may co-exist in patients and rapidly change their proportion under selection from host stresses and antibiotic treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Trauner et al., 2017</xref>). We also observed non-synonymous mutations in multiple genes, associated with persistence and host survival enriched with changes in rifampicin tolerance between the longitudinal isolates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c</xref> with references). However, the lack of convergent SNPs in the samples may be due to the relatively small sample size, interaction between SNPs, and strain background, or indication of a larger set of tolerance-related genes that independently affect bacterial growth and antibiotic tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brauner et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Our study also reveals novel aspects of rifampicin tolerance associated with isoniazid susceptibility. Rifampicin treatment itself led to the selection of IR <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> genetic micro variants with high rifampicin tolerance and increased growth fitness in patients. The precise mechanisms underlying these phenotypes will require further investigation, but it is intriguing to note that different <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> lineages have varying liabilities for the development of isoniazid resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carey et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that clinical isolates may evolve diverse paths towards phenotypic drug resistance that impact fundamental bacterial physiology and tolerance to other antibiotics.</p><p>The wide range of observed rifampicin tolerance, spanning many orders of magnitude confirms findings of experimentally evolved drug tolerance to the laboratory isolate <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-H37Rv (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Torrey et al., 2016</xref>) and extends our prior findings from a smaller-scale pilot study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Vijay et al., 2021</xref>). Given that almost all rifampicin resistance is via mutations in <italic>rpoB</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zaw et al., 2018</xref>, our findings suggest that first-line molecular testing for rifampicin susceptibility, which is replacing phenotypic drug susceptibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Macedo et al., 2018</xref>), may not fully capture the response to therapy. It needs to be further validated if these strains that are ‘hyper-tolerant’ to rifampicin are risk factors for poor clinical outcomes in IR-TB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Thai et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Given the association of IR with the emergence of rifampicin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Srinivasan et al., 2020</xref>), our findings suggest a plausible mechanism by which isoniazid resistance, via rifampicin tolerance, acts as a ‘stepping stone’ to rifampicin resistance. The association between IR and rifampicin tolerance only held for fast-growing recovered bacteria. Given the observation that ‘growing’ rifampicin tolerant bacteria are over-represented after initiation of drug therapy in humans due to the specific regulation of <italic>rpoB</italic> in mycobacteria in response to rifampicin exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>), this may represent a divergence between growing and non-replicating persister forms of antibiotic tolerance. A better understanding of which forms of tolerance contribute to clinically relevant responses to therapy will be critical for tailoring individualized regimens for TB or improving treatment regimens for IR-TB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">WHO, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Our study has some limitations. We only assayed rifampicin tolerance under one standard axenic culture condition. It is known that antibiotic tolerance phenotypes vary considerably according to culture conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hicks et al., 2018</xref>), with some phenotypes only emerging in vitro with specialized media, e.g., containing odd-chained fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hicks et al., 2018</xref>). Second, contributors to antibiotic tolerance can be genetic, epigenetic, or transient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Su et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Torrey et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hicks et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wang et al., 2020</xref>), and there is considerable epistasis between genetic variation and antibiotic susceptibility. Our assay will not be able to capture drivers of tolerance that have been lost in the collection, banking, freezing, and reviving of the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates. Finally, the isolates were from a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Thai et al., 2018</xref>), and during the study period, the old 8 month TB treatment regimen lacked rifampicin in the continuation phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Thai et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>This study also reveals interesting aspects like fast and slow-growing sub-populations and possible variation in lag-time distribution among clinical <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates. There can also be different mechanisms of tolerance and persistence among <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates, detailed investigations are required to further understand these aspects and its clinical relevance.</p><p>In conclusion, our study identifies a significant association between isoniazid resistance and rifampicin tolerance in clinical isolates of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. Our findings have implications for the requirement to consider heterogeneity in bacterial responses to antibiotics and the emergence of antibiotic-tolerant bacterial genetic micro variants in determining optimal tuberculosis treatment regimens.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Ethical approval</title><p><italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates in this study were a part of the collection from a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Thai et al., 2018</xref>), approved by the Institutional Research Board of Pham Ngoc Thach Hospital as the supervisory institution of the district TB Units (DTUs) in southern Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh City Health Services and the Oxford University Tropical Research Ethics Committee (Oxtrec 030–07).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Bacterial isolates</title><p>242 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates, collected for a previous study in Vietnam were used in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Thai et al., 2018</xref>).

the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The study entitled &quot;Rifampicin tolerance and growth fitness among isoniazid-resistant clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates: an in-vitro longitudinal study&quot; by Vijay et al. provides valuable insights into the association of rifampicin tolerance and growth fitness with isoniazid resistance among clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis. Antibiotic tolerance in M. tuberculosis is an important topic since it contributes to the lengthy and complicated treatment required to cure tuberculosis disease and may portend the emergence of antibiotic resistance. The authors found that rifampicin tolerance was correlated with bacterial growth, rifampicin minimum inhibitory concentrations, and isoniazid-resistance mutations.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The large number of clinical isolates evaluated and their longitudinal nature during treatment for TB (including exposure to rifampin) are strengths of the study.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Some of the methodologies are not well explained or justified and the association of antibiotic tolerance with growth rate is not a novel finding. In addition, the molecular mechanisms underlying rifampicin tolerance only in rapidly growing isoniazid-resistant isolates have not been elucidated and the potential implications of these findings for clinical management are not immediately apparent.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comments, we have modified the method section and figure 1 to clarify the method as suggested by the reviewer.</p><p>Although we agree that previous studies have shown the association of slow growth rate with antibiotic tolerance, ours is the most comprehensive assessment of rifampicin tolerance among clinical isolates, to our knowledge. In particular, we show that the degree of tolerance in clinical isolates can vary over several orders of magnitude: which had not been previously documented or appreciated. Furthermore, the association of high tolerance among IR isolates is a new finding, and given the potential for tolerance to increase risk of de novo drug resistance, our study suggests that IR isolates with high rifampicin tolerance may present a risk for development of MDR-TB.</p><p>In addition, we have also analysed the longitudinal isolates and the genetic variants emerging in them associated with increase in rifampicin tolerance. This analysis reveals possible multiple pathways to increase in rifampicin tolerance among clinical M. tuberculosis isolates. Possible clinical implication includes associating high rifampicin tolerance and isoniazid resistance as a risk factor for tuberculosis treatment failure. This study helps to develop further clinical studies to evaluate the role of rifampicin tolerance in IR isolates and treatment outcome. We have focused on these aspects in the discussion of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study by Vijay and colleagues addresses a clinically important, and often overlooked aspect of Tb treatment. Detecting for variations in the level of antibiotic tolerance amongst otherwise antibiotic-susceptible isolates is difficult to routinely screen for, and consequently not performed. The authors, present a convincing argument that indeed, there is significant variation in the susceptibility of isoniazid-resistant strains to killing by rifampicin, in some cases at the same tolerance levels as bona fide resistant strains. On the whole, the study is easy to follow and the results are justified. This work should be of interest to the wider TB community at both a clinical and basic level.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The manuscript is long, repetitive in places, and the figures could use some amending to improve clarity (this could be a me-specific issue as they look ok on my screen, yet the colour is poor when printed).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comments, we have modified the revised manuscript as per the reviewer suggestions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would have been great to have seen some correlation between increased rifampicin tolerance and treatment outcome, although I'm not sure if this data is available to the researchers.

Rifampicin tolerance and treatment outcome analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that correlation between rifampicin tolerance and treatment outcome is important.

They demonstrate the association of isoniazid-resistant isolates by rifampicin treatment supporting the idea that selection of MDR is a microenvironment phenomenon and involves a group of isolates.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The methods used in this study are robust and the results support the authors' claims to a major extent.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The manuscript needs a thorough vetting of the language. At present, the language makes it very difficult to comprehend the methodology and results.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comments, we have revised the manuscript as per the reviewer’s suggestions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Major comments:</p><p>(1) Methods: The authors attempt to differentiate between &quot;fast&quot;- and &quot;slow&quot;-growing bacteria in order to determine if the growth rate is associated with rifampicin tolerance. This is accomplished by assessing growth on solid agar at 15 and 60 days post-incubation, respectively. However, mycobacterial growth rate is not a binary phenomenon but rather a continuous variable. Moreover, it is not clear why 15 and 60 days were selected. Also, instead of a &quot;slow growth&quot; phenotype, the 60-day time point might simply reflect a longer lag phase. Were the plates examined at any interval time points? It would be interesting to know whether colony growth was delayed overall in the populations observed only at 60 days, or simply if the appearance of microcolonies visible to the naked eye was delayed (with normal growth afterwards).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comments, we want to clarify that we have not used agar plates but most-probable number method to determine the survival fraction post antibiotic treatment. We have clarified this in the revised manuscript and revised figure 1. The MPN method is a binary measure (growth/ no growth) and therefore cannot differentiate between long lag time and other mechanisms. In our original analysis, we included an intermediate time point of 30 days, but these data (included as supp fig. 1) cannot address the issue of lag phase directly. Since the 30-day time point did not add to the overall analysis and interpretation, we had not included them in the original submission.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Methods/Results/Discussion: Some important clinical information is missing-how were the patients treated who had IR isolates? Did they receive the standard regimen for DS TB or was another drug substituted for isoniazid? Exposure to different drugs could affect the rifampicin-tolerant populations during the intensive phase (Figure 5).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment, we have included the information regarding the treatment regimen in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Were there differences in microbiological (sputum culture conversion rate at 8 weeks or time to culture negativity) or clinical outcomes based on isoniazid susceptibility? Perhaps more importantly, were there differences in microbiological/clinical outcomes based on the proportion of bacterial subpopulations with rifampicin tolerance for a particular isolate? There should be more discussion on the potential clinical implications of the study's findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that correlation between rifampicin tolerance and treatment progression or outcome is important. This needs to be performed in future studies with better design to correlate rifampicin tolerance with treatment progression or outcome data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Results (Figure 3A): Although an interesting finding, the increased rifampicin tolerance observed only in the &quot;rapidly&quot; growing populations of isoniazid-resistant isolates (IR) vs. isoniazid-susceptible (IS) isolates is not explained. In contrast, equally, increased rifampicin tolerance is seen in the &quot;slowly&quot; growing populations of both IR and IS isolates. It would be interesting to know if these slowly growing populations show specific tolerance to rifampicin or if, as expected, slow growth confers tolerance to a range of different bactericidal antibiotics.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestions. we agree these will be interesting to investigate in a future study but are outside the scope of the current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Results (Figure 3B): The basis for the classification into tertiles is not clear and appears somewhat arbitrary-does this represent the survival of a particular isolate following rifampicin exposure relative to the other isolates based on isoniazid susceptibility (IS or IR) or the % growth relative to other populations for the same isolate? Figure 3B is missing a y-axis label. Is it a log10 MPN ratio?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this, we want to clarify that for the classification into tertiles, first we pooled both group of isolates isoniazid susceptible (IS) and isoniazid resistant (IR) into a single population. Subsequently, we categorized this unified population into three distinct groups: low, medium, and high, based on their survival fraction following rifampicin treatment. Consequently, the 'low,' 'medium,' and 'high' tertiles represent the survival of each isolate following rifampicin exposure relative to the total number of isolates combing both IS and IR isolates.</p><p>For clarity, we provide a breakdown of the criteria for each tertile:</p><p>+Low tertile: Consists of isolates with the lowest survival fraction (bottom 25%).</p><p>+Medium tertile: Encompasses isolates with survival fractions that fall between the bottom 25% and the top 25%.</p><p>+High tertile: Comprises isolates with the highest survival fractions (top 25%). This we have modified in the revised manuscript to clarify.</p><p>We have also modified the Figure 3B to correct the y-axis label.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Results (lines 185-186): For correlating relative growth in the absence of antibiotics, 19 clinical isolates &quot;outliers&quot; were removed without explanation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added explanation for the “outliers” which were removed earlier due to deviation from normal distribution, we have also provided the supplementary figure 3 which includes these outliers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Results (lines 203-211): The authors attempted to investigate a potential association between the mechanism of M. tuberculosis isoniazid resistance and the degree of rifampicin tolerance. However, the vast majority of IR clinical isolates (n=71) had a katG_S315X mutation and only 8 isolates had alternative mutations (inhA_I21T and fabG1_C-15X). Given the wide range of rifampicin tolerance observed within these isoniazid-resistant isolates, they concluded that other genetic or epigenetic determinants must be playing a role. WGS of longitudinally collected isolates from the same patients during TB treatment yielded non-synonymous SNPs in a list of genes previously reported to be associated with persistence, tolerance, and mycobacterial survival. However, precise mechanisms (including, e.g., expression of efflux pumps) are not investigated.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for summarising the findings.

This is an important aspect of understanding MDR development in TB strains. the results are promising and gel well with the hypothesis. However, the manuscript requires a thorough language modification. While the overall idea is clear the methodology does not come out clearly.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>(1) It is not clear whether rifampicin treatments were given for 2 and 5 days before kill curves or for 15 and 60 days? The methodology needs to be phased clearly. Why was this time interval of 15 days and 60 days taken? is there a rationale for this?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestions, we have modified the method and figure 1 to clarify this in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) A concentration of 2ug/ml was used for in vitro culture in this study. While the authors themselves indicate that this is well above the MIC, this might represent a non- natural dose and hence may force the evolution of strains. What will be the scenario in the natural course of antibiotic treatment (dose at MIC or less than MIC)?</p></disp-quote><p>We have observed that till 5 days there is no significant resistant emergence but after 5 days only resistance emerges, therefore we avoided determining the survival fraction after resistance emergence, the kill curve represents mostly tolerant sub population. ADD: Pharmacokinetic studies of rifampicin dosing suggest that peak concentrations of &gt;2-32 µg/mL are typical for standard doses of the drug, therefore we believe the chosen concentration of 2 µg/mL to be physiologically relevant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) As described in line 155, the survival spanned a broad distribution, across a million times in difference. This is rather surprising that 5 days of rifampicin treatment would lead to such a spread in resistance patterns. Did the authors study the different populations to understand this phenomenon? This is important given the scale of resistance developed in this short time.</p></disp-quote><p>We want to clarify that the broad range of survival fraction reflect the difference in tolerant sub-populations but not resistant sub-population to rifampicin as they are determined post rifampicin treatment in rifampicin free media, this has been clarified in the revised figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, the manuscript is a detailed study with new insights into the development of multi-drug resistance by Mtb.
