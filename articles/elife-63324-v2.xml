However, a similar phenotype is not observed under adipocyte-selective deletion (<italic>Nr1d1<sup>Flox2-6</sup>:Adipoq<sup>Cre</sup></italic>), and transcriptional profiling demonstrates that, under basal conditions, direct targets of NR1D1 regulation are limited, and include the circadian clock and collagen dynamics. Under high-fat diet (HFD) feeding, <italic>Nr1d1<sup>Flox2-6</sup>:Adipoq<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice do manifest profound obesity, yet without the accompanying WAT inflammation and fibrosis exhibited by controls. Integration of the WAT NR1D1 cistrome with differential gene expression reveals broad control of metabolic processes by NR1D1 which is unmasked in the obese state. Adipocyte NR1D1 does not drive an anticipatory daily rhythm in WAT lipogenesis, but rather modulates WAT activity in response to alterations in metabolic state. Importantly, NR1D1 action in adipocytes is critical to the development of obesity-related WAT pathology and insulin resistance.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>circadian clock</kwd><kwd>energy metabolism</kwd><kwd>obesity</kwd><kwd>adipose</kwd><kwd>Rev-erb-alpha</kwd><kwd>Rev-erbα</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/I018654/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bechtold</surname><given-names>David A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/N021479/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hunter</surname><given-names>Ann Louise</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/P00279X/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bechtold</surname><given-names>David A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/P011853/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ray</surname><given-names>David W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/P023576/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ray</surname><given-names>David W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>107849/Z/15/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ray</surname><given-names>David W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>107851/Z/15/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ray</surname><given-names>David W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Clock protein NR1D1 regulates white adipose tissue expansion and development of obesity-related pathology.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mammalian circadian clock directs rhythms in behaviour and physiology to coordinate our biology with predictable changes in food availability and daily alternations between fasted and fed states. In this way, profound cycles in nutrient availability and internal energy state can be managed across multiple organ systems. A central circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) drives daily rhythms in our behaviour (e.g. sleep/wake cycles) and physiology (e.g. body temperature), and orchestrates rhythmic processes in tissue systems across the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dibner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">West and Bechtold, 2015</xref>). The molecular clock mechanism is also present in most cell types. The rhythmic transcriptome that defines cells and tissues is shaped by both local tissue clock activity and input from the central clock and rhythmic systemic signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hughes et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kornmann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Koronowski et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lamia et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hunter et al., 2020</xref>). The relative importance of these intrinsic and systemic factors remains ill-defined. Mounting evidence suggests that systemic signalling (e.g. SCN and/or behaviour-driven rhythmicity) is highly dominant in setting daily rhythms, while local clocks serve to buffer tissue/cell responses based on time of day. Nevertheless, it is clear that our rhythmic physiology and metabolic status reflects the interaction of clocks across the brain and body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">West and Bechtold, 2015</xref>). Disturbance of this interaction, as occurs with shift work and irregular eating patterns, is increasingly recognised as a risk factor for metabolic disease and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Broussard and Van Cauter, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kim et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Extensive work over the past 20 years has demonstrated that circadian clock function and its component factors are closely tied into energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bass and Takahashi, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Reinke and Asher, 2019</xref>), with strong rhythmicity evident in cellular and systemic metabolic processes. Clock-metabolic coupling in peripheral tissues is adaptable, as demonstrated by classical food-entrainment studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Damiola et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mistlberger, 1994</xref>), and by recent work showing that systemic perturbations such as cancer and high-fat diet (HFD) feeding can reprogramme circadian control over liver metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dyar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Masri et al., 2016</xref>). Plasticity therefore exists within the system, and the role of the clock in tissue and systemic responses to acute and chronic metabolic perturbation remains a critical question. The nuclear receptor NR1D1 (REVERBα) is a core clock component, and has been highlighted as a key link between the clock and metabolism. NR1D1 is a constitutive repressor, with peak expression in the latter half of the inactive phase (daytime in the nocturnal animal). In liver, NR1D1 exerts repressive control over programmes of lipogenesis by recruiting the NCOR/HDAC3 co-repressor complex to metabolic target genes, such that global loss of NR1D1 or liver-specific deletion of HDAC3 results in hepatosteatosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Feng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>); (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, we recently showed that NR1D1 regulation of hepatic metabolism is state-dependent, with minimal impact under basal conditions yet increased transcriptional influence in response to mistimed feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hunter et al., 2020</xref>). The selective functions of NR1D1 in white adipose tissue (WAT) are not well established and remain poorly understood. Early studies implicated an essential role of <italic>Nr1d1</italic> in adipocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chawla and Lazar, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kumar et al., 2010</xref>); however, these findings are difficult to align with in vivo evidence. Indeed, pronounced adiposity and adipocyte hypertrophy are evident in <italic>Nr1d1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, even under normal feeding conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Delezie et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hand et al., 2015</xref>); (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Daily administration of NR1D1 agonists has also been shown to reduce fat mass and WAT lipogenic gene expression in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Solt et al., 2012</xref>), although these agents do have significant off-target actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dierickx et al., 2019</xref>). Given the links between circadian disruption and obesity, and the potential of NR1D1 as a pharmacological target, we now define the role of NR1D1 in dictating WAT metabolism.</p><p>Transcriptomic and proteomic profiling of WAT in global <italic>Nr1d1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice revealed an expected de-repression of lipid synthesis and storage programmes. However, in contrast, selective deletion of <italic>Nr1d1</italic> in adipocytes did not result in dysregulation of WAT metabolic pathways. Loss of NR1D1 activity in WAT did, however, significantly enhance adipose tissue expansion in response to HFD feeding; yet despite exaggerated obesity, adipocyte-specific knockout (KO) mice were spared the anticipated obesity-related pathology. Integration of transcriptomic data with the WAT NR1D1 cistrome demonstrates that, under basal conditions, NR1D1 activity is limited to a small set of direct target genes (enriched for extracellular matrix [ECM] processes). However, NR1D1 regulatory control broadens to include lipid and mitochondrial metabolism pathways under conditions of obesity. Our data recast the role of NR1D1 as a regulator responsive to the metabolic state of the tissue, rather than one which delivers an anticipatory daily oscillation to the WAT metabolic programme.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Adiposity and up-regulation of WAT lipogenic pathways in <italic>Nr1d1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice</title><p>We first examined the body composition of age-matched <italic>Nr1d1</italic> global KO (<italic>Nr1d1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) mice and littermate controls (wild type [WT]).

Differentially expressed (DE) proteins included influential metabolic enzymes, with up-regulation of metabolic processes detected on pathway enrichment analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Importantly, and in line with the phenotype observed, increased NADPH regeneration (e.g. ME1, G6PDX), enhancement of glucose metabolism (also likely reflecting increased glyceroneogenesis, e.g. PFKL, ALDOA), and up-regulation of fatty acid synthesis (e.g. ACYL, FAS, ACACA) all support a shunt towards synthesis and storage of fatty acids and triglyceride in the KO mice. To validate this putative increase in local lipid synthesis, we quantified fatty acid species in gWAT, and indeed, the ratio of palmitic to linoleic acid (C16:0/C18:2n6), a marker of de novo lipogenesis, was significantly elevated in <italic>Nr1d1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Fatty acid profiling also revealed evidence of increased SCD1 activity (C16:1 n-7/C16:0). Enhanced fatty acid synthesis in gWAT of mice lacking NR1D1 may be in part driven by increased glucose availability and adipose tissue uptake as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Delezie et al., 2012</xref>), although we do not observe elevated blood glucose levels in the <italic>Nr1d1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>).

Global <italic>Nr1d1</italic> deletion had a large effect on the gWAT transcriptome, with 4163 genes showing significant differential expression (FDR¡0.05) between <italic>Nr1d1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice and age- and weight-matched WT littermate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Taken together, our data suggest that under a basal metabolic state, the adipose transcriptional targets under direct NR1D1 control are in fact limited to core clock function and collagen dynamics. NR1D1 is not a major repressor of lipid metabolism in this setting.

To test this, <italic>Nr1d1<sup>Flox2-6</sup>:Adipoq<sup>Cre</sup></italic> and <italic>Nr1d1<sup>Flox2-6</sup></italic> mice were provided with HFD for 16 weeks to drive obesity and WAT expansion.

Of note, divergence between control and <italic>Nr1d1<sup>Flox2-6</sup>:Adipoq<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice became clear only after long-term HFD feeding (beyond 13 weeks), a time at which body weight gain plateaus in control mice.

The stark difference in progression and severity of diet-induced obesity is likely due (at least in part) to the HFD-induced hyperphagia, which is observed in <italic>Nr1d1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (WT food intake 2.92±0.10 g HFD/day/mouse; KO 3.74±0.21 g, p=0.0014, Student’s t-test, n=21/genotype), but not in <italic>Nr1d1<sup>Flox2-6</sup>:Adipoq<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice (Cre<sup>-ve</sup> 2.99±0.61 g HFD/day/mouse; Cre<sup>+ve</sup> 3.01±0.60 g, p&gt;0.05, n=8/genotype). Nevertheless, both models highlight that loss of NR1D1 increases capacity for increased lipid storage and adipose tissue expansion under obesogenic conditions. Despite the enhanced diet-induced obesity, HFD-fed <italic>Nr1d1<sup>Flox2-6</sup>:Adipoq<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice showed little evidence of typical obesity-related pathology.

We next used this NR1D1 cistrome to define the relationship between direct chromatin binding and altered gene expression under different genetic and/or dietary challenge. For this, we employed a custom Python script that calculates the enrichment of DE gene sets in spatial relation to identified transcription factor binding sites, over all genes in the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Briggs et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hunter et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yang et al., 2019</xref>).

Extending out from NR1D1 ChIP-seq peaks by increasing distances (λ), we found transcription start sites (TSSs) of genes up-regulated in <italic>Nr1d1<sup>Flox2-6</sup>:Adipoq<sup>Cre</sup></italic> and <italic>Nr1d1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> gWAT to be significantly enriched (above all genes in the genome) at distances up to 100 kbp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This is consistent with repression mediated directly by DNA-bound NR1D1 and strongly suggests that this gene cluster (clock and collagen genes) represents direct targets of NR1D1 repression in WAT under NC conditions. In contrast, no enrichment of genes with decreased expression in <italic>Nr1d1<sup>Flox2-6</sup>:Adipoq<sup>Cre</sup></italic> or <italic>Nr1d1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> WAT was evident at any distance from NR1D1 peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Thus, NR1D1 activation of transcription involves a different mechanism of regulation, likely involving secondary or indirect mechanisms (e.g. de-repression of another repressor), as previously proposed to explain NR1D1 transactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Le Martelot et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>HFD -feeding of <italic>Nr1d1<sup>Flox2-6</sup>:Adipoq<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice greatly increased the overlap of DE genes with those DE in <italic>Nr1d1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> WAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

Thus, this integration of transcriptome and cistrome profiling suggests that these commonly up-regulated genes represent direct NR1D1 targets unmasked by the abnormal environment of obese adipose, and that NR1D1’s exertion of direct repressive control is dependent on metabolic state.</p><p>Consistent with the healthier metabolic phenotype observed in obese <italic>Nr1d1<sup>Flox2-6</sup>:Adipoq<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice, we found that the large majority of the 863 NR1D1 gene targets unmasked by HFD feeding are normally repressed in obesity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), with 551 (63.8%) showing a significant down-regulation in obese control (Cre<sup>-ve</sup>) animals (chronic HFD compared to NC-fed state). Furthermore, 495 of these genes were found to lie within 100 kbp of a NR1D1 binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). These genes include important regulators of lipid and mitochondrial metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>) – including <italic>Fasn, Scd1, Acsl1, Cs</italic> – and FGF-21 co-receptor <italic>Klb</italic>, a previously identified NR1D1 target gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jager et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, obesity-dependent de-repression of these genes was also observed in isolated mature adipocytes (MA) collected from NC or HFD-fed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). This provides further evidence that they are regulated by adipocyte NR1D1, and that this regulation is direct.</p><p>Considered together, these findings suggest that the healthy adiposity phenotype in HFD-fed <italic>Nr1d1<sup>Flox2-6</sup>:Adipoq<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice results from de-repression of NR1D1-controlled adipocyte pathways which allow continued and efficient lipid synthesis and storage, thus permitting greater expansion of the adipose bed, and attenuation of obesity-related dysfunction.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We set out to define the role of NR1D1 in the regulation of WAT metabolism and subsequently reveal a new understanding of NR1D1 function. Together, our data show NR1D1 to be a state-dependent regulator of WAT metabolism, with its widespread repressive action only unmasked by diet-induced obesity. Surprisingly, <italic>Nr1d1</italic> expression in WAT appears to limit the energy-buffering function of the tissue. This finding parallels our recent work in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hunter et al., 2020</xref>). Hepatic-selective loss of NR1D1 carries no metabolic consequence, with NR1D1-dependent control over hepatic energy metabolism revealed only upon altered feeding conditions. Contrary to current understanding, our findings therefore suggest that NR1D1 (and potentially other components of the peripheral clock) does not impose rhythmic repression of metabolic circuits under basal conditions but rather determines tissue responses to altered metabolic state. As reported previously by us and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Delezie et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hand et al., 2015</xref>), global deletion of <italic>Nr1d1</italic> leads to an increase in lipogenesis, adipose tissue expansion, and an exaggerated response to diet-induced obesity. How the loss of NR1D1 specifically in WAT contributes to this phenotype has not previously been addressed. Here, we use proteomic, transcriptomic, and lipid profiling studies to show a clear bias towards fatty acid synthesis and triglyceride storage within <italic>Nr1d1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> WAT. Adipocyte-targeted deletion of <italic>Nr1d1</italic> reveals only a modest phenotype, and a relatively selective set of gene targets, limited to clock processes and collagen dynamics. These genes are concurrently de-regulated in <italic>Nr1d1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> adipose, and are found in proximity to NR1D1 binding sites, strongly implicating them as direct targets of NR1D1 repressive activity.</p><p>The reduced inflammation seen in obese <italic>Nr1d1<sup>Flox2-6</sup>:Adipoq<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice is likely multifactorial, but may be secondary to a reduction in the pro-inflammatory free fatty acid pool, resulting from de-repression of lipogenic and mitochondrial metabolism pathways, or the absence of signals from dead/dying adipocytes. It is of note that improved metabolic flexibility is beneficial in other mouse models of metabolic disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jonker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Virtue et al., 2018</xref>) and in human obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aucouturier et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Begaye et al., 2020</xref>). Whilst the clock has been linked to ECM remodelling in other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dudek et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sherratt et al., 2019</xref>), where it is thought to coordinate ECM dynamics, collagen turnover, and secretory processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2020</xref>), we now identify ECM as a direct target of adipose NR1D1 action; altered regulation of WAT collagen production and modification likely contributing to the rapid and continued adipose tissue expansion observed in <italic>Nr1d1</italic>-targeted adipose. The diminished adipose fibrosis seen in <italic>Nr1d1<sup>Flox2-6</sup>:Adipoq<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice may well reflect alteration in multiple processes, some of which may be under direct/indirect NR1D1 control. Adipose-specific deletion of <italic>Nr1d1</italic> thus provides a unique model to explore the complex ECM responses which accompany obesity-related tissue hypertrophy and development of fibrosis.</p><p>A role for the clock in the regulation of WAT function has been reported in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barnea et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Paschos et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shostak et al., 2013</xref>), perhaps implying that it is the rhythmicity conferred by the clock which is important for WAT metabolism. However, despite robust rhythms of clock genes persisting, rhythmic gene expression in gWAT is largely attenuated following genetic disruption of SCN function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kolbe et al., 2016</xref>). This supports the alternative notion that an intact local clock is not the primary driver of rhythmic peripheral tissue metabolism. Indeed, metabolic processes, including lipid biosynthesis, were highly enriched in the cohort of SCN-dependent rhythmic genes from this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kolbe et al., 2016</xref>), implying that feeding behaviour and WAT responses to energy flux are more important than locally generated rhythmicity for adipose function.</p><p>The modest impact of adipose-selective <italic>Nr1d1</italic> deletion is both at odds with the large effect of global <italic>Nr1d1</italic> deletion, and with the extensive WAT cistrome we have identified for NR1D1. This suggests that the tissue-specific actions of NR1D1 are necessary, but not sufficient, and require additional regulation from the metabolic state. Although not explored to the same extent, a lipogenic phenotype of liver-specific RORα/γ deletion has previously been shown to be unmasked by HFD feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). By driving adipose tissue hypertrophy through HFD feeding of the <italic>Nr1d1<sup>Flox2-6</sup>:Adipoq<sup>Cre</sup></italic>, we observed a stark difference in the adipose phenotype of targeted mice and littermate controls. WAT tissue lacking <italic>Nr1d1</italic> showed significantly increased tissue expansion, but little evidence of normal obesity-related pathology (tissue fibrosis and immune cell infiltration/inflammation). Genes controlling mitochondrial activity, lipogenesis, and lipid storage were relatively spared from the obesity-related down-regulation observed in control mouse tissue, and were associated with the WAT NR1D1 cistrome. Thus, in response to HFD feeding, NR1D1 acts to repress metabolic activity in the adipocyte and limit tissue expansion (albeit at the eventual cost of tissue dysfunction, inflammation, and development of adipose fibrosis).</p><p>The broadening of NR1D1’s regulatory influence in response to obesity likely reflects a change to the chromatin environment in which NR1D1 operates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>). The majority of emergent NR1D1 target genes are repressed in obese adipose when <italic>Nr1d1</italic> expression is intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). As these genes are not de-repressed by <italic>Nr1d1</italic> loss in normal adipose, NR1D1 activity must be redundant or ineffective in a ‘basal’ metabolic state. Subsequent emergence of NR1D1’s transcriptional control may reflect alterations in chromatin accessibility or organisation, and/or the presence of transcriptional repressors and accessory factors required for full activity. As NR1D1 is itself proposed to regulate enhancer-promoter loop formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kim et al., 2018</xref>), modulation of <italic>Nr1d1</italic> expression would be a further important variable here. Such reshaping of the regulatory landscape likely occurs across tissues, and may explain why, with metabolic challenge, emergent circadian rhythmicity is observed in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eckel-Mahan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kinouchi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tognini et al., 2017</xref>), and in circulating and tissue metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dyar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eckel-Mahan et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Here, we now uncover a role for NR1D1 in limiting the energy-buffering role of WAT, a discovery which may present therapeutic opportunity as we cope with an epidemic of human obesity. Despite recent findings which have cast doubt on the utility of some of the small molecule NR1D1 ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dierickx et al., 2019</xref>), antagonising WAT NR1D1 now emerges as a potential target in metabolic disease.

Quality and integrity of the RNA samples were assessed using a 2200 TapeStation (Agilent Technologies) and then libraries generated using the TruSeq Stranded mRNA assay (Illumina, Inc) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, total RNA (0.1–4 μg) was used as input material from which polyadenylated mRNA was purified using poly-T, oligo-attached, magnetic beads. The mRNA was then fragmented using divalent cations under elevated temperature and then reverse-transcribed into first strand cDNA using random primers. Second strand cDNA was then synthesised using DNA Polymerase I and RNase H. Following a single ‘A’ base addition, adapters were ligated to the cDNA fragments, and the products then purified and enriched by PCR to create the final cDNA library. Adapter indices were used to multiplex libraries, which were pooled prior to cluster generation using a cBot instrument.

By using an adipose-specific REVERBa knockout mouse model, the authors describe a metabolic phenotype distinct from that previously reported in a global model. Convincing data is presented supporting a role for REVERBa in regulating the circadian clock and collagen dynamics, the latter of which was not previously recognized. The authors further show that loss of adipose REVERBa leads to healthy adipose expandability with added systemic metabolic benefit. Overall, the results supporting a broader role for REVERBa to include lipid and mitochondrial metabolic pathways in the context of obesity are of interest. However, the reviewers also identified a number of areas where the current data do not fully support the conclusions drawn.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors are encouraged to provide mechanistic insights detailing altered REVERBa repressive activity upon high fat-feeding. Is activity of REVERBa physiologically regulated in response to HFD, e.g., by altered post-translational modifications and/or by altered co-repressor complex interactions? Also, is adipose REVERBa expression by itself affected during obesity?</p><p>2) Prior publications have shown that the metabolic gene regulation mediated by REVERBa tends to also involve HDAC3. They should consider further mechanistic studies of REVERBa and HDAC3 in this mouse line.</p><p>3) One major issue with this study is the lack of cellular specificity. The authors generate mice with an adipocyte-specific knockout of REVERBa, but then do RNA-seq of the entire gonadal fat pad. Since only about 50% of the cells in the tissue are adipocytes, there is thus no way to know whether the gene expression changes seen are due to direct loss of REVERBa in adipocytes or secondary effects on other cell types within adipose tissue. The authors could partly address this concern by either (a) fractionating adipose tissue into mature adipocytes and stromal vascular fraction to verify which cell types are demonstrating the expression changes or (b) isolating SVF from control and adipocyte-specific knockout animals and differentiating them in vitro to determine cell intrinsic effects of REVERBa deletion.</p><p>4) The lack of specificity also becomes an issue with the analyses done in Figure 6 in which they have overlaid their RNA-Seq data with previously published ChIP-seq data. They then use bioinformatics to predict which genes are direct targets of REVERBa. This analysis would be strengthened if they first knew which of their transcriptional changes represented expression differences in adipocytes and if they then either did their own ChIP-seq study or at least validated some candidate genes by ChIP-PCR to actually confirm REVERBa binding.</p><p>5) In Figure 3, the authors highlight that adipocyte-specific knockout of REVERBa results in increased collagen gene expression (Figure 3). However, on a high fat diet, mutant animals actually have decreased fibrosis. How do the authors explain this seeming contradiction? At a minimum, they should measure the same panel of collagen genes they propose to be regulated by REVERBa to see if they are altered in high fat fed gWAT.</p><p>6) Some of the claims made on the metabolic phenotyping are overstatements:</p><p>a) The data presented on acute cold exposure and REVERBb compensation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes are not at all sufficient to claim that the phenotypes seen here are not due to effects in brown fat or due to compensatory action by REVERBb.</p><p>b) Isolated sections with F4/80 alone are not sufficient to make a broad claim about inflammation. This would be more convincing if supported by flow cytometry data and inflammatory gene expression.</p><p>c) The legend for Figure 4 says that mutant mice have &quot;greater insulin sensitivity&quot;. However, the curves in Figure 4F look very similar. Moreover, they calculate the area within the curve. I am not sure if they mean the area under the curve, which is more typically done, but this is confusing and needs to be clarified.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.63324.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Hunter et al., identifies a dominant metabolic role for REVERBa in adipose tissue.

As outlined below, we have added new data, analyses, and discussion to further support the main conclusions of the paper. Specifically, we have now undertaken and present: (i) HaloNR1D1 ChIP-seq studies; (ii) assessment of gene expression in mature adipocytes isolated from gWAT of NC- and HFD-fed mice; (iii) additional characterisation of energy expenditure in <italic>Nr1d1<sup>Flox2-6</sup>:Adipoq<sup>Cre</sup></italic> and <italic>Nr1d1<sup>Flox2-6</sup> </italic>mice; (iv) additional characterisation of immune/inflammation-related processes in the HFD-fed mice, and (v) extended analyses of relevant published datasets.</p><p>Overall, our studies demonstrate that NR1D1 (REVERBα) is highly influential over the adipose tissue response to high-fat diet (HFD) feeding, and the development of obesity-related pathology. Underlying this is a repression of metabolic function in response to chronic over-nutrition, which is mitigated upon genetic targeting of <italic>Nr1d1</italic>. Integration of RNA-seq and ChIP-seq studies indicates that these effects are due in large part to direct repressive action of NR1D1. Metabolic genes which are shut down in obese adipose show significant enrichment at sites of NR1D1 chromatin binding, and are significantly up-regulated in <italic>Nr1d1<sup>Flox2-6</sup>:Adipoq<sup>Cre</sup></italic> adipose.

Thus, NR1D1 has the potential to regulate a broad programme of gene expression, linked to widespread chromatin binding, but this does not occur in the basal state. It is only revealed under a state of obesity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors are encouraged to provide mechanistic insights detailing altered REVERBa repressive activity upon high fat-feeding.

To this end, we have undertaken additional studies, including the generation of a novel, antibody-independent NR1D1 cistrome in adipose tissue, transcriptional analyses in mature adipocytes under normal and obese conditions, assessment of NR1D1 expression under chow and HFD-fed conditions, and additional integration with published literature (these additions are discussed in detail below). Overall, these data suggest that altered NR1D1 expression and/or interaction with co-repressors <italic>per se</italic> is unlikely to explain the emergence of increased repressive influence by NR1D1 under conditions of obesity.</p><p>NR1D1 expression. In our studies, we find a large effect of NR1D1 loss in obese adipose, which we do not see in the basal state. This is important, as it suggests that NR1D1 repressive activity increases in obesity. However, as we and others have shown, <italic>Nr1d1</italic> gene expression is consistently decreased in white adipose tissue following long-term HFD feeding in mice (e.g. Cunningham et al., 2016). This was similarly observed in our RNA-seq studies in the current work (<italic>Nr1d1</italic> expression showing log fold-change of -1.56 between HFD- and NC-fed <italic>Nr1d1<sup>Flox2-6</sup></italic> adipose, FDR 1.19E-06). Therefore, increased <italic>Nr1d1</italic> gene expression cannot explain the increased influence of the nuclear receptor in the obese state. To examine whether there is a similar impact of chronic HFD-feeding on NR1D1 protein expression, we undertook Western blot analyses following 16 weeks of NC or HFD-feeding (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Here, we similarly find no evidence of increased protein expression in obese gWAT. We therefore have no evidence that NR1D1 is expressed more highly in WAT of obese animal.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Western blot (top panel) showing NR1D1 protein expression in NC and HFD gWAT.</title><p>Corresponding Ponceau stain (bottom panel).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-63324-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Altered mode of action. DNA binding and subsequent repressive activity of NR1D1 involves two key mechanisms: firstly by competing with the ROR transcriptional activators at ROR-elements (ROREs; Forman et al., 1994), and secondly by recruiting co-repressors NCOR and HDAC3 to sites of NR1D1 binding at RevDR2 elements or co-located RORE motifs (Phelan et al., 2010; Zamir et al., 1996, 1997). Our new HaloNR1D1 cistrome reveals widespread chromatin binding in gWAT under basal state conditions (i.e. NC-fed mice), and significant enrichment of both RORE and RevDR2 motifs at NR1D1 binding sites. Classic examples of these two repressive mechanisms include clock genes <italic>Arntl (Bmal1)</italic> and <italic>Nfil3</italic>. NR1D1 repression of the core clock gene <italic>Arntl</italic> is mediated through the binding of NR1D1 to two closely situated RORE motifs in the <italic>Arntl</italic> promoter (Preitner et al., 2002; Yin and Lazar, 2005). By contrast, NR1D1 repression of clock gene <italic>Nfil3</italic> (<italic>E4bp4</italic>) likely occurs by antagonization of ROR transactivation, with NR1D1 binding a promoter-located RORE motif as a monomer (Duez et al., 2008). In our studies, we observe significant de-repression of both <italic>Arntl</italic> and <italic>Nfil3</italic> under both NC and obese conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>). This suggests that both modes of NR1D1 repressive activity are evident in the basal (NC) state, and does not support an alteration in the functioning of NR1D1 in the obese state. Whilst it would be of interest to investigate whether there are more subtle differences in the NR1D1 protein under normal and obese conditions, studying the native NR1D1 protein is very challenging due to poor sensitivity of NR1D1 antibodies. We believe that such studies are beyond the scope of this current work.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Gene expression (mean +/- SEM of raw counts) of core clock genes Arntl and Nfil3 in bulk gWAT RNA-seq from NC- or HFD-fed Nr1d1<sup>Flox2-6</sup>:Adipoq<sup>Cre</sup> mice and Nr1d1<sup>Flox2-6</sup>controls.</title><p>A significant difference (FDR&lt;0.05) between genotypes is detected for each comparison.

The initial version of our manuscript made use of an existing NR1D1 cistrome (taken from Zhang et al., 2015), with stringent peak-calling parameters applied. Stringent criteria were applied because, as we have shown ourselves, overlap between antibody-dependent NR1D1 cistromes is limited, likely reflecting poor antibody sensitivity and specificity (Hunter et al., 2020). However, we have now been able to profile the gWAT NR1D1 cistrome in an antibody-independent manner, and thus substantially add to this study. We have used <italic>HaloNr1d1</italic> mice which express (at the endogenous <italic>Nr1d1</italic> locus) NR1D1 protein with a HaloTag fused to its N-terminus. HaloNR1D1 demonstrates normal DNA-binding domain function (no de-repression of NR1D1 target genes is seen in <italic>HaloNr1d1</italic> tissue), and <italic>HaloNr1d1</italic> mice show normal fertility, behaviour, and body composition (Hunter et al., 2020). By performing HaloNR1D1 ChIP-seq in gWAT collected from <italic>HaloNr1d1</italic> mice at ZT8 (peak NR1D1 genomic recruitment), and calling peaks against two control libraries (WT ZT8, <italic>HaloNr1d1</italic> ZT20), we mapped a NR1D1 cistrome of over 4,000 binding sites (Figure 6A).</p><p>Therefore, under basal conditions, the NR1D1 cistrome is far broader than the limited effects of <italic>Nr1d1</italic> deletion would suggest. To support a functional role for this broad cistrome, we looked for evidence that the cistrome correlates with NR1D1 regulation of gene expression (Figure 6B,C). We examined the relationship between NR1D1 binding sites and the genes affected by <italic>Nr1d1</italic> deletion, under both NC and HFD conditions, and looked for associations that are more significant than would occur by chance (i.e. that might occur for any gene in the genome). We did not see any association between NR1D1 binding sites and genes down-regulated with NR1D1 loss, in keeping with NR1D1’s constitutive repressor function, and supporting the specificity of our analysis. Importantly, we did see strong associations between NR1D1 binding sites and genes up-regulated with NR1D1 loss, not only in the basal (NC-fed) state, but under HFD conditions also. This suggests that NR1D1 has the potential to regulate a broad programme of gene expression, but this does not occur in the basal state. We propose that, in the basal state, chromatin organisation and the action of other transcriptional regulators combine to make NR1D1 repressive activity redundant. In the perturbed, obese state, rewiring of the regulatory landscape serves to make NR1D1 repression important. Exploration of this hypothesis is intended for ongoing and future studies. There is supportive data, however, from studies which demonstrate chromatin alterations in obese adipose (Roh et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2018), and studies in mouse liver which have shown remodelling of the gene regulatory environment in response to high-fat diet (Dyar et al., 2018; Quagliarini et al., 2019).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Prior publications have shown that the metabolic gene regulation mediated by REVERBa tends to also involve HDAC3. They should consider further mechanistic studies of REVERBa and HDAC3 in this mouse line.</p></disp-quote><p>One of the mechanisms of NR1D1-mediated repression is indeed recruitment of the NCOR/HDAC3 co-repressor complex. An earlier report suggested that NR1D1 represses distinct programmes of genes (most notably core clock-related versus metabolic genes) through different mechanisms (Zhang et al., 2015). Specifically, this report suggested that NR1D1 repression of clock genes involved direct binding to DNA, whereas repression of metabolic genes was accomplished by tethering to lineage-determining factors (e.g. HNF6 in liver). This theory stemmed from experiments performed in the <italic>Nr1d1<sup>DBDm</sup></italic> mouse, a conditional transgenic model expressing a DNA-binding domain mutant form of NR1D1. We have shown that the <italic>Nr1d1<sup>DBDm</sup></italic> mouse is a phenocopy of the <italic>Nr1d1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse (Hunter et al., 2020); ie. it is not spared the metabolic abnormalities observed in the global knockout model. Furthermore, in HaloNR1D1 ChIP-seq in liver, there is no enrichment of lineage-determining factor motifs above and beyond what would be expected at any sites of open chromatin (Hunter et al., 2020). As we now also observe in our adipose HaloNR1D1 ChIP-seq (employing dual-crosslinking to maximise capture of any tethered interactions), the RORE and RevDR2 motifs are by far the dominant transcription factor binding motifs underlying NR1D1 DNA binding. Therefore, NR1D1 repression requires DNA-binding, and as such, may be mediated through competition with RORs, not only through NCOR/HDAC3 recruitment.</p><p>Existing evidence suggests that NCOR and HDAC3 activity extends far beyond NR1D1 action (Feng et al., 2011; Ferrari et al., 2017; Li et al., 2011), with these factors having wide-ranging repressive activity, including of critical metabolic regulators such as PPARγ. In further support is our report that, in liver, we find substantial overlap between NR1D1, HDAC3, and NCOR cistromes, but also large numbers of sites bound by only one of these factors (Hunter et al., 2020). We have been interested to examine HDAC3 activity in adipose, but HDAC3 does not directly bind the genome, thus HDAC3 ChIP has proven challenging (we attempted this in response to reviewer/editor feedback, but without success). We can use removal of the H3K27ac mark as a proxy measure of HDAC3 activity however (Nguyen et al., 2020). Here, we do see removal of the H3K27ac mark at NR1D1 binding sites (adipocyte H3K27ac ChIP-seq data taken from Roh et al., 2020) under both NC and HFD-feeding conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref>), at both established NR1D1 targets, and at NR1D1 targets unmasked by obesity. This suggests that altered interaction between NR1D1 and HDAC3/NCOR is not the driving factor in increased NR1D1 repression in obese mice, although we cannot exclude this possibility with current data. Given that NR1D1 does not mediate gene repression exclusively through HDAC3, and that HDAC3 does not interact exclusively with NR1D1, we believe that pursuing extensive, technically difficult studies of HDAC3-NR1D1 interaction state under different chronic feeding conditions is beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p><fig id="respfig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Adipocyte H3K27ac ChIP-seq signal, collected in NC (top row) and HFD (middle row) conditions, aligned with adipose HaloNR1D1 ChIP-seq signal (bottom row).</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-63324-resp-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) One major issue with this study is the lack of cellular specificity. The authors generate mice with an adipocyte-specific knockout of REVERBa, but then do RNA-seq of the entire gonadal fat pad. Since only about 50% of the cells in the tissue are adipocytes, there is thus no way to know whether the gene expression changes seen are due to direct loss of REVERBa in adipocytes or secondary effects on other cell types within adipose tissue. The authors could partly address this concern by either (a) fractionating adipose tissue into mature adipocytes and stromal vascular fraction to verify which cell types are demonstrating the expression changes or (b) isolating SVF from control and adipocyte-specific knockout animals and differentiating them in vitro to determine cell intrinsic effects of REVERBa deletion.</p></disp-quote><p>We recognise that this is a critical question, and have undertaken additional experiments and analyses to address this. Undoubtedly, gene expression changes observed on bulk analyses reflect effects across all adipose cell types. Therefore, as suggested by the reviewers, we have now completed an adipose tissue fractionation study, in which <italic>Nr1d1<sup>Flox2-6</sup>:Adipoq<sup>Cre</sup></italic> and <italic>Nr1d1<sup>Flox2-6</sup> </italic>mice were maintained on HFD or NC for 16 weeks, with subsequent isolation of mature adipocytes from freshly-collected gWAT. This method (adapted from Collins et al., 2010) clearly separated a population of adiponectin (<italic>Adipoq</italic>)-expressing mature adipocytes from the remaining stromal vascular fraction. These studies (now included in Figure 6 Supplemental) provide strong support for the conclusions drawn from the whole tissue RNA-seq (regarding lack of differential gene expression under NC conditions, and unmasking of differential gene expression with chronic HFD feeding in the adipocyte knockout mice). Specifically, we assessed expression of 7 genes, all of which show up-regulation in <italic>Nr1d1<sup>Flox2-6</sup>:Adipoq<sup>Cre</sup></italic>gWAT under HFD but not NC conditions in bulk RNA-seq, and which all have a TSS within 100kbp of a NR1D1 ChIP-seq peak (Figure 6SD). In line with our previous studies, we saw no between-genotype differences in any of these genes in mature adipocytes isolated from NC-fed mice. In contrast, mature adipocytes isolated from HFD-fed mice showed a pronounced up-regulation in <italic>Nr1d1<sup>Flox2-6</sup>:Adipoq<sup>Cre</sup></italic> samples (compared to control HFD-fed mice), strongly suggesting that there is an effect specific to adipocyte gene expression with adipocyte-targeted <italic>Nr1d1</italic> deletion. These results are described on lines 308-311 of the main manuscript.</p><p>Recent data from the literature also reveal a major impact of chronic HFD-feeding on the adipocyte transcriptome. In their recent study, Evan Rosen’s group (Roh et al., 2020) used the NuTRAP reporter to profile adipocyte-specific gene expression and H3K27 acetylation in NC and HFD-fed mice. We have analysed the raw RNA-seq data from this paper and compared it with our bulk adipose RNA-seq data. In line with our original conclusions, genes commonly (adipocyte and whole tissue) up-regulated by HFD-feeding are strongly enriched for immune pathways, whilst down-regulated genes enrich for lipid and mitochondrial metabolism pathways (<xref ref-type="table" rid="resptable1">Author response table 1</xref>). Overall, these data reinforce our earlier conclusions that metabolic pathways are shut down in adipocytes in response to long-term HFD feeding, and that genetic targeting of <italic>Nr1d1</italic> expression in adipocytes mitigates this effect.</p><table-wrap id="resptable1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><caption><title>ReactomePA pathway analysis for genes commonly dysregulated by HFD (FDR&lt;0.05, HFD vs NC) in our study, and an adipocyte-only RNA-seq study.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Top 5 ReactomePA pathways (by gene count) for 749 genes up-regulated by HFD in both our data (Cre-) and Roh et al. adipocyte-only RNA-seq:</th><th/><th/><th/><th/><th/></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>ID</td><td>Description</td><td>GeneRatio</td><td>BgRatio</td><td>p.adjust</td><td>Count</td></tr><tr><td>R-MMU-168256</td><td>Immune System</td><td>463/438</td><td>1691/8733</td><td>1.90E-16</td><td>163</td></tr><tr><td>R-MMU-168249</td><td>Innate Immune System</td><td>108/438</td><td>911/8733</td><td>5.32E-16</td><td>108</td></tr><tr><td>R-MMU-109582</td><td>Hemostasis</td><td>70/438</td><td>505/8733</td><td>4.92E-13</td><td>70</td></tr><tr><td>R-MMU-1280218</td><td>Adaptive Immune System</td><td>65/438</td><td>667/8733</td><td>5.89E-06</td><td>65</td></tr><tr><td>R-MMU-6798695</td><td>Neutrophil degranulation</td><td>62/438</td><td>514/8733</td><td>6.32E-09</td><td>62</td></tr><tr><td>Top 5 ReactomePA pathways (by gene count) for 826 genes down-regulated by HFD in both our data (Cre-) and Roh et al., adipocyte-only RNA-seq:</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>ID</td><td>Description</td><td>GeneRatio</td><td>BgRatio</td><td>p.adjust</td><td>Count</td></tr><tr><td>R-MMU-1430728</td><td>Metabolism</td><td>177/421</td><td>1727/8733</td><td>4.85E-24</td><td>177</td></tr><tr><td>R-MMU-556833</td><td>Metabolism of lipids</td><td>52/421</td><td>594/8733</td><td>0.000992</td><td>52</td></tr><tr><td>R-MMU-1428517</td><td>The citric acid (TCA) cycle and respiratory electron transport</td><td>37/421</td><td>143/8733</td><td>3.61E-15</td><td>37</td></tr><tr><td>R-MMU-71291</td><td>Metabolism of amino acids and derivatives</td><td>33/421</td><td>247/8733</td><td>9.30E-06</td><td>33</td></tr><tr><td>R-MMU-8978868</td><td>Fatty acid metabolism</td><td>25/421</td><td>172/8733</td><td>5.83E-05</td><td>25</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Unfortunately, these events cannot be easily addressed in primary differentiated adipocyte cultures.

Here, a set of candidate genes were chosen which (i) showed differential regulation in bulk adipose RNA-seq under HFD- but not NC-fed conditions; and (ii) were in close proximity to a HaloNR1D1 ChIP peak. Profiling gene expression in these adipocyte fractions confirmed both the absence of de-repression under the NC-feeding state, as well as an enhanced expression of target genes under HFD-feeding conditions in the <italic>Nr1d1<sup>Flox2-6</sup>:Adipoq<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In Figure 3, the authors highlight that adipocyte-specific knockout of REVERBa results in increased collagen gene expression (Figure 3). However, on a high fat diet, mutant animals actually have decreased fibrosis. How do the authors explain this seeming contradiction? At a minimum, they should measure the same panel of collagen genes they propose to be regulated by REVERBa to see if they are altered in high fat fed gWAT.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for any lack of clarity in the original manuscript regarding the potential role of NR1D1 in regulating collagen and extracellular matrix dynamics. Our data strongly suggest that several collagen genes and collagen modifying enzymes are direct targets of NR1D1 repressive activity in gWAT. This is based on increased gene expression in the <italic>Nr1d1<sup>Flox2-6</sup>:Adipoq<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice compared to <italic>Nr1d1<sup>Flox2-6</sup></italic> controlled (Figure 3F), as well as close proximity of de-repressed genes to NR1D1 ChIP peaks (for example, on simple nearest-gene annotation with HOMER, the genes <italic>Col1a1, Col5a3, Col6a1, Col6a2, Col18a1, Loxl4</italic> are found adjacent to NR1D1 peaks). These altered ECM dynamics may facilitate adipocyte/adipose tissue expansion under HFD-feeding conditions (discussed more below). However, this is likely to be quite a different process than the development of pronounced tissue fibrosis in the control animals under chronic HFD-feeding conditions.</p><p>The development of obesity-related WAT fibrosis is a complex process, with remodelling of the extracellular matrix (involving both collagen synthesis and breakdown) and contribution from both resident and infiltrating immune cells. Moreover, the fibrotic state of a tissue cannot be judged simply on collagen gene expression. The virtual absence of gWAT fibrosis in the HFD-fed mice lacking <italic>Nr1d1</italic> expression in adipocytes is most likely a reflection of an attenuated inflammatory response and reduced adipocyte dysfunction in comparison to obese control animals. Indeed, under a pathological obese state, a major contribution to collagen production, modification and fibril deposition would come from non-adipocyte cells (where NR1D1 activity is intact).</p><p>As suggested, we have measured the same panel of collagen genes in HFD gWAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4</xref>), and find that obesity does modulate observed patterns of gene expression. Even in this limited examination, some important differences remain (such as the reduced induction of <italic>Col6a3</italic> in response to chronic HFD-feeding in the adipocyte knockout mice). <italic>Col6a3</italic> has been associated with obesity, and obesity-related WAT inflammation and fibrosis in both animal models and humans (Khan et al., 2009; Pasarica et al., 2009; Sun et al., 2014).</p><fig id="respfig4"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>Collagen gene expression in gWAT, as measured by qPCR.</title><p>2-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparison tests. *P&lt;0.05, **P&lt;0.01.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-63324-resp-fig4-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Moreover, inspection of the RNA-seq data shows significant reduction in expression of numerous matrix metalloproteinase genes (e.g. <italic>Mmp2, Mmp14, Mmp23, Mmp27</italic>) (<bold>Figure 5 Source Data File 1 – “Figure 5B_edgeR_HFD_Cre+vsCre-sigDN” tab</bold>) in control HFD-fed samples compared to equivalent knockout samples, which suggests that ECM remodelling activity is different between the two genotypes. The same data show altered expression of fibulin and fibrillin genes between genotypes in the HFD state, indicating that the extracellular microfibrillar network is likely impacted as well.</p><p>Therefore, it is not contradictory to find that certain collagen genes are targets of NR1D1 repressive activity, but that <italic>Nr1d1</italic>-targeted adipose is less susceptible to fibrosis. Instead, the reduced fibrosis reflects differences in numerous processes, some of which are under direct NR1D1 control, and others which are indirectly affected by <italic>Nr1d1</italic> deletion. We have now added further comment on this subject in the manuscript text (lines 346-348).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Some of the claims made on the metabolic phenotyping are overstatements:</p><p>a) The data presented on acute cold exposure and REVERBb compensation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes are not at all sufficient to claim that the phenotypes seen here are not due to effects in brown fat or due to compensatory action by REVERBb.</p></disp-quote><p>The key phenotypic finding revealed in our study is that loss of NR1D1 in adipocytes increases adipose tissue expansion in response to HFD-feeding. Therefore, it may be hypothesised that a decrease in energy expenditure and/or reduced thermogenesis could contribute to this phenotype. However, we and others have shown that daily mean energy expenditure and body temperature are not significantly altered in either the adipocyte-specific or the global <italic>Nr1d1</italic> knockout line (Delezie et al., 2012; Hand et al., 2015). Moreover, in our original manuscript, we demonstrate that daily body temperature profiles are not different between adipocyte-specific <italic>Nr1d1</italic> knockout mice under normal temperature, thermoneutral (~28-29°C), and cold-challenge conditions. These studies under different ambient temperature environments would be expected to reveal any major differences in inherent (thermoneutral) or stimulated brown adipose tissue (BAT) activity. We now also include assessment of metabolic gas exchange in <italic>Nr1d1<sup>Flox2-6</sup>:Adipoq<sup>Cre</sup></italic> and <italic>Nr1d1<sup>Flox2-6</sup></italic> mice, which similarly shows no change in energy expenditure between the two genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig5">Author response image 5</xref>). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that altered BAT activity does not significantly contribute to the adiposity phenotype of the mice under normal chow or chronic HFD feeding. Nevertheless, we have softened the relevant manuscript text (lines 142-146).</p><fig id="respfig5"><label>Author response image 5.</label><caption><title>No change in metabolic parameters in Nr1d1<sup>Flox2-6</sup>:Adipoq<sup>Cre</sup> mice.</title><p>Representative two day recordings of metabolic gas exchange parameters of oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>), carbon dioxide production (VCO<sub>2</sub>), energy expenditure (kcal/hr) and respiratory exchange ratio (RER) in male mice.

Specifically, it is the paucity of phenotypic or transcriptional impact in the <italic>Nr1d1<sup>Flox2-6</sup>:Adipoq<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice under normal chow feeding conditions which raises a question of NR1D2 activity. However, several lines of evidence argue against this possibility: (i) expression of <italic>Nr1d2</italic> in WAT is not altered by the loss of <italic>Nr1d1</italic> in either the global or adipocyte-specific knockout mouse; (ii) if NR1D2 activity were sufficient to compensate for loss of <italic>Nr1d1</italic>, and in doing so mitigate transcriptional and/or phenotypic impact, then why is this not evident in the global <italic>Nr1d1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (under normal chow conditions), or in the <italic>Nr1d1<sup>Flox2-6</sup>:Adipoq<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice under HFD-feeding conditions?; (iii) potential compensation by <italic>Nr1d2</italic> does not extend to transcriptional regulation of the core circadian clock genes, including <italic>Arntl (Bmal1)</italic> and <italic>Nfil3</italic>, which show significant de-repression upon <italic>Nr1d1</italic> deletion; (iv) finally, as we have shown in our in vitro studies (Figure 3 Supplemental), combined knockdown of both <italic>Nr1d1</italic> and <italic>Nr1d2</italic> in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes does not cause an increase in the expression of putative metabolic targets. It is difficult to undertake similar studies in vivo. Dual deletion of <italic>Nr1d1</italic> and <italic>Nr1d2</italic> profoundly disrupts circadian clock function (core clock gene expression is rendered arrhythmic; e.g. Cho et al., 2012; Guan et al., 2020), and therefore, it is not possible to separate the impact of NR1D1/β loss from loss of circadian timing <italic>per se</italic> under these conditions.</p><p>Taken together, we do not believe that NR1D2 compensation is likely to play a major role in our models; nevertheless, we have softened the text in the main manuscript (lines 178-183).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Isolated sections with F4/80 alone are not sufficient to make a broad claim about inflammation. This would be more convincing if supported by flow cytometry data and inflammatory gene expression.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate that immunohistochemistry using a general macrophage marker has limitations with regards to describing overall immune response and inflammatory state within the adipose tissue of our different mice. Our aim was to broadly demonstrate that, despite showing enhanced obesity in response to HFD-feeding, mice lacking <italic>Nr1d1</italic> expression in adipocytes do not exhibit increased macrophage infiltration into gWAT (an extremely well-characterised pathological process associated with obesity in humans and animals). The reduced appearance of inflammatory cuffs was pronounced and consistent across our animals. The main focus of our current manuscript is the altered metabolic state and transcriptional regulation delivered by NR1D1 under normal conditions and during obesity, rather than the detailed immune consequence of enhanced lipid storage. Therefore, we have not undertaken flow cytometry-based immune cell characterisation. Nonetheless, to increased clarity and to reinforce the attenuated immune response observed in gWAT collected from HFD-fed <italic>Nr1d1<sup>Flox2-6</sup>:Adipoq<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice, we have more thoroughly analysed and presented immune-related gene expression within our RNA-seq studies. Using IPA (Qiagen), we assessed enrichment and overall direction of change in genes that showed differential expression between the two genotypes fed HFD for 16-weeks. Extensive enrichment of immune-related pathways were revealed by this analysis, and importantly, all of those showing significant enrichment were predicted to be strongly attenuated in the gWAT samples lacking <italic>Nr1d1</italic> expression. We have now also included these analyses within Figure 5 Source Data File 1 accompanying the main manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) The legend for Figure 4 says that mutant mice have &quot;greater insulin sensitivity&quot;.

To show insulin sensitivity more clearly, we have plotted the data in Figure 4F as blood glucose change from baseline. Area under the curve is then calculated from this.
