This study aims to investigate the protective effects of exogenous mitochondrial transplantation in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Exogenous mitochondrial transplantation can enhance myocardial function and improve the survival rate. Mechanistic studies suggest that mitochondrial transplantation can limit impairment in mitochondrial morphology, augment the activity of mitochondrial complexes II and IV, and raise ATP level. As well, mitochondrial therapy ameliorated oxidative stress imbalance, reduced myocardial injury, and thus improved PAMD after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>muscle fiber</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82372210</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Xiang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81901932</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Xiang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003819</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021CFB492</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Xiang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Exogenous mitochondrial transplantation improves cardiac function after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may be related to improving mitochondrial function, reducing the oxidative stress response, and decreasing apoptosis in myocardial cells.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cardiac arrest (CA) is a life-threatening event and that is followed by post-cardiac arrest myocardial dysfunction (PAMD) after the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). PAMD exhibits degrees of systolic and diastolic dysfunction. The heart requires up to 30 kg of ATP daily to maintain systolic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hall et al., 2014</xref>). Due to the high energy requirements of the myocardium, mitochondria make up approximately one-third of the volume of cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cao et al., 2023</xref>). The occurrence of PAMD is associated with mitochondrial damage with increased mitochondrial volume, accumulation of calcium ions, a diminution in complex activity, and a decrease in phosphate synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Huang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">McCully et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Su et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tsai et al., 2021</xref>). Myocardium, as a high energy-consuming tissue, is very susceptible to energy depletion due to mitochondrial dysfunction. After mitochondrial injury, cytoplasmic and mitochondrial calcium overload prevents full relaxation of cardiomyocytes and can release cytochrome C to activate mitochondrial apoptotic pathways. This process contributes to the development of PAMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gazmuri and Radhakrishnan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Su et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, maintaining cardiomyocyte mitochondrial function after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) could be useful for cell survival and tissue homeostasis.</p><p>Transplantation of mitochondria isolated from non-ischemic or allogeneic tissues promoted myocardial recovery after regional ischemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">McCully et al., 2009</xref>). Although the safety and efficacy of this approach have been verified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ali Pour et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jia et al., 2022</xref>), effectiveness of mitochondrial transplantation in treating myocardial injury following CA remains to be demonstrated. Herein, we performed mitochondrial transplantation in rats following CPR to observe its effects on cardiac function and prognosis and explored its potential mechanism of action <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental design of the in vivo study, rats in all groups except the Sham group underwent cardiac arrest for 5 min and then received the corresponding intervention 10 min after ROSC.</title><p>Four hours after ROSC, the 4 hr group was used to collect myocardial tissue and blood samples for detection, while the 72 hr group was used for survival detection.

Circulatory dysfunction occurs in approximately two-thirds of CA subjects, which is associated with a poor outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Han et al., 2022</xref>). Unlike myocardial depression caused by regional ischemia characterized by localized ventricular wall-motion abnormalities, myocardial depression caused by PAMD after CA manifest as global left ventricular systolic dysfunction accompanied by reduced ejection fraction, left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, and right ventricular dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lazzarin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Xu et al., 2008</xref>). Of these, global left ventricular systolic dysfunction is the most significant manifestation.</p><p>In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that the administration of exogenous mitochondria is cardioprotective effects after CPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The rationale was to enhance the energy-dependent contractility of the myocardium. We isolated mitochondria from allogeneic gastrocnemius muscle tissue of healthy rats and maintained optimal mitochondrial activity and therapeutic effects. CA is an occasional event, making it impossible to predict when it will occur. Consequently, it is consistent with clinical practice to perform mitochondrial transplantation interventions only after spontaneous circulation has recovered and stabilized. The dosage of mitochondria is determined based on previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blitzer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Guariento et al., 2020</xref>). In previous research, isolated mitochondria (1×10<sup>9</sup>) were delivered to the left coronary ostium in pigs, and can be a viable treatment in cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blitzer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Guariento et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, the dose of 1×10<sup>9</sup> mitochondria achieves the maximal hyperemic effect when administered via intracoronary injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shin et al., 2019</xref>). Considering that Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats are smaller than pigs and that there is a loss of mitochondria during pulmonary circulation, we adopted a mitochondrial transplantation dose of 5×10<sup>8</sup>. Subsequently, uptake of the delivered mitochondria occurred in the heart and myocytes, perhaps via micropinocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kami and Gojo, 2020</xref>). AS well, mitochondrial internalization occurred through actin-dependent endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pacak et al., 2015</xref>). Internalized mitochondria promote degradation of resident via lysosomes to maintain an energy mitochondrial balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jia et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liu et al., 2022</xref>). Notably, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cowan et al., 2017</xref>) indicated that isolated mitochondria are transported to endosomes and lysosomes; however, most of these mitochondria escape from these compartments and subsequently fuse with the endogenous mitochondrial network.

Possibly because CPR caused ischemia/reperfusion injury to organs throughout the body, with non-specific distribution and uptake of the delivered mitochondria. Moreover, mitochondria possess the ability to adjust their mass and function to maintain cellular homeostasis. This includes mitochondrial dynamics such as fusion and fission, as well as biogenesis and degradation through mitophagy, which are crucial for regulating the morphology, mass, and function of mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Quiles and Gustafsson, 2020</xref>). These mechanisms may regulate the continuous remodeling of mitochondrial numbers to maintain mitochondrial mass homeostasis following mitochondrial transplantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jia et al., 2022</xref>). After mitochondrial transplantation, the energy supply of myocardial mitochondria was restored, and autophagy was enhanced, resulting in an increased clearance of damaged mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Xu et al., 2024</xref>). This also clarifies why the overall mass of mitochondria did not increase. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Masuzawa et al., 2013</xref> proposed that the internalization of mitochondria is not critical, as cardioprotection occurs rapidly within 10 min of reperfusion, the presence of viable mitochondria in cardiac tissue is all that is required. The nonviable mitochondria, mitochondrial fractions, mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid, ribonucleic acid, and exogenous adenosine diphosphate and ATP are incapable of providing protection to the ischemic heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Masuzawa et al., 2013</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shin et al., 2019</xref> also suggested that the number of mitochondria required for cardioprotection is not dependent on the absolute number of transplanted mitochondria. Therefore, an increase in mitochondrial mass may not be the mechanism underlying the cardioprotective effects of transplanted mitochondria. The cardioprotective mechanisms of isolated mitochondria involve increased ATP production. The results of our study were consistent with other date that the energy metabolism of myocardial mitochondria improved after mitochondrial transplantation along with increased complex activity and ATP content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jia et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pacak et al., 2015</xref>). Mitochondrial transplantation is being pursued as a therapeutic strategy, as it does not result in coronary occlusion, autoimmunity and arrhythmia attacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Masuzawa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shin et al., 2019</xref>). The clinical application of mitochondrial transplantation can enhance the prognosis of pediatric patients requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation following cardiac surgery, the improvement of cardiac function in patients helps them successfully wean off ECMO support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Emani and McCully, 2018</xref>). It is worth noting that the method of mitochondrial isolation may better meet the needs of clinical settings where an interventional time below 60 min is desired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ali Pour et al., 2021</xref>). After the isolation, mitochondria can be immediately used for transfer and internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ali Pour et al., 2021</xref>).

In a regional ischemia-reperfusion model, mitochondrial transplantation reduced oxidative stress in cells following reperfusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Similarly, in the present study, mitochondrial transplantation reduced the production of ROS, decreased the level of myocardial oxidative markers, and increased the activity of antioxidant enzymes after 4 hr of ROSC.</p><p>Ischemia/reperfusion injury of myocardial tissue releases CK-MB and cTn-I, which were commonly used indicators of early myocardial injury in clinical settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). The concentrations of CK-MB and cTn-I rose significantly 4 hr after resuscitation in the CA-CPR model, while mitochondrial transplantation significantly reduced this effect. During ischemia, the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential leads to mitochondrial swelling and release of cytochrome C, followed by caspase-mediated cell death during reperfusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lu et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Milliken et al., 2022</xref>).

Similar results were reported in pigs that underwent CA-CPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). In our results, the level of apoptosis and the opening of mPTP in cardiomyocytes increased significantly after CPR, whereas administration of healthy mitochondria significantly reduced both apoptosis and mPTP opening. Moreover, exogenous mitochondrial transplantation significantly reduced the disordering of myocardial fiber arrangement and inflammatory cell infiltration.</p><p>In conclusion, exogenous mitochondrial transplantation improved cardiac function after CPR.

Healthy rats tend to exhibit a higher recovery ability after a CA attack, which may lead to an overestimation of the therapeutic effects of mitochondrial transplantation.

Based on this scale, the degree of mitochondrial damage in rats across the four groups was scored, and the average scores were calculated from three random fields of view per rat. A higher score indicates more severe injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-5"><title>The determination of ROS</title><p>The extraction of mitochondria from myocardial tissue was performed using a mitochondrial isolation kit (S3606; Beyotime, Shanghai, China). Rat myocardial tissues were homogenized with mitochondrial isolation reagent A and then centrifuged at 600 × <italic>g</italic> for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was subsequently centrifuged again at 11,000 × <italic>g</italic> for 5 min at 4 °C. ROS was determined by a fluorescent probe DCFH-DA using the ROS assay kit (S0033S; Beyotime, Shanghai, China) based on the manufacturer’s directions. After removing the supernatant, the pelleted materials were suspended in incubation buffer (20 mM MOPS, 0.1 M KCl, 10 mM ATP, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM sodium succinate, and 1 mM EGTA); then DCFH-DA (1: 1000) was added. Next, the contents were mixed and incubated at 37 °C in the dark for 20 min. Finally, the fluorescence intensity was measured on a flow cytometry with excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 nm and 525 nm, respectively. The results were presented as the fluorescent intensity per nanogram of protein.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-6"><title>Quantification of MDA and SOD detection</title><p>The MDA and SOD activity level of myocardial samples were determined with an MDA test kit (A003-1; Nanjing Jiancheng, Nanjing, China) and SOD test kit (A001-3; Nanjing Jiancheng, Nanjing, China).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-7"><title>Mitochondrial swelling assay</title><p>Myocardial tissue was initially isolated. The tissue was digested using 0.1% collagenase and 0.125% trypsin, followed by hydrolysis at 37℃ for 30 min. The mixture was filtered through a 200-mesh screen at 1500 rpm and then centrifuged for 15 min to collect the sediment. mPTP Assay Kit (C2009S; Beyotime, Shanghai, China) was used to determine the opening of the mPTP in cardiomyocytes. This kit provides a more straightforward approach for assessing mPTP opening. In brief, cardiomyocytes were treated with Calcein AM for 30 min at 37℃, which easily entered the cells and accumulated in various cytosolic compartments, including the mitochondria. Once inside, intracellular esterases broke down the acetoxymethyl esters, releasing the highly polar fluorescent dye calcein. The fluorescence from cytosolic calcein was diminished when CoCl2 was added, while the fluorescence from mitochondrial calcein remained unaffected. However, when the mPTP opened, mitochondrial calcein was released into the cytosol, where it was quenched by CoCl2, leading to a notable decrease in calcein fluorescence. A decrease in absorbance reflects mitochondrial swelling and the opening of the mitochondrial mPTP. Subsequently, flow cytometry was employed to detect the opening of the mPTP in 1×10<sup>6</sup> cardiomyocytes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Detection of myocardial injury</title><sec id="s4-9-1"><title>TUNEL assay</title><p>Paraffin-embedded tissue sections were processed with an in-situ cell-death detection kit (11684795910; Roche, Basel, Switzerland) for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling.

All data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (Mean ± SD). Sample size for the 4 hr group was calculated as published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dell et al., 2002</xref>). The ejection fraction of the first three surviving rats among the groups was measured. The population standard deviation of the variable is 11.34. With a magnitude of difference set at 15, an error rate of 0.1, and a power of 80%, the smallest acceptable sample size was determined to be five animals. Considering an animal loss of approximately 20% after 4 hr of CPR, seven animals were selected for each group. The sample size for the 72 hr group was calculated using StatBox (StatBox-Open 0.1.0; Cloud Powered Clinical Trial, Hebei, China). Set the survival rate at 20% for survival rate 1 and 80% for survival rate 2 (with power = 0.8 and <italic>α</italic>=0.05). Accordingly, 10 was the smallest acceptable animal sample size. The comparison of time-based measurements was evaluated using repeated-measures tow-way ANOVA, with groups as the between-subjects factor and time as the within-subjects factor. One-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple-comparison test were employed to compare multiple groups. Survival was characterized using the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis test. Statistical significance was defined at p&lt;0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>The experimental protocol was approved by the Animal Experiment Committee of the General Hospital of Central Theater Command (No.2023017) and conformed to the Guide for the Care and Use of Experimental Animals published by the National Institutes of Health, USA (NIH Publication No. 5377-3, 1996).

Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles that play a crucial role in cellular energy metabolism. When cells encounter various stressors and increased energy demands, they can benefit from the incorporation of exogenous mitochondria. In 2013, Masuzawa et al. (Masuzawa, et al.,2013) were the first to demonstrate that transplanted mitochondria are internalized by cardiomyocytes 2 to 8 hours after transplantation, significantly contributing to the preservation of myocardial energetics. Ali et al. (Ali, et al.,2020) discovered that exogenous mitochondria could be internalized by H9C2 cardiomyocytes as quickly as 5 minutes after co-incubation, resulting in an acute enhancement of normal cellular bioenergetics following mitochondrial transplantation. Pacak et al. (Pacak, et al.,2015) established that the internalization of mitochondria into cardiomyocytes is time-dependent and occurs through actin-dependent endocytosis.</p><p>Collectively, these evidences illustrate that exogenous mitochondria can be effectively internalized by H9C2 cells and other cardiomyocytes, our experiments further confirmed that mitochondrial transplantation can be incorporated by the myocardium in <italic>vivo</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The description of results in the manuscript is too simple. It lacks detail on the rationale behind the experiments and the significance of the data.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have realized that the results in the submitted manuscript have not been adequately interpreted. We have added necessary details on the rationale behind the experiments and the significance of the data to the results section (Lines 57~59, 69~73, 81~88, 91~98, 100~102, 103~104, 10<sup>9</sup>~115, 124~129, 135~146, 149~157, 159~161, 168~169, 178~179). We would like to express our gratitude to the reviewers once again and hope that our modifications will meet their requirements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors demonstrate that mitochondrial transplantation reduces cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Therefore, Western blot analysis of apoptosis-related caspases could be provided for further confirmation.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this constructive comment. We fully agree with the reviewer's perspective on the detection of apoptosis-related caspases and have conducted a Western blot assay to investigate the impact of mitochondria on myocardial tissue. Our new evidence indicates that rats receiving mitochondrial transplantation exhibited reduced expression of cleaved caspase-3 compared with those in the NS and Vehicle groups (Fig. 6G, 6H, Lines 168~169), suggesting that mitochondrial transplantation decreased the level of apoptosis in the myocardium.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Do donor mitochondria fuse with recipient mitochondria? Relevant experiments and data should be provided to address this question.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very helpful comment. Investigating the fate of transplanted mitochondria in myocardial cells after CA is of great significance. The internalization of exogenous mitochondria has been observed across various cell types (Liu, et al.,2021; Shanmughapriya, et al.,2020). Notably, a recent study indicated that after being incorporated into host cells, isolated mitochondria are transported to endosomes and lysosomes. Subsequently, most of these mitochondria escape from these compartments and fuse with the endogenous mitochondrial network (Cowan, et al.,2017). We have discussed this in the manuscript. (Lines 217~220)</p><p>Oxidative stress, a pathophysiological phenomenon common to cells suffering from ischemia/reperfusion insults after CA/CPR, was implicated to promote internalization and survival of exogenous mitochondria (Aharoni-Simon, et al.,2022). In our study, we confirmed that mitochondrial transplantation can enhance the metabolism of cardiomyocytes, increase ATP level, and reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS). Our results indirectly confirm that isolated mitochondria can successfully fuse with myocardial mitochondria.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) In Figure 5A, the histograms are not labeled with the specific experimental groups.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this oversight. We have labeled the specific experimental groups in the histograms presented in Figure 6B and 6C (originally Figure 5A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) The age, gender, and strain of the donor rats should be specified in the Methods section. Additionally, it is not obvious what doses of mitochondria were injected into the rats and how the dosage was initially determined.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your suggestion. We have included relevant information about the donor rats in the Methods section（Lines 361~362）.</p><p>In Mito group, each animal received 0.5 mL of 1× 10<sup>9</sup>/mL mitochondrial suspension. (Lines 342~345). Considerable amounts of data have demonstrated the efficacy of mitochondrial transplantation in cellular, animal, and human research (Alemany, et al.,2024; Kaza, et al.,2017; Liu, et al.,2023). However, there is currently no evidence to determine the optimal dosage for transplantation. In previous research, isolated mitochondria (1 × 10<sup>9</sup>) were delivered to the left coronary ostium in pigs, and can be a viable treatment modality in cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury (Blitzer, et al.,2020; Guariento, et al.,2020). Additionally, the dose of 1× 10<sup>9</sup> mitochondria achieve the maximal hyperemic effect when administered via intracoronary injection (Shin, et al.,2019). Considering that Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats are smaller than pigs and that there is a loss of mitochondria during pulmonary circulation, we adopted a mitochondrial transplantation dose of 5× 10<sup>8</sup>. We will explore the optimal dosage in our future research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In Figure 4a, the number of transplanted mitochondria appears to be very low. Considering the high number of mitochondria present in cardiomyocytes, it is unclear whether this small amount of transplanted mitochondria can significantly impact complex II activity and ATP levels in myocardial tissues, as shown in Figures 4b-d, or improve survival post-ROSC, as shown in Figure 2d. Could the observed benefits of mitochondrial transplantation be due to the indirect effects of the injected mitochondria, such as the release of mitochondrial contents, rather than the mitochondria themselves, as discussed by Bertero et al. (2021, Circ. Research)? This issue should be addressed in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this wonderful comment. As presented in Fig. 4 (originally Figure 4A), our results indicated the internalization of mitochondria by myocardium, shown by colocalization of Mito-tracker and myocardium marker. We would like to make our points here regrading to Fig. 4:</p><p>(1) Significant left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction that occurs in the myocardium shortly after the return of ROSC is referred to post-cardiac arrest myocardial dysfunction (PAMD) (Laurent, et al.,2002). It has demonstrated the efficacy of mitochondrial transplantation for the heart following ischemia-reperfusion injury in cellular, animal, and human studies, despite inadequate mitochondrial internalization (Liu, et al.,2023). A low number of transplanted mitochondria may improve cardiac function.</p><p>(2) Only biologically active mitochondria can be specifically labeled with Mito-tracker. Therefore, cardiomyocytes uptake mitochondria that possess complete functionality. Previous results have demonstrated that mitochondrial contents, such as nonviable mitochondria, mitochondrial fractions, mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid, ribonucleic acid, exogenous adenosine diphosphate and ATP, do not provide protection to the ischemic heart (McCully, et al.,2017; McCully, et al.,2009).</p><p>(3) The specific mechanism for mitochondrial internalization has yet to be fully elucidated. We totally agree with reviewer’s opinion pertaining the presence of other mechanisms of mitochondria transplantation that play a role in cardiac protection. Multiple mechanism may involve in the cardiac protection effect of mitochondria transplantation, and we are actively seeking reasonable approach to verify these hypotheses in an underway study (Lines 236~246).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In Figure 4g, the claims regarding sarcomere length, mitochondrial structure, the number of cristae, accumulated calcium etc. seem to rely on the visual interpretation of representative images. To ensure a reliable interpretation of the data, a blinded quantification of each image in each group should be conducted. The same applies to the claims made in Figure 5E.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this suggestion. We have quantitatively evaluated the electron microscope images and HE images of the myocardium to ensure reliable interpretation. Corresponding supplements have been added to the methods (Lines 433~441, 494~496), results sections (Lines 10<sup>9</sup>~115, 178~179), and Figures 5C, 5D, 6K and 6H (originally Figures 4G and 5E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) In line 69, it is unclear why the authors claim that MAP and HR decrease at 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours after ROSC in all groups compared to the Sham group, despite stating in line 72 that &quot;MAP and HR did not differ at any observational time points (P&gt;0.05, Figure 2C).&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for our inaccurate phrasing. In the presented study, there was no statistically significant difference between MAP and HR at any observational timepoints (P&gt;0.05, Figure 2C). In the NS, Vehicle and Mito groups, the MAP and HR decreased at 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours after ROSC, reaching their nadir at 1 hour. Subsequently, MAP and HR increased gradually but did not show any statistically significant differences compared with the Sham group. (Lines 69~73).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The absence of increased mitochondrial content in the mito-groups should be discussed further in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion.

This reviewer recommends limiting the graphical abstract to the findings specifically in this paper.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your great advice. We have revised Figure 7 (originally Figure 6) and restricted the graphical abstract to the findings presented in this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor issues:</p><p>(8) The order of data in Figure 4 should be consistent with the text in the manuscript. Figures 4E-F-G are described before Figures 4B-C-D in the text. Similarly, Figure 5F was described before Figure 5E in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your great advice. We have rearranged the order of the pictures to align with the text. Thank you for your proposal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) In Figure 4A, the locations of the epicardium, muscle, and endocardium should be indicated for clarity. Also, it is not obvious where the close-up box refers to in the actual image.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion.

This discrepancy should be addressed in the Discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry for confusing the ‘activity’ with ‘expression’. Although mitochondrial transplantation has been shown to be involved in the restoration of manganese superoxide dismutase levels after ischemic insults, the changes in antioxidant enzyme expression level were not evaluated at the protein level in this paper (Tashiro, et al.,2022).

In our manuscript, we added results regarding mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening. As anticipated, mitochondrial transplantation reduced the increase in mitochondrial ROS and the mPTP opening in ischemic myocardium.

In our results, we have not yet conducted cellular experiments, The process of isolating cells from the myocardial tissue of adult SD rats for Seahorse analysis can lead to secondary damage to the myocardial cells (Jacobson, et al.,1985). In this experiment, we measured ATP content and the activity of mitochondrial complexes to evaluate energy changes after mitochondrial transplantation. We will conduct cell experiments and utilize Seahorse measurements to further clarify the alterations in myocardial energy in future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For Figure 3B, it would be beneficial to include the relative quantification of the mitochondrial marker COX-IV.
