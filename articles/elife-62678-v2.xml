cardiovascular disease (CVD). We applied fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), RNA sequencing, and bioinformatic methods to investigate the common effects of CVD risk factors in mouse cardiac endothelial cells (ECs). Aging, obesity, and pressure overload all upregulated pathways related to TGF-β signaling and mesenchymal gene expression, inflammation, vascular permeability, oxidative stress, collagen synthesis, and cellular senescence, whereas exercise training attenuated most of the same pathways. We identified collagen chaperone <italic>Serpinh1</italic> (also called as <italic>Hsp47</italic>) to be significantly increased by aging and obesity and repressed by exercise training. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that increased SERPINH1 in human ECs induced mesenchymal properties, while its silencing inhibited collagen deposition. Our data demonstrate that CVD risk factors significantly remodel the transcriptomic landscape of cardiac ECs inducing inflammatory, senescence, and mesenchymal features. SERPINH1 was identified as a potential therapeutic target in ECs.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cardiovascular diseases are the number one cause of death in the western world. Endothelial cells that line the blood vessels of the heart play a central role in the development of these diseases. In addition to helping transport blood, these cells support the normal running of the heart, and help it to grow and regenerate. Over time as the body ages and experiences stress, endothelial cells start to deteriorate. This can cause the cells to undergo senescence and stop dividing, and lay down scar-like tissue via a process called fibrosis. As a result, the blood vessels start to stiffen and become less susceptible to repair.</p><p>Ageing, obesity, high blood pressure, and inactivity all increase the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases, whereas regular exercise has a protective effect. But it was unclear how these different factors affect endothelial cells. To investigate this, Hemanthakumar et al. compared the gene activity of different sets of mice: old vs young, obese vs lean, heart problems vs healthy, and fit vs sedentary.</p><p>All these risk factors – age, weight, inactivity and heart defects – caused the mice’s endothelial cells to activate mechanisms that lead to stress, senescence and fibrosis. Whereas exercise training had the opposite effect, and turned off the same genes and pathways. All of the at-risk groups also had high levels of a gene called SerpinH1, which helps produce tissue fiber and collagen. Experiments increasing the levels of SerpinH1 in human endothelial cells grown in the laboratory recreated the effects seen in mice, and switched on markers of stress, senescence and fibrosis.</p><p>According to the World Health Organization, cardiovascular disease now accounts for 10% of the disease burden worldwide. Revealing the affects it has on gene activity could help identify new targets for drug development, such as SerpinH1. Understanding the molecular effects of exercise on blood vessels could also aid in the design of treatments that mimic exercise. This could help people who are unable to follow training programs to reduce their risk of cardiovascular disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>obesity</kwd><kwd>exercise</kwd><kwd>heart</kwd><kwd>endothelium</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004022</institution-id><institution>Jenny ja Antti Wihurin Rahasto</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hemanthakumar</surname><given-names>Karthik Amudhala</given-names></name><name><surname>Kivelä</surname><given-names>Riikka</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002341</institution-id><institution>Academy of Finland</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>297245</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kivelä</surname><given-names>Riikka</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005633</institution-id><institution>Sydäntutkimussäätiö</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hemanthakumar</surname><given-names>Karthik Amudhala</given-names></name><name><surname>Kivelä</surname><given-names>Riikka</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006306</institution-id><institution>Sigrid Juséliuksen Säätiö</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kivelä</surname><given-names>Riikka</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003125</institution-id><institution>Suomen Kulttuurirahasto</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kivelä</surname><given-names>Riikka</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008723</institution-id><institution>Suomen Lääketieteen Säätiö</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mäyränpää</surname><given-names>Mikko I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003756</institution-id><institution>Biomedicum Helsinki-säätiö</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hemanthakumar</surname><given-names>Karthik Amudhala</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010133</institution-id><institution>Aarne Koskelon Säätiö</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hemanthakumar</surname><given-names>Karthik Amudhala</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Endothelial dysfunction due to cardiovascular disease risk factors explained by cardiac endothelial cell transcriptome remodelling.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>According to WHO, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) account for 10% of the global disease burden and constitute the number 1 cause of death in the western world. CVDs are mainly caused by behavioral (physical inactivity, unhealthy diet) and metabolic (obesity, hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol) risk factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mendis et al., 2011</xref>). Aging, however, is by far the biggest contributor to CVD, and aging population is becoming an enormous challenge worldwide.</p><p>The heart contains a dense vascular network, and endothelial cells (ECs) are indeed the most abundant cell population in the adult mouse heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pinto et al., 2016</xref>). In addition to their transport function, ECs are defined to control vasomotor tone, maintain vascular homeostasis, regulate angiogenesis, and establish bidirectional communication with other cell types and organs via paracrine signaling mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aird, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aird, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kivelä et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Talman and Kivelä, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hemanthakumar and Kivelä, 2020</xref>). ECs are found to be highly adaptive to physiological stimuli during normal growth and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">White et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bloor, 2005</xref>), and the diversity of ECs in different tissues has now been acknowledged. ECs are also maladaptive to a spectrum of pathological events involving, for example, inflammation or oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cines et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gimbrone and García-Cardeña, 2016</xref>), and the development of heart diseases is strongly linked to endothelial dysfunction and impaired vascular remodeling. However, the molecular cues, which cause maladaptation and dysfunction of ECs in the heart in response to pathological signals, remain elusive.</p><p>Physical inactivity increases the incidence of several chronic diseases, whereas regular exercise training has positive effects on most of our tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hawley et al., 2014</xref>). Because microcirculation is present in every organ in the body, ECs have a unique ability to influence the homeostasis and function of different tissues, and they are potentially a major cell type mediating the positive effects of exercise throughout the body. Although the cardiac benefits of exercise are clear and there have been major advances in unraveling the molecular mechanisms, the understanding of how the molecular effects are linked to health benefits is still lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hawley et al., 2014</xref>). Especially, the effects of exercise on ECs have not been characterized.</p><p>We hypothesized that the major CVD risk factors aging, obesity, and pressure overload will induce adverse remodeling of cardiac EC transcriptome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gimbrone and García-Cardeña, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ungvari et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brandes, 2014</xref>), whereas exercise training would provide beneficial effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">White et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bloor, 2005</xref>). Both physiological and pathological stimuli significantly modified the cardiac EC transcriptome. Intriguingly, our results demonstrated that CVD risk factors promoted activation of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling, inflammatory response, cellular senescence, and induced mesenchymal gene expression in cardiac EC, whereas exercise training promoted opposite protective effects.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Exercise training and CVD risk factors modulate cardiac EC number, vascular density, and transcriptome</title><p>To mimic the effect of the most common CVD risk factors (aging, obesity, pressure overload/hypertension, and physical inactivity), we used adult C57BL/6J wild-type mice in the following experimental groups: aged (18 months) vs. young (2 months) mice, high-fat diet (HFD) induced obesity (14 weeks HFD) vs. lean mice, transverse aortic constriction (TAC) vs. sham-operated mice, and exercise training (progressive treadmill running for 6 weeks) vs. sedentary mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Exercise trained mice showed improved ejection fraction compared to the sedentary mice, whereas aging, HFD, and TAC resulted in impaired heart function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>). HFD also induced marked weight gain, increased fat mass, and impaired glucose tolerance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G–I</xref>). Left ventricular (LV) mass was increased in aged, HFD-treated, and TAC mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>). Exercise training also slightly increased LV mass, which reflects mild physiological hypertrophy often observed in endurance-trained athletes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arbab-Zadeh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>).</p><p>Exercise training significantly increased, whereas aging, HFD, and TAC decreased the percentage, count, and mean fluorescence intensity of the cardiac ECs (CD31<sup>+</sup>CD140a<sup>-</sup>CD45<sup>-</sup>Ter119<sup>-</sup>DAPI<sup>-</sup>) compared to the controls, when analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>). This was also demonstrated by immunohistochemistry for CD31-positive coronary vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). The cardiac ECs were gated and sorted by FACS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>), and the isolated ECs were first analyzed by quantitative PCR analysis, which indicated significant enrichment of EC markers Cdh5 and Tie1 in the sorted fraction compared to whole heart or other cardiac mononuclear cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). In addition, isolation resulted in 87.4 ± 1.9% cell viability and RNA purification strategy yielded intact and stable RNA with average RNA integrity number (RIN) of 8.7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C,D</xref>). RNA sequencing of isolated ECs was used to profile the expression pattern of cardiac EC transcripts in different experimental groups. Two-dimensional PCA of the EC transcriptomes exhibited significant proportion of variance in the gene expression pattern, which can be attributed to the treatment-induced changes in cardiac EC transcriptome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–E</xref>). Notably, unsupervised hierarchical clustering of EC data sets for all experimental interventions (sedentary, exercise trained, young, aged, sham, TAC) revealed consistent clustering and high degree of similarity in the gene expression pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F–J</xref>). The analysis for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) showed a large number of up- and downregulated genes especially in aged, obese, and TAC-operated mice followed by a smaller number of affected genes in exercise trained mice. The number of significantly up- and downregulated genes with the false discovery rate (FDR) 0.05 for each treatment are shown in the MA plots and the top 50 DEGs for each treatment are presented by heat maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–E,F–J</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Effects of exercise training, aging, obesity, and pressure overload on cardiac endothelial cell (EC) number and vascular density.</title><p>(<bold>A and B</bold>) Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis and quantification of mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the cardiac ECs (CD31+CD140a-CD45-Ter119-DAPI-) in various mouse models.

The results demonstrate that the CVD risk factors activate transcriptional programs promoting cell aging, senescence, TGF-β activation, inflammation, and oxidative stress in cardiac ECs. Importantly, exercise attenuated these same pathways, even in healthy mice. Furthermore, we found that aging, obesity, and pressure overload induced mesenchymal gene programs in cardiac ECs, which can contribute to dysfunctional endothelium and CVD development. Analysis of potential disease-promoting genes identified <italic>Serpinh1</italic> to be induced by aging and obesity, while its expression was significantly repressed by exercise, also in old mice. Mechanistically, SERPINH1 was induced by TGF-β and ROS, and the overexpression of SERPINH1 increased cell size and stress fiber formation, weakened cell–cell junctions, and promoted mesenchymal and senescence-associated gene expression in human cardiac ECs. Immunohistochemistry of human hearts showed that SERPINH1 is abundantly expressed throughout the cardiac vasculature.</p><p>The largest dysregulation of the cardiac EC transcriptome was found in aged mice, followed by obesity and pressure overload. Exercise training affected a smaller number of transcripts, which can be accounted, at least partly, to the young and healthy control mice, which could move unrestrictedly in their home cages. Interestingly, however, most of the pathways activated by CVD risk factors were the same that were repressed by exercise training, highlighting the potential of physical activity to improve cardiovascular health via modulating EC phenotype and function. The positive effects of exercise on skeletal muscle and cardiac angiogenesis have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hudlicka et al., 1992</xref>), but exercise-induced molecular changes in ECs have not been characterized. It is important to note that here we studied the chronic adaptations to exercise training, and not the acute responses, which likely explains why more genes were found to be downregulated than upregulated in these mice. The effects of exercise training in cardiac ECs were associated with EC homeostasis and stabilization, with increased expression of genes related to establishment of EC barrier, polarity, and focal adhesion. Importantly, exercise induced repression of inflammatory, permeability, senescence, and mesenchymal gene networks. It also attenuated the expression of apelin, which is considered as a marker of activated ECs, and also its receptor Aplnr. This suggests that regular exercise training promotes stabilization and quiescence in cardiac ECs and prevents cellular aging. Aging and obesity, on the other hand, are known to contribute to capillary rarefaction and/or dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cines et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gimbrone and García-Cardeña, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">López-Otín et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ungvari et al., 2010</xref>), and another novel aspect in this study was the comparison of several CVD risk factors to identify common pathways and genes, which could drive the pathogenesis in cardiac disease, and could be considered as potential therapeutic targets. ECs would provide an attractive target for drug development, as they are the first cells to encounter drugs in the bloodstream.</p><p>Dysfunctional endothelium likely contributes to more diseases than any other tissue in the body as it affects all organs. On the other hand, endothelium could act as an important mediator of the health-promoting effects of exercise in a variety of tissues. Our finding that aging, obesity, and pressure overload induce mesenchymal gene programs in cardiac ECs adds to the increasing evidence that activated endothelial TGF-β signaling and acquisition of mesenchymal features play an important role in the development of EC dysfunction and cardiac diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kovacic et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xiong et al., 2018</xref>). Importantly, genes related to TGF-β production and cellular aging were repressed by exercise, highlighting the potential of exercise training in preventing and delaying the development of CVD. The molecular mechanisms of exercise-mediated repression of TGF-β signaling are not known. Nitric oxide (NO) has been previously shown to attenuate TGF-β/SMAD2 signaling in ECs, whereas mice lacking endothelial NO synthase activity presented increased TGF-β signaling and collagen 1 in their aortas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Saura et al., 2005</xref>). Increased blood flow during exercise induces eNOS expression and NO production, which could repress TGF-β activity in the vasculature.</p><p>Reduced TGF-β activation was also recently reported in whole heart lysates in exercised rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lin et al., 2020</xref>), and enhanced TGF-β signaling was also suggested to be a negative regulator of exercise response in human skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Böhm et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The activation of TGF-β signaling pathway has been implicated as a driving force for EndMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Evrard et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cooley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">James and Rafii, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bischoff, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bischoff et al., 2016</xref>). Several studies have recently suggested that EndMT could contribute to the development of various CVDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zeisberg et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kovacic et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sánchez-Duffhues et al., 2018</xref>), but currently there is a lack of understanding of the causal relationships and mechanisms linking EndMT and CVD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kovacic et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, whether the transition from ECs to mesenchymal cells occurs completely in various CVDs is still actively debated in the literature. It has been suggested that pathological EC activation will result in acquired EndMT features for example expression of mesenchymal genes, without full transformation from one cell type to another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). This is in line with our findings, as only cells with high CD31 expression and with no expression of CD45, CD140a, and Ter119 were included in our analyses. Thus, all the analyzed cells were ECs, but in the CVD risk factor groups they demonstrated increased mesenchymal marker expression. Long-term lineage tracing of ECs in response to CVD risk factors would provide further knowledge if and to what extent full transformation of ECs to mesenchymal cells occurs in cardiac vasculature. Our results, however, demonstrate that ECs acquire mesenchymal features due to CVD risk factors, which likely results in EC dysfunction even without full EndMT.</p><p>It was not surprising that SASP-genes were induced in old mouse ECs, but the observation that this was also seen in the obese and pressure overloaded mice caught our attention. In ECs of obese mice, increased <italic>p53</italic> expression has been reported, which led to reduced eNOS phosphorylation both in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yokoyama et al., 2014</xref>). Combined with our data, this could then result in increased TGF-β activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Saura et al., 2005</xref>), linking senescence and TGF-β signaling. We also observed significantly more SA-β-galactosidase positive cells in the hearts of obese mice compared to the lean mice. These cells were often found in clusters, and in addition to ECs, they could also be other non-myocytes. Thus the significance of these cells to cardiac vasculature remains to be further studied. Endothelial deletion of <italic>p53</italic> has also been demonstrated to protect against pressure overload-induced cardiac dysfunction and fibrosis, suggesting that increased p53 and other senescence-associated genes are important mediators of EC dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gogiraju et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>To identify possible pathology-driving genes, which would be common for several risk factors, we performed gene overlap analysis using all data sets. Two genes, <italic>Serpinh1</italic> and <italic>Vwa1</italic>, were found to be significantly increased by both aging and obesity and decreased by exercise, suggesting that they could act as common mediators of EC dysfunction. We focused in this study on <italic>Serpinh1</italic>, as it is a collagen chaperone and has been shown to contribute to tissue fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ito and Nagata, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Khalil et al., 2019</xref>), an important feature of many cardiac diseases. Recently, it was demonstrated using <italic>Serpinh1</italic> cell type-specific knockout mice that <italic>Serpinh1/Hsp47</italic> in myofibroblasts is an important regulator of pathologic cardiac fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Khalil et al., 2019</xref>). In line with our results, collagen 1 production was decreased also in the EC-specific <italic>Serpinh1</italic> deficient hearts in TAC-operated mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Khalil et al., 2019</xref>). In human cardiac ECs, our results placed SERPINH1 downstream of TGF-β and ROS, and demonstrated that its overexpression promoted mesenchymal features and senescence . Furthermore, SERPINH1 was found to be important for extracellular collagen 1 deposition and EC proliferation and migration. Overexpression of SERPINH1 slightly increased proliferation, but the effect was more pronounced on migration, whereas silencing of SERPINH1 almost completely blocked proliferation. Silencing also prevented the TGF-β induced appearance of TAGLIN-positive cells in human cardiac EC, which is considered as a marker for EndMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Evrard et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Magenta et al., 2011</xref>). It is counterintuitive that SERPINH1 increased senescence markers that inhibit cell proliferation, but at the same time increased proliferation and migration. Proliferation was evaluated 48 hr after transduction, thus it is possible that at this time point, the induced mesenchymal properties override the senescence signals, which might take over at later time points, reflected as increased cell size and SA-beta galactosidase staining.</p><p>Based on the publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing data and immunohistochemistry of the human heart samples, SERPINH1 is abundantly expressed in all cardiac endothelial populations, as well as in arterial and venous ECs in other tissues. Not much is known about the role of SERPINH1 in heart disease. In a study by Kato et al., SERPINH1 was found to colocalize with several other EndMT markers in some of the ECs in left <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/atrium-heart">atrium</ext-link> in patients with atrial fibrillation, a disease which is often related to fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kato et al., 2017</xref>). To further the translational potential, the role of endothelial SERPINH1 in aged, obese, and hypertensive human hearts needs to be determined.</p><p>In the in vivo experiments for endothelial RNA sequencing analyses, we have used male mice, which were age and gender matched in exercise, obesity, and TAC models. Thus, most of the results represent responses in male mice, whereas in the exercise training experiment in old mice, female mice were used. Some of the responses, for example the repression of <italic>Serpinh1</italic> in exercised mice, were similar to those observed in young male mice; however, some of the changes were not significant in old female mice. It will be important to determine if the findings presented here in male mice are also valid in females, and even more interestingly, in humans.</p><p>In conclusion, our data demonstrate that the major CVD risk factors significantly remodel the cardiac EC transcriptome promoting cell senescence, oxidative stress, TGF-β signaling, and mesenchymal gene features, whereas exercise training provided opposite and protective effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). SERPINH1 was identified as one of the downstream effectors of TGF-β, which could provide a novel therapeutic target in ECs.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Schematic demonstrating the cardiovascular disease risk factor mediated activation of TGF-β signaling and acquisition of mesenchymal gene features in cardiac EC.</title><p>CVD risk factors aging, obesity and pressure overload trigger the regression of coronary vasculature by activating TGF-β/ROS signaling pathways and cellular senescence.

models</title><p>All animal experiments were approved by the committee appointed by the District of Southern Finland. Male C57BL/6J wild-type mice were purchased from Janvier Labs and used in the following experimental set-ups: physical activity (progressive exercise training vs sedentary), obesity (high-fat fed for 14 weeks vs chow), aging (18 months vs 2 months), and pressure overload/heart failure (transaortic constriction for 2 and 7 weeks vs sham). Female C57BL/6J wild-type mice of 19–24 months old were used for a separate exercise training experiment. The mice were housed in individually ventilated cages and acclimatized at least for 1 week in the animal facility before any experiments. The cohort size (n) for each experiment is indicated in the figures or figure legends.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Exercise training</title><p>Ten-week-old C57BL/6J male mice (used for RNAseq) or 19–24 months old female mice (used for qPCR analyses) were trained on a treadmill (LE 8710, Bioseb). The mice were familiarized to the treadmill for three consecutive days with low speed (8–10 cm/s). Progressive training program consisted of 1–1.5 hr training bouts 5 days a week for a total of 6 weeks with increasing speed, inclination, and/or duration each week. The following parameters in the treadmill controller were opted, tread inclination: 0°−10°; minimum and maximum tread speed: 10–30 cm/s; shock grid intensity: 0.2 mA. The aged female mice were exercise-trained for 4 weeks and the same procedures were followed during the training program.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>High fat feeding</title><p>Ten-week-old C57BL/6J male mice were fed with standard chow diet or HFD containing 60% kcal derived from fat (Research Diets, D12492) for 4 or 14 weeks and used for immunohistochemistry or RNA-seq analysis, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>TAC surgery</title><p>Ten-week-old C57BL/6J male mice were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine. The mice were placed in supine position and intubated. The skin along the supra-sternal notch to mid sternum was incised to perform sternotomy to expose the aortic arch, right innominate, and left common carotid arteries together with the trachea. Ligation of the transverse aorta between the right innominate left common carotid arteries against blunted 27-gauge needle with a 7–0 suture was performed and the needle was gently removed. The sternum and skin were ligated with monofilament polypropylene suture. Mice were placed in a warm chamber to recover, treated with analgesics (0.05 mg/kg of Temgesic i.m.) at the time of the surgery and twice a day for following 2 days. For the control group (sham), all the steps in the surgical procedure were followed, except constricting the aorta. One group was killed 2 weeks and another group 7 weeks after the surgery. Echocardiography was performed once a week during the experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Echocardiography</title><p>To analyze cardiac function and ventricle dimensions, two-dimensional echocardiography images were acquired (Vevo 2100 Ultrasound, FUJIFILM Visual Sonics). The LV internal diameter, LV posterior wall thickness, and interventricular septum thickness at end-systole and end-diastole were measured in M-mode along the parasternal short axis view and analyzed by Simpson’s modified method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kivelä et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Body fat measurement</title><p>The mice were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine and the percentage of total body fat was measured using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (Lunar PIXImus, GE Medical systems).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Oral glucose tolerance test</title><p>Mice were fasted for 4–5 hr before the experiment. Glucose (1 g/kg) was administered by oral gavage to mice. Blood from the tail tip was used to measure glucose levels at the following time points (15, 30, 60, and 90 min) using blood glucose meter (Contour, Bayer).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Immunofluorescent staining</title><p>Frozen mouse heart sections (10 μm) were cut with cryomicrotome and stained as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kivelä et al., 2019</xref>). The primary antibodies are listed in the Key Resource Table. Primary antibodies were detected with Alexa 488, 594 or 647-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen). The sections were mounted with Vectashield Hard Set mounting media with DAPI (Vector Laboratories). The images were acquired with 20×, 40× air or 40× oil immersion objectives using AxioImager epifluorescent microscope (Carl Zeiss). The stained micrographs were initially adjusted for threshold, and an area fraction tool was used to quantify the area percentage of the vessels and collagen (Image J software, NIH).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Human heart samples</title><p>Human heart samples were obtained from four organ donor hearts, which could not be used for transplantation for example due to size or tissue-type mismatch. The collection was approved by institutional ethics committee and The National Authority for Medicolegal Affairs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>The human paraffin heart sections (4 μm) were cut, deparaffinized, and rehydrated with xylene, descending concentration series of ethanol (99%, 95%, 70%, and 50%) and H<sub>2</sub>O, and incubated in high pH antigen retrieval buffer containing 10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, 0.05% Tween 20 (pH 9.0). For HSP47 immunohistochemical analysis, VECTASTAIN Elite ABC kit (PK-6100) and DAB substrate were used to label and amplify the antibody signal. The 20× or 63× images were acquired with light microscope (Leica). For immunofluorescent staining, after the antigen retrieval step the sections were blocked with donkey immunomix (5% normal donkey serum, 0.2% BSA, 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS), incubated overnight at 4°C with the primary antibodies for HSP47 and VE-Cadherin (CDH5) and detected with Alexa 488 and 594 conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular probes, Invitrogen). The sections were mounted with Vectashield hardset with DAPI (Vector labs) and 40× images were acquired using AxioImager epifluorescent microscope (Carl Zeiss).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Isolation of cardiac ECs</title><p>The harvested hearts were briefly rinsed in ice-cold Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS, #14190–094, Gibco) supplemented with 0.3 mM calcium chloride (CaCl<sub>2</sub>), cut opened longitudinally into two halves to expose the cardiac chambers and minced longitudinally and transversely into small pieces. To enzymatically dissociate the heart, 4 ml of pre-warmed digestion media (1 mg/ml) of each collagenase types (type I [#17100–017], type II [#17101–015], and type IV [#17104–019]) from Gibco were dissolved in DPBS containing 0.3 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and added to the minced hearts, and incubated in water bath at 37°C for 25 min. During the digestion process, the samples were very gently mixed by vortexing for every 5 min. After incubation, the cell suspension was gently passed through T10 serological pipette 20 times. To neutralize the digestion, 10 ml of rinsing media (Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium [#31053–028] supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FCS) was added to the cell suspension and filtered through the 70 μm nylon cell strainer (Corning, #352350). Throughout the isolation process the cell suspensions were centrifuged for 5 min, 300 g, and 4°C between each rinsing step. The cell pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of ice-cold staining buffer (DPBS containing 2% heat inactivated FCS and 1 mM EDTA). Before antibody staining, the cells were incubated with Fc receptor blocking antibody (CD16/32) for 5 min. The cells were incubated with the CD31, PDGFRa/CD140a, CD45, and Ter119 antibodies for 30 min (Key Resource Table for the antibody details). Prior to FACS, the cells were rinsed twice with the staining buffer and filtered through 5 ml cell strainer tubes (Corning, #352235).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Fluorescent-activated cell sorting</title><p>The cells were passed through a 100 μm nozzle. Multiple light scattering parameters for forward- and side-scatter properties of the cells were employed to gate, analyze, and sort live cardiac ECs. Initially, total cells were gated based on the forward and side-scatter area of the cells (FSC-A and SSC-A). The single cells were selected depending on forward scatter parameters area, height, and width of the cells (FSC-A, FSC-H, or FSC-W). DAPI was used to determine live and dead cells. To enrich and FACS sort pure and viable cardiac ECs, ECs were stained with CD31, mesenchymal cells with PDGFRa/CD140a, leucocytes with CD45, and red blood cells with Ter119. The live cardiac ECs were defined as CD31<sup>+</sup> CD45<sup>-</sup> Ter119<sup>-</sup> CD140a<sup>-</sup> DAPI<sup>-</sup>. Cells were sorted using FACS Aria II (BD Biosciences), and the data was acquired with BD FACSDIVA v8.0.1 and further analyzed with FlowJo v10.1 (FlowJo, LLC) software. We verified the enrichment and purity of the FACS sorted Cardiac EC population (CD31+ PDGFRa (CD140a)- CD45- Ter119- DAPI-) by QPCR analysis for classical cardiac EC markers. Recently, we have used the same isolation method for single-cell RNAseq experiments, and these results show that there is about 3% contamination from other cells types, mainly pericytes and hemangioblasts.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>RNA isolation</title><p>The sorted cardiac ECs were immediately suspended in lysis buffer (350 μl of RLT buffer plus 10 μl of β-mercaptoethanol), the cells were homogenized in QIAshredder (#79654, Qiagen), and the RNA was purified using RNeasy Plus Micro Kit (#74034, Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. The RNA integrity was analyzed with bioanalyzer (Agilent Tape Station 4200) and the concentration was determined by Qubit fluorescence assay (ThermoFisher). The cells from the post sort fractions were stained with propidium iodide (PI) and the viability of the cells were determined by Luna automated cell counter. The purity of the post sort fraction was determined by QPCR analysis for EC markers.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>RNA sequencing of cardiac EC</title><p>Indexed cDNA library was synthesized using SMARTer Stranded Total RNA-Seq Kit V2 – Pico Input Mammalian (Takara Bio, USA) kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The library quality was determined using bioanalyzer and sequenced using illumina NextSeq 550 System with the following specifications: 1 × 75 bp, 50M single end reads were sequenced using NextSeq 500/550 High-Output v2.5 kit.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Differential gene expression</title><p>The sequenced reads were analyzed with the following software packages embedded in the Chipster analysis platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kallio et al., 2011</xref>) (v3.12.2; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://chipster.csc.fi">https://chipster.csc.fi</ext-link>).

The HISAT2 package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2015</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://chipster.csc.fi/manual/hisat2.html">https://chipster.csc.fi/manual/hisat2.html</ext-link>) was employed to align the reads to mouse genome GRCm38.90 and the HTSeq count tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anders et al., 2015</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://chipster.csc.fi/manual/htseq-count.html">https://chipster.csc.fi/manual/htseq-count.html</ext-link>) to quantify the aligned reads per gene. The raw read count table for genes generated utilizing the HTSeq count were used as an input to perform two-dimensional principal component analysis (PCA) and unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis using DESeq2 Bioconductor package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Love et al., 2014</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://chipster.csc.fi/manual/deseq2-pca-heatmap.html">https://chipster.csc.fi/manual/deseq2-pca-heatmap.html</ext-link>). Next, to perform the differential gene expression (DGE) analysis, the DESeq2 Bioconductor package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Love et al., 2014</xref>) was used. The advantage of DEseq2 tool is sensitive and precise for analyzing the DEG in studies with few biological replicates. To reliably estimate the within group variance, Empirical Bayes shrinkage for dispersion estimation was used and a dispersion value for each gene was estimated through a model fit procedure (refer to the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>, which illustrates the shrinkage estimation for the experimental conditions). The gene features obtained after the dispersion estimation were used to perform statistical testing. Next, negative binomial generalized linear model was fitted for each gene and Wald test (raw p-value) was calculated to test the significance. Finally, DEseq2 applies Benjamini–Hochberg correction test to control the FDR (refer to the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref> indicating the distribution of raw and FDR adjusted p-value for the experimental conditions). In our DEG analysis, we have set the FDR (p adj.) cutoff as less than or equal to 0.05 (FDR/p-adj ≤ 0.05) for pathway analysis and gene overlap analysis.

Based on leads from the transcriptomics data, the authors performed histology and in vitro gene overexpression and silencing studies to show that TGFβ signaling mediated upregulation of SERPINH1/Hsp47 mediates endothelial to mesenchymal transition in cardiac endothelial cells. Overall, the paper is well-written with extensive data that support the conclusions. It is timely work that integrates effects of risk factors horizontally and also examines function for some of the noted changes, and thus it provides a more thorough understanding of age-related CVD.</p><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>Reviewers were in agreement that a modest amount of validation of senescence phenotype would strengthen the conclusions. It was suggested to consider RT-PCR, senescence-associate b-gal in vitro, and/or perhaps investigating expression of SASP (senescence-associated-secretory phenotype) genes. This was thought to be important for obesity and pressure overload groups, that have not been linked to EC senescence in the literature. For example, subsection “SERPINH1/HSP47 is needed for collagen 1 deposition by ECs”, larger cells in HSP47 overexpression, is this characterized by senescence and could it be investigated by b-galactosidase staining.</p><p>Revisions expected in follow-up work:</p><p>If you cannot perform some of the suggested experiments due to pandemic-related issues, we ask that you temper your conclusions regarding the link to senescence for this work, and plan to submit further work as described above.</p><p>Numerous points were raised by the reviewers that it was felt could be dealt with via text revisions and/or data reanalysis:</p><p>1) Please discuss what might drive repression of TGF-b upon exercise? Removal of stress products, better oxygenation, improved flow and thereby reduced EndMT?</p><p>2) How do markers of inflammation change in the datasets? Note that TGFb is also linked to inflammation.</p><p>3) What is the potential effect of sex-specific changes? One reviewer noted that some of the groups were not sex-matched, and it was felt that discussion of this variable was warranted. For example, while most experimental approaches used male mice, females were used for the exercise training experiment in old mice. They were also older that the males used in the aging approach. Remarkably, exercise suppressed Vwa1 and Tgfbr2 expression in cardiac EC from young male but not from aged female whereas exercise diminished Vim expression in EC from aged female but not from young males. Is it possible that sex was a confounding factor for these discrepancies? Please clearly state the sex throughout the text (and figures) and also emphasize that sex needs to be take into account on their conclusion.</p><p>4) Please discuss HSP47 expression – it was expressed throughout the human cardiac EC. Differential expression in arteries vs veins, what about specifically the coronary vessels?</p><p>5) Please speculate a little more on relevance of genes in different groups – for example, Figure 3: Are all genes presented that are up in sedentary then &quot;bad&quot; genes? How come exercise creates increased downregulation of genes while fewer upregulated? Does exercise provide more of a break upon gene regulation than actually stimulating the transcriptome? Is exercise more suppressive than promoting? Or just skewed presentation of data?</p><p>6) Figure 6B, lentiviral silencing of Serpinh1, batch #3 and #4 affected cell viability? Authors claim decreased cell density. Or is proliferation affected i.e. downregulated?</p><p>7) It is counter intuitive to see that overexpression of SERPINH1 promotes cell proliferation in wound healing assay when it is associated with senescence wherein proliferative arrest is expected. Please address this in the Discussion.</p><p>8) In Figure 1B, please confirm the number of animals in TAC(2) group. It appears that there are only 2 animals in the group which makes it not ideal for statistical analysis.</p><p>9) Although the expression of SerpinH1 was validated in human hearts, healthy hearts were used for that approach.

Exercise increases blood flow and shear stress, inducing eNOS expression and NO production, thus possibly providing link to attenuated TGF-b pathway activity in our experiment. Interestingly, there are recent papers linking exercise to TGF-b signaling in rat heart and human skeletal muscle. We have included discussion about this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) How do markers of inflammation change in the datasets?

The genes were selected based on a recent paper by Mike Simons’ group published in Nature Metabolism, where they present a gene list for TGF-b mediated inflammatory response in ECs (PMID: 31572976). We also used Gene Ontology term “inflammatory response” (GO:0006954) for validating the genes for the analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) What is the potential effect of sex-specific changes?

We used male mice for all RNAseq experiments. Following these findings, we also wanted to test the effect of exercise in old mice, especially to see if it can attenuate SerpinH1 expression also in old mice. For this experiment, we chose female mice to evaluate, if the effect is seen in females as well. The perfect set up would have included both old male and female mice with and without exercise training, however, in practice this was not feasible. Even though exercise training attenuated SerpinH1 expression also in aged female mice, not all genes responded the same as in young males. Thus, it will be important to evaluate the effects of CVD risk factors also in female mice, both young and old. We have now added information about the sex of the mice to all figure legends and clarified this in the Materials and methods, and added the sex aspect also to the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Please discuss HSP47 expression – it was expressed throughout the human cardiac EC. Differential expression in arteries vs veins, what about specifically the coronary vessels?</p></disp-quote><p>We used EndoDB (dataset E-GEOD-43475) to compare the HSP47 expression in various human endothelial cells, both cell lines and primary cells. The results show that there is abundant and highly similar expression of SERPINH1/HSP47 in endothelial cells from different tissues and in both arteries and veins. The results are added as a Figure 4—figure supplement 3A and to the Results and Discussion sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Please speculate a little more on relevance of genes in different groups – for example, Figure 3: Are all genes presented that are up in sedentary then &quot;bad&quot; genes? How come exercise creates increased downregulation of genes while fewer upregulated? Does exercise provide more of a break upon gene regulation than actually stimulating the transcriptome? Is exercise more suppressive than promoting? Or just skewed presentation of data?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out, we have now added more detailed discussion in the text. We believe that the reason why exercise had more downregulated that upregulated genes is due to the chronic effects that were studied here. Acute exercise would likely induce e.g. angiogenesis genes, which are already attenuated after six weeks of training, when the vasculature has been already adapted to the training load. Thus, at this point the upregulated genes reflect quiescence and stabilization of the vasculature and downregulated genes attenuation of (pathological) signaling pathways, e.g. TGF-b.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 6B, lentiviral silencing of Serpinh1, batch #3 and #4 affected cell viability? Authors claim decreased cell density. Or is proliferation affected i.e. downregulated?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now performed EdU labeling to analyze the proliferation vs. migration effects of SERPINH1 overexpression and silencing. Overexpression significantly increases EC proliferation about 20%, however, this is much smaller effect than seen in the wound healing assay. Based on this, we conclude that SERPINH1 increases especially cell migration, which is in line with increased mesenchymal properties. In contrast, silencing of SERPINH1 resulted in almost complete inhibition of proliferation, which explains the loss of cells after 10 days in culture, and also the impaired wound healing. These new results are added to Figure 7E-G and to the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) It is counter intuitive to see that overexpression of SERPINH1 promotes cell proliferation in wound healing assay when it is associated with senescence wherein proliferative arrest is expected. Please address this in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>This is true, and we have now looked at this in more detail during the revision. Indeed, the analysis of SA-β-gal and SASP genes confirms the pathway analysis results, that SERPINH1 promotes senescence in ECs. Counter intuitively, the EdU analysis demonstrated slightly increased proliferation, but together with the wound healing assay the results suggest that increase in migration is more pronounced. We have now discussed this discrepancy and propose that the increased migration and proliferation reflect the acquired mesenchymal features, which likely overrides the effects of senescence-related changes, at least in early cultures (48h post-transduction), but this might change over time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) In Figure 1B, please confirm the number of animals in TAC(2) group. It appears that there are only 2 animals in the group which makes it not ideal for statistical analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>For the FACS analysis of this group, we unfortunately lost two samples. However, we have reported the two samples as they are highly similar to the ones observed at 7 weeks after TAC. Thus, even this is not enough for reliable statistical analyses, we believe that these two values represent the phenomenon rather well.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Although the expression of SerpinH1 was validated in human hearts, healthy hearts were used for that approach. Is there any evidence that SerpinH1 is increased in patients presenting the major risks factors for CVD? Perhaps considering citing Kato et al., 2017.</p></disp-quote><p>Currently, there is not much data about SERPINH1/HSP47 in human disease, especially related to CVD. The study by Kato et al. proposes that EndMT and increased SERPINH1/HSP47 are related to atrial fibrillation, which is often related to fibrosis. We have now discussed this in the text.</p></body></sub-article></article>
