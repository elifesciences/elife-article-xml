In some tissular contexts, phosphorylation of Serine180 occurs in asymmetrically dividing cells but not in their symmetrically dividing neighbours. In neuroblasts, Serine180 phosphomutants disrupt the timing of basal polarisation. Serine180 phosphomutants also affect the specification and binary cell fate determination of sensory organ precursors as well as Baz localisation during their asymmetric cell divisions.

This spatiotemporal organization is particularly critical for certain types of asymmetric cell division that generate different cell fates in a single division. Cell fate differences in the resulting daughter cells can stem, for instance, from the asymmetric subcellular localisation of fate determinants in the dividing cell. This asymmetry results in the daughter cell receiving distinct sets of molecular information. In such divisions, the subcellular localisation and segregation of molecules involved in fate decisions needs to be timed along the cell cycle for proper establishment of cells fates of the resulting daughter cells. The molecular mechanisms underpinning this coordination are not fully resolved.</p><p>Studies in worms and in flies have uncovered key aspects into the coupling of the cell cycle and cell fate and suggest that the cell cycle dependent regulation of cell polarity is important in this context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Noatynska et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fichelson et al., 2005</xref>). In many asymmetric dividing cells, the conserved PAR polarity complex, composed of PAR-3, PAR-6 and atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goldstein and Macara, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goehring, 2014</xref>), polarises prior to division. The PAR polarity complex exhibits cell-cycle dependent localisation in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> zygote (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kemphues, 2000</xref>) and many stem and precursor cells, such as neural precursors in the chick (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Das and Storey, 2012</xref>) and fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexandre et al., 2010</xref>), muscle stem cells in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dumont et al., 2015</xref>), and stem and precursor cells of the developing central and peripheral nervous system of <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wodarz et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schober et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bellaïche et al., 2001</xref>). The mechanisms controlling the subcellular localisation and function of the PAR complex in cycling cells are poorly understood.</p><p>In the <italic>C. elegans</italic> zygote, the coordination of cell polarity by the cell cycle machinery is critical for a successful asymmetric division establishing the precursor of the germ line and that of somatic fates in a single division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rose and Kemphues, 1998</xref>). Cell cycle kinases like Plk1 and Aurora A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim and Griffin, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Reich et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schumacher et al., 1998</xref>) regulate polarity in the zygote required for the establishment of PAR anterior-posterior polarisation. In flies, the homologs of Plk1 and Aurora A and the master regulator of cell cycle transitions, CDK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nurse, 1997</xref>), have been implicated in linking cell cycle and asymmetric division in the central and peripheral nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tio et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wirtz-Peitz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> neural stem cells called neuroblasts are a well-studied model for asymmetric cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sunchu and Cabernard, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tassan and Kubiak, 2017</xref>). Neuroblasts divide asymmetrically generating a self-renewed neuroblast and a differentiating daughter cell. This outcome relies on a series of events taking place during mitosis. In prophase, PAR proteins (PAR-6, aPKC and PAR-3, known as Baz in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) accumulate to a cortical domain, defining the apical pole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rolls et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wodarz et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wodarz et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Petronczki and Knoblich, 2001</xref>). The earliest signs of neuroblast polarisation in mitosis include the recruitment of Baz from the cytoplasm to a broad apical area at the onset of prophase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hannaford et al., 2018</xref>). At nuclear envelope breakdown (NEB), basal-to-apical actin-driven cortical flows then lead to the coalescence of Baz into continuous a continuous cluster that forms a bright apical crescent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Oon and Prehoda, 2019</xref>). The signals that drive Baz coalescence and its functional significance in neuroblasts are unknown.</p><p>Following nuclear envelope break down, the PAR complex excludes cell fate determinants such as Miranda, Pon and Numb from the apical pole <italic>via</italic> aPKC activity, leading to their localisation at the opposite basal pole. At metaphase, the mitotic spindle aligns with the apical basal polarity axis, leading to the asymmetric segregation of fate determinants into the differentiating daughter cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gillies and Cabernard, 2011</xref>). Therefore, cell polarity and the cell cycle are tightly coordinated in neuroblasts, with apical polarity assembled and disassembled at each cell cycle. Baz is heavily regulated by phosphorylation by different kinases including PAR-1 and aPKC in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benton and St Johnston, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Morais-de-Sá et al., 2010</xref>) and additionally by Aurora A, Plk1 and other kinases in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dickinson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Khazaei and Püschel, 2009</xref>). Thus, cell-cycle-dependent kinases, indispensable for the spatio-temporal regulation of cell divisions, are promising candidates for coordinating polarity with the cell cycle through direct phosphorylation of Baz.</p><p>Some polarity proteins are phosphorylated by cell-cycle-dependent kinases during asymmetric neuroblast division: Aurora A phosphorylates PAR-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wirtz-Peitz et al., 2008</xref>) and Polo, the fly homolog of Plk1, phosphorylates Pon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2007</xref>). Importantly, although these phosphorylation events control basal polarity, apical Baz polarity remains largely unaffected in <italic>aurora A</italic> and <italic>polo</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, Baz asymmetric localisation was reported to be lost in embryonic neuroblasts expressing a dominant negative form of CDK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tio et al., 2001</xref>). Thereby, direct phosphorylation of Baz by CDK1 may be the temporal trigger driving Baz polarisation in mitotic neuroblasts.</p><p>Like in neuroblasts, Baz polarity is coupled to the cell cycle in asymmetrically dividing sensory organ precursors (SOPs) in the peripheral nervous system of the fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bellaïche et al., 2001</xref>). In this system, SOP cells are first specified through a Notch-dependent lateral inhibition mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Simpson, 1990</xref>), and then undergo a series of asymmetric cell divisions generating five cells. At the end of each division, the asymmetric segregation of Notch regulators results in the differential activation of the Notch pathway in each daughter cell, assigning them different identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schweisguth, 2015</xref>). Downregulation of CDK1 activity in SOPs delays mitosis and causes mother-to-daughter cell fate transformations occurring without divisions, affecting polarity orientation when cells eventually divide, and ultimately leads to loss of external organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fichelson and Gho, 2004</xref>). Interestingly, Cyclin A, a CDK1 activator, was recently found to colocalise with Baz at the posterior cortex of mitotic SOPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Darnat et al., 2022</xref>), consistent with the possibility that CDK1 may directly phosphorylate Baz.</p><p>Here, we used live cell imaging and chemical genetics to study the cell cycle and cell polarity coordination in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblasts and SOPs. We generated an analog-sensitive allele of CDK1 allowing us to tune CDK1 activity. Partial CDK1 inhibition in larval neuroblasts affects Baz polarity by preventing apical crescent coalescence at NEB. We identified a consensus CDK phosphorylation on the Baz sequence (Baz-S180), against which we developed a phospho-specific antibody. In larval brains and the pupal notum at 16 hr after puparium formation (APF), Baz-S180 is phosphorylated specifically during the asymmetric division of neuroblasts and sensory organ precursors but not during the symmetric cell divisions of neighbouring cells. Baz-S180 is also phosphorylated in non-mitotic cells earlier in the pupal notum (8 hr APF), during the specification of sensory organ precursors. We generated Baz-S180 phosphomutants and observed that, despite not being necessary for Baz localisation, phosphorylation of Baz-S180 controls the timing of basal polarisation in neuroblasts. In sensory organs, Baz-S180 phosphomutants affect the specification of sensory organs precursors, binary cell fate decisions following their ACD, and Baz localisation during ACD of the pIIa cell. Finally, we report that Baz-S180 and an ‘equivalent’ Serine on human PARD3 are substrates for CDK1/Cyclin B in vitro.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation and in vivo analysis of an analog-sensitive allele of CDK1</title><p>To investigate the role of CDK1 in regulating Baz localisation during the neuroblast cell cycle we generated an analog sensitive allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lopez et al., 2014</xref>) of <italic>cdk1</italic>, <italic>cdk1<sup>F80A</sup></italic>, henceforth called <italic>cdk1<sup>as2</sup></italic>. To test whether CDK1 activity can be acutely and specifically inhibited in these mutants, we exposed control and <italic>cdk1<sup>as2</sup></italic> larval brains to the ATP analog 1-NA-PP1, using cell cycle arrest as an indicator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nurse, 1997</xref>). As we previously showed that 10 µM of 1-NA-PP1 acutely blocks an analog sensitive version of aPKC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hannaford et al., 2019</xref>), we used 10 µM as a starting concentration. While control neuroblasts continued proliferating after exposure to 1-NA-PP1, <italic>cdk1<sup>as2</sup></italic> neuroblasts stopped dividing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and A’</xref>). Interestingly, upon 1-NA-PP1 addition, early prophase <italic>cdk1<sup>as2</sup></italic> neuroblasts lost their apical Baz crescent and did not further proceed through mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), apparently reverting back to interphase, a reported effect of CDK1 inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Potapova et al., 2011</xref>). Another expected effect of CDK1 inhibition is exit from mitosis in metaphase-arrested cells (mitotic exit; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Potapova et al., 2006</xref>). We first exposed neuroblasts to Colcemid to arrest them in metaphase, and then to 1-NA-PP1, which resulted in mitotic slippage within 10 min in the majority of <italic>cdk1<sup>as2</sup></italic> neuroblasts, but not in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and C’</xref>). Interestingly, in neuroblasts that exited mitosis, Baz asymmetry was lost in a manner reminiscent of localisation changes normally occurring with the onset of anaphases of untreated neuroblasts. Like in anaphase, Baz crescents spread along the lateral cortex while the cell elongated along the apico-basal axis, after which Baz eventually dissipated into the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

CDK1 inhibition with 10 µM 1-NA-PP1 prevents neuroblasts from cycling and causes metaphase-arrested neuroblasts to slip out of mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), which prevents the analysis of polarizing or polarized neuroblasts. Therefore, we partially inhibited Cdk1 using lower concentration of 1-NA-PP1. <italic>cdk1<sup>as2</sup></italic> neuroblasts stopped proliferating when exposed to 1 µM or higher concentrations but continued proliferating at a slower rate in the presence of 0.5 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Hence, 10 µM 1-NA-PP1 likely fully inhibits CDK1 and 0.5 µM partially inhibits CDK1. We compared apical polarity in mitosis of control and <italic>cdk1<sup>as2</sup></italic> neuroblasts before and after exposure to 0.5 µM 1-NA-PP1. In control cells, Baz polarized in a dynamic manner. First, it was recruited to a broad cortical crescent during prophase, which then coalesced into a smaller, brighter crescent at NEB, as previously described for unperturbed neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hannaford et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Oon and Prehoda, 2019</xref>). Interestingly, although Baz still polarized upon partial CDK1 inhibition in <italic>cdk1<sup>as2</sup></italic> neuroblasts, apical Baz crescents appeared fainter and wider than during the previous cell cycle occurring before exposure to 1-NA-PP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and A’</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Thus, Baz crescents fail to coalesce at NEB upon partial CDK1 inhibition. As Baz polarity was previously shown to be completely lost in dominant negative <italic>cdk1</italic> mutant embryonic neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tio et al., 2001</xref>), we tested the effect of partial inhibition of CDK1 in larval neuroblasts in a sensitized context. Baz localisation is dependent on an oligomerization domain (OD) and a lipid binding domain (LD), which are functionally redundant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kullmann and Krahn, 2018</xref>). We reasoned that deletion of either of these domains might make Baz localisation more sensitive to disruptions and lead to complete loss of polarity upon partial inhibition of CDK1. However, Baz deletion mutants for either of these domains still polarized when we partially inhibited CDK1, and only presented an apical coalescence defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). To test whether embryonic neuroblasts are more sensitive to CDK1 inhibition than larval neuroblasts, we exposed embryonic neuroblasts to 0.5 µM 1-NA-PP1. Again, partial inhibition of CDK1 in embryonic neuroblasts resulted in defective coalescence but not in complete loss of polarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We conclude that high levels of CDK1 activity are needed for full apical polarization of embryonic and larval neuroblasts by driving apical coalescence.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Partial inhibition of analog-sensitive CDK1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Two consecutive divisions of live control and <italic>cdk1<sup>as2</sup></italic> cycling neuroblasts expressing Baz::GFP, before and after addition of 1-NA-PP1 0.5 µM at t0.

To investigate this possibility, we allowed neuroblasts to cycle into Colcemid-induced metaphase arrest under partial CDK1 inhibition.

The observation that non-coalesced crescents remain stable in metaphase enabled us to next test whether restoring normal CDK1 activity in metaphase-arrested neuroblasts could reinstate Baz crescent coalescence. Indeed, 37% of metaphase-arrested neuroblasts with non-coalesced crescents gradually concentrated Baz in narrow and brighter crescents following 1-NA-PP1 washout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Thus, partial inhibition of CDK1 can briefly destabilize Baz crescents in cycling neuroblasts, but not in metaphase-arrested neuroblasts.

As aPKC orchestrates basal cell fate determinant localisation by directly phosphorylating them or their adapters, we tested whether weaker aPKC polarity was correlated with abnormal basal polarization.

This excess of bristles could be indicative of defects in lateral inhibition, a Notch-dependent mechanism restricting the number of sensory organ precursors. It could also result from defects in asymmetric cell divisions in the sensory organ precursor lineage leading to cell fate transformations such as socket-to-shaft transformations. To investigate both possibilities, we stained pupal nota for SOP lineage (Cut) and socket cell (Su(H)) markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Rescue by the Baz-S180 phosphomutants in the <italic>baz, delta</italic> double RNAi background resulted in significantly more SOPs to be formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>) and in significantly more socket-to-shaft transformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>) than rescue by Baz<sup>WT</sup>::GFP, suggesting a Notch loss of function during lateral inhibition and following asymmetric cell divisions, respectively. Thus, in the absence of Delta, phosphorylation of Baz-S180 affects sensory organ formation both during the initial specification of SOPs and during the asymmetric cell divisions they undergo later.</p><p>The latter is consistent with the observation that Baz-S180 is phosphorylated in mitotic SOPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In contrast, we were puzzled by the involvement of Baz-S180 phosphorylation in SOP specification: the lateral inhibition process does not involve ACD, whereas Baz-S180 phosphorylation is restricted to ACD in the larval brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) and in the pupal notum at the developmental stage when SOPs divide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This prompted us to test whether Baz-S180 is phosphorylated earlier in the notum, during lateral inhibition. Microchaete SOPs are specified within Delta-positive stripes of proneural cells between 10 and 12 hr APF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Usui and Kimura, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Parks et al., 1997</xref>). We observed patches of Baz-pS180-positive cells that overlapped with these Delta-positive stripes at 8 hr APF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>) These observations are consistent with a role of Baz-S180 phosphorylation in lateral inhibition and indicate that it is not ACD-specific in this tissue at this developmental stage. Importantly, a strong Baz-pS180 signal was also present outside of these stripes, in particular close to the scutellar macrochaetes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>, arrowhead), in a region devoid of microchaete SOPs. This suggests that Baz-S180 phosphorylation may have additional roles during development.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Phosphorylation of Baz-S180 controls Baz localisation during pIIa division</title><p>To test whether Baz-S180 phosphorylation influences its localisation in SOPs and their lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), we used the Neur-GAL4 driver to express our Baz::GFP constructs and to deplete <italic>delta</italic> and endogenous <italic>baz::mScarlet</italic> by RNAi. Baz::mScarlet appeared to be efficiently depleted in microchaete SOPs in the pupal notum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) but adult flies did not have any sensory organ formation defect (not shown), perhaps because of an incomplete Delta depletion, which we did not assess. Surprisingly, we observed that only a subset of microchaete SOPs in the pupal notum expressed our Neur-GAL4, UASz-controlled Baz::GFP constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). As SOPs and their progeny underwent asymmetric cell divisions, Baz::GFP started to be gradually expressed in other SOPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), but, in most cases, not in their entire lineage. Baz::GFP sometimes started after the pI division in both its daughter cells, but was more often restricted to the pIIb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>), pIIa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>) or pIIIb lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The Baz-S180 phosphomutants localisation did not appear to be affected during the ACD of pI: in metaphase, they formed posterior crescents which intensity was not significantly different from Baz<sup>WT</sup>::GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and D’</xref>). The unexpected spatio-temporal mosaicism of our Baz::GFP transgenes within the SOP lineage gave us the opportunity to measure cortical Baz::GFP levels during pIIa division without any contribution from its sister cell pIIb, in cases where Baz::GFP expression was limited to the pIIa lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). In contrast to pI division, the Baz-S180 phosphomutants localisation differed from Baz<sup>WT</sup>::GFP during pIIa metaphase.

Based on the observation on fixed tissues that dominant negative or thermosensitive <italic>cdk1</italic> alleles do not prevent embryonic neuroblasts from cycling but disrupt their polarity, asymmetric cell division was proposed to strictly rely on high levels of CDK1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tio et al., 2001</xref>). However, using live imaging analysis and chemical genetics, we did not reproduce these observations: the apical polarity protein Baz still polarizes upon partial inhibition of CDK1 using an analog-sensitive allele of <italic>cdk1</italic>, both in embryonic and larval neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). A possible cause for this discrepancy could be that loss of Baz polarity was previously only reported with the dominant negative <italic>cdk1<sup>E51Q</sup></italic> allele, for which neomorphic activity cannot be ruled out, whereas loss of polarity in the thermosensitive <italic>cdk1</italic> genetic situation was only reported for another apical polarity protein, Inscuteable. Considering that Baz functions upstream of Inscuteable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schober et al., 1999</xref>), it is possible that Baz localisation is not affected in this situation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>High CDK1 activity triggers apical coalescence</title><p>While partial inhibition using the analog-sensitive allele of cdk1 did not abolish Baz polarity, it did prevent apical coalescence: large apical crescents formed during prophase failed to coalesce into smaller crescents at NEB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Although our observations show that high CDK1 activity is required for apical coalescence, the exact mechanism regulating this process remains elusive. Our previous observation that aPKC inhibition can result in apical crescents coalescing in the wrong direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hannaford et al., 2019</xref>) suggests that apical polarity proteins are involved in some aspects of this process. As coalescence was not affected in Baz-S180 phosphomutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), CDK1-dependent control of apical coalescence might be controlled by other CDK1 phosphosites on Baz or other CDK1 targets. RhoGAPs and RhoGEFs are promising candidates for this: first, apical coalescence of neuroblasts is driven by basal-to-apical actomyosin-driven cortical flows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Oon and Prehoda, 2019</xref>), reminiscent of the ones polarising <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Munro et al., 2004</xref>) induced by asymmetric localisation of the RhoGEF ECT-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Motegi and Sugimoto, 2006</xref>) second, ECT-2 can be phosphorylated by CDK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Niiya et al., 2005</xref>). Based on the observation that some RhoGEFs such as the fly ECT-2 homolog Pebble can be sequestered in the nucleus until NEB and that apical coalescence occurs at NEB, a tempting model for the temporal regulation of coalescence would be that the release of RhoGEFs at NEB triggers a basal-to-apical flow. However, we showed that NEB and apical coalescence can be temporally uncoupled by first partially inhibiting CDK1, then restoring its full activity after NEB has occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Thus, although an involvement of NEB cannot be ruled out in its temporal control, it is ultimately high CDK1 activity that triggers apical coalescence. Interestingly, enlarged Baz crescents were observed in <italic>aurora A</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang et al., 2006</xref>). Given that CDK1 activates Aurora A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Van Horn et al., 2010</xref>), this raises the possibility that CDK1 drives apical coalescence via Aurora A activation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Function of apical coalescence</title><p>Beyond its regulation, the function of apical coalescence is unknown. Based on our observation that partial inhibition of CDK1 not only leads to defective coalescence but also to crescent instability in metaphase in cycling neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), we initially speculated that coalescence, by concentrating apical polarity proteins, might reinforce positive feedback loops for apical protein concentration and thus stabilize them. However, partial inhibition of CDK1 and the resulting failure to coalesce surprisingly did not seem to affect crescent stability in metaphase-arrested neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). A possible explanation for this difference between cycling and arrested cells could be that, in cycling cells, partial inhibition of CDK1 somehow prematurely triggers some anaphase events involving Baz crescents disassembly, uncoupling them from other anaphase events such as DNA segregation and cortical furrowing. Regardless of the reason for this difference, apical coalescence is not necessary for apical polarity maintenance. However, we did observe that basal Numb crescents significantly increased in intensity upon partial inhibition of CDK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H and K</xref>). We speculate that enlarged apical crescents might be able to exclude basal protein further down the apico-basal axis, concentrating basal components in smaller basal crescents. Brighter Numb crescents did not appear noticeably smaller than in controls in our fixed tissue analysis, but live imaging of neuroblasts in culture would be necessary to accurately measure basal crescents size. An alternative explanation could be that, upon partial inhibition of CDK1, a longer cell cycle allows neuroblasts to synthesize more Numb, raising the interesting possibility of a modulation of the strength of basal asymmetry by cell cycle duration. Finding ways of interfering with coalescence without increasing cell cycle length would be necessary to test this. Finally, it is possible that loss of basal-to-apical flows could affect the properties of the basal cortex, impacting basal fate determinants localisation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Phosphorylation of Baz-S180 by CDK1</title><p>We confirmed in vitro that Baz-S180 is phosphorylated by CDK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>), as suggested by its consensus CDK phosphorylation motif near Cyclin and Cks1 binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This seems consistent with our observation that Baz-S180 is phosphorylated in asymmetrically dividing neuroblasts and SOPs. However, CDK1 is also involved during symmetric cell divisions, in which we could not detect any Baz-S180 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). This difference might result from higher CDK1 activity than in symmetrically dividing cells, from an asymmetric cell division-specific adaptor between CDK1 and Baz, or from asymmetric celldivision-specific inhibition of Baz-S180 dephosphorylation. It is also noteworthy that Cyclin A colocalises with Baz in asymmetrically dividing SOPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Darnat et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), perhaps explaining SOP-specific Baz-S180 phosphorylation. However, none of the CDK1-associated Cyclins localise asymmetrically to the mitotic neuroblasts cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Alternatively, Baz-S180 could simply be phosphorylated by another as-yet-unknown kinase specifically expressed in asymmetrically dividing cell and only active during mitosis. Despite only being observed during ACD in larval brains and the pupal notum at 16 hr APF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), Baz-S180 phosphorylation is not strictly ACD-specific throughout development, as we observed it in large patches of non-mitotic epithelial cells in the early pupal notum at 8 hr APF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). Although these cells are not mitotic, we cannot exclude that this phosphorylation is mediated by CDK1: all cells of the notum are arrested in G2 at this developmental stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hunter et al., 2016</xref>) and CDK1 can be active in G2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hochegger et al., 2008</xref>). Again, this does not explain why Baz-S180 is not phosphorylated in all these G2-arrested cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>), and it is possible that another kinase is responsible for the Baz-S180 phosphorylation pattern of 8 hr APF nota.</p><p>Importantly, we found that CDK1 phosphorylates in vitro Serine S187 of PARD3, the human ortholog of Baz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). PARD3-S187 is, like Baz-S180 in close proximity to an N-terminal 14-3-3 binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) regulating PAR-3 proteins localisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benton and St Johnston, 2003</xref>). Whether PARD3-S187 is also phosphorylated in vivo in a tissue-specific, cell cycle stage-specific and/or ACD-specific manner in humans remains to be determined.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Function of Baz-S180 phosphorylation in neuroblasts</title><p>We used Baz-S180 phosphomutants in the absence of endogenous Baz to investigate the function of this phosphorylation, expecting it to be necessary for the timing of Baz polarization based on its mitosis-specificity, and/or for Baz ability to polarize, given its asymmetric cell division-specificity. However, neither polarization itself, nor its timing, nor its maintenance were affected in Baz-S180 phosphomutant neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–D</xref>). Thus, Baz-S180 phosphorylation is not the temporal cue coordinating cell polarity and the cell cycle (or at least not the only one), and the observed effects upon full (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) or partial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) CDK1 inhibition on Baz localisation and dynamics are likely caused by other phosphosites on Baz and/or other CDK1 substrates. Although apical Baz crescents were apparently unaffected in Baz-S180 phosphomutants, the formation of basal Mira and Numb crescents was affected in metaphase. In contrast, basal crescents were indistinguishable from controls in anaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–H’</xref>), perhaps through the ‘telophase rescue’ mechanism that somehow restores defective basal polarity in <italic>baz</italic> and <italic>insc</italic> mutant neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schober et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wodarz et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Why the establishment of basal polarity is delayed in Baz-S180 phosphomutants remains unclear. As the function of the PAR complex is to exclude Miranda from the apical pole by phosphorylating it, defective recruitment of Miranda to the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) suggests a gain of function of the PAR complex in Baz-S180 phosphomutants. We speculate that it might be caused by an excessive transfer of aPKC from an immobile apical Baz/aPKC/PAR-6 complex to a more diffusible Cdc42/aPKC/PAR-6 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rodriguez et al., 2017</xref>), able to phosphorylate Miranda further down the apico-basal axis. In contrast, uniform localisation of Numb in metaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>) suggests a loss of function of the PAR complex. This stark difference between Numb and Mira might come from the fact that, unlike Mira, Numb localisation is not only controlled by phosphorylation by the PAR complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Smith et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wirtz-Peitz et al., 2008</xref>), but also by Polo-mediated phosphorylation of its binding partner Pon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Function of Baz-S180 phosphorylation in sensory organs formation</title><p>We showed that sensory organs formation is affected in Baz-S180 phosphomutants: we observed an excess of bristles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D’</xref>) caused by the specification of too many sensory organ precursor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>) and by lineage transformations leading to an excess of shaft cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). These phenotypes are consistent with Baz-S180 being phosphorylated in the notum during both SOP specification at 8 hr APF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>) and asymmetric SOP divisions at 16 hr APF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Both phenotypes are classically caused by a Notch loss of function. When SOPs are specified through Notch-dependent lateral inhibition, failure to activate Notch in their neighbouring cells allows them to also be specified as SOPs, leading to supernumerary sensory organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Simpson, 1990</xref>). Later on, failure to activate the Notch pathway following ACDs taking place in the SOP lineage leads to cell fate transformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schweisguth, 2015</xref>), such as socket-to-shaft transformations causing one sensory organ to produce two bristles. Notch loss of function during ACD in the Baz phosphomutants could be due to defective cell polarity-controlled asymmetric segregation of Notch regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schweisguth, 2015</xref>), or to defective Baz-dependent recruitment of Notch at the interface of daughter cells following ACD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wu et al., 2023b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Houssin et al., 2021</xref>). We speculate that Baz involvement in lateral inhibition may be mediated by a similar, yet untested Baz-dependent recruitment of Notch or its ligands at the interface between Notch signal-sending and signal-receiving cells during this process. Baz was also shown to be somehow involved in the activation of the Notch intracellular domain following its cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wu et al., 2023a</xref>), which may have implications for the regulation of both lateral inhibition and ACD.</p><p>Unlike in neuroblasts, Baz-S180 phosphorylation controls its localisation in SOPs, at least during ACD of the pIIa cell. During pIIa metaphase, Baz<sup>S180A</sup> crescents were weaker than controls and Baz<sup>S180D</sup> crescents were displaced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). In contrast, Baz phosphomutants crescents appeared normal during pI division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). This difference may come from different mechanisms controlling division orientation <italic>via</italic> cell polarity: pI polarization is oriented at the tissular level by planar cell polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gho and Schweisguth, 1998</xref>), whereas pIIa polarization is oriented by an E-Cadherin-rich cortical patch allowing it to retain the division orientation of its mother cell pI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Le Borgne et al., 2002</xref>). Our results suggest that Baz-S180 phosphorylation is specifically involved in this division axis maintenance mechanism in pIIa. It is noteworthy that, with the exceptions of basal polarization being more delayed in <italic>baz<sup>S180D</sup></italic> than in <italic>baz<sup>S180A</sup></italic> in neuroblasts as well as Baz polarization being differently affected in <italic>baz<sup>S180A</sup></italic> and <italic>baz<sup>S180D</sup></italic> during pIIa division in SOPs<italic>,</italic> the Baz-S180 non-phosphorylatable and phosphomimetic mutants give the same phenotypes. This is likely because phosphomimetics do not always faithfully reproduce the effects of a phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gogl et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Robustness of Baz localisation and function</title><p>Across the few decades during which Baz has been studied, a recurring observation is that Baz-dependent processes are often robust, involving context-specific functional redundancies between Baz and other proteins. Therefore, despite the central importance of Baz throughout development, disrupting Baz function alone can sometimes lead to mild phenotypes which are significantly worsened by concomitantly interfering with other proteins. Accordingly, Baz functions redundantly with the polarity protein PAR-6 in tracheal terminal cells branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jones and Metzstein, 2011</xref>), with the transmembrane protein Crumbs in the maintenance of epithelial polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Müller and Wieschaus, 1996</xref>), with the Notch ligand Delta in the formation of sensory organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Houssin et al., 2021</xref>), and with the apical polarity Pins in the generation of size asymmetry during neuroblasts asymmetric cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cai et al., 2003</xref>). Beyond redundancies with other proteins, the robustness of Baz function relies on a lipid binding domain and an oligomerization domain, which are both sufficient on their own to support Baz localisation and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kullmann and Krahn, 2018</xref>). In this light, it is perhaps not surprising that the phenotypes that we describe in neuroblasts remain relatively mild: partial inhibition of CDK1 does not abolish apical nor basal polarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), and Baz-S180 phosphomutants display no localisation defect and only a delay in basal polarity establishment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). It is conceivable that, in these situations, Baz localisation and/or function is rescued by another protein. A very likely candidate for this is Pins, known to function redundantly with Baz in neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cai et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Izumi et al., 2004</xref>). Could Pins be phosphorylated by mitotic kinases, and in this case, would both Baz and Pins need to lose the temporal cue provided by phosphorylation to uncouple cell polarity from the cell cycle? In the absence of Pins, would apical coalescence become necessary for the maintenance of apical polarity? Would Baz-S180 phosphomutants fail to polarize? Addressing these questions will be the focus of further studies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

(<bold>3</bold>) The user starts the rotating linescans macro, which perform linescans (i.e. measuring signal at each pixel along the length of line while averaging pixels values along the width of the line) along the wide line selection traced by the user.

For this orientation, the macro measures the pixel values at the intersection between the line selection/cortex and 1 pixel around this intersection. (<bold>5</bold>) The macro performs steps 3 and 4 one optical slice above and one optical slice below the optical slice initially selected by the user.

Briefly, 2–4 L of BL21(DE3) cells were harnessed to express the relevant fragments at 18 C overnight following IPTG induction at OD600=0.8. Following harvest, cells expressing GST-Par3/Baz truncations were thawed on ice and homogenised in Standard Buffer (20 mM HEPES, 250 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM TCEP, pH 7.4). 1 x Protease inhibitor cocktail and 5–10 μL Benzonase were added. Samples were lysed by sonication and centrifuged at 60,000 x <italic>g</italic> at 4 °C for 1 hr. Two mL Glutathione Resin (MRC Reagents and Services) was preequilibrated in Standard Buffer. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.22 μm filter using a syringe and mixed with the pre-equilibrated resin, and incubated on a rotary spinner at 4 °C for 1 hr. Samples were centrifuged at 500 x <italic>g</italic> at 4 °C for 5 min and the flow-through was collected. Forty mL of Buffer 1 was added to the resin, and it was centrifuged at 500 x <italic>g</italic>, 4 °C for 10 min and the excess buffer removed. This wash step was repeated another 2 times. Resin with sample was incubated in 10 mL Standard Buffer supplemented with 10 mM Glutathione to elute the protein. The protein in the supernatant was collected after centrifuging at 500 x <italic>g</italic> at 4 °C for 10 min. Subsequently, the protein elution from the affinity chromatography was injected onto a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 prep grade sizing column (Fisher, #15182085) pre-equilibrated in Standard Buffer and peak fractions were collected. Samples were analysed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie gel stain. Protein fractions were identified, aliquoted snap frozen using LQN2 and stored at –80 °C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Immunoblotting</title><p>Samples were stored at –20 °C until SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and immunoblotting. NuPAGE 4–12% SDS-PAGE gels were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane and incubated with primary antibody diluted in 1 X TBS-T 5% BSA overnight in 4 °C. Phosphospecific anti-baz pS180 antibody was used at 0.2 µg/mL with 10 µg/mL non-phosphopeptide (S180) to decrease the non-specific background. After incubation with primary antibodies, membranes were washed 3 times with TBS-T buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl supplemented with 0.2% (v/v) Tween-20 (Sigma Aldrich)) and incubated for 1 hr in secondary antibodies (1:10000 dilution in 1 X TBS-T 5% BSA) at room temperature, membranes were washed three times in TBS-T and subjected to Infrared detection using LI-COR Odyssey Clx system.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>In vitro kinase phosphorylation assay</title><p>A total of 2.5 µg of recombinant GST-tagged <italic>Drosophila</italic> Bazooka (2-320) or GST-tagged human PAR3 (2-281) was incubated in the presence or absence of 200 ng human GST-CDK1/GST-Cyclin B1 in a kinase reaction for 60 min at 30 °C.

LC separations were performed with a Thermo Dionex Ultimate 3000 RSLC Nano liquid chromatography instrument using 0.1% formic acid as buffer A and 80% acetonitrile with 0.08% formic acid as buffer B. The peptide samples were loaded on C18 trap columns with 3% acetonitrile / 0.1% trifluoracetic acid at a flow rate of 5 μL/min. Peptide separations were performed over EASY-Spray column (C18, 2 μM, 75 μm x 50 cm) with an integrated nano electrospray emitter at a flow rate of 300 nL/min. Peptides were separated with a 60 min segmented gradient starting from 3% to 7% buffer B over 5 min, 7%~25% buffer B over 43 mins, 25%~35% buffer B over 5 min, then raised to 95% buffer B over 3 min and held for 2 min. Eluted peptides were analysed on an Orbitrap Exploris 480 (ThermoFisher Scientific, San Jose, CA) mass spectrometer. Spray voltage was set to 2 kV, RF lens level was set at 40%, and ion transfer tube temperature was set to 275 °C. The mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent mode (ID low load) with 2 seconds per cycle. The full scan was performed in the range of 350—1200 m/z at nominal resolution of 60,000 at 200 m/z and AGC set to 300% with a custom maximal injection time of 28ms, followed by selection of the most intense ions above an intensity threshold of 10000 for higher-energy collision dissociation (HCD) fragmentation. HCD normalised collision energy was set to 30%. Data-dependent MS2 scans were acquired for charge states 2–6 using an isolation width of 1.2 m/z and a 30 s dynamic exclusion duration. All MS2 scans were recorded with centroid mode using an AGC target set to standard and a maximal fill time of 100ms.</p><p>The.RAW files obtained from the mass spectrometer were processed by Proteome Discoverer v2.4 (ThermoFisher Scientific) using Mascot v 2.6.2 (Matrix Science) as the search engine. A precursor mass tolerance of 10ppm and fragment tolerance of 0.06 was used. An in-house database (MRC_Database_1) was used with trypsin set as the protease which was allowed a maximum of two missed cleavage sites. Oxidation and dioxidation of methionine, phosphorylation of serine, threonine and tyrosine were set as variable modifications, and carbamidomethylation of cysteine was set as a fixed modification. Phospho-site assignment probability was estimated via Mascot and PhosphoRS3.1 (Proteome Discoverer v.1.4-SP1) or ptmRS (Proteome Discoverer v.2.0). ptmRS was used as a scoring system for the phospho site identification, with a mass tolerance of 0.5 and neutral loss peaks were considered. Phosphorylation site localisation was considered correct only if peptides had a Mascot delta score and ptmRS probability score above 85%.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Supervision, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Phosphopeptides identified from phospho-proteomics of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Baz and human PARD3 N-terminal fragments in the presence or absence of CDK1/CyclinB1.</title><p>Bold text: very good position assignment.

Although there are several examples of cell cycle kinases phosphorylating polarity proteins, it has been difficult to assess the importance of these on cell division due to the strong and pleiotropic effects of manipulating these kinases. Here, the authors generate an analogue-sensitive allele of cdk1 in flies to tackle this question in neuroblasts (NBs) and sensory organ precursors (SOPs), two well characterised examples of asymmetric cell divisions. They show that partial Cdk1 inhibition (which still allows cell cycle progression) does not block Bazooka (PARD3 in mammals) polarization in NBs, but prevents coalescence of the Baz crescent, which has previously been shown to be an actomyosin-based process. They further identify a Cdk1 consensus site on Baz (S180) for which they generate a phospho-specific antibody, allowing them to show that this site is specifically phosphorylated in dividing NBs and SOPs. Although mutations at this site do not recapitulate the effect of Cdk1 on Baz coalescence, they do delay Miranda polarization in NBs and affect lateral inhibition and asymmetric cell division of SOPs. Finally, the authors show that human PARD3 can also be phosphorylated by Cyclin B/Cdk1 in vitro.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1. Figure 2A: it would be good to show that polarization of Baz::GFP in consecutive divisions is maintained in cdk1as2 animals in the absence of 1-NA-PP1.</p></disp-quote><p>We now show in Figure 1 —figure supplement 1B a panel with two consecutive divisions of a <italic>cdk1<sup>as2</sup></italic> neuroblast in the absence of 1-NAP-PP1, followed by a third division in the presence of 1-NAP-PP1. The neuroblast shows high levels of Baz polarization in the two first divisions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The interpretation of the observed SOP phenotypes is complicated by the uneven expression of the pnr-GAL4 driver and the fact that it is expressed in epithelial cells rather than just SOPs. The authors could express their control and mutant Baz constructs under the control of neurP72-GAL4. It is not likely they would be able to deplete endogenous Baz as they have done in NBs, as neurP72-GAL4 is expressed too late to deplete most proteins before SOP division, but they could at least look at localization of the mutants and any possible gain-of-function phenotypes.</p></disp-quote><p>Following this suggestion, we have recombined Neur-<italic>GAL4</italic> with UAS-<italic>δ RNAi</italic> to attempt to deplete both endogenous Baz::mScarlet and Δ while expressing our Baz::GFP constructs specifically in SOPs. Baz::mScarlet depletion was surprisingly efficient considering, as the reviewer points out, the late timing of Neur-GAL4 expression. However, the adult flies did not present any sensory organs transformations, perhaps because Δ might not be as efficiently depleted. We can at least rule out dominant-negative effects.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for his constructive feedback and as suggested, we now extensively analysed the localisation of the Baz-S180 mutants in SOPs and found significant defects. We describe these observations in a new Figure 6. Briefly, we observed that the Baz phosphomutants have localisation defects during the pIIa cell division but not the π cell division. We also observed a very surprising mosaicism of expression of our UASz-driven constructs within the SOP lineage that allowed us to make a few interesting observations which should be of interest to SOP specialists. Briefly, mosaic expression of Baz::GFP within the SOP lineage allowed to analyse the relative contributions of pIIa and pIIb/pIIIb to different Baz cortical pools and revealed an unexpected cell non-autonomous mechanism controlling pIIb division orientation. We describe these findings in a new associated supplemental figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors speculate that Baz phosphorylation during lateral inhibition may be the reason for the observed excess specification of SOPs in the S180 mutants. This could easily be tested by looking at their antibody staining at earlier stages in the notum.</p></disp-quote><p>Following this suggestion (also coming from Reviewer #2), we have stained nota between around 8h APF. We observed that patches of cells of the early notum display a strong Baz-pS180 phospho-signal. These patches partially overlap with the Δ-positive stripes in which lateral inhibition occurs (as described for example in Corson et al., 2017), consistent with the possibility that Baz-S180 phosphorylation does somehow regulate lateral inhibition.</p><p>These new experiments clearly show that Baz can be phosphorylated on S180 in cells that do not divide asymmetrically. This led us to change the title.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>This work advances our knowledge of the coupling between the cell cycle and cell polarity during cell division, and shows that Baz/PARD3 receives inputs from Cdk1 that is specific to asymmetrically dividing cells. The reagents generated here (cdk1as2 and phospho-specific antibody) will also be of interest to the field. The data are convincing and well documented. This work should be of broad interest to the stem cell and developmental biology fields. Above are a few suggestions to improve the manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer #2 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>Cell polarization in dividing cells, including stem cells, is typically coupled such that polarity can inform the architecture, orientation, and/or asymmetry during cell division. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> neural stem cells (neuroblasts/SOP), Par polarity is coupled to the cell cycle, but the nature of this coupling remains unclear. In this work, Loyer and colleagues report on impacts of CDK1 inhibition on Bazooka/Par3 localization and basal fate determinant localization. They provide evidence for a novel phosphorylation site that appears unique to asymmetrically dividing cells and may be involved in regulation of asymmetric division. Finally, they show that CDK1 can, at least in principle, phosphorylate human Par3 in vitro.</p><p>Overall, the major claims of the abstract appear supported by the experimental work; however, we think the title overstates the overall conclusions that can be drawn from the work.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>(1) The major claim of the paper is the role of specific phosphorylation of S180 in asymmetrically dividing cells in polarization and sensory organ formation, which relies heavily on interpretation of S180A/D phosphomutants. The experiments are carefully performed and quantified, and are consistent with the conclusions drawn. However, we wondered if it possible that the phenotypes are not linked to phosphorylation (the authors acknowledge this in the Discussion)? In other words could the A/D mutants simply be weak Baz mutants? This could this potentially explain the extra-SOP phenotype if Baz function is generally altered, especially given that it is difficult to rationalise a role for SOP-specific phosphorylation in the processes that specify SOP cells in the precursor epithelial cells. The authors speculate that these early precursors may exhibit also phosphorylation, but this isn't examined. Chasing this down seems key to support the core titular claim of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>Following this suggestion (also coming from Reviewer #1), we have stained nota around 8h APF. We observed that patches of cells of the early notum display a strong Baz-pS180 phospho-signal. These patches partially overlap with the Δ-positive stripes in which lateral inhibition occurs (as described for example in Corson et al., 2017). This result is presented in Figure 5H. As would be the case for any phosphomutant, this does not strictly rule out that the S180A and S180D could simply be weak Baz mutants, but it strongly supports the possibility that the lateral inhibition defects observed in these mutants result from defective Baz-S180 phosphorylation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Implicit in the core message of the paper is the elucidation of CDK1 regulation of polarity and specifically Baz. However, the connection between CDK1 and S180 (and Baz regulation overall) is relatively tenuous in this work. First, the S180A mutant does not phenocopy CDK1 inhibition with respect to basal determinant phenotypes, though obviously CDK1 may be more pleiotropic. Second, whether the CDK1 inhibition phenotype is linked to any effect on Baz/PAR behaviour is not really explored. Third, they do not test whether S180 phosphorylation is CDK1-dependent.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with these comments. We cannot think of any way of addressing the first two points, which would require fully inhibiting CDK1 and somehow maintaining neuroblasts in mitosis to examine how it impacts Baz localisation. We tried to arrest neuroblasts in mitosis and block the proteasome as this at least in HeLa cells led to persistence of mitosis when CDK1 was inhibited (Skoufias et al., 2007). However, neuroblasts arrested in mitosis by proteasome inhibition slipped out of mitosis.</p><p>However, concerning the third point, we now provide evidence showing that, at least in vitro, <italic>Drosophila</italic> BazS180 is phosphorylated by CDK1 (see below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The method for quantifying domain signal only references prior work and should be described in this work. From our search of the cited reference, it appears to be peak signal intensity at a user specified point on the cortex. While this does not undermine the core findings as presented, it may not capture additional features that may be informative (domain size, fluorescence distribution, total signal etc.). For example domain coalescence would imply smaller, brighter domains, but similar total protein amounts, which appears to be the case from images, but isn't quantified per se.</p></disp-quote><p>We now describe our method for quantifying average signal intensity in the middle of the Baz crescents. We agree that quantifying additional features to check whether they are affected by partial CDK1 inhibition would be interesting. However, doing so requires determining exactly where Baz crescents start and end. As Baz crescent edges in neuroblasts often end in a gradient rather than a sharp edge (Hannaford et al., 2018), we are not sure to be able to confidently do so in every case with the image quality of our dataset: we prioritised limiting photobleaching to accurately quantify the levels of endogenously expressed Baz rather than obtaining very sharp and high contrast images. This is further complicated by the fact that, depending on the depth of neuroblasts within the tissue and the orientation of their division relative to the imaging plane, the signal intensity of Baz crescents is quite variable, preventing a simple thresholding approach to arbitrarily determine the limits of crescents based on signal intensity. In short, accurately determining the size of crescents is very challenging.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The phosphospecific antibody signal is relatively weak, leading to relatively low signal to noise, which could compromise the ability to detect phospho-S180 in non-asymmetrically dividing cells or generally in cells in which Baz is not polarised and thus signal would be diffused around the cell rather than concentrated. Similar caveats could also apply to the lack of signal in interphase cells, where Baz may be less enriched at the cortex and not polarized. We are inclined to believe the authors conclusions, particularly given their examination of multiple cell types and tissues. However, it is a potential caveat as it may be most visible in polarised cells where it is asymmetrically enriched.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. Given the fact that Baz levels at the neuroepithelial cells adherens junctions are similar, we are confident that Baz-S180 is phosphorylated in dividing neuroblasts but not in non-mitotic epithelial cells, which is at least consistent with our new finding that CDK1 phosphorylates Baz-S180 in vitro. However, we agree that we cannot strictly rule out that Baz-S180 is phosphorylated but below a detection threshold in mitotic neuroepithelial cells as cortical Baz levels decrease in these cells.</p><p>We have also gathered new data showing that, in the early notum, Baz-S180 is detected in epithelial cells that are not dividing asymmetrically, definitely ruling out the notion that Baz-S180 is strictly ACD-specific. We have changed the title of the paper accordingly, toned down the mention of apparently ACD-specific Baz-S180 phosphorylation in the abstract and now describe and discuss the fact that the apparent ACD-specificity of Baz-S180 phosphorylation is context-specific.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Examination of in vitro phosphorylation of human Par3D (Figure 6) seems out of place and does not add much. It is human, not Bazooka. They reveal 30 sites, 18 of which in both replicates, but most are not obvious CDK sites and the S180 equivalent site is missing. None of these sites is validated in vivo, at least in this work.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with these comments. We initially attempted to purify both full length Baz and human PARD3 but only managed to purify small amounts of PARD3, which is why our analysis was limited to human PARD3. To circumvent these difficulties, we instead purified a smaller N-terminal fragment of Baz and PARD3, which was successful for both proteins and gave us much higher quantities of sample for analysis. Using two different approaches (Western blot with our phospho-specific antibody on Baz and targeted mass spectrometry on Baz and PARD3), we now show in a new Figure 7 that CDK1 phosphorylates Baz-S180 and PARD3-S187 in vitro.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>– Figure 1: Uses metaphase arrested cells, presumably colcemid, but colcemid is only noted in Figure 2.</p></disp-quote><p>We now mention Colcemid in the legend of Figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 2A: Scale bar is truncated.</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 2A: Example images of control neuroblasts could be useful to readers.</p></disp-quote><p>We now show control neuroblasts in Figure 2A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 2G' vs H': Because G' has two panels and H' has only one, we often confused the PKC and Mira box plots when comparing to Numb. Perhaps Mira could be in a separate sub panel or be more closely juxtaposed with Numb?</p></disp-quote><p>The quantification of the Mira signal is now right next to Numb.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Whereas both Numb/Mira were examined in CDK1(as), only Mira is reported for the S180A/D experiments. Is there a Numb phenotype as well?</p></disp-quote><p>We actually co-stained Numb and Miranda in the dataset that we analysed in the S180A/D experiments shown in Figure 4E, F. We did not analyse Numb localisation in the first version we submitted because of a penetration issue of the Numb antibody: the Numb signal fades extremely fast as we image deeper in the tissue, causing large difference of signal intensity even within a single cell. This prevents us from performing any meaningful quantitative measurement of the Numb signal like the one we did in Figure 2H, K, for which we did not encounter this issue. All our further immunostaining experiments with this antibody have had the same problem since then, even after using Triton concentrations up to 4% for permeabilization.</p><p>Nonetheless, following the reviewer’s question, we have at least performed a simple qualitative analysis of Numb localisation in this experiment. We observed that Numb localised to the basal pole in most cases in controls and Baz phosphomutants, but localised uniformly at the cortex in half the cases where Miranda showed very low levels of polarisation in metaphase in Baz<sup>S180D</sup> mutants. This Numb localisation defect suggests a loss of function of the PAR complex whereas, intriguingly, the Miranda localisation defect suggests a gain of function of the PAR complex. These new observations are described in Figure 4G-H’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The discussion of the notch / Baz phenotypes (Figure 5) is rather complicated and a bit difficult to follow.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this, we have rewritten this part.

That said, overall, the work seems somewhat premature.</p><p>(1) The direct impact of CDK1 on Baz behaviour remains somewhat unclear. The authors do a good job of limiting the concentration of inhibitor to decouple effects of cell cycle progression from CDK1 levels per se, but this does potentially impact the strength of the phenotypes they can detect and hence the observed phenotypes are relatively minor. Note that driving cells out of mitosis with stronger CDK1 inhibition clearly impacts Baz localization, so the 'real' effect of CDK1 inhibition on Baz could be stronger than reported here. It is also unclear whether the phenotypes observed are directly linked to CDK1 regulation of PAR polarity or an indirect effect of cell cycle control of other processes. The authors' suggestion that it could be related to defects in cortical actin organization, which is known to be cell cycle controlled, seems most likely, but neither this or other models are explored further.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree but are not aware of any experiment that would allow testing full inhibition of CDK1 on membrane-bound Baz in mitotic neuroblasts. As mentioned above in our response to reviewer #1 we tried to arrest neuroblasts in mitosis and block the proteasome as this at least in HeLa cells led to persistence of mitosis when CDK1 was inhibited (Skoufias et al., 2007). However, neuroblasts arrested in mitosis by proteasome or Colcemid or both slipped out of mitosis upon inhibition of CDK1.</p><p>We agree it would be interesting to study how CDK1 affects the actomyosin network in neuroblasts but feel that this is somewhat beyond the scope of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Using phosphospecific antibodies, they report on a novel putative CDK1 phosphorylation site, but aside from looking like a consensus CDK1 site, whether this site is CDK1 dependent is not examined. Notably, the corresponding phosphomutants have modest effects and don't obviously account for the CDK1 inhibition phenotype, leaving it somewhat unclear whether it is under cell cycle regulation.</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide a new Figure 7 to address this point. As mentioned already above, using two different approaches (Western blot with our phospho-specific antibody on Baz and targeted mass spectrometry on Baz and PARD3 using), we now show in a new Figure 7 that CDK1 phosphorylates Baz-S180 and PARD3-S187 in vitro. Again, we cannot identify any experiment that would allow us testing whether S180 Baz is a direct target of CDK1 in vivo. The fact that we now report significant defects on Baz localisation in pIIa divisions, strongly suggests functional relevance and CDK1 seems a plausible kinase based on the new in vitro results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The observation that S180 phosphorylation appears unique to asymmetrically dividing cells is very curious, but this observation is not followed up extensively. Again phenotypes of phosphomutants are quite modest, and while one can propose models to rationalise the phenotypes observed, these models are not fully explored.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, we now show that Baz-S180 phoshorylation is not strictly ACD-specific and changed the title accordingly. We also have new data showing that the S180 phosphomutants of Baz have localisation defects in mitotic pIIa divisions (new Figure 6). Therefore, this phosphorylation event on Baz can be linked to Baz’s cortical localisation and interestingly shows context dependency.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The findings that human Par3D can be phosphorylated by CDK1 in vitro do not add much particularly as they obtain a very large number of putative sites raising questions of specificity, the sites are not validated, and an S180 equivalent site was not identified.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this has been a weakness which we feel we have addressed. We paste here the answer already provided above when replying to reviewer #1.</p><p>We initially attempted to purify both full length Baz and human PARD3 but only managed to purify small amounts of PARD3, which is why our phospho-proteomics analysis was limited to human PARD3. To circumvent these difficulties, we instead purified a smaller N-terminal fragment of Baz and PARD3, which was successful for both proteins and gave us much higher quantities of sample for analysis. Using two different approaches (Western blot with our phospho-specific antibody on Baz and phosphor proteomics on Baz and PARD3 using mass spectrometry), we now show in a new Figure 7 that CDK1 phosphorylates Baz-S180 and PARD3-S187 in vitro.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In summary, the individual findings of this work are interesting and generally solid. Each could be followed up to provide mechanistic insight into cell cycle- or cell type-dependent regulation of Par polarity. However, in their current state, the results seem more like a loosely connected set of observations.</p><p>Expertise: Cell polarity and asymmetric cell division</p></disp-quote><p>References</p><p>CORSON, F., COUTURIER, L., ROUAULT, H., MAZOUNI, K. &amp; SCHWEISGUTH, F. 2017.
