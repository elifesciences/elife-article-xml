Its striated, periodic appearance in electron micrographs led to the idea that transverse filaments within this structure ‘crosslink’ the axes of homologous chromosomes, stabilizing their pairing. SC proteins can also form polycomplexes, three-dimensional lattices that recapitulate the periodic structure of SCs but do not associate with chromosomes. Here we provide evidence that SCs and polycomplexes contain mobile subunits and that their assembly is promoted by weak hydrophobic interactions, indicative of a liquid crystalline phase. We further show that in the absence of recombination intermediates, polycomplexes recapitulate the dynamic localization of pro-crossover factors during meiotic progression, revealing how the SC might act as a conduit to regulate chromosome-wide crossover distribution. Properties unique to liquid crystals likely enable long-range signal transduction along meiotic chromosomes and underlie the rapid evolution of SC proteins.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21455.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21455.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21455.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The genetic information in cells is encoded within long molecules of DNA called chromosomes. In most human cells, the two copies of each chromosome – the one inherited from our mother and the one from our father – are physically separated and behave independently. However, in the reproductive cells that give rise to eggs or sperm, each chromosome must pair with its partner. Pairing first occurs at one or more positions along each chromosome. This triggers a protein-based polymer called the “synaptonemal complex” to assemble between the paired chromosomes, and then spread along the interface between the partners until they are fully lined up side-by-side. Chromosomes in reproductive cells must pair in this particular way to exchange genetic information and generate new combinations of traits.</p><p>The synaptonemal complex was first observed over 60 years ago, but it remains enigmatic. Though its structure is highly ordered and looks very similar in different organisms from yeast to humans, little is known about how this polymer forms or what it does between chromosomes. Some evidence has suggested that the synaptonemal complex helps to regulate how much information can be transferred between each pair of chromosomes, but not all studies have supported this conclusion.</p><p>Several lines of evidence suggest that the synaptonemal complex might be fundamentally different from other protein-based polymers, such as those that form filamentous skeletal structures within cells, namely actin filaments and microtubules. Now, Rog et al. have tested the idea that the synaptonemal complex might actually have liquid-like properties, despite its highly ordered appearance.</p><p>The experiments showed that the proteins that make up the synaptonemal complex in yeast, worms and fruit flies are weakly bound to each other and can move around within the assembled structure. These are considered to be defining properties that distinguish liquids from solid materials. Together with its regular, repetitive organization, these findings indicate that the synaptonemal complex behaves like a liquid crystal. This intriguing class of materials has properties between those of conventional liquids and those of solid crystals, and is particularly sensitive to environmental conditions.</p><p>Rog et al. believe that this discovery helps to explain how signals are transmitted along the length of chromosomes to regulate the transfer of genetic information. In support of this idea, further experiments showed that proteins that are required for this recombination process were also found within the synaptonemal complex. As reproductive cells transition from one stage of their development to the next, these proteins abruptly move to a new location, indicating that a switch-like signal rapidly spreads throughout the synaptonemal complex.</p><p>Together the findings suggest that the liquid crystal-like properties of the synaptonemal complex allow signals to be transmitted along the interface between pairs of chromosomes. The next challenges are to understand what triggers these signals and to explore whether they are based upon physical or chemical changes within the synaptonemal complex. Further research is also needed to uncover how this information is propagated along the length of a chromosome.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21455.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21455.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>meiosis</kwd><kwd>crossover interference</kwd><kwd>synaptonemal complex</kwd><kwd>liquid crystals</kwd><kwd>phase transitions</kwd><kwd>subcellular compartmentalization</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALTF 564-2010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rog</surname><given-names>Ofer</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dernburg</surname><given-names>Abby F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM065591</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dernburg</surname><given-names>Abby F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Formation of a phase-separated interface between homologous chromosomes during meiosis enables regulatory signals to spread in <italic>cis</italic> over long distances, illuminating the longstanding mystery of crossover interference.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In most eukaryotes, chromosome pairing during meiosis culminates with synapsis, defined as the assembly of synaptonemal complexes (SCs) between homologous chromosomes (homologs). Upon meiotic entry, prior to pairing and synapsis, replicated chromosomes reorganize around a central ‘axis,’ a linear structure comprised of cohesin complexes and associated meiosis-specific proteins. Once chromosomes establish local interactions with their homologs through recombination or other mechanisms, the central region of the SC nucleates and assembles progressively between paired axes, resulting in close side-by-side alignment of homologous chromosomes along their entire lengths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">MacQueen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Page and Hawley, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rog and Dernburg, 2015</xref>). SC assembly is required for stable interhomolog pairing, normal levels of crossover (CO) recombination, cell cycle progression, and faithful chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Page and Hawley, 2004</xref>).</p><p>While disruption of the SC dramatically alters the CO distribution in a variety of organisms, the functional contribution of the SC to CO regulation remains hotly debated. Evidence from budding yeast has suggested that the SC may be a passive ‘glue’ that merely stabilizes the physical pairing of homologs to permit efficient CO formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Börner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fung et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zickler and Kleckner, 2015</xref>). However, evidence from <italic>C. elegans</italic> has indicated that the SC plays a direct role in the conserved phenomenon of <italic>crossover interference</italic>, which distributes COs in a non-random, widely spaced pattern along each chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hayashi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Libuda et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The SC was initially observed sixty years ago by thin-section transmission electron microscopy (TEM), which revealed electron-dense linear structures at the interface between meiotic chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Moses, 1956</xref>). Subsequent observations of meiocytes from diverse eukaryotes led to a consensus view that the SC is a symmetrical, tripartite structure, with two parallel, darkly-staining lateral bands flanking an electron-lucent, transversely striated, central region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Westergaard and von Wettstein, 1972</xref>and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Electron microscopy, superresolution fluorescence imaging, and protein-protein interaction analysis have clearly indicated that the proteins that make up this complex form a highly ordered, periodic structure with bilateral symmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schild-Prüfert et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schücker et al., 2015</xref>). Serial-section TEM analysis also led to the discovery of ‘recombination nodules’ associated with SCs at sites of genetic exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carpenter, 1975</xref>), and specific recombination factors have been localized to these sites by a variety of cytological methods. However, how the SC assembles between chromosomes, and how this polymer might govern or respond to meiotic recombination are largely mysterious.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21455.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Polycomplexes are 3D lattices of SC proteins that exhibit liquid-like behaviors.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Fluorescence micrograph showing mid-prophase oocyte nuclei from wild type and <italic>htp-3(tm3655)</italic> hermaphrodites, immunostained for SYP-2.

The distance between parallel darkly-staining bands is 97 nm, identical to the width of SCs that normally form between homologous chromosomes.

This implies that the electron-dark lateral bands of the SC do not correspond to the chromosome axis, as has been long presumed, but are instead part of the structure formed by the central region proteins.

Structural components, defined here as proteins required for SC assembly, have been identified through genetic screens and/or immunocytochemistry in a variety of organisms. Three to five such proteins have been characterized in budding yeast, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and mammals, and at least one SC protein has been identified in plants. However, it is not yet clear whether the full cohort of SC structural elements has been defined in any organism. While the dimensions and appearance of the SC are conserved among diverse phyla, these structural proteins show remarkable divergence in their lengths and primary sequences. All known SC structural proteins contain extensive regions that score highly on coiled-coiled prediction scales. Together with the transverse striations observed by TEM, this has led to a prevalent view of the SC as a stable, ‘crosslinking’ polymer assembled through coiled-coil interactions, perhaps resembling intermediate filaments. However, other observations have hinted at a more dynamic structure. In particular, evidence from budding yeast has revealed that SCs can incorporate newly translated proteins after assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Voelkel-Meiman et al., 2012</xref>), consistent with dynamic exchange of subunits. Additionally, in many organisms SCs are known to undergo ‘synaptic adjustment,’ post-assembly progressive reorganization that tends to simplify their topology (<italic>e.g.</italic>, the extent of loop structures and unsynapsed axes is minimized) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Page and Hawley, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">MacQueen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Henzel et al., 2011</xref>) – a behavior that implies extensive rearrangement of subunits after initial assembly of the complex.</p><p>Here we probe the biophysical properties of the SC in vivo, and show that it exhibits liquid-like behaviors and likely assembles through a regulated coacervation process. We further report that SCs in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, budding yeast, and <italic>Drosophila</italic> are rapidly and reversibly dissolved by aliphatic alcohols, indicating that their integrity relies on weak hydrophobic interactions. Finally, we demonstrate that the dynamic localization and interdependence of two essential CO factors is recapitulated by chromosome-free assemblies of SC proteins, demonstrating how an SC compartment may dynamically partition enzymatic activities to regulate meiotic recombination.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SCs exhibit liquid-like behaviors</title><p>The SC normally assembles between the paired axes of meiotic chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Couteau et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Severson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kim et al., 2014</xref>). Note that throughout this work we use terminology that differentiates between the SC (sometimes called the 'central region') and the chromosome axis.

Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we found that these nuclear bodies have a multilaminar internal structure, in which each layer recapitulates the appearance and dimensions of SCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A and C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dernburg et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schild-Prüfert et al., 2011</xref>). Similar periodic, multilaminar structures formed by SC proteins have been observed in wild-type nuclei or cytoplasm of meiocytes or nurse cells from a wide variety of organisms, as well as under perturbed conditions where SCs cannot assemble between chromosomes, and are known as ‘polycomplexes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Roth, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Westergaard and von Wettstein, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Page and Hawley, 2004</xref>).

Additionally, this reveals that the electron-dark bands with 100 nm periodicity within polycomplexes, which correspond to the cytologically-defined ‘lateral elements’ of the SC, are not equivalent to chromosome axes.</p><p>Polycomplexes contain all known SC structural proteins and depend on the full cohort of these proteins for their formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Humphryes et al., 2013</xref>, and our observations). Coupled with their structural similarity to SCs, we reasoned that it might be possible to learn more about the SC, independent of its interactions with chromosome axes, by analyzing polycomplex dynamics in living worms. Time-lapse imaging of <italic>htp-3</italic> mutant worms expressing GFP-SYP-3 revealed that prophase nuclei frequently contained more than one fluorescent polycomplex. Unexpectedly, we observed that when these came into contact, they readily fused to form a single larger body (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>).

The ability of such bodies to merge together and to readily change in shape are defining characteristics of liquids, since they imply that molecules can rapidly rearrange within a material. These observations were thus initially very surprising, given the highly ordered appearance of polycomplexes. However, materials with liquid-like properties and ordered arrangements of molecules, known as structured fluids or liquid crystals, are a well-known class of soft condensed matter, and a variety of structures within cells have been postulated to have such properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown and Wolken, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rey, 2010</xref>).<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-21455-media1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21455.006</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Polycomplexes fuse upon contacting each other.</title><p>Oocytes from the diplotene region of an <italic>htp-3(tm3655)</italic> hermaphrodite expressing GFP-SYP-3, corresponding to the stills shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>.

Our early efforts to carry out long-term recordings in living worms consistently led to meiotic arrest, which we deduced to be a physiological response to food withdrawal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wynne et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rog and Dernburg, 2015</xref>). Arrest was evident as abatement of the dramatic chromosome movements that normally occur throughout early prophase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wynne et al., 2012</xref>), which typically ceased within 15–20 min of immobilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Videos 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">4</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> for a schematic of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> gonad). In nuclei that had initiated synapsis before arresting, we observed that diffuse GFP-SYP-3 gradually coalesced to join existing segments of SC between chromosomes. These partial SCs became brighter but not longer, likely reflecting addition of subunits to form a multilayered structure, much as they must stack within 3D polycomplexes. Consistent with this idea, EM analysis of lateral and cross-sectional views of SCs has indicated that they contain varying numbers of layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schmekel et al., 1993a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">1993b</xref>). The observation that these pre-existing SC segments did not spread along partially synapsed chromosomes following arrest suggests that longitudinal extension is an active process. In earlier, presynaptic nuclei, GFP-SYP-3 coalesced within each nucleus over a period of tens of minutes to form several compact aggregates. Similar coalescence of SC proteins was observed in animals treated with sodium azide, which reversibly arrests meiosis and other physiological processes by depleting ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), suggesting that phosphorylation and/or other ATP-dependent mechanisms normally maintain the solubility of SC subunits.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21455.008</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Condensation of SC proteins following meiotic arrest or ATP depletion.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Still images from a time-lapse recording of an otherwise wild-type hermaphrodite expressing GFP-SYP-3, sampled at 1 min intervals.

Gonads were dissected and fixed immediately following azide treatment, and stained with antibodies against SYP-2 and HTP-3 to localize SCs and chromosome axes, respectively. Small polycomplexes that contain SYP-2 but not HTP-3 are observed in some early meiotic nuclei in the absence of any treatment, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goldstein, 2013</xref>), but become much larger and more abundant in response to azide exposure.

We engineered worm strains expressing SYP-3 fused to the photoconvertible fluorescent protein mMaple3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2014b</xref>). We photoconverted subnuclear regions in live worms and imaged these nuclei over time. The photoconverted proteins rapidly redistributed throughout the SCs within the same nucleus, becoming homogeneously dispersed within 22 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

We conclude that SC central region proteins are far more mobile than axis components. The relatively slow rate of subunit turnover within the SC compared to that observed for other liquid-like compartments might reflect a high viscosity of the liquid-like phase, and/or other constraints such as confinement within the very thin laminar space, or a slow rate of exchange of subunits between the different SC compartments in the nucleus. Future studies using high-speed imaging and other tools should provide a more complete understanding of the movement of proteins within the SC. Taken together, our observation of coacervation following meiotic arrest, of liquid-like behaviors of polycomplexes, and of the dynamic exchange of subunits all indicate that the SC is a phase-separated compartment with liquid crystalline properties.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21455.013</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>SC proteins, but not axis components, are highly dynamic.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>B</bold>) Images of representative nuclei from time-lapse recordings of hermaphrodites expressing either the SC protein SYP-3 or the axis component HIM-3 fused to the photoconvertible fluorescent protein mMaple3.

We therefore wondered whether the biophysical properties we observed in <italic>C. elegans</italic> are conserved. We found that SCs in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and budding yeast were rapidly dispersed by 1,6-hexanediol, while axis markers (Rec8p in budding yeast; C(2)M in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) remained associated with chromosomes, as in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–E</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref> for an explanatory diagram). This indicates that weak hydrophobic interactions are important for SC integrity in diverse lineages.</p><p>While SCs in budding yeast, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and <italic>C. elegans</italic> meiocytes were readily disrupted by 1,6-hexanediol, we found that similar concentrations of the more polar solvents ethanol or dimethyl sulfoxide failed to dissolve these structures (data not shown). Because the effects of 1,6-hexanediol on cellular structures are not well understood, we also probed the sensitivity of SCs to disruption by a number of other water-miscible alcohols. These di-alcohols vary in the length of the hydrocarbon chain and the positions of their hydroxyl groups. Most experiments were performed with yeast cells arrested in mid-pachytene, since it is simple to manipulate the media in which these cells are immersed and no dissection or cell permeabilization was required to see the effects of 1,6-hexanediol. For each di-alcohol we determined the minimal concentration required for complete SC disruption, based on loss of any discernible structure by fluorescence microscopy of unfixed yeast cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We observed a clear correlation between the extent of the hydrophobic domains of different solvents and their effects on the SC. For example, 1,2-heptanediol disrupted the structure at lower concentrations than 1,2-hexanediol, which was more potent than 1,2-pentanediol. Similar results were obtained for the series 1,7-heptanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, and 1,5-pentanediol. Together, these results reinforce the idea that solvation by aliphatic alcohols is due to suppression of the hydrophobic effect, and support a major contribution of hydrophobic interactions to SC stability.</p><p>We also probed the effect of electrostatic interactions on SC stability. We noted that SC central region proteins in various organisms are predominantly polyampholytic, <italic>i.e.</italic>, they contain an unusually large fraction of charged residues, both acidic and basic, which are well-mixed within the primary sequences. This suggests that electrostatic interactions likely contribute to SC integrity, and that higher salt concentrations, which shield electrostatic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Veis, 2011</xref>), might disfavor assembly. Consistent with this, we found that increasing the concentration of KCl potentiated the ability of 1,6-hexanediol to dissolve the SC in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>; other salts showed similar effects [data not shown]), highlighting a role for electrostatic interactions, in addition to hydrophobic interactions, in SC assembly and stability. The effects of increasing salt concentration were fairly modest in light of the highly charged nature of SC proteins; however, only a limited range of ionic strength could be investigated in living cells, and the effects of these buffer manipulations on intracellular ionic strength could not be directly monitored.</p><p>Both of these trends observed in budding yeast — disruption of SCs by lower concentrations of more hydrophobic diols, and synergy between electrostatic shielding and amphipathic solvents — also held true for <italic>C. elegans</italic> SCs (data not shown). Experiments conducted using this system were less comprehensive since they required extensive hand dissection and, probably as a consequence of this manipulation, were somewhat less consistent and thus harder to score. Nevertheless, we tested whether various mutations in <italic>C. elegans</italic> that perturb meiotic recombination or chromosome structure might affect 1,6-hexanediol sensitivity, and observed no major differences, except that the aberrant SCs in <italic>syp-3(me42)</italic> mutants, which carry a small C-terminal truncation in an SC protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Smolikov et al., 2007</xref>), were hypersensitive to 1,6-hexanediol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>). We further probed the effects of this mutation, and found that the <italic>syp-3(me42)</italic> truncation also prevents polycomplex formation in an <italic>htp-3</italic> background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>), as well as heat-induced aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D</xref>). The correlation between 1,6-hexanediol hyper-sensitivity, defects in SC assembly and lack of SC aggregation further underscore the contribution of hydrophobic interactions to the functional integrity of the SC.</p><p>When SCs in <italic>C. elegans</italic> were disrupted by 1,6-hexanediol, followed by rapid dilution of the solvent with buffer, GFP-SYP-3 immediately relocalized along the chromosomes (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media10">Video 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; throughout the figures, panels showing samples subsequent to the dilution are shown with a yellow border). Some fluorescent material that had exited the nucleus, perhaps due to transient disruption of the nuclear pores, formed small puncta in the cytoplasm. Notably, reassembly of SCs following 1,6-hexanediol dilution occurred much more quickly than physiological SC assembly between axes, which requires 20–30 min per chromosome pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rog and Dernburg, 2015</xref>). Polycomplex dissolution was also reversible: upon dilution of 1,6-hexanediol, multiple small puncta formed in each nucleus, and rapidly fused with each other to form larger bodies (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media9">Video 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), qualitatively similar to the behavior of polycomplexes in live animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">2</xref>). This reassembly following hexanediol dilution occurred much more quickly than under metabolic arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Dissolution of the SC by 1,6-hexanediol in budding yeast cells was also reversible: we observed some re-association of SC components with chromosomes after both short (2 min) and longer (&gt;30 min) incubations of yeast cells arrested at mid-pachytene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). These results provide additional evidence that neither the chromosome axes, which are essential for SC assembly between chromosomes, nor the SC proteins themselves, are irreversibly perturbed by exposure to 1,6-hexanediol.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Spatial regulation of recombination proteins by the SC</title><p>Subcellular liquid-like compartments are selectively permeable to macromolecules, and can regulate biochemical reactions by concentrating enzymes and substrates and restricting their diffusion (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hyman et al., 2014</xref>). We therefore wondered whether the SC might regulate and surveil recombination by partitioning CO factors into a distinct compartment between homologous chromosomes. At least one essential CO factor that is not required for SC assembly, the conserved RING-finger protein ZHP-3, is observed throughout the SC during early prophase, before becoming restricted to designated CO sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jantsch et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhalla et al., 2008</xref>), whereupon it colocalizes with COSA-1, another conserved protein required for COs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yokoo et al., 2012</xref>). We found that CO formation altered not only the localization of ZHP-3 but also its sensitivity to 1,6-hexanediol: Prior to CO designation, the ZHP-3 distributed throughout SCs was dispersed by the solvent, while CO-associated ZHP-3 foci remained intact even after disruption of the SC by 1,6-hexanediol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>).</p><p>If ZHP-3 concentrates between chromosomes by partitioning into the SC, we expected that it might also localize within polycomplexes. Indeed, we found that in <italic>htp-3</italic> mutants, ZHP-3 was concentrated throughout polycomplexes during most of meiotic prophase. However, near the ‘loop’ region of the gonad, where exit from pachytene normally occurs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> for reference), we observed an abrupt change in ZHP-3 localization: The protein largely disappeared from the interior of the polycomplexes and became restricted to a single focus conspicuously abutting the surface of each polycomplex. Intriguingly, at the same stage, COSA-1, which was not detected earlier, became localized to these same small, peripheral puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C</xref>). This dynamic relocalization of ZHP-3 and COSA-1 is highly analogous to what is observed along bona fide SCs upon CO designation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yokoo et al., 2012</xref>). We further determined that ZHP-3 is required for the appearance of COSA-1 foci at polycomplexes, while COSA-1 is required for the relocalization of ZHP-3 to the edge of these bodies and its disappearance from the interior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>), mirroring the interdependence of these factors for their localization to CO sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yokoo et al., 2012</xref>). We also found that the earlier ZHP-3 localization throughout polycomplexes is readily disrupted by 1,6-hexanediol, whereas the foci of COSA-1 and ZHP-3 foci at the edges of polycomplexes are 1,6-hexanediol-resistant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>), again mirroring the properties of ZHP-3 and COSA-1 associated with SCs and designated CO sites, respectively. Polycomplexes do not appear to be associated with chromosomes and moreover, meiotic recombination does not initiate in <italic>htp-3</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Goodyer et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, localization of COSA-1 and ZHP-3 to foci on polycomplexes does not require their interaction with CO intermediates such as Holliday junctions, or indeed with chromosomes. These results imply that in response to exogenous cell cycle signals, polycomplexes can recapitulate a signaling network that normally designates COs, and hence suggest how a liquid-like SC compartment may promote and regulate CO recombination along meiotic chromosomes.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21455.026</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>The localization of CO factors to polycomplexes recapitulates their dynamic behavior and interdependencies upon CO designation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>B</bold>) Dynamic relocalization of ZHP-3 and COSA-1 during meiotic progression.

Here we report another conserved property of SCs and polycomplexes: they assemble through coacervation of polypeptides into compartments with liquid crystalline properties. While the symmetric, transversely striated appearance of the SC, combined with known properties of coiled-coil proteins, has suggested a filamentous and stable internal structure, our observations indicate that SCs instead resemble smectic (planar) liquid crystal bilayers, structurally analogous to lipid bilayers. Moreover, the SC can also assemble into its canonical smectic structure when its normal association with chromosome axes is prevented. The preferential assembly of SC proteins into a thin lamellar structure between two axes is further evidenced by our observation that upon meiotic arrest, nuclear aggregates appear only if no pre-assembled SC bilayers are present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). While biological membranes are well-known examples of smectic liquid crystals, to our knowledge, the SC is the first known example of such a highly ordered, liquid-like structure arising from protein-protein interactions. However, a variety of biological assemblies of less regular structure have been described as liquid crystals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown and Wolken, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rey, 2010</xref>), and many others have been created in vitro by mixing synthetic peptides in aqueous solution.</p><p>Liquid crystals are considered to be a distinct phase of matter from liquids, which are disordered and anisotropic. Thus, it is perhaps unsurprising that the proteins that assemble to form SCs are markedly different from those that have been implicated in the assembly of other liquid-like compartments within cells. Many such proteins have low-complexity, intrinsically disordered domains that are essential for their phase transition behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hyman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhu and Brangwynne, 2015</xref>), and some of these have been shown to adopt cross-beta strand structures in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kato et al., 2012</xref>). By contrast, SC proteins are predicted to be largely alpha-helical in structure, and have extensive domains predicted to form coiled-coils. Smectic liquid crystals assemble from elongated, amphipathic rod-like molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gennes and Prost, 1993</xref>). It is known that some of the longer SC proteins, particularly SYCP1 in mammals and Zip1p in budding yeast, have a head-to-head orientation within the SC, with their N-termini near the center and their C-termini near the chromosome axes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schmekel et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dong and Roeder, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2005</xref>). Interaction of their C-termini with axis-associated proteins seems to promote their coacervation with other SC proteins, possibly by promoting high local concentrations. Axis association also favors the formation of single bilayers (lamellae), rather than the stacks of bilayers that make up polycomplexes. By specifying the orientation of these ‘transverse filament’ proteins, the chromosome axes may also act as a ‘director’ for the liquid crystalline array.</p><p>Many of the best-studied coiled-coil proteins form highly stable interactions through regions of superhelical coiling. Some, such as muscle myosin, keratins, and lamins, form long-lived filamentous networks, which has suggested that the SC might have similar properties. However, it has long been appreciated that interruptions in the phasing of the canonical heptad repeat sequence disrupt supercoiling and reduce the stability of interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown et al., 1996</xref>). We note that even the ‘transverse filament’ proteins SYCP1 (vertebrates and other metazoans), Zip1p (budding yeast), C(3)G (<italic>Drosophila</italic>), and SYP-1 (<italic>Caenorhabditis</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Page and Hawley, 2004</xref>) contain very few perfect heptads arranged in tandem, which may underlie the lability of the SC.</p><p>Meiotic synapsis can be disrupted by small increases in temperature, as seen in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bilgir et al., 2013</xref>) and many other organisms, and we propose that this stems from the liquid crystalline properties of the SC. While the <italic>C. elegans</italic> Bristol N2 strain remains fertile at temperatures up to 25°C, at 26.5°C hermaphrodites are sterile, and in such animals we observed SC protein assemblies that were neither crystalline nor liquid-like. Because liquid crystals depend on ordered but weak interactions, they are considered to be a ‘mesophase’ between liquids and crystalline solids. They are often exquisitely sensitive to variations in temperature and/or other perturbations such as electric fields, making synthetic materials useful as thermometers (on fish tanks and mood rings) and in video displays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gennes and Prost, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carlton et al., 2013</xref>). Thus strong selective forces to maintain the responsive, liquid-like properties of the SC, which plays a central role in fertility and fitness, may underlie the sequence diversity observed among its constituent proteins, especially among ectothermic organisms. In support of this idea, direct evidence has recently indicated that SC proteins, among other chromosome structural components, are subject to rapid positive selection in plant populations growing at different temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wright et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Our observation that meiotic arrest or azide treatment promotes the coalescence of SC components is consistent with the idea that phosphorylation and/or other modifications regulate the coacervation of these proteins. These modifications presumably tune the strength of interactions among SC proteins to control the timing and location of assembly and disassembly, as has been described for other cellular coacervation processes, such as the formation of P-granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2014a</xref>). Consistent with this, PLK-2, a kinase that promotes SC disassembly at the end of meiotic prophase, localizes to SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Harper et al., 2011</xref>), and we have found that several of the SYP proteins can be phosphorylated by PLK-2 in vitro (Y. Kim and AFD, unpublished). Because liquid crystals are ultrasensitive to perturbations of their intermolecular interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gennes and Prost, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carlton et al., 2013</xref>), we envision that posttranslational modifications may also modulate the dynamic properties of assembled SCs during meiotic progression.</p><p>Phase-separated liquid-like compartments in vitro and in vivo are selectively and tunably permeable to macromolecules. This property can concentrate specific cellular activities while excluding others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hyman et al., 2014</xref>). While the liquid crystalline properties of the SC set it apart from other compartments that resemble amorphous liquids, we provide evidence that it may have some analogous properties. Specifically, this assembly dynamically regulates the localization of at least two conserved recombination factors, ZHP-3 and COSA-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), which are not required for SC assembly, in response to meiotic progression. Previous work has shown that Zip3p, the budding yeast homolog of ZHP-3, also localizes throughout polycomplexes, while the CO factors Zip2p, Zip4p, Msh5p and the 9-1-1 clamp proteins localize to one or two foci abutting polycomplexes, sometimes referred to as a ‘capping complex’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tsubouchi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shinohara et al., 2015</xref>), very similar to the physical distribution we observe for ZHP-3 and COSA-1 during late meiotic prophase. Homologs of ZHP-3 in plants, mammals and fungi also localize to SCs before concentrating at sites of COs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chelysheva et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Reynolds et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Muyt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jahns et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Qiao et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that spatial regulation of COs by the SC is widely conserved. We envision that the SC acts as an active ‘scaffold’ to localize and concentrate ‘client’ proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banani et al., 2016</xref>), defined here as SC-resident proteins that are not required for SC assembly. These factors, including ZHP-3, are recruited by the SC to control the processing of double-strand breaks that are induced during meiosis. We also speculate that the SC may share an evolutionary relationship with other liquid-like nuclear compartments, such as repair foci, which concentrate repair factors at sites of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhu and Brangwynne, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Our observations support a central role for the SC in CO interference, which acts over many microns and even over entire chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Page and Hawley, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Libuda et al., 2013</xref>). Evidence that SCs share physical properties with liquid crystals, a particularly responsive class of active materials, illuminates how they might contribute to the transduction of a long-range, cis-acting interference signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). In particular, the knowledge that macromolecules can diffuse laterally within the plane of smectic liquid crystals suggests that the dynamics of diffusion within the SC likely determine the rate at which biochemical signals are propagated along the chromosomes. (By analogy, 2D diffusion within lipid membranes profoundly impacts the spatial organization and kinetics of signaling by membrane-associated proteins.) Thus, our discovery that the SC acts as a non-membrane-bound compartment suggests how COs could be regulated in cis through a reaction-diffusion mechanism, which is consistent with quantitative analysis of CO interference in several organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fujitani et al., 2002</xref>). This idea is also consistent with evidence that reduction in the expression levels of SC proteins, which likely results in discontinuities of the SC along individual chromosomes, can permit additional COs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hayashi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Libuda et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We further report that both SCs and polycomplexes undergo an abrupt biochemical change in response to cell cycle signals, which results in the appearance of a single CO-like focus and removal of ZHP-3 from the interior, indicating that this material can mediate switch-like regulation that spans an entire compartment. We have found that depletion of the ERK kinase MPK-1, which has been implicated in regulating late meiotic prophase events in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nadarajan et al., 2016</xref>), does not affect the relocalization of COSA-1 or ZHP-3 on SCs or polycomplexes (Liangyu Zhang, OR and AFD, unpublished), so the nature of the ‘exit pachytene’ signal that triggers this switch is unknown.</p><p>Finally, we note that long-range order within liquid crystals allows propagation of structural transitions, known as ‘disclinations,’ over long distances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rey, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bukusoglu et al., 2016</xref>), similar to a ‘domino effect.’ Energy can also be stored within liquid crystals as elastic strain, and released through abrupt topological changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bukusoglu et al., 2016</xref>). This property could provide a rapid response to crossover formation. Specifically, we imagine that structural changes could be induced within the SC at sites of CO formation and transmitted laterally, in which case interference might be mediated by a mechanochemical rather than a purely biochemical signal. This idea is analogous to a ‘beam-film’ model that has been proposed to explain interference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>), but posits that the medium that stores strain is the SC, or more precisely, the SC as confined by its interaction with chromosome axes. Ultrastructural analysis of SC organization before and after CO formation may eventually allow this idea to be tested. Additionally, future studies of the role of SC organization and dynamics in CO interference may enable development of new synthetic materials with long-range signaling capabilities.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Worm strains and transgenes</title><p>All strains were cultured using standard methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brenner, 1974</xref>).

Briefly, worms were placed on freshly prepared agarose pads (7.5% in water) overlaid with 100 nm polystyrene beads (Polysciences, cat#00876) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). The pad and beads included freshly-dissolved serotonin creatinine sulfate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) at a final concentration of 25 mM. Worms were overlaid with high-performance coverslips (0.17 ± 0.005 mm; Schott) that were sealed to the slide with VALAP (1:1:1 vaseline:lanolin:paraffin), and imaged immediately afterwards. Time-lapse images were recorded from the posterior gonad arm, the motion of which was less perturbed by pharyngeal pumping than the anterior arm. Only gonads for which chromosome motion was detected during the entire recording were analyzed, except where otherwise indicated.</p><p>Hexanediol treatment during time-lapse imaging was performed by dissecting adult hermaphrodites in 30 μL 1X egg buffer (EB) on poly-L-lysine covered coverslips (Neuvitro, Vancouver, WA). Extruded gonads were gently pressed against the coverslip to promote adhesion. At the indicated times, an equal volume of hexanediol in EB was added to the drop to attain the indicated final concentrations of hexanediol. Where indicated, the buffer was subsequently diluted with additional EB lacking hexanediol.</p><p>Images were acquired using a Marianas spinning-disc confocal microscope (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Inc. [3i], Denver, CO) at ambient temperature (19°C–24°C), using a 100 × 1.46 NA oil immersion objective, yielding a pixel spacing of 133 × 133 nm. 3D image stacks of 11–17 sections at 0.5 µm z-spacing were acquired over 1–3 s. Raw image stacks were analyzed using Imaris 7.3 or 8.0 (Bitplane AG, Zurich, Switzerland). Time-lapse series were segmented, tracked and aligned based on overall fluorescence using the Spots tool. Compactness was measured using the Surface tool, analyzing at least three different gonads for each condition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Protein mobility measurements</title><p>Photoconversion of mMaple3 fusion proteins was performed using the Marianas spinning-disc confocal system described above, equipped with a Vector FRAP module. Two-color 3D image stacks of 11 sections at 0.8 µm z-spacing were acquired over 1–3 s. The first time point included activation of 10 × 10 pixel regions (1.33 × 1.33 µm) using a 405 nm laser at each focal position. Following photoconversion, 3D stacks were acquired every 1–5 min, as indicated.</p><p>Our recordings indicate that photoconverted molecules can spread both along SCs and between SCs on different chromosomes. We thus assume that this movement has multiple rate components. At the temporal and spatial resolution we could achieve in living animals with spinning disk confocal microscopy, it was not possible to directly measure diffusion rates or the surface tension of individual SC compartments. Instead, we compared the spreading rates of SYP-3 (SC) and HIM-3 (axis) proteins by calculating the rate of change of the volume of the nucleus containing photoconverted (red) signal, based on 3D images from time-lapse recordings. The volume of the nucleus occupied by photoconverted molecules at each time point was placed in one of four bins (25%, 50%, 75% or 100%), which were then plotted as a function of time elapsed since photoconversion. At least 15 nuclei were scored for each fluorescent marker. The expansion rate was defined as the slope of a line fitted to the data. These values were compared to simple simulations in which a point source of fluorescence became homogeneously distributed throughout the nucleus in 1 hr.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Immunofluorescence</title><p>Immunofluorescence was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Phillips et al., 2009</xref>), except that where indicated, dissected hermaphrodites were briefly incubated with 1,6-hexanediol in egg buffer immediately before adding fixative.

responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The synaptonemal complex is a liquid crystalline compartment that spatially regulates meiotic recombination factors&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor and three reviewers, including Michael K Rosen (Reviewer #3) and a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In the past few years, liquid-liquid de-mixing or phase separation of proteins has emerged as a novel way to think about concentrating biomolecules in a heavily crowded cytoplasmic microenvironment. In this manuscript by Rog et al., the authors have shown the synaptonemal complex (SC), that for years was thought to be a solid polymeric complex of proteins, because of the striated structures observed by EM, in fact possess properties reminiscent of a liquid crystal.</p><p>PCs can fuse with each other, distort, and condense from diffuse molecules into dense puncta. Similarly, the SC protein SYP-3 (but not the axis protein HIM-3) spreads rapidly in the interchromosomal space, and SCs form through a process consistent with condensation. The authors show that both SCs and polycomplexes are reversibly sensitive to hydrophobic alcohols in a manner similar to some other phase separated cellular structures.</p><p>The idea that the SC complex forms a liquid-crystal like structure is provocative, and as you say in the paper, helps to explain some of the biology of these complexes. The reviewers engaged in extensive discussion about the use of the term liquid-crystal.</p><p>On the one hand, it certainly helps to unify the observations seen by electron microscopy, with the dynamic observations that you have made in your paper.</p><p>On the other hand, there was some discomfort with the strength of the claim that it <italic>is</italic> a liquid crystal, i.e. the same underlying organizational principles as in nonliving smectic LCs.

When we’ve discussed our findings with polymer chemists and physicists, they have quickly concluded that the SC is a liquid crystal even when we refrain from using this language. We agree that it is probably distinct from liquid crystals as studied under equilibrium conditions, in that it is likely an active material. We are willing to face potential criticism for using this terminology. However, since the Editor and reviewers feel strongly about this issue, we have agreed to change the title to “The synaptonemal complex has liquid crystalline properties and spatially regulates meiotic recombination factors,” almost the same as the second suggestion below. We have also tempered the language somewhat throughout the text.</p><p><italic>For instance, in comparison with other intracellular phase separated liquids recently described, which typically exhibit molecular turnover (e.g. from FRAP) on timescales of tens of seconds, SC only exhibits turnover on timescales of tens of minutes.

It’s not clear to what extent molecular diffusion within the synaptonemal complex is analogous to that within amorphous liquids. For example, as alluded to by the reviewer(s), it is not yet clear if diffusion within the SC should be modeled as a 1D or 2D system, or how its confinement between chromosomes might impact mobility. In addition, we cannot currently distinguish between diffusion within an individual SC compartment and exchange of subunits between compartments. We are currently exploring these questions using correlation-based image analysis methods, but they are clearly beyond the scope of this work.</p><p><italic>Another point of discussion was that liquid crystals are generally multilayer.

This is well-known in the meiosis field and unlikely to be questioned by readers familiar with the SC. Ours is the first demonstration that the aggregates that form in worm axis mutants have the same periodic internal structure seen for polycomplexes in other organisms, and that this order is lost at high temperatures. Our EM images obtained from high-pressure-frozen samples are actually somewhat less clear than some of the “classic” images from the mid-20th century using conventional fixation, in which the SC and polycomplexes appear in higher contrast, probably because of more extensive extraction of other cellular material.</p><p><italic>While many of the behaviors of SC and polycomplexes are consistent with liquid phase separation, the following description: &quot;In nuclei that had initiated synapsis before arresting, we observed that diffuse GFP-SYP-3 gradually coalesced to join existing segments of SC between chromosomes.

We didn’t mean to suggest that the segments were becoming denser or more concentrated; we think that they are probably growing in thickness (above and below the plane defined by the SC) but not longitudinally; i.e., along the chromosome axis. We have added some text to explain and justify this idea.</p><p><italic>We would also encourage you to comment on the relationship to surfactants.

While it’s certainly possible that assembly of the SC helps to overcome a repulsive force between homologous chromosomes arising from “stiff brush”-like behavior, we don’t have any evidence that addresses this, so we have chosen not to address this in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Importantly, I think that the title as shown is too strong.
