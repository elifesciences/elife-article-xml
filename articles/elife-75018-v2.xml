head and body. However, while the vestibular sensors and nuclei directly encode head motion, no sensors directly encode body motion. Instead, the integration of vestibular and neck proprioceptive inputs is necessary to transform vestibular information into the body-centric reference frame required for postural control. The anterior vermis of the cerebellum is thought to play a key role in this transformation, yet how its Purkinje cells transform multiple streams of sensory information into an estimate of body motion remains unknown. Here, we recorded the activity of individual anterior vermis Purkinje cells in alert monkeys during passively applied whole-body, body-under-head, and head-on-body rotations. Most Purkinje cells dynamically encoded an intermediate representation of self-motion between head and body motion. Notably, Purkinje cells responded to both vestibular and neck proprioceptive stimulation with considerable heterogeneity in their response dynamics. Furthermore, their vestibular responses were tuned to head-on-body position. In contrast, targeted neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei are known to unambiguously encode either head or body motion across conditions. Using a simple population model, we established that combining responses of~40-50 Purkinje cells could explain the responses of these deep cerebellar nuclei neurons across all self-motion conditions. We propose that the observed heterogeneity in Purkinje cell response dynamics underlies the cerebellum’s capacity to compute the dynamic representation of body motion required to ensure accurate postural control and perceptual stability in our daily lives.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cerebellum</kwd><kwd>Purkinje cells</kwd><kwd>vestibular</kwd><kwd>proprioception</kwd><kwd>neurophysiology</kwd><kwd>population coding</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rhesus macaque</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-DC002390</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cullen</surname><given-names>Kathleen E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-DC018061</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cullen</surname><given-names>Kathleen E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The transformation of multiple streams of sensory information into an estimate of body motion occurs between the cerebellum and deep cerebellar nucleus to ensure postural and perceptual stability.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The cerebellum guides motor performance by computing differences between the expected versus actual consequences of movements and then adjusting the commands sent to the motor system (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wolpert et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Raymond and Medina, 2018</xref>). Patients with damage to the anterior vermis of the cerebellum show impaired posture and balance, as well as deficits in motor coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Diener et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bastian et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ilg et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sullivan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mitoma et al., 2020</xref>). In this context, the anterior vermis has a vital role in the vestibulospinal pathways that generate the postural adjustments required to ensure the maintenance of balance during our everyday activities. Additionally, there is an emerging consensus that the cerebellum contributes to our self-motion perception. Indeed, patients with degeneration of the cerebellar vermis demonstrate reduced perceptual time constants and detection thresholds to externally applied rotations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bronstein et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dahlem et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The prevailing view is that the vestibular pathways mediating vestibulospinal reflexes and the stable perception of self-motion explicitly transform vestibular information from a head-centered to a body-centered reference frame. The vestibular sensory organs are located within the head, making the vestibular system’s native reference frame head-centered (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cullen, 2019</xref>). In turn, vestibular nerve afferents and their targets in the vestibular nuclei also encode information in a head-centered reference frame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Roy and Cullen, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Roy and Cullen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Roy and Cullen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carriot et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brooks and Cullen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sadeghi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jamali et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cullen and Minor, 2002</xref>). However, the brain accounts for the position of the head relative to the body for vestibulospinal reflexes to accurately control the musculature required to maintain upright posture and balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tokita et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tokita et al., 2009</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kennedy and Inglis, 2002</xref>). Indeed, distinct representations of body versus head motion are encoded by individual neurons in the fastigial nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brooks and Cullen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brooks and Cullen, 2014</xref>) – the most medial of deep cerebellar nuclei – which lesion studies have shown serves an important role in the control of posture and balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Thach et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kurzan et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pélisson et al., 1998</xref>). Neck proprioceptors provide the head position information required for this transformation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cullen and Zobeiri, 2021</xref>). Thus, the integration of neck proprioceptive and vestibular signals is thought to underlie the transformation from a head-centered to a body-centered reference frame in vestibulospinal reflexes pathways as well as our ability to perceive body motion independently of head motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mergner et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Peterka, 2002</xref>).</p><p>There are many reasons to believe that the anterior region of the cerebellar vermis is vital in the transformation of vestibular information from a head-centered to a body-centered reference frame. First, Purkinje cells in this region project to the rostral portion of the fastigial nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Batton et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yamada and Noda, 1987</xref>), which lesion studies have shown serves an important role in the control of posture and balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Thach et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kurzan et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pélisson et al., 1998</xref>). Second, inhibition of the cerebellar vermis via continuous theta-burst stimulation impairs the modulation of vestibulospinal pathways that normally accounts for changes in the position of the head relative to the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lam et al., 2016</xref>). Third, neuronal recordings from anterior vermis Purkinje cells in decerebrate cats have demonstrated that individual neurons can encode both vestibular and neck proprioceptive-related information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Denoth et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Manzoni et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Manzoni et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Manzoni et al., 2004</xref>), thereby providing a neural substrate for the coordinate transformation using neck proprioceptive signals to convert head-centered vestibular signals to a body-centered reference frame. However, these studies stopped short of establishing whether Purkinje cells integrate vestibular and neck proprioceptive signals to dynamically encode head or body movement.</p><p>Thus, a key question yet to be answered is: Does the cerebellum integrate vestibular and neck proprioceptive signals to provide a dynamic representation of body motion relative to space? Here, we recorded the activity of single Purkinje cells in the anterior vermis during head motion, body motion, and combined head and body motion. We found considerable heterogeneity across individual Purkinje cells in their encoding of head versus body motion, with most (~75%) neurons dynamically encoding an intermediate representation of self-motion between head and body motion. These neurons, termed bimodal neurons, responded to both vestibular and neck proprioceptive stimulation and displayed head-position-dependent tuning in their sensitivity to vestibular stimulation. In contrast, a minority of cells, termed unimodal neurons, only responded to vestibular stimulation and unambiguously encoded the motion of the head in space. Across all cells, the linear combination of a given neuron’s response sensitivity to dynamic neck and vestibular stimulation alone well estimated its response during combined stimulation. Finally, we found that a simple linear combination model combining the responses of ~40 Purkinje cells could account for the more homogeneous responses of target neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei (i.e., the rostral fastigial nucleus [rFN]) during applied self-motion. Our results provide the first evidence, at the level of single Purkinje cells, that a sequential transformation from a head-centered to body-centered reference frame occurs between the cerebellum and deep cerebellar nucleus to ensure postural and perceptual stability in everyday life.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Most vestibular-sensitive Purkinje cells in the anterior vermis are also sensitive to stimulation of neck proprioceptors</title><p>Each Purkinje cell in our population (<italic>n</italic> = 73) was responsive to vestibular stimulation and was insensitive to eye movements. To assess each neuron’s vestibular sensitivity, we applied ipsilaterally and contralaterally directed whole-body rotations in the dark (i.e., whole-body-rotations; see Materials and methods). As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, we found considerable heterogeneity in vestibular sensitivities across our Purkinje cell population. Some neurons generated excitatory versus inhibitory responses for oppositely directed head movements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; left, linear). Alternately, some neurons generated bidirectional excitatory responses (center, v-shaped), while others largely only generated excitatory responses for one movement direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; right, rectifying). This contrasts with the vestibular responses recorded in areas targeted by Purkinje cells in the anterior vermis. Notably, vestibular-only neurons in the rFN and vestibular nucleus consistently show excitatory versus inhibitory responses for oppositely directed head movements (rFN: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gardner and Fuchs, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shaikh et al., 2005</xref>; vestibular nucleus: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Scudder and Fuchs, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cullen and McCrea, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McCrea et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Roy and Cullen, 2004</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Purkinje cell simple spike’s responses to vestibular stimulation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Vestibular stimulation was generated by applying passive whole-body rotations about the vertical axis.

Our analysis further revealed that the response dynamics varied considerably across neurons, with 43% neurons demonstrating responses that were relatively in-phase (±15°) with head velocity (1.8 ± 7.7°), while others demonstrated marked response leads (32%, 57 ± 31) or lags (25%, –47.5 ± 22°). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C</xref> illustrates the vestibular response vectors for our populations of neurons computed in their preferred and non-preferred directions, respectively.

To assess each neuron’s proprioceptive sensitivity, we applied ipsilaterally and contralaterally directed rotations to the monkey’s body while its head was held stationary relative to space (i.e., body-under-head rotations; see Materials and methods), with the same motion profiles as those used for the assessment of vestibular sensitivities. Thus, since the head did not move relative to space, neck proprioceptors but not the vestibular system were stimulated in this condition. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> illustrates the responses recorded from the same three example neurons shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. We quantified the neck proprioceptive sensitivity of each Purkinje cell using least-squares dynamic regression (see Materials and methods) and found that most neurons (~75%, <italic>n</italic> = 54) were sensitive to passive proprioceptive stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, C</xref>, filled bars; bimodal neurons), whereas the remaining ~25% (<italic>n</italic> = 19) were insensitive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, C</xref>, open bars; unimodal neurons). Overall, similar to our findings above regarding vestibular stimulation, the dynamics of responses to proprioceptive stimulation varied considerably across Purkinje cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

To directly establish how vestibular and neck proprioceptive information is integrated in the anterior vermis, we next recorded the responses of the same Purkinje cell populations during combined stimulation of neck proprioceptors and the vestibular system. Specifically, we applied ipsilaterally and contralaterally directed rotations of the monkey’s head relative to its earth-stationary body (i.e., head-on-body rotations; see Materials and methods), again with the same motion profiles as those used above in the assessment of neuronal vestibular and neck proprioceptive sensitivities.

Correspondingly, there was good alignment between the vector length and direction computed for the firing rate estimate and prediction for these three example neurons for the head-on-body motion in the <italic>preferred direction</italic>.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref> summarizes the population data for unimodal and bimodal Purkinje cells in each of the three stimulation conditions.

Note that since there were no significant differences between the response of Type I and II cells (other than their preferred direction), we reported the responses of both groups together, by accounting for the difference in the direction of the modulation of Type II cells. We first hypothesized that the vestibular sensitivity of unimodal neurons should remain constant across conditions regardless of whether the neck proprioceptors were stimulated. Consistent with this proposal, we found that unimodal cell response sensitivities (open bars) were comparable during the vestibular-only and combined stimulation conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>, p &gt; 0.22). Likewise, response phases of unimodal neurons were comparable for both conditions (<italic>preferred</italic>: 11 ± 5 versus 11 ± 14; p = 0.21; versus <italic>non-preferred</italic>: 27 ± 8 versus 14 ± 18; p = 0.77). In contrast, we hypothesized that since the vestibular and proprioceptive sensitivities of bimodal Purkinje cells were generally antagonist (i.e., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), the oppositely modulated inputs from neck proprioceptors should effectively suppress the vestibular-driven responses during the combined conditions. Indeed, consistent with this prediction, the sensitivities of bimodal Purkinje cells were reduced during the combined stimulation condition relative to the vestibular-only condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>, filled bars, p &lt; 0.027).</p><p>Above, we showed that the responses of our three example neurons in the combined stimulation were well predicted by the linear summation of the neuron’s vestibular and proprioception sensitivities applied in isolation, particularly for stimulation in the <italic>preferred direction</italic>. We next explicitly addressed whether this simple linear model of vestibular-proprioceptive integration could reliably predict neuronal responses in the combined condition across our population of Purkinje cells. To do this, we compared the estimated and predicted head-on-body rotation sensitivities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) for all the Purkinje cells in our sample on a neuron by neuron basis. Overall, estimated and predicted sensitivities and phases were comparable (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.77 and 0.75 for sensitivity and phase, respectively, p &lt; 0.001). The similarity between values is shown by the slope of the line fitted to the data which were not different from 1 (p = 0.42 and 0.83 for gain and phase, respectively). Thus, the summation model provided a good estimate of the gain of the preferred direction responses during combined stimulation.

To better understand the coding by our population of neurons, we first computed a ‘head sensitivity’ and a ‘body sensitivity’ ratio for each neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, see Materials and methods). Two theoretical neurons, one that selectively encodes head-in-space and the other that selectively encodes body movement, are indicated by red and orange stars, respectively. A neuron selectively encoding head-in-space motion (red star) would display comparable responses to whole-body and head-on-body rotations (head sensitivity ratio = 1), while not responding to body-under-head rotations (body sensitivity ratio = 0). On the other hand, a neuron selectively encoding body motion would display a comparable response to whole-body and body-under-head rotations (orange star, body sensitivity ratio = 1), while not responding to head-on-body rotations (head sensitivity ratio = 0). In contrast, comparison of these ratios across each of the Purkinje cells in our neuronal population revealed considerable heterogeneity in the relationship between these two measures relative to these theoretical neurons. As reviewed above, anterior vermis Purkinje cells target neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei (i.e., rFN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Batton et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yamada and Noda, 1987</xref>).

The red and orange shaded areas represent the distribution of our sensitivity ratios for the unimodal and bimodal rFN neuron populations reported in this prior study.

Indeed, neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei of primates show such tuning. Specifically, the vestibular responses of bimodal neurons in the rFN modulate as a function of head position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brooks and Cullen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kleine et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shaikh et al., 2004</xref>).

Thus, we next asked: How is this tuning generated? And more specifically, is it computed within the deep cerebellar nuclei or instead inherited from the Purkinje cells that target neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei? To address these questions, we first determined whether the vestibular responses of Purkinje cells were affected by static changes in head-on-body position (i.e., ‘gain-field’ condition, see Materials and methods). We measured neuronal responses to vestibular stimulation (i.e., whole-body rotation) applied with the head positioned at five different orientations ranging from −30 (left) to +30° (right) relative to the body (−30°, –15°, 0°, 15°, and 30°). The example bimodal neuron was typical in that it displayed marked changes in vestibular sensitivity with changes in head-on-body position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

Note that the small number of unimodal neurons tested in this condition reflects that they constituted a relatively small percentage of our overall Purkinje cell population. First, bimodal neurons were more narrowly tuned than were unimodal neurons (mean tuning widths; 7.2 versus 15°, respectively). Additionally, bimodal neurons showed stronger tuning relative to unimodal neurons (mean tuning amplitude; 0.52 versus 0.05 (sp/s)/(°/s)), respectively. Finally, there was no difference in the mean of the tuning curve between unimodal neurons and bimodal neurons (p &gt; 0.37). We next compared the tuning of our bimodal and unimodal Purkinje cells with that previously described for their target neurons in the rFN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brooks and Cullen, 2009</xref>). The corresponding distributions of rFN neuron tuning width, amplitude, and mean direction are plotted in the bottom row of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>.

Moreover, tuning was consistently stronger for bimodal than unimodal neurons in Purkinje cells as has previously been shown for rFN neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, compare solid and dashed lines). We note that because the interaction between vestibular responses and head-on-body position that underlies the tuning shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> is inherently nonlinear, this tuning cannot be predicted by the component of the Purkinje cells’ dynamic modulation that is in phase with head position during body-under-head rotation (i.e., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Linear combination of the Purkinje cells’ response can encode head and body motion</title><p>To summarize, our results have shown that while most vestibular-sensitive Purkinje cells in the anterior vermis integrate vestibular and neck proprioceptive signals, the transformation from head- to body-centered reference frame is not complete.

Specifically, to quantify the actual number of Purkinje cells necessary to explain the responses of bimodal rFN neurons, we determined whether a simple linear model optimizing the weights of the activities of multiple Purkinje cells (see Materials and methods) could generate bimodal rFN neural responses across conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). As expected, combining the activities of more Purkinje cells (i.e., increasing population size) led to an increase in the goodness of fit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Datasets used for this modeling first included Purkinje cell responses recorded during (i) our three dynamic conditions (i.e., whole-body, body-under-head, head-on-body rotations) alone (black curve) and (ii) these same three dynamic conditions as well as the the gain-field condition (i.e., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; dashed blue curve). In the latter case, the tuning of Purkinje cells that were not held long enough to test during gain-field paradigm were generated from the tuning curves distribution of the tested neurons (see Materials and methods). Importantly, in both cases we found that the weighted activities of ~40 neurons generated responses that well approximated those previously reported for bimodal rFN neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, red arrow); the confidence intervals of our model estimations and that of the rFN neural responses completely overlapped for a population of ~40 neurons. Thus, a population of 40 Purkinje cells could explain the dynamic representation of body motion across conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), as well as robust encoding of vestibular stimuli as a function of static head position observed in bimodal rFN neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, right panel).</p><p>Above we described how Purkinje cells demonstrate considerable heterogeneity in their responses to both vestibular and proprioceptive stimulation. Thus, we next asked whether certain Purkinje cell classes were weighted higher in our population model than others. For example, given that rFN neurons show linear tuning, one might predict that Purkinje cells with linear tuning might be weighted higher in our population model than those with v-shaped tuning. However, we found that this was not the case. The model weight distributions were similar for linear versus v-shaped versus rectifying Purkinje cells. Similarly, model weight distributions were similar for (i) bimodal versus unimodal Purkinje cells, (ii) Type I versus Type II Purkinje cells, as well as (iii) Purkinje cells with agonistic versus antagonistic vestibular and proprioceptive responses. These distributions are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">2</xref> for our modeling of bimodal versus unimodal rFN neurons, respectively.</p><p>Finally, we note that our simple population model above in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> assumed no input to the rFN neurons other than that from Purkinje cells. However, the fastigial nucleus receives mossy fiber inputs via the vestibular nuclei, reticular formation, and central cervical nucleus (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Voogd et al., 1996</xref>) that likely also encode vestibular and/or neck proprioceptive information (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Roy and Cullen, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kubin et al., 1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kubin et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Thomson et al., 1996</xref>). Therefore, we next tested the effect of adding simulated mossy fiber inputs to our model. Prior studies have shown that the dynamics of responses of vestibular nuclei neurons strongly resemble those of unimodal fastigial neurons in rhesus monkeys (i.e., they encode vestibular input and are insensitive to neck proprioceptive inputs, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Roy and Cullen, 2001</xref>). In contrast, the response of neurons in the reticular formation and central cervical nucleus to such yaw head and/or neck rotations have not yet been described. We therefore simulated mossy fiber input first as a summation of vestibular and neck proprioceptive inputs, for which the gains and phases were randomly drawn from a distribution, comparable to that previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mitchell et al., 2017</xref>) in the vestibular nuclei (see Materials and methods). We repeated this approach for a total of 1000 simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>). We then further explored the effect of systematically altering this simulated mossy fiber input relative to the reference distribution of mossy fiber inputs by (i) doubling the gain, (ii) reducing the gain by half, (iii) doubling the phase, and (iv) reducing the phase by half (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4</xref>). Overall, we found that the addition of such simulated mossy fiber inputs did not dramatically alter our estimate of the Purkinje cell population size required to generate rFN neurons responses (~50 versus 40; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">4</xref>). Furthermore, comparable results were obtained for model weight distributions as shown above in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">2</xref>.</p><p>Finally, for completeness, we also used the same approach to quantify the number of Purkinje cells necessary to explain the responses of unimodal rFN neurons and obtained comparable results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Figure 7—figure supplement 5</xref>). Interestingly, our finding that a population of ~40–50 Purkinje cells is again required to explain the responses of bimodal and unimodal rFN neurons matches the value established independently from anatomical studies of Purkinje cell – deep cerebellar nucleus neuron projection ratio. We further consider this point below in the Discussion.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Summary of results</title><p>Here, we recorded the simple spike activity of Purkinje cells of the anterior vermis during passive vestibular (i.e., whole-body rotation), neck proprioceptive (i.e., body-under-head rotation), and a combination of vestibular and neck proprioceptive stimulation (i.e., head-on-body rotation). First, we found that most Purkinje cells responded to both vestibular and neck proprioceptive stimulation (i.e., bimodal neurons). Second, the linear combination of the responses to dynamic neck proprioceptive and vestibular stimulation alone provided a good estimate of each Purkinje cell’s response during combined stimulation. Third, bimodal neurons generally did not encode either the motion of the head or body in space across conditions. Instead, they dynamically encoded intermediate representations of self-motion between head and body motion. Additionally, bimodal neurons, but not unimodal neurons, showed tuning for the encoding of vestibular stimuli as a function of static head position. Finally, using a simple linear population model, we establish that combining inhibitory responses from ~40 to 50 Purkinje cells can explain the responses of target neurons in deep cerebellar nuclei across all self-movement conditions. Thus, our findings in alert monkeys provide new insight into the neural mechanisms underlying the coordinate transformation by which the cerebellum uses neck proprioceptive information to transform vestibular signals from a head- to body-centered reference frame.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Purkinje cells have diverse temporal responses to dynamic vestibular and neck proprioceptive sensory stimulation</title><p>The integration of vestibular and neck proprioceptive-related information is required to convert head-centered vestibular signals to the body-centered reference frame required for postural control (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cullen, 2019</xref>). Our recordings in the anterior vermis of alert monkeys demonstrate that most vestibular-sensitive Purkinje cells also encode neck proprioceptive-related information. As reviewed above, anterior vermis Purkinje cells project to the rFN, the most medial of the deep cerebellar nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fujita et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Husson et al., 2014</xref>) which plays a key role in the control of posture. Two types of rFN neurons have been previously identified in alert monkeys: unimodal and bimodal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brooks and Cullen, 2009</xref>). Unimodal neurons respond to vestibular stimulation during passive rotations and dynamically encode head movement. Bimodal rFN neurons respond to both vestibular and neck proprioceptive stimulation and dynamically encode body movement. Notably, because the vestibular and neck proprioceptive sensitivities of rFN bimodal neurons are both equal and complementary in sign, they sum linearly to effectively cancel each other during passive head-on-body rotations – a condition in which both sensory systems are activated but the body does not move in space. In contrast, here, we found that vestibular-sensitive anterior vermis Purkinje cells were on average more sensitive to vestibular than proprioceptive stimulation and that there was considerable variability in the relative signs of responses to each modality. As a result, cancellation of these two inputs during passive head-on-body rotations was the exception rather than the rule (i.e., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) with the vast majority of bimodal Purkinje cells demonstrating significant modulation in response to passively applied head-on-body rotations. Thus, unlike bimodal rFN neurons, which dynamically encode body motion, bimodal Purkinje cells dynamically encode an intermediate representation of self-motion.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Reference frame transformations: Purkinje cell’s vestibular responses modulated by posture</title><p>Theoretical models of reference frame transformations commonly include a sensory input (e.g., vestibular or visual information) that is modulated by a postural signal (e.g., head-on-body position) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pouget and Snyder, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Salinas and Abbott, 2001</xref>). The resultant modulation of the sensory signal is commonly referred to as a gain field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen and Mountcastle, 1983</xref>) and is thought to be mediated via nonlinear interactions between sensory responses and head/body referenced cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zipser and Andersen, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Salinas and Abbott, 2001</xref>). Our present results reveal the neural substrate of such a reference frame transformation required for postural control. Notably, bimodal anterior vermis Purkinje cells displayed vestibular tuning as a function of head-on-body position during horizontal rotations. This tuning is similar but not as strong as that shown by downstream bimodal neurons in the target rFN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brooks and Cullen, 2009</xref>), and indeed some rFN neurons do encode vestibular information in a body-centered reference frame for both two-dimensional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kleine et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shaikh et al., 2004</xref>) and three-dimensional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martin et al., 2018</xref>) self-motion. Thus, our present data establish that the modulation of vestibular information by a postural signal becomes more marked in the progression from the cerebellar cortex to the deep cerebellar nuclei. Interestingly, in the present study, such nonlinear interactions between neck position and vestibular signals were only in bimodal and not unimodal vestibular Purkinje cells. Future experiments are required to understand the implications of the dynamic coding of head rather than body movements by the unimodal neurons.</p><p>Finally, it is noteworthy that our findings regarding the transformation from a vestibular to head-centered reference frame in the anterior vermis of the alert primate contrast with those of Pompeiano, Manzoni, and colleagues in anesthetized decerebrate cats. Using dynamic tilt stimuli, they concluded that the direction of average response vector of Purkinje cells encoding both vestibular and proprioceptive information well corresponded to body tilt – consistent with a complete transformation from head- to body-centered reference frame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Denoth et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Manzoni et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Manzoni et al., 2004</xref>). One potential explanation for this apparent difference in neural strategy is that our studies were performed in intact alert behaving animals whereas Manzoni and colleagues completed their experiments in anesthetized decerebrate preparation where modulation/gating by cortical structures is not present. Additionally, there are significant differences across species regarding how the vestibular system integrates multimodal information even at the first stage of central processing in the vestibular nuclei (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cullen, 2019</xref>). For instance, vestibular nuclei neurons in alert mice, cats, and cynomolgus monkeys commonly display vestibular-proprioceptive convergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Medrea and Cullen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cullen, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McCall et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast, in rhesus monkeys, vestibular nuclei neurons are only sensitive to vestibular input, and instead, proprioceptive information is integrated only at the subsequent levels of vestibular processing, most notably in the deep nuclei of the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Roy and Cullen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brooks and Cullen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carriot et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Population coding: the heterogeneous response of Purkinje cells and convergence in the rFN</title><p>Our results establish that there is considerable heterogeneity in the response dynamics of anterior vermis Purkinje cells to vestibular and/or neck proprioceptive sensory stimulation. Semicircular canal afferents and vestibular nuclei neurons provide the primary source of vestibular information to the cerebellum via mossy fiber input. However, while they encode head velocity with a phase lead, the responses of individual Purkinje cells actually more often lagged rather than led head velocity. Albus and Marr proposed that the divergent feedforward mossy fiber projections onto a far larger number of granule cells effectively expand the dimensionality of neural space, in turn allowing better downstream decoding to linearly classify dynamic patterns of activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marr, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albus, 1971</xref>). Indeed, recent studies have shown that mossy fibers from multiple sensory systems converge on each of more than 50 billion granule cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chabrol et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Knogler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lanore et al., 2021</xref>), with interneurons likely further contributing to the temporal diversity of granule cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rousseau et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kennedy et al., 2014</xref>). In turn, &gt;100,000 granule cells project to a single Purkinje cell via parallel fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fujishima et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, together these features of the cerebellar microcircuitry are well designed to generate high-dimensional dynamic coding of information by Purkinje cells relative to their mossy fiber input across regions of the cerebellum including the anterior vermis.</p><p>In this context, the heterogeneity we observed in anterior vermis Purkinje cells’ responses then contrasts strikingly with the responses of their target neurons in rFN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brooks and Cullen, 2009</xref>). Our estimation that pooling the responses of a population of ~40–50 Purkinje cells can explain more homogeneous responses of bimodal and unimodal rFN neurons matches that established independently from anatomical studies of the Purkinje cell – deep cerebellar nucleus neuron projection ratio in rodents and cats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Person and Raman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Palkovits et al., 1977</xref>). Additionally, these Purkinje cells likely send direct projections to the vestibular nuclei. Testing with comparable stimulation protocols has established that the responses of vestibular nuclei neurons are comparable to those of unimodal rFN neurons (compare <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cullen, 2019</xref>, with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brooks and Cullen, 2014</xref>). Thus, our present modeling results regarding the population convergence required to account for unimodal rFN neurons can be directly applied to vestibular nuclei neurons. Interestingly, Purkinje cells can display patterns of neuronal synchrony during active movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Person and Raman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sarnaik and Raman, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wu and Raman, 2017</xref>) which could, in turn, alter the timing and modulation of target neuron responses in the deep cerebellar nuclei in a nonlinear manner. Nevertheless, we found that responses could be predicted using a simple linearly weighted summation of ~40–50 neurons. In this context, we note our modeling was based on averaged Purkinje cell and rFN neuron responses. Future studies including simultaneous recordings from Purkinje cells and rFN neurons can provide additional insight into whether comparable population sizes can account for single trial responses in real time.</p><p>Finally, it is noteworthy that our study focused on the sensory responses of Purkinje cells (i.e., responses to vestibular and/or proprioceptive stimulation) during <italic>passively</italic> applied self-motion. Prior studies focused on the responses of Purkinje cells during <italic>voluntary</italic> movements have similarly concluded that they are more heterogeneous than those of their target neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei (e.g., saccades: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Thier et al., 2000</xref>; wrist control: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tomatsu et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, in their analysis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tanaka et al., 2019</xref>, likewise estimated that linearly pooling the responses of ~40–50 Purkinje cells could account for the more homogeneous responses of target neurons in the deep cerebellar nucleus (i.e., the dentate nucleus) during voluntary wrist movements. We speculate that expanded dimensionality of the cerebellum provides a basis set for sensorimotor errors as well as plasticity at the level of Purkinje cells required to generate accurate movements (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sohn et al., 2021</xref>) as well as ensure robust calibration over time. Overall, our current results reveal a striking transformation from heterogeneous response dynamics of cerebellar Purkinje cells to more stereotyped response dynamics of neurons in the targeted deep cerebellar nucleus. These findings provide new insights into the neural computations that ultimately ensure accurate postural control in our daily lives.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental model and subject details</title><p>Animal experimentation: All experimental protocols were approved by the Johns Hopkins University Animal Care and Use Committee and were in compliance with the guidelines of the United States National Institutes of Health (PR19M408).

Loading doses of dexamethasone (1 mg/kg i.m.) and cefazolin (50 mg/kg i.v.) were administered to minimize swelling and prevent infection, respectively. Anticholinergic glycopyrrolate (0.005 mg/kg i.m.) was also preoperatively injected to stabilize heart rate and to reduce salivation, and then again, every 2.5–3 hr during surgery. During surgery, anesthesia was maintained using isoflurane gas (0.8–1.5%), combined with a minimum 3 l/min (dose adjusted to effect) of 100% oxygen. Heart rate, blood pressure, respiration, and body temperature were monitored throughout the procedure. During the surgical procedure, a stainless-steel post for head immobilization and recording chambers were fastened to each animal’s skull with stainless-steel screws and dental acrylic. Craniotomy was performed within the recording chamber to allow electrode access to the cerebellar cortex.

Extracellular single-unit activity was recorded using enamel-insulated tungsten microelectrodes (Frederick-Haer). The location of the anterior vermis of the cerebellar cortex was determined relative to the abducens nucleus identified based on stereotypical neuronal responses during eye movements. The Purkinje cells were identified by their characteristic complex spike activity. The angular velocity of the turntable was measured using a gyroscope sensor (Watson Industries, Eau Claire, WI). Monkeys’ gaze and head angular positions were measured using the magnetic search coil technique. The neck torque produced by the monkey against its head restraint was measured using a reaction torque transducer (QWFK-8M; Honeywell, Canton, MA). All analog behavioral signals were low-pass filtered with a 125 Hz cut-off frequency and acquired at 1 kHz. The neural activity was recorded at 30 kHz using a data acquisition system (Blackrock Microsystems).

Each neuron’s lack of response to eye movements was further confirmed by absent responses to smooth pursuit eye movements during sinusoidal target motion (0.5 Hz, 40°/s peak velocity).</p><p>Next, to characterize each Purkinje cell’s vestibular and proprioceptive sensitivities, we applied rotational stimuli mimicking the monkey’s head movement generated during ±30° orienting gaze shifts in the head-unrestrained condition (i.e., ‘active-like’ condition). Use of this head movement trajectory facilitates direct comparison with rFN and vestibular nuclei neurons (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brooks and Cullen, 2014</xref>). First, vestibular sensitivities were assessed by applying whole-body rotations about an earth-vertical axis in the dark (i.e., whole-body-rotations). Second, neck proprioceptive sensitivities were assessed by rotating the monkey’s body with this same active-like trajectory while its head was held stationary relative to space (i.e., body-under-head rotations). Third, neural sensitivities to combined proprioceptive and vestibular stimulation were assessed by passively rotating the monkey’s head relative to its stationary body (i.e., head-on-body rotations) with this same trajectory. Finally, in a subset of neurons, we also applied whole-body rotations about an earth-vertical axis in the dark (1 Hz, ±40˚/s) with the head statically oriented at five different positions relative to the body (−30°, –15°, 0°, 15°, and 30°) to assess whether static neck position influenced vestibular-induced modulation during whole-body sinusoidal rotation (i.e., the ‘gain-field’ condition).</p><p>Histological analysis confirmed that the Purkinje cells were located in lobules II–V of the anterior vermis, ~0–2 mm from the midline. We note that while we first tested the vestibular sensitivity of individual neurons, we did also test whether neurons that were insensitive to vestibular stimulation responded to neck proprioceptive stimulation. Consistent with Manzoni and colleagues’ prior studies in anesthetized cat (12%, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Manzoni et al., 1998</xref>), we found that only a small portion of Purkinje cells (~10%) fell into this latter category.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-4"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Analysis of neuronal discharge dynamics: Data were imported into the Matlab (MathWorks) programming environment for analysis, filtering, and processing as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dale and Cullen, 2019</xref>).

The sensitivity of the Purkinje cells to the neck proprioceptive stimulation (during body-under-head rotations) was used to categorize the cells into unimodal (zero sensitivity) and bimodal (non-zero sensitivity).</p><p>Neuronal tuning to vestibular and proprioceptive inputs was further categorized as linear, rectifying, or V-shaped. Linear neurons demonstrated increased and decreased firing rates in the preferred and non-preferred directions, respectively. The difference between the magnitude of sensitivities in each of the two directions was within 0.2 (sp/s)/(°/s). Rectifying neurons demonstrated increased firing rate in the preferred direction and minimal modulation (i.e., sensitivity smaller than 0.2 (sp/s)/(°/s)) in the non-preferred direction. V-shaped neurons demonstrated an increased firing rate in both directions. The difference between the magnitude of their sensitivities in each of the two directions was within 0.2 (sp/s)/(°/s). Finally, neurons that did not fit any of these criteria were characterized as ‘other’. Note that v-shaped neurons were categorized as Type I or II based on the direction for which their vestibular sensitivity was larger, since their responses in each direction were not identical.</p><p>We used a similar approach to estimate sensitivities to passive head-on-body movements. Since in this condition, it is not possible to dissociate neck proprioceptive and vestibular sensitivities, we estimated them as a single coefficient. Estimated sensitivities were compared to those predicted from the linear summation of the vestibular and proprioceptive sensitivities estimated for the same neuron during passive whole-body and body-under-head rotations (termed summation model), respectively. To quantify the ability of the linear regression analysis to model neuronal discharges, the variance-accounted-for (VAF) for each regression equation was determined as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cullen et al., 1996</xref>). Values are expressed as mean ± SD and paired-sample Student’s t-tests were used to assess differences between conditions.</p><p>Quantifying head versus body encoding: We computed a ‘head sensitivity ratio’ and ‘body sensitivity ratio’ for each Purkinje cell. These ratios were defined as the neuron’s (i) sensitivity to head-on-body rotation/sensitivity to whole-body rotation and (ii) sensitivity to body-under-head rotation/sensitivity to whole-body rotation, respectively. Further to quantify the relative encoding of head versus body motion by a given cell, we computed a ‘coding index’, which was defined as the ratio (smaller value)/(larger value) of these two ratios.</p><p>Quantification of head position on Purkinje cell vestibular sensitivity: The tuning curves for different head-on-body positions were fit with Gaussian curves with the following equation:<disp-formula id="equ4"><label>(4)</label><mml:math id="m4"><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>H</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where <italic>µ</italic> represents the mean, <italic>σ</italic> is a measure of the width, and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf15"><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is the amplitude from the peak to the base of the Gaussian curve (as described previously, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brooks and Cullen, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Population modeling of Purkinje cells: To determine whether integrating the activities of multiple Purkinje cells could explain the response of their target neurons in the rFN, we used the linear model below:<disp-formula id="equ5"><label>(5)</label><mml:math id="m5"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">^</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:munderover><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:msub><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf16"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">^</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> is a reconstructed firing rate response of an rFN neuron.

Next, we used the parameters of these Gaussian functions to find a normal distribution representing the tuning curves of bimodal Purkinje cells. Then, for the remaining Purkinje cells that were not recorded during the ‘gain-field’ condition, we generated tuning curves by drawing from this normal distribution. Since four unimodal Purkinje cells that were recorded during the ‘gain-field’ condition did not demonstrate significant tuning, we did not consider any tuning to the remaining unimodal Purkinje cells.</p><p>Finally, we modeled the contribution of the mossy fiber input to the rFN as a summation of independent responses to vestibular and neck proprioceptive stimulation. To simulate the mossy fiber input, we randomly selected response gains and phases from normal distributions that described the responses of neurons in the vestibular nuclei (i.e., 0.6 ± 0.1 (sp/s)/(°/s) and 20 ± 5°, respectively), and repeated this for a total of 1000 simulations. We further assessed the robustness of our modeling performance by modifying these distributions. Specifically, we tested the effect of either doubling or halving the gain (i.e., 1.2 ± 0.2 and 0.3 ± 0.05 (sp/s)/(°/s), respectively) or phase (i.e., 40 ± 10° and 10 ± 2.5°, respectively), resulting simulations based on four modifications of the original distribution.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Supervision, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All experimental protocols were approved by the Johns Hopkins University Animal Care and Use Committee and were in compliance with the guidelines of the United States National Institutes of Health.(PR19M408).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-75018-mdarchecklist1-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data and codes to generate figures are available on Figshare under the URL: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.19362239">https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.19362239</ext-link>.</p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research was supported by grants R01-DC002390 and R01-DC018061 from the National Institutes of Health (KEC).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Andrew King as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Stephen H Scott (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All Reviewers had concerns about the rFN model, in particular (a) the absence of mossy fiber inputs to fastigial neurons, and (b) whether it's just easiest to get this fastigial response by down-weighting the PCs with ipsilaterally-signed vestibular and proprioceptive signals, which would make it less interesting. More information about the model is required. At a minimum, please add (1) additional discussion of the assumptions and limitations of the model, and (2) analysis of the distribution of model weights over different classes of PCs (especially linear vs v-shaped or rectifying). Please also see the more detailed comments from the individual reviews below.</p><p>2) There was concern during the consultation phase that the focus of the paper is the difference in sensitivity to vestibular vs proprioceptive stimuli, and yet different stimuli are being presented in the two conditions (e.g., compare body velocity in Figure 1A Cell 1, and Figure 2A, Cell 1). It was not clear how these differences might impact the regression coefficients and model performance. The velocity differences between conditions should be addressed directly in the manuscript. Specifically, the reason for the discrepancy (and, if relevant, the experimental constraints on matching the velocities) should be explained in the Methods and discussed explicitly in the text. The reviewers further agreed that the authors should address this issue by (1) providing the total variance-accounted-for for all neurons (not just the normalized values in Supp 1and2), (2) plotting the residuals vs predicted firing rate for all neurons, and (3) providing additional justification that the model is not overfit, if possible.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– The writing, particularly in the Results section, is very abrupt. The reader has to go to the Methods section immediately to understand what stimulus is even being provided, let alone what the motivation for the experiments is. Even as someone with reasonable experience in the vestibular field, I had difficulty following the logic of the experimental design.</p><p>– The authors have used a &quot;naturalistic&quot; rotational stimulus, about which I have several questions. First, I didn't understand the motivation for using this. Second, based on the figures, this rotational stimulus varied significantly across experiments. E.g., the head and velocity traces in Figure 1A are quite different for Cell 1, Cell 2, and Cell 3. Why deliver different stimuli if the goal is to make comparisons across cells? Even more confusing, the body velocity traces delivered to those exact same cells (Figure 2) appear again quite different. Why deliver different body velocity stimuli in the proprioceptive versus vestibular experiments? Since the entire manuscript focuses on the comparison between these stimuli, it would seem important to hold the parameters constant across the experiments. Head velocity traces are also different, or appear different, across the rotations at different head-on-body angles (Figure 5; e.g. the head velocity stimulus in 5A for +15 vs +30 is different in amplitude).</p><p>– In Figure 5, the authors make the interesting observation that vestibular sensitivity of PCs actually varies depending on the head angle relative to the body. I was expecting that they would then test whether the neck proprioceptive &quot;position&quot; term (that they had derived from the experiments in Figure 2) could be used to predict this shift in sensitivity. Instead, the authors directly jump to comparisons with the rostral fastigial population recorded in a prior study. Can they calculate whether their proprioceptive position weights (c_a,2 from equation 1) explain the measured difference in vestibular sensitivity?</p><p>– In Figure 6, the authors show modeling evidence that linear summation of Purkinje cells can produce the tuning results of fastigial neurons. They don't address whether an alternate explanation, that some of the proprioceptive or vestibular tuning derives from direct mossy fiber afferents to fastigial neurons, is possible. Furthermore, they don't seem to address the basic surprise here, that although the PCs show much less &quot;cancellation&quot; between vestibular and proprioceptive inputs (p. 11, last paragraph) than fastigial neurons do, the summation of PC inputs can produce fastigial responses. One assumes that the only way to obtain this result is preferential summation of the small set of PCs that do show cancellation (oppositely signed proprioceptive and vestibular sensitivities) but this is never discussed. If that is the underlying explanation of their model's success, then it seems quite weak.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I think the first experiment is strong and the paper should emphasize even more the comparison between Purkinje cells and the downstream fastigial neurons. I think some example fastigial neurons could be added to contrast with the Purkinje cell responses. Importantly, Figure 4C shows a red and orange cloud to denote the rFN neurons, but this is very hard to see in the figure. I think the individual neurons should be plotted to highlight the substantive difference between these Purkinje cells and fastigial neurons.</p><p>I'm not sure the model is that insightful given that it assumes that there is no other input to the fastigial nucleus. I assume that it would have substantive vestibular and neck proprioceptive input from mossy fibers. As stated in the comment above, is the point of the Purkinje cell activity to counter the sensory input from the mossy fibers in order to create two distinct signals, one related to head and one to body motion in the fastigial population? Thus, a variant for the model would be to show how the population model could create distinct head and body motion signals to counter the presence of a random pattern of vestibular and neck proprioceptive input (assumed to be generated by mossy fiber input). A more advanced model might be interesting in which weights of the parallel fibers onto Purkinje neurons are altered given random mossy fiber inputs to granule cells and fastigial neurons leading to distinct head and body motion signals in the fastigial neurons, but this is certainly beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><p>The cells in Figure 1 and 2 show the same patterns (linear, v-shaped, rectified) across the two conditions. I assume this was common for bimodal cells? Was there any analyses done to support or refute this?</p><p>Figure 1 shows that all neurons were sensitive to vestibular input, and no unimodal proprioceptive neurons. Is this an order effect of the experiment in that you always tested vestibular first, and if responsive, then you completed the rest of the experiments? Thus, could there be proprioceptive only neurons, but they were not examined in this study due to the protocol. This is important and needs to be clearly stated in the manuscript, one way or another.</p><p>The small sample size makes conclusions regarding head-on-body position a bit of a challenge. Notably, there are only 4 unimodal neurons for Purkinje cells in Figure 5C. The number of neurons is only noted in the figure legend and the number of neurons for the fastigial nucleus is not stated at all and looks to be 11 for bimodal and 10 for unimodal. I think the main text needs to clearly state the actual numbers and recognize the very small sample size for this analysis. These limited number of neurons to characterize tuning properties also weakens the modelling results and conclusions about 40 neurons necessary to predict fastigial neuron responses.</p><p>In Figure 4C it looks like the positive body sensitivity ratio neurons tend to have larger values than the negative sensitivity ratio neurons. Is this just a random sampling issue?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1 – &quot;All non-significant coefficients were set to zero.&quot; In the Methods, the authors should briefly describe the rationale for using this approach instead of L1 regularization.</p><p>2 – The acceleration term appears to dominate in the non-preferred direction for vestibular stimulation (Figure S1A); why?</p><p>3 – Typo: &quot;Albus and Marrs&quot; -&gt; &quot;Albus and Marr&quot;.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.75018.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All Reviewers had concerns about the rFN model, in particular (a) the absence of mossy fiber inputs to fastigial neurons, and (b) whether it's just easiest to get this fastigial response by down-weighting the PCs with ipsilaterally-signed vestibular and proprioceptive signals, which would make it less interesting.

We have address each of the reviewers’ main concerns.</p><p>First, to consider the influence of mossy fiber inputs, we followed Reviewer #2’s suggestion and modeled mossy fiber input using random patterns of vestibular and neck proprioceptive input. Prior studies have shown that the dynamics of vestibular nuclei neuron responses strongly resemble those of unimodal fastigial neurons in rhesus monkeys (i.e., they encode vestibular input and are insensitive to neck proprioceptive inputs, Roy and Cullen, 2001). In contrast, reticular formation neurons responses to such yaw head and/or neck rotations have not yet been described. We therefore simulated mossy fiber input first as a summation of vestibular and neck proprioceptive inputs, for which the gains and phases were randomly drawn from a distribution, comparable to that previously reported (Mitchell er al. 2017) in the vestibular nuclei (Figure 7—figure supplement 3). We then further explored the effect of systematically altering this simulated mossy fiber input – relative to the reference distribution of mossy fiber inputs – by i) doubling the gain, ii) reducing the gain by half, iii) doubling the phase, and iv) reducing the phase by half (Figure 7—figure supplement 4). Overall, we found that the addition of such simulated mossy fiber did not dramatically alter our estimate of the population Purkinje cell population size required to generate rFN neurons responses (~50 versus 40; Figure 7—figure supplement 3 and 4).</p><p>Second, to address the reviewers’ concerns regarding the Purkinje cell weights, we have added a new inset to Figure 7C. As can be seen, model weights are well distributed across different Purkinje cells. Further, to confirm that the distribution of the weights of Purkinje cells inputs are distributed over different classes of PCs we now illustrate the weight distributions for (a) linear vs. v-shaped vs. rectifying Purkinje cells, (b) bimodal vs. unimodal Purkinje cells, (c) Type I vs. Type II Purkinje cells and (d) Purkinje cells with agonistic vs. antagonistic vestibular and proprioceptive sensitivities. These results are shown in Figure 7-supplemental figures 1 and 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There was concern during the consultation phase that the focus of the paper is the difference in sensitivity to vestibular vs proprioceptive stimuli, and yet different stimuli are being presented in the two conditions (e.g., compare body velocity in Figure 1A Cell 1, and Figure 2A, Cell 1).

The apparent discrepancy was due to an error in finalizing Figure 2. The left panel of Figure 2A illustrated a different cell than that shown in Figures1A and 3B, plotted at different time/amplitude scales than indicated by the bars. We have corrected this figure in the revised manuscript. Indeed, movement trajectories were well matched across all of our conditions, and we have revised the METHODS to more clearly explain how velocities were matched across conditions. Additionally, as requested, we now present the total variance-accounted-for for all neuron responses during whole-body and body-under-head stimulation in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 and Figure 2—figure supplement 2, respectively. Finally, we have also revised the METHODS to explain our linear regression method more clearly. Briefly, as stated in our response to Reviewer #3, a bootstrapping approach was used to prevent overfitting instead of lasso L1 regularization, since we used a non-negative/non-positive criterion in the least-square linear regression and to the best of our knowledge, there is no commonly used package for non-negative lasso regularization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– The writing, particularly in the Results section, is very abrupt.

Specifically, we chose these rotational stimuli for 2 main reasons: (1) First they mimic typical head movements generated by monkeys during orienting gaze shifts in the head-unrestrained condition. Thus, use of these stimuli facilitates future comparisons with neuronal responses during active head rotations. (2) Second, comparable stimuli have been used to assess the responses of both rFN and vestibular nuclei neurons to applied vestibular, proprioceptive, and combined stimulation in rhesus monkeys (see for example Brooks et al., 2015). Thus, the use of these stimuli also facilitates the direct comparison between rFN and vestibular nuclei neurons and the Purkinje cells in the present study. To improve clarity, we have revised the text and now refer to these stimuli as “active-like” motion profiles in the revised METHODS, consistent with the terminology used by Brooks et al., 2015.</p><p>We also agree that it is important to apply comparable stimuli in all three paradigms (whole-body, body-under-head, and head-on-body). Indeed, this was the case in our study. As explained in the response to the reviewers’ consensus comments the apparent inconsistency across the example cells in old Figure 2 was due to a scaling error that has now been corrected. We apologize for this oversight. A similar issue has also been corrected in figure 5A, and we have confirmed that the scaling is now correct for all figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In Figure 5, the authors make the interesting observation that vestibular sensitivity of PCs actually varies depending on the head angle relative to the body. I was expecting that they would then test whether the neck proprioceptive &quot;position&quot; term (that they had derived from the experiments in Figure 2) could be used to predict this shift in sensitivity. Instead, the authors directly jump to comparisons with the rostral fastigial population recorded in a prior study. Can they calculate whether their proprioceptive position weights (c_a,2 from equation 1) explain the measured difference in vestibular sensitivity?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We note, however, that it is not theoretically possible to predict a neuron’s “gain field” tuning via the linear addition its response to the static head-on-body position, which was estimated during body-under-head rotation (i.e., Figure 2A). This is because the estimated position term is a fixed value which would not contribute to a head position-dependent change in dynamic firing rate modulation. Put another way, the interaction between vestibular responses and head-on-body position that underlies the tuning shown in Figure 6 (old Figure 5) is inherently nonlinear. We have revised the RESULTS to discuss this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In Figure 6, the authors show modeling evidence that linear summation of Purkinje cells can produce the tuning results of fastigial neurons. They don't address whether an alternate explanation, that some of the proprioceptive or vestibular tuning derives from direct mossy fiber afferents to fastigial neurons, is possible. Furthermore, they don't seem to address the basic surprise here, that although the PCs show much less &quot;cancellation&quot; between vestibular and proprioceptive inputs (p. 11, last paragraph) than fastigial neurons do, the summation of PC inputs can produce fastigial responses. One assumes that the only way to obtain this result is preferential summation of the small set of PCs that do show cancellation (oppositely signed proprioceptive and vestibular sensitivities) but this is never discussed. If that is the underlying explanation of their model's success, then it seems quite weak.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted in our response to the reviewers’ consensus feedback above, we have performed additional modeling to consider the influence of mossy fiber inputs and present these new results at the end of the revised RESULTS. Briefly, following Reviewer #2’s suggestion, we modeled mossy fiber input using random patterns of vestibular and neck proprioceptive input drawn from the experimentally distribution observed in the vestibular nuclei. As shown in Figure 7-supplemental figure 3, our new analysis demonstrates that any of these simulated mossy fiber inputs can be combined with Purkinje cell inputs to create two distinct signals, one related to head and one to body motion – consistent with the responses of target unimodal and bimodal rFN neurons. respectively. We then further explored the effect of systematically altering this simulated mossy fiber input – relative to the reference distribution of mossy fiber inputs – by i) doubling the gain, ii) reducing the gain by half, iii) doubling the phase, and iv) reducing the phase by half (Figure 7—figure supplement 4). Overall, we found that the addition of such simulated mossy fiber did not dramatically alter our estimate of the population Purkinje cell population size required to generate rFN neurons responses (~50 versus 40; Figure 7—figure supplement 3 and 4).</p><p>Finally, regarding the comment that “the PCs show much less &quot;cancellation&quot; between vestibular and proprioceptive inputs”, we believe that the reviewer is referring to the fact that because vestibular vs. proprioceptive sensitives are typically of opposite sign for bimodal rFN neurons they effectively cancel during combined stimulation (i.e., head-on-body), whereas this is not observed for Purkinje cells. We agree that it is interesting to understanding the relative contribution of agonistic vs. antagonistic Purkinje cells. Thus, in the revised manuscript we now report the weight distributions of Purkinje cells with agonistic vs. antagonistic vestibular and proprioceptive sensitivities. These results are shown in Figure 7-supplemental figures 1and2. Notably, our new findings confirm that both classes have similar weights, such that the heterogeneity that we observed Purkinje cell’s response is represented in the input to the model of fastigial responses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I think the first experiment is strong and the paper should emphasize even more the comparison between Purkinje cells and the downstream fastigial neurons. I think some example fastigial neurons could be added to contrast with the Purkinje cell responses. Importantly, Figure 4C shows a red and orange cloud to denote the rFN neurons, but this is very hard to see in the figure. I think the individual neurons should be plotted to highlight the substantive difference between these Purkinje cells and fastigial neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have revised Figure 5A (old Figure 4C) to include plots of example rFN neurons from our previous study (i.e., Brooks and Cullen 2009) to emphasize the difference between Purkinje cells and fastigial neurons responses across paradigms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I'm not sure the model is that insightful given that it assumes that there is no other input to the fastigial nucleus. I assume that it would have substantive vestibular and neck proprioceptive input from mossy fibers. As stated in the comment above, is the point of the Purkinje cell activity to counter the sensory input from the mossy fibers in order to create two distinct signals, one related to head and one to body motion in the fastigial population? Thus, a variant for the model would be to show how the population model could create distinct head and body motion signals to counter the presence of a random pattern of vestibular and neck proprioceptive input (assumed to be generated by mossy fiber input). A more advanced model might be interesting in which weights of the parallel fibers onto Purkinje neurons are altered given random mossy fiber inputs to granule cells and fastigial neurons leading to distinct head and body motion signals in the fastigial neurons, but this is certainly beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above, we have performed additional modeling to directly address the reviewer’s concern.

I assume this was common for bimodal cells? Was there any analyses done to support or refute this?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this observation and suggestion. We performed an additional analysis (Figure 2—figure supplement 3) and found that the category (i.e., linear, v-shaped, rectified, etc.) of most of the Purkinje cells is generally not the same across the two conditions. Thus, Purkinje cells show considerable heterogeneity in their simple spike responses dynamics to vestibular versus proprioceptive stimulation. We now note this in the RESULTS.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1 shows that all neurons were sensitive to vestibular input, and no unimodal proprioceptive neurons. Is this an order effect of the experiment in that you always tested vestibular first, and if responsive, then you completed the rest of the experiments? Thus, could there be proprioceptive only neurons, but they were not examined in this study due to the protocol. This is important and needs to be clearly stated in the manuscript, one way or another.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that we generally first tested the vestibular sensitivity of individual neurons. We however did check whether neurons that were insensitive to vestibular stimulation responded to neck proprioceptive stimulation. We found that only a minority of Purkinje cells (~10%) fell into this latter category – a result is similar to that of Manzoni and colleagues in anesthetized cat (12%, Manzoni et al., 1998). We now provide this information in the revised Methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The small sample size makes conclusions regarding head-on-body position a bit of a challenge. Notably, there are only 4 unimodal neurons for Purkinje cells in Figure 5C. The number of neurons is only noted in the figure legend and the number of neurons for the fastigial nucleus is not stated at all and looks to be 11 for bimodal and 10 for unimodal. I think the main text needs to clearly state the actual numbers and recognize the very small sample size for this analysis. These limited number of neurons to characterize tuning properties also weakens the modelling results and conclusions about 40 neurons necessary to predict fastigial neuron responses.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above, we have revised the Results to clarify the numbers of Purkinje cells that were tested (13 bimodal and 4 unimodal Purkinje cells). For comparison, in our Brooks and Cullen study, tuning curves were computed for 10 bimodal and 12 unimodal rFN. We note that i) unimodal Purkinje cells make up a relatively small percentage of anterior vermis Purkinje cells and ii) similar to unimodal rFN, our small sample of unimodal Purkinje cells did not demonstrate significant tuning. In contrast, all bimodal Purkinje cells in our sample demonstrated significant tuning. To simulate responses for the bimodal Purkinje cells that were not held long enough to test during gain-field paradigm (i.e., Figure 6), we generated tuning curves drawn from a normal distribution estimated from 13 bimodal Purkinje cells. We appreciate this was not clear in the original submission and have revised the Methods section to clarify our approach. Overall, while we recognize that our sample size is small, we nevertheless found it interesting that including this our results from this protocol did not increase the estimated population size relative to that estimated using our other dynamic protocols.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 4C it looks like the positive body sensitivity ratio neurons tend to have larger values than the negative sensitivity ratio neurons.
