The enzyme catalyses the reversible conversion of fumaric to L-malic acid in mitochondria as part of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and in the cytosol/nucleus as part of the DNA damage response (DDR). Here, we show that fumarase of the model prokaryote <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (Fum-bc) is induced upon DNA damage, co-localized with the bacterial DNA and is required for the DDR. Fum-bc can substitute for both eukaryotic functions in yeast. Furthermore, we found that the fumarase-dependent intracellular signaling of the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> DDR is achieved via production of L-malic acid, which affects the translation of RecN, the first protein recruited to DNA damage sites. This study provides a different evolutionary scenario in which the dual function of the ancient prokaryotic fumarase, led to its subsequent distribution into different cellular compartments in eukaryotes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30927.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Living cells make an enzyme called fumarase. It converts a chemical called fumaric acid into L-malic acid. This is a crucial step in primary metabolism and aerobic respiration, the process of using oxygen to release energy for life. Yet it is not the only role that fumarase plays. In the cells of eukaryotes such as plants, animals and even baker’s yeast, aerobic respiration happens inside compartments called mitochondria. Yet fumarase is also found in the nucleus, which contains the cell’s genetic material. Inside the nucleus, this enzyme takes part in the DNA damage response that senses and repairs damage to the genetic code.</p><p>Simpler organisms, like bacteria, do not have mitochondria or a nucleus. Instead, all their reactions take place inside the main space within the cell. The current model for the evolution of fumarase is that the enzyme evolved in an ancient bacterium for the production of energy. Then, in more complex organisms, becoming split between the mitochondria and the nucleus allowed it to take on a second role in the DNA damage response. Singer et al. now challenge that model, and show that fumarase takes part in DNA damage repair in bacteria too.</p><p><italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> has one fumarase gene, known as <italic>fum-bc</italic>. Singer et al. showed that, without this gene, the bacteria do not grow well under conditions where they need to use aerobic respiration. But, the bacteria also became sensitive to DNA-damaging agents such as ionizing radiation or a chemical called methyl methanesulfonate.</p><p>Singer et al. then expressed the bacterial <italic>fum-bc</italic> gene in baker’s yeast, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. This organism has mitochondria and a cell nucleus. With the yeast's own fumarase gene switched off, the bacterial fumarase was able to take on both roles – aerobic respiration and the DNA damage response.</p><p>In bacteria grown with the DNA-damaging chemical, the level of fumarase started to rise. A fluorescent tag revealed that it also changed location, moving close to the bacteria’s DNA. As such, even in bacteria, fumarase has two roles. Further experiments showed that the L-malic acid made by fumarase affects the production of a protein called RecN, and it is this protein that triggers DNA repair.</p><p>These findings shed new light on the evolution of fumarase, and suggest that its dual role evolved before its dual location in eukaryotes. The next step is to find out exactly how L-malic acid affects the production of RecN.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>fumarase</kwd><kwd>L- Malic acid</kwd><kwd>double strand break</kwd><kwd>RecN</kwd><kwd>DNA damage response</kwd><kwd>metabolite signaling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>B. subtilis</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pines</surname><given-names>Ophry</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>German Israeli Project Cooperation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pines</surname><given-names>Ophry</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>CREATE Project of the National Research Foundation of Singapore</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pines</surname><given-names>Ophry</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The dual function of an ancient prokaryotic enzyme, which is linked to specific metabolite signals, may have been the evolutionary driving force behind its dual localization in eukaryotes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The enzyme fumarase (classII, fumarate hydratase in higher eukaryotes) is a conserved protein in all organisms from bacteria to human with respect to its sequence, structure, and enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akiba et al., 1984</xref>). Fumarase is a dual targeted protein in eukaryotes; its echoforms are distributed between mitochondria and the cytosol/nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yogev et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yogev et al., 2010</xref>). Moonlighting of proteins is also a well-known phenomenon, which is defined by single proteins that can perform different functions in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gancedo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Espinosa-Cantú et al., 2015</xref>). Fumarase is also a moonlighting protein since it performs functions in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in mitochondria and it participates in the DNA damage response (DDR) in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boukouris et al., 2016</xref>). In the TCA cycle, fumarase converts fumaric acid to L-malic acid while in the nucleus it catalyses the opposite reaction, thereby supplying fumaric acid as a signaling molecule for the DDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yogev et al., 2010</xref>). In human cells, fumaric acid has been shown to inhibit certain histone dimethylases and prolyl hydroxylases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gottlieb and Tomlinson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Isaacs et al., 2005</xref>). Worth mentioning is that fumarase associates with different protein partners in the two compartments (in the mitochondria where it is part of the TCA cycle, it interacts with other TCA cycle enzymes such as malate dehydrogenase, while in the cytosol/nucleus, it interacts with components of the DDR such as kinases and histones). Two questions with regard to the evolution of fumarase come to mind; (1) how and when did dual targeting of the protein evolve? And (2) how and when did dual function of the protein evolve?</p><p>With regard to the first question, fumarase has been shown to distribute between the mitochondria and the cytosol/nucleus by different mechanisms in different eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yogev et al., 2011</xref>). In Arabidopsis, there are two fumarase-encoding genes, which are highly homologous, besides the fact that one encodes a mitochondrial targeting signal (MTS), while the other lacks it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pracharoenwattana et al., 2010</xref>). In human, there is a single gene, however, it makes multiple mRNAs, which either encode or lack a MTS. In these cases, described above, two different types of mRNA are made which determine dual localization of fumarase echoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dik et al., 2016</xref>). In yeast (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>), mitochondrial and cytosolic echoforms of fumarase, are encoded by a single nuclear gene (FUM1) and follow an intriguing mechanism of protein subcellular localization and distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yogev et al., 2011</xref>). Translation of all FUM1 messages initiates only from the 5'-proximal AUG codon and results in a single translation product that contains the MTS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yogev et al., 2007</xref>). The precursor of yeast fumarase is first partially translocated into mitochondria, so that the N-terminal signal is cleaved. While a subset of these molecules continues to be fully translocated into the organelle, the rest are folded into an import-incompetent conformation and are released by the retrograde movement back into the cytosol. Thus, protein folding is the driving force for fumarase dual targeting in yeast, a mechanism termed reverse translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Karniely and Pines, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kalderon and Pines, 2014</xref>). Dual localization is a very abundant phenomenon in eukaryotes, and in fact, we estimate that a third of the yeast mitochondrial proteome is dual targeted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ben-Menachem et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, dual targeting or dual localization of proteins is a major outcome of gene expression and as such, the evolutionary pressures governing this phenomenon are of fundamental importance. In a major discovery, we have shown that dual-targeted proteins are significantly more evolutionary conserved than exclusive mitochondrial proteins. We reached this conclusion by employing codon usage bias, propensity for gene loss, phylogenetic relationships, conservation analysis at the DNA level, and gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dinur-Mills et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kisslov et al., 2014</xref>). This has changed the way we think about dual targeting since we now assume that the majority of dual targeted proteins have discrete functions in the different subcellular compartments, regardless of their dual-targeting mechanism. Thus we hypothesize that dual targeting is maintained due to separate selective pressures administered by the different compartments to maintain the functions associated with the protein sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kisslov et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we use the enzyme fumarase as a paradigm of this evolution and show for the first time that the single fumarase gene of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> is involved in the bacterial DDR, in addition to its role in the TCA cycle. This finding suggests that dual function of fumarase, in the bacterial progenitor, preceded the dual targeting that we find in eukaryotes. Intriguingly, fumarase in bacteria, similarly to eukaryotes, appears to be linked to the DDR by metabolite signaling, however the active molecule in this case is L-malic acid and not fumaric acid.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Bacterial fum-bc functions in the TCA cycle and the DDR</title><p>The conservation of fumarase dual function in eukaryotes without conservation of the mechanism of dual targeting has brought us to examine the following hypothesis: Dual function of fumarase in bacteria preceded dual targeting in eukaryotes; in other words, it occurred in the prokaryotic ancestor prior to evolving of eukaryotes. Thus, dual function was the driving force for fumarase dual localization in the eukaryotic cell. To examine this question we employed the Gram positive bacterium <italic>Bacillus subtilis,</italic> which contains a single class II fumarase gene (<italic>fum-bc</italic>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> (compare the right and left panels), <italic>B. subtilis</italic> deleted for the <italic>citG</italic> gene (<italic>fum-bc</italic>) which encodes fumarase, exhibits very poor growth on defined medium (S7) containing a low level of glucose (0.1%) that requires respiration and the TCA cycle for efficient growth. Thus, as expected, Fum-bc has a crucial function within the TCA cycle. Intriguingly, <italic>fum-bc</italic> deleted strains are sensitive to DNA damaging agents such as ionized radiation (IR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, middle panel) or methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We expressed Fum-bc from the ectopic amyE locus (Δfum+Fum-bc, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) and this strain exhibits similar resistance to MMS treatment as the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, compare the first and third rows). The slight difference in resistance may be since fumarase is expressed from the amyE locus and not from its native promoter. Quantitative experiments following colony forming units (CFU) are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ci</xref> and 1Cii. The difference between wild type and Δfum strains is insignificant (compare the two left bars of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ci</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Cii</xref>) while the difference between these strains following DNA damage is highly significant (bars 4 and 5, p&lt;0.01). These results suggest, as we hypothesized, that dual function of fumarase can already be found in prokaryotes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30927.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Fumarase is required for an efficient DNA damage response in <italic>Bacillus subtilis.</italic></title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> wild type (Bs WT) and Δfum (=ΔcitG) strains were untreated (control) or exposed to ionized radiation (150 Gy) and then serially diluted onto LB plates or minimal S7 medium plates (containing 0.1% glucose).

The levels of fumarase in cultures grown in galactose medium of wild type yeast, yeast deleted for the chromosomal <italic>FUM1</italic> and such a deletion strain expressing bacterial <italic>fum-bc</italic>, are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>. The <italic>fum-bc</italic> gene was expressed in a yeast strain deleted for the endogenous <italic>FUM1</italic> gene (<italic>Δfum1</italic>). This strain was grown on glucose (dextrose) as a control medium that does not require respiration for growth, and on ethanol which does require respiration and the function of the TCA cycle. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, yeast strains deleted for the endogenous <italic>FUM1</italic> and expressing <italic>fum-bc</italic> can partially complement the lack of yeast fumarase for growth on ethanol (compare row 4 [fum-bc expression] to row 2 [no fumarase expression]). Fum-bc does not contain a mitochondrial targeting sequence and it is not targeted to, or imported into mitochondria. We have performed subcellular fractionation of yeast cells expressing fum-bc. The bacterial protein is located only in the ‘cytosol’ and not in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). From previous studies, it turns out that fumarase, located outside mitochondria, can nevertheless function in the TCA cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sass et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Stein et al., 1994</xref>). The explanation for this is that the metabolites fumarate and malate can enter and exit the organelle (via specific inner membrane transporters) thereby completing the TCA cycle.</p><p>To examine the activity of Fum-bc in the DNA damage response, the yeast FUM<sup>m</sup> strain was employed. The FUM<sup>m</sup> strain harbors a chromosomal FUM1 deletion (<italic>Δfum1</italic>) and a FUM1 ORF (open reading frame) insertion in the mitochondrial DNA, thereby allowing exclusive mitochondrial fumarase (Fum1) expression, but lacking extra-mitochondrial (cytosolic/nuclear) fumarase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yogev et al., 2010</xref>). Accordingly, the FUM<sup>m</sup> strain exhibits a functional TCA cycle and the ability to respire; however, it displays sensitivity to DNA damaging agents such as ionized radiation. When <italic>fum-bc</italic> is expressed in the yeast FUM<sup>m</sup> strain, it can complement the lack of extra-mitochondrial fumarase with respect to sensitivity to ionized radiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, compare row 3 [cytosolic fum-bc expression] to row 2 [no cytosolic fumarase expression]). These results support our hypothesis that bacterial fumarase has the capacity to function both in the TCA cycle and the DNA damage response.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Fum-bc is induced upon DNA damage, and is co-localized with the bacterial DNA</title><p>To examine the role of fumarase in the DDR, <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> cells were grown to log phase and then incubated in the presence or absence of MMS. Cell extracts were analyzed with time by western blot using a mixture of anti yeast fumarase (anti yFum) and anti human fumarase-FH (anti hFum) antibodies. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> the level of Fum-bc gradually increases (compare the top panel to the SigmaA loading control in the lower panel. After 60 min of MMS treatment, the amount of fumarase rises two fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This finding is consistent with the proposed function of Fum-bc in the DDR. As shown In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, the levels of other TCA cycle enzymes, citrate synthase 2 (citZ) and isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH), do not change significantly upon treatment with MMS.We next asked whether the appearance and localization of Fum-bc changes upon induction of the DNA damage response.

Without DNA damaging treatment the fum-bc-GFP foci and DAPI stained DNA do not regularly superimpose. Nevertheless one does see some co-staining which can be explained by simple coincidence or naturally occurring low random DNA damage for example at DNA replication sites. Furthermore, we found that without induction of double strand breaks (DSBs) (-MMS) most of the cells show between three to four <italic>Fum-bc-GFP</italic> foci, while after induction of DSB (+MMS) most of the cells show one to two extensive foci that overlap with the DAPI stained DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

The finding that fumarase and L-malic acid affect the expression and subcellular appearance of RecN fully supports this hypothesis. Nevertheless, we decided to also examine at which level of gene expression, do fumarase and L-malic acid affect RecN cellular levels. Cells deleted for the fumarase gene and the corresponding wild type were grown to early logarithmic phase (OD = 0.4), MMS was added for 30 min and then the levels of RecN mRNA were determined. We employed quantitative RT-PCR (see materials and methods) and observed no difference between the mRNA levels (data not shown). To further make the point that transcription does not play a role in RecN higher levels in <italic>Δfum</italic> strains, we grew <italic>B. subtilis</italic> strains in the presence of rifampicin. Rifampicin inhibits bacterial RNA polymerase and blocks transcription initiation, thus, in its presence; changes in protein synthesis do not result from changes in transcription. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>, cells treated with MMS in the presence of rifampicin for 10 or 20 min, revealed significantly higher levels of RecN in the <italic>Δfum</italic> strain than in the wild type strain. These results indicate that the increased synthesis of RecN, in the absence of fumarase, is due to translation and not transcription. To rule out the possibility that the different RecN levels in strains result from differences in protein stability, we assessed RecN-protein turnover in the presence of chloramphenicol following induction of DNA damage. Chloramphenicol prevents protein chain elongation by inhibiting the peptidyl transferase activity of the bacterial ribosome. As presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> the decrease in RecN levels in this experiment shows that both <italic>Δfum</italic> strain and wild type exhibit similar RecN turnover kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>How did moonlighting and dual targeting of proteins evolve in eukaryotes? The notion is that a protein with a single function, activity or location, acquired new traits through evolution. With regard to fumarase the notion was that the enzyme acquired its second function in the DNA damage response after endosymbiosis and the creation of mitochondria. An example of the acquisition of novel functions after endosymbiosis are roles assumed by yeast Hsp60 and aconitase in mitochondrial genome stability through binding of mitochondrial DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kaufman et al., 2000</xref>). Fumarase has been shown to distribute between the mitochondria and the cytosol/nucleus by different mechanisms in different eukaryotes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yogev et al., 2011</xref>). It seems unlikely that the dual targeting/dual function arose independently in different eukaryotic ancestors.

Our model depicts fumarase as a protein with dual function in the bacterial ancestor of mitochondria. Upon transfer of the endosymbiont gene into the eukaryotic nucleus, the selective pressure due to the two functions that are ‘needed to be carried out in different subcellular compartments’, resulted in dual targeting of this enzyme. A similar model can be assigned to the dual-targeted yeast aconitase, which is a component of the TCA cycle in mitochondria and the glyoxylate shunt in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rouault et al., 1991</xref>). This is a simpler example, compared to fumarase, in which aconitase functions in two parallel metabolic pathways that coexist in the prokaryotic cytosol. The main goal of this study was to determine that <italic>B. subtilis</italic> Fum-bc has both TCA cycle and DDR-associated functions. Nevertheless, we have also gained insight into some mechanistic features of fumarase function within the DDR. The most exciting finding is that intracellular signaling of the DDR is achieved via L-malic acid, the product of the reaction catalyzed by fumarase. This conclusion was reached not only due to the fact that L-malic acid, added to the medium, can complement <italic>Δfum</italic> strains upon DNA damage, but it is also consistent with other data in this study. <italic>B. subtilis</italic> fumarase enzymatic activity is required for its DNA damage protective function. In addition, upon DNA damage <italic>B. subtilis</italic> accumulates L-malic acid versus lower levels of fumaric and succinic acids. Furthermore, upon DNA damage <italic>Δfum</italic> cells accumulate extremely high levels of fumaric (and succinic) acids as though the cells are ‘trying to make more L-malic acid’ in order to signal DNA damage. This finding is intriguing since in yeast and human cells, the signaling molecule associated with fumarase, with respect to the DDR, is fumaric not L-malic acid as we find for <italic>B. subtilis</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yogev et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, although the fumarase protein sequence and the dual function/targeting of the enzyme are conserved, the signaling metabolite is different. In other words, when we talk about conservation of function of fumarase in the DDR we do not mean that all aspects of dual function are conserved but rather that the metabolic pathway with specific organic acid intermediates are recruited. This raises questions on how intermediates of primary metabolism were chosen during evolution as signaling molecules in different organisms.</p><p>Our results indicate that fumarase does not interact directly with RecN, but rather, the effect is via L-malic acid. How does L-malic acid precisely exert its effect on the DDR? A number of possibilities come to mind; the organic acid binds components of the DDR directly, thereby, modulating their activity. A good example of such a scenario are succinate and fumarate that can inhibit prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs), resulting in the stabilization of HIF1-α and activation of downstream hypoxic pathways in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gottlieb and Tomlinson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Isaacs et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pollard et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sudarshan et al., 2007</xref>). Another example are local concentrations of fumarate produced by phosphorylated fumarase (bound to histone H2A.Z) which inhibits KDM2B, histone dimethylase, which in turn results in enhancement of histone H3 dimethylation and downstream activation of the DDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>). Another possibility is that L-malic acid affects components of the DDR by affecting their expression. RecN fits the profile of an L-malic acid target since its expression is affected by the acid; the level and appearance of RecN is altered in <italic>Δfum</italic> cells following DNA damage which is correlated with lower levels of L-malic acid in the cells. RecN does not appear to be regulated at the mRNA level, transcription or protein stability. We claim that L-malic acid affects the translation of RecN mRNA, since upon DNA damage, <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells lacking fumarase, have three fold higher amounts RecN protein in cell extracts. Importantly, this higher level of RecN can be reversed by growth of the cells in the presence of L-malic acid.</p><p>To summarize these notions, the activity of fumarase and L-malic acid are required for an efficient DNA damage response and their effect on RecN has two consequences: (1) A change in the localization of RecN, (upon DNA damage induction), from foci throughout the cell to co-localization with the condensed DNA and (2) A two fold over-expression of RecN at the protein level. While we do not know how lack of fumarase and accumulation of L-malic acid affect the localization of RecN we do know that the change in expression of RecN occurs at the level of translation.</p><p>How could L-malic acid affect RecN translation? There are three different ways to temporally regulate gene expression at the translational level: through trans-acting proteins, through cis-acting mRNA elements, acting as riboswitches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kirchner and Schneider, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Perez-Gonzalez et al., 2016</xref>) and through transacting RNAs (small RNA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2009</xref>). There are no known riboswitches in the RecN gene yet riboswitches have been detected in the upstream gene, <italic>ahrC</italic>, of the RecN operon, which appears to be highly regulated in <italic>Bacillus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dar et al., 2016</xref>). The <italic>ahrC</italic> gene participates in the metabolism of arginine and the riboswitches were identified by term-seq which is quantitative mapping of all exposed RNA 3′ ends in bacteria. This allowed unbiased, genome-wide identification of genes that are regulated by premature transcription termination. Small untranslated RNA SR1, from the <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> genome, is a regulatory RNA involved in fine-tuning of arginine catabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gimpel et al., 2012</xref>). SR1 is an sRNA that acts as a base-pairing regulatory RNA on the <italic>ahrC</italic> mRNA. The interaction of SR1 and <italic>ahrC</italic> mRNA does not lead to degradation of <italic>ahrC</italic> mRNA, but inhibited translation at a post-initiation stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Heidrich et al., 2006</xref>). Overexpression of RecN has been shown to be lethal for <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells. Thus, one of the roles of L-malic acid may be to maintain appropriate RecN levels.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains and general methods</title><p><italic>B. subtilis</italic> strains are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> of the supplemental material.

The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Doron Rapaport (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Singer and colleagues present data suggesting that dual functions of a single protein evolved prior dual localization. Fumarase is an enzyme found in both the cytoplasm and mitochondria of all eukaryotes. In mitochondria, it is involved in the Krebs cycle whereas the cytoplasmic version of fumarase has a role in repairing DNA double-strand breaks in the nucleus. This role involves the movement of fumarase from the cytoplasm into the nucleus and depends on its enzymatic activity. In the present contribution, the authors nicely demonstrate that such dual function occurs already in prokaryotes like <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. They provide convincing evidence that fumarase catalytic activity is required to mediate the DNA damage response in prokaryotic cells. As such, mutants lacking Fum-bs are sensitive to DNA damage stress and fail to recruit important proteins needed to repair damaged DNA. Furthermore, these phenotypes can be rescued by adding exogenous malate to growth media. In the end, the evidence presented quite clearly supports the hypothesis that the dual function of fumarase in the DNA damage response and the TCA cycle evolved in prokaryotes prior to the divergence of eukaryotes. Thus, the authors propose that proteins with dual functions in prokaryotes drove the evolution of dual localization once compartments such as mitochondria and nuclei came to exist.</p><p>In general, the manuscript is well organized with high quality data that support their hypothesis.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Does Fum-bc contain a mitochondrial presequence?

According to the results, they should discuss how Fum-bc, which is maybe only in the cytosol, can complement the TCA cycle defect in fumΔ yeast cells.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>.

A more thorough description for genomic DNA and Fumarase-GFP overlay would be appreciated in the experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>. As is, it is a bit confusing. Without MMS, the DAPI stain appears to fill the entire cytosol, with several Fumarase-GFP spots throughout that appear to at least partially co-localize. Upon MMS treatment, the genome appears to condense into a single spot, as does Fumarase-GFP which now very clearly co-localizes. Thus, their hypothesis that dual function preceded dual localization may be true, but the dual localization in prokaryotes should at least be considered throughout the manuscript.</p><p>5) The following point should be addressed at least in a detailed discussion. If prokaryotes use malate as their connecting metabolite and eukaryotes use fumarate, then this calls into question whether this is conservation.

It is curious that prokaryotes and eukaryotes use a different metabolite to support DNA damage response and the authors should address this discrepancy.</p><p>6) The following technical points should be addressed:</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>.

To address the reviewer's concern, we have now performed subcellular fractionation of yeast cells expressing fum-bc, and as expected the bacterial protein is located only in the &quot;cytosol&quot; and not in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Previous studies from our group indicate that fumarase, located outside mitochondria, can at least partially function in the TCA cycle. The explanation for this is that the metabolites fumarate and malate can enter and exit the organelle (via specific inner membrane transporters), thereby completing the TCA cycle. All this is also valid for yeast Fum1 lacking a targeting sequence (18,19) and <italic>E. coli</italic> fumC (unpublished data). We have now added text and a supplementary figure to make this point clear.

Upon DNA damaging treatment, fumarase clearly coincides with the condensed DNA. Without DNA damaging treatment the fum-bc-GFP foci and DAPI stained DNA do not generally superimpose. Nevertheless, one does see some co-staining, which can be explained by simple coincidence or naturally occurring random DNA damages. We quantified this by determining the proportion of fum-bc-GFP foci which coincide with the DNA DAPI stain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Please see below a figure, added for the reviewers, in which one can see that upon MMS treatment, undivided bacilli rods and partially condensed DNA coincide with fumarase-GFP.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30927.022</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-30927-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><p>It is important to note that we do not measure the level of total fluorescence but rather the number of foci per cell.

The activity of fumarase and L-malic acid are required for an efficient DNA damage response, and their effect on RecN has two consequences: 1) A change in the localization of RecN, (upon DNA damage induction), from foci throughout the cell to co-localization with the condensed DNA, and 2) A two-fold over-expression of RecN at the protein level. We know that the lack of fumarase and accumulation of L-malic acid brings about a change in expression of RecN at the level of translation. This also has an etiological explanation; overexpression of RecN has been shown to be lethal for <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells. Thus, one of the roles of L-malic acid may be to maintain appropriate RecN levels. With that being said, we do not know with whom L-malic acid interacts in order to affect RecN localization. Attempts to show a direct interaction between L-malic acid and RecN have been unsuccessful, neither supporting nor ruling out such an interaction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>.

Thus, in the prokaryote, localization of fumarase to the complexes of the TCA cycle, and to complexes of the DDR (on the DNA) may be considered the ancient precursor to dual targeting of the enzyme to two “bone fide” subcellular compartments of the eukaryotic cell. Precisely repeating point 2 above: &quot;Upon DNA damaging treatment, fumarase clearly coincides with the condensed DNA. Without DNA damaging treatment the fum-bc-GFP foci and DAPI stained DNA do not regularly superimpose. Nevertheless, one does see some co-staining which can be explained by simple coincidence or naturally occurring low random DNA damage for example at DNA replication sites. We quantified this by determining the proportion of fum-bc-GFP foci which coincide with the DNA DAPI stain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).&quot; (subsection “Fum-bc is induced upon DNA damage, and is co-localized with the bacterial DNA”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The following point should be addressed at least in a detailed discussion.

When we discuss conservation of function of fumarase in the DDR, we do not mean that all aspects of dual function are conserved but rather that the metabolic pathway with specific organic acid intermediates are recruited. We refer to this point in the manuscript discussion(Discussion section). To make the point here we refer to another manuscript of ours that will be submitted shortly, showing that in yeast fumarase and fumarate, signal the homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair pathway, whereas, in human cells the same enzyme and metabolite signal the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) DNA repair pathway. It is important to point out that although the same signaling metabolite is employed (fumarate) the factors it affects downstream are different. Worth mentioning is that fumarase associates with different protein partners in the two compartments (in the mitochondria where it part of the TCA cycle it interacts with other TCA cycle enzymes such as malate dehydrogenase, while in the cytosol/nucleus it interacts with kinases and histones which are part of the DDR).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The following technical points should be addressed:</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>.
