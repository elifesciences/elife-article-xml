The cues involved in positioning DCs in areas of antigen exposure in the spleen are undefined. Here we show that CD4<sup>+</sup> DCs highly express EBI2 and migrate to its oxysterol ligand, 7α,25-OHC. In mice lacking EBI2 or the enzymes needed for generating normal distributions of 7α,25-OHC, CD4<sup>+</sup> DCs are reduced in frequency and the remaining cells fail to situate in marginal zone bridging channels. The CD4<sup>+</sup> DC deficiency can be rescued by LTβR agonism. EBI2-mediated positioning in bridging channels promotes DC encounter with blood-borne particulate antigen. Upon exposure to antigen, CD4<sup>+</sup> DCs move rapidly to the T-B zone interface and promote induction of helper T cell and antibody responses. These findings establish an essential role for EBI2 in CD4<sup>+</sup> DC positioning and homeostasis and in facilitating capture and presentation of blood-borne particulate antigens.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00757.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00757.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00757.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>One of the main roles of the spleen is to make the antibodies that protect the body against viruses, bacteria and other microorganisms. Antibodies are made by B cells, which are a type of white blood cell, after they have been exposed to antigens. For most antibody responses, it is also necessary for the B cells to get help from other white blood cells called T cells that have been exposed to antigens. Specialized cells called dendritic cells have a central role in bringing the antigens—which are usually fragments of the infectious agents that have invaded the body—to the T cells.</p><p>One subset of dendritic cells, called CD4<sup>+</sup> dendritic cells, are found in large numbers in a part of the spleen called the bridging channel, but the process by which these cells become localized in this channel has not been fully understood. Now, Yi and Cyster show that a receptor called EBI2, which is found on the surface of CD4<sup>+</sup> dendritic cells, binds to a type of organic molecule called an oxysterol that is produced in the bridging channel.</p><p>In mice that had been genetically engineered to lack EBI2 or the enzymes needed to make this particular oxysterol—which is known as 7α,25-dihydroxycholesterol, or 7α,25-OHC for short—the CD4<sup>+</sup> dendritic cells were no longer clustered in the bridging channel and their number was markedly decreased. This showed that the interaction between EBI2 and the oxysterol was essential for ensuring that the CD4<sup>+</sup> dendritic cells were in the right place. The correct positioning of the CD4<sup>+</sup> dendritic cells was, in turn, necessary for maintaining cell numbers. Moreover, these mice had a weakened immune response because of the very low number of antigens that were being presented to the T cells.</p><p>A number of autoimmune diseases, such as lupus, are caused by the body developing an immune response to its own cells and tissues. One implication of the work of Yi and Cyster is that if small molecule inhibitors of EBI2 could be designed, they might be able to suppress the onset of such autoimmune responses.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00757.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00757.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Dendritic cells</kwd><kwd>EBI2</kwd><kwd>Oxysterols</kwd><kwd>antigen capture</kwd><kwd>spleen bridging channel</kwd><kwd>lymphotoxin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cyster</surname><given-names>Jason G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI40098</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cyster</surname><given-names>Jason G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Cancer Research Institute Postdoctoral fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yi</surname><given-names>Tangsheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The receptor EBI2 is essential for correctly positioning CD4+ dendritic cells in the spleen so that they can present blood-borne antigens to T cells and thereby provoke an antibody response.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dendritic cells (DCs) play a crucial role in presenting antigens to T cells to initiate adaptive immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banchereau and Steinman, 1998</xref>). The DC lineage is divided into several subtypes based on transcription factor requirements, surface markers and ability to prime CD4 vs CD8 T cell responses. By surface phenotype, the spleen contains three major populations of conventional DCs: CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup> and double negative (DN) DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shortman and Liu, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hashimoto et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Miller et al., 2012</xref>). CD4<sup>+</sup> DCs also express the C-type lectin receptor called DC-inhibitory receptor 2 (DCIR2), identified by the antibody 33D1, whereas CD8<sup>+</sup> DCs express the lectin DEC205 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dudziak et al., 2007</xref>). Lymph nodes (LNs) contain these DC populations but also contain additional subsets that travel to these organs from peripheral tissues sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hashimoto et al., 2011</xref>). Based on soluble antigen immunization studies and antigen targeting to DC subtypes using antibodies, as well as studies in mice deficient in DC subsets, CD4<sup>+</sup> and DN DCs have been most strongly implicated in priming CD4 T cell responses against exogenous antigens whereas CD8<sup>+</sup> DCs have a more prominent role in cross-presenting antigens and promoting CD8 T cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pooley et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dudziak et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hildner et al., 2008</xref>). However, these functional distinctions are not strict with some studies, for example, suggesting that CD8<sup>+</sup> DCs contribute to priming of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tamura et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fukaya et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The spleen, the largest secondary lymphoid organ, has an essential function in supporting rapid B and T cell responses against circulating antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mebius and Kraal, 2005</xref>). Blood entering the spleen is released at the marginal sinus prior to travelling through the marginal zone in a direction away from the lymphoid (white pulp) regions, into the red pulp to return to circulation via venous sinuses. The CD4<sup>+</sup> 33D1<sup>+</sup> DCs in the spleen are enriched in an area of the white pulp known as the marginal zone (MZ) bridging channel, where the T zone abuts the blood-rich red pulp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mitchell, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Witmer and Steinman, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Steinman et al., 1997</xref>). CD8<sup>+</sup> DEC205<sup>+</sup> DCs, by contrast, are mostly located within the T zone (also known as the periarteriolar lymphatic sheath or PALS). The factors that promote CD4<sup>+</sup> DC positioning in MZ bridging channels have been unclear.</p><p>The developmental requirements of DCs have been under intense investigation. DCs derive from pre-DCs in the bone marrow (BM) and these cells seed the spleen and give rise to the CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup> and DN DC subsets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Naik et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2007</xref>). The transcription factors IRF2, IRF4, RelB and RBP-J are needed for CD4<sup>+</sup> DC development whereas Batf3, IRF8 and Id2 are required for CD8<sup>+</sup> DC development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hashimoto et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Satpathy et al., 2012</xref>). CD4<sup>+</sup> DCs require signaling by Notch to induce RBP-J (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lewis et al., 2011</xref>), and by the cytokine LTα1β2, the latter coming from B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kabashima et al., 2005</xref>). How maturing DCs are guided into locations that ensure receipt of appropriate developmental or homeostasis signals is not understood.</p><p>EBI2 (GPR183) is a Gαi coupled receptor that responds to the oxysterol ligand, 7α,25-hydroxycholesterol (OHC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hannedouche et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2011</xref>). EBI2 is upregulated by activated B cells and plays an important role in promoting their movement to inter- and outer-follicular regions of lymphoid organs during T-dependent antibody responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gatto et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pereira et al., 2009</xref>). 7α,25-OHC is synthesized from cholesterol by the actions of two enzymes, CH25H and CYP7B1, and these are expressed at high levels by stromal cells in inter- and outer-follicular regions while expression of Ch25h is repressed in the center of follicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yi et al., 2012</xref>). As well as expression by B cells, EBI2 is present on a variety of other hematopoietic cell types, including DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hannedouche et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2011</xref>). However, its function in DCs is unknown.</p><p>Here we show that EBI2- and EBI2-ligand deficient mice have a marked deficiency in CD4<sup>+</sup> DCs in spleen and related DCs in LNs. CD4<sup>+</sup> DCs migrate strongly to 7α,25-OHC and the CD4<sup>+</sup> DCs remaining in the spleen of EBI2-deficient mice fail to localize correctly in MZ bridging channels. The CD4<sup>+</sup> DCs in EBI2-deficient mice show evidence of reduced LTβR engagement and their numbers can be rescued by increased LTβR agonism. When situated in the MZ bridging channels, CD4<sup>+</sup> DCs rapidly capture particulate antigen, upregulate CCR7 and relocalize to the T-B zone interface to promote CD4 T cell and antibody responses. These responses are defective when DCs lack EBI2.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>EBI2 expression and promigratory function in DCs</title><p>CD11c<sup>+</sup> splenic DCs from EBI2-GFP reporter mice showed high GFP abundance in CD8<sup>−</sup> vs CD8<sup>+</sup> DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Enumeration of 33D1<sup>+</sup> DCs showed a significant reduction of positive cells in the spleen, confirming that the reduction in CD4<sup>+</sup> DCs is due to a loss of this cell type rather than being due to a reduction in surface marker expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).

In the spleen, CD4<sup>+</sup> DCs are enriched in MZ bridging channels, specialized interfollicular regions that connect the T zone with the red-pulp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mitchell, 1973</xref>). Locating DCs in tissue sections by staining for CD4 is problematic due to the large abundance of CD4 T cells. We therefore took advantage of the DC restricted expression of DCIR2, detected with 33D1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Witmer and Steinman, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dudziak et al., 2007</xref>), for this assessment. Strikingly, while 33D1<sup>+</sup> DCs were concentrated in bridging channels of control mice, they were markedly under represented in these regions in EBI2-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Although the total number of 33D1<sup>+</sup> DCs in the sections was reduced, consistent with the reduced cell numbers detected by flow cytometry, the 33D1<sup>+</sup> DCs that remained were mostly distributed in the red pulp or in the T zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

The above findings establish a crucial role for EBI2 and its oxysterol ligand, 7α,25-OHC, in positioning CD4<sup>+</sup> 33D1<sup>+</sup> DCs in MZ bridging channels and in LN interfollicular regions. EBI2 is also required for the maintenance of a CD4<sup>+</sup> 33D1<sup>+</sup> DC compartment of normal size. These roles of EBI2 in DCs are necessary for supporting normal CD4 T cell and B cell proliferative responses, and early plasma cell and germinal center responses to particulate blood-borne antigens. These observations are in close agreement with a study that appeared online at the time this work was submitted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gatto et al., 2013</xref>). Our study additionally provides evidence that EBI2-mediated positioning of CD4<sup>+</sup> DCs in splenic MZ bridging channels promotes two important processes: (1) encounter with B cell-derived LTα1β2 that engages the DC LTβR, delivering a signal necessary for maintaining the homeostasis of the population; and, (2) efficient exposure to blood-borne particulate antigens and an ability to promptly access the T-B zone interface to stimulate T-dependent B cell responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00757.014</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model for the role of EBI2 in mediating marginal zone (MZ) bridging channel positioning of CD4<sup>+</sup> DCs in the spleen.</title><p>The major zones and cell types are labeled.

This in turn juxtaposes them to MZ and follicular B cells, resulting in exposure to B cell-derived LTα1β2 (not depicted). LTβR engagement on the DC transmits a homeostasis-promoting signal. This positioning also exposes the cells to particulate antigens traveling with blood flow through the marginal sinus and the MZ. Following particulate antigen exposure, DCs migrate in a CCR7-dependent manner from the bridging channel in to the T zone where they present antigen to helper T cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00757.014">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00757.014</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-00757-fig8-v1"/></fig></p><p>Our finding of a similar disruption in CD4<sup>+</sup> DC numbers and bridging channel positioning in mice incapable of making 7α,25-OHC (Ch25h- and Cyp7b1-deficient) and in mice unable to properly degrade 7α,25-OHC (Hsd3b7-deficient) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Russell, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yi et al., 2012</xref>) provides strong evidence that the critical function of EBI2 in CD4<sup>+</sup> DCs is to mediate their correct positioning. The alternative possibility that EBI2 is providing a maintenance signal that is independent of its positioning role seems unlikely as <italic>Hsd3b7</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice with elevated 7α,25-OHC would not be expected to have the same defect in EBI2 signaling as mice that lack 7α,25-OHC. Cyp7b1 and Ch25h are abundantly expressed in the outer follicle and in fibroblastic reticular cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yi et al., 2012</xref>) and our present findings suggest the necessary source of 7α,25-OHC for bridging channel positioning and maintenance of CD4<sup>+</sup> DCs is stromal. Further experiments will be needed to determine the nature of the stromal cells expressing these enzymes in MZ bridging channels and LN interfollicular regions.</p><p>In previous work that established a role for LTα1β2 in maintaining normal numbers of CD4<sup>+</sup> DCs within the spleen, a slight reduction in the rate of <italic>Ltbr</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> DC turnover was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kabashima et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2005</xref>). The basis for our inability to observe a statistically significant reduction in DC turnover in EBI2-deficient mice is not clear but may indicate that the cells continue to receive low level LTβR engagement. Precisely how a reduction in LTβR engagement leads to a decrease in CD4<sup>+</sup> DC numbers needs further investigation. The sufficiency of increased EBI2 expression to lead to greater numbers of CD4<sup>+</sup> DCs may be a consequence of increased LTβR signaling since increased LTβR engagement is adequate to increase CD4 DC numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kabashima et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2005</xref>). To account for our inability to observe changes in the CD4<sup>+</sup> DC turnover rate or rescuing effects of antagonizing apoptosis when EBI2 function was lacking, we suggest that CD4<sup>+</sup> DCs are lost in EBI2-deficient mice at a similar rate irrespective of how long it has been since they were generated from pre-DCs or last proliferated. It seems possible that the cells suffer from the combined effect of mispositioning due to EBI2-deficiency and lack of expression of molecules downstream of LTβR signaling that control interactions with other cell types, with the outcome that the CD4<sup>+</sup> DCs are more frequently engulfed by phagocytes or become caught in blood flow and lost from the spleen. In this regard, it is notable that mice lacking CD47 or its partner protein SIRPα, have a similar deficiency in splenic CD4<sup>+</sup> DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hagnerud et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Van et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Saito et al., 2010</xref>). Although we did not observe alterations in CD47 or SIRPα expression by DCs in EBI2-deficient mice (T. Yi and J. Cyster, unpublished observation), it is possible that the function of these molecules in mediating cell–cell interactions or in regulating engulfment by phagocytic cells is somehow altered in EBI2-deficient DCs.</p><p>The marked defect in T cell proliferative responses in EBI2-deficient mice following injection with antigen-conjugated to SRBCs, but intact response to soluble Ova, observed here and in the recent study of Brink and coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gatto et al., 2013</xref>), suggests that EBI2 function in splenic DCs is most important for responses against particulate antigens. We provide evidence that one reason for this differing dependence on EBI2 is that particulate antigen is not able to freely access DCs already positioned within the T zone. This finding is consistent with other studies showing an inverse relationship between the size of molecules and their ability to diffusively access the white pup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nolte et al., 2003</xref>). The intact response of EBI2-deficient mice to 33D1-Ova was unexpected but suggests that the defective response to SRBC-antigen is not solely a consequence of reduced CD4<sup>+</sup> DC numbers. Instead, these data suggest that appropriate positioning in MZ bridging channels, and thus in close proximity to the marginal sinus and blood-rich MZ, is critical for supporting the response against particulate antigens. This requirement might reflect both the improved efficiency with which DCs in this region can capture blood-borne particles and the ability to be triggered for rapid movement into the T zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Although 33D1 coupling ensured efficient delivery of antigen to CD4<sup>+</sup> DCs it did not promote their movement into the T zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chappell et al., 2012</xref> and data not shown).</p><p>The reduction in CD4 T cell responses in mice lacking EBI2<sup>+</sup> DCs described here and by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gatto et al. (2013)</xref> might be sufficient to account for the reduced plasma cell and germinal center responses observed in both studies. However, a recent report showed that when antigen was targeted to 33D1<sup>+</sup> DCs as an antibody conjugate, it promoted some B cell activation events in a manner that did not depend on T cell help (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chappell et al., 2012</xref>). A number of studies have shown that DCs can directly augment B cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">MacPherson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balazs et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jego et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Qi et al., 2006</xref>). Our finding that 33D1<sup>+</sup> DCs move to the B-T zone interface following particulate antigen immunization also seems consistent with the possibility that these DCs interact with activated B cells as well as T cells. Future studies will be needed to determine whether EBI2-dependent DC–B cell interactions contribute to driving early B cell activation events during responses to particulate antigens.</p><p>The surface markers ICOS and PD1 are highly expressed by T follicular helper (Tfh) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vinuesa and Cyster, 2011</xref>). The less effective induction of ICOS and PD1 on T cells responding to SRBC-Ova in EBI2-deficient hosts suggests that antigen presentation by CD4<sup>+</sup> DCs may be important in favoring induction of an early B-helper phenotype in CD4 T cells. In addition to efficiently presenting antigen in the context of MHC class II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pooley et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dudziak et al., 2007</xref>) it is possible that appropriately activated CD4<sup>+</sup> DCs bias T cell differentiation in a manner that favors provision of B cell help. Consistent with early induction of Tfh cell properties in activated T cells augmenting B cell responses, when T cells lack the ‘master regulator’ of Tfh cell differentiation, Bcl6, they are poorly able to support extrafollicular plasmablast responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2011</xref>). The reduced induction of Tfh-phenotype cells likely also contributes to the reduced germinal center response.</p><p>Our findings indicate that CD4<sup>+</sup> DC positioning is controlled by a balance of EBI2 and CCR7 expression and ligand responsiveness. Under homeostatic conditions, EBI2 has a dominant influence and promotes positioning in MZ bridging channels. However, following activation by antigen exposure the balance shifts in favor of CCR7 and the cells move promptly into the T zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). While we suggest that direct exposure to antigen triggers DC movement, we do not exclude the possibility that CCR7 upregulation is promoted indirectly as a consequence of cytokine production by other antigen-exposed cells. The basis for the antigen activated DCs favoring the B-T zone interface compared to the central T zone is not yet clear but this does not seem to depend on EBI2 expression. These data add to a series of findings showing how differential responsiveness to chemoattractants emanating from adjacent zones determines cell position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Reif et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cyster, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bromley et al., 2008</xref>). Although LPS causes CCR7 upregulation on splenic DCs and promotes their movement to the T zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Becker et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Trez et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Seul et al., 2012</xref>) we found that LPS-mediated repositioning happened more slowly and with a more uniform distribution of DCs through the T zone than occurred following SRBC immunization. The DC sensor triggered following SRBC immunization is not clear but in preliminary experiments we do not find a requirement for Myd88 (unpublished observation). SRBCs rapidly become opsonized by complement and presumably also by natural antibody and it is possible that these factors contribute to SRBC capture by CD4<sup>+</sup> DCs and to triggering CCR7 upregulation. It seems possible that detection of damaged endogenous RBCs may be a trigger for DC maturation as a number of important pathogens, most notably the malaria parasite, propagate inside RBCs, insert foreign proteins in their membranes and alter their functional properties.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>C57BL/6NCr and C57BL/6-cBrd/cBrd/Cr (CD45.1) mice at age 7–9 weeks were from National Cancer Institute (Frederick, MD). <italic>Ebi2</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pereira et al., 2009</xref>) were backcrossed to C57BL/6J for eleven generations.

In connection with this concern, we have added data to the figure 7 supplement (Figure 7–figure supplement 1) showing the OTII T cell response in DT-treated <italic>Ebi2</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup><italic>:CD11c-DTR</italic> mixed BM chimeras, supporting the conclusion that the reduced wild-type T cell response is due to the role of EBI2 in CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells, most likely DCs. We have also added data to figure 7 panels D and E showing that the wild-type GC B cell response in the Hy10 B cell transfer system is reduced in <italic>Ebi2</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> hosts.</p><p>We did attempt an experiment of the type suggested by the reviewers, where CD11c- DTR:EBI2 KO (or WT) mixed BM chimeras were treated with DT (at days -1, 1 and 3), immunized with SRBC (d0) and then analyzed for the frequency of polyclonal plasma cells and GC cells at day 5. However, we found that this approach was problematic as the DT treatment caused almost complete ablation of plasma cells and GC B cells derived from the CD11c-DTR BM (Author response image 1A). This effect is consistent with past and very recent findings that CD11c-DTR (and CD11c-YFP) is expressed in plasmablasts and GC B cells (Hebel et al., 2006 Eur J Immunol 36, 2912; Racine et al., 2008 J Immunol 181, 1375; Baumjohann et al., 2013 Immunity 38, 596). While this approach did not allow us to examine the impact of selective EBI2-deficiency in DCs on WT B-lineage cells, the experiment did allow assessment of the response of EBI2- deficient B cells in mice that lack EBI2 on CD11c<sup>+</sup> DCs while retaining EBI2 on approximately half of all non-CD11c expressing cells (such as helper T cells). This analysis showed the plasma cell response was reduced 3-fold and the GC response about 2.5-fold compared to the response in control CD11c-DTR:WT mixed BM chimeras (Author response image 1B). This reduction was greater than observed for EBI2- deficient B cells in SRBC immunized Ebi2<sup>-/-</sup>:WT mixed BM chimeras, where the plasma cell response was reduced only 25% and the GC response was not reduced (Author response image 1C). The greater defect in the DT treated Ebi2<sup>-/-</sup>:CD11c-DTR chimeras is consistent with a role for EBI2<sup>+</sup> DC in supporting events necessary for the polyclonal anti-SRBC plasma cell and GC responses.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Author response image 1</label><caption><p><bold>(A, B)</bold> Mixed (1:1) CD11cDTR (CD45.1<sup>+</sup>) and Ebi2<sup>-/-</sup> or Ebi2<sup>+/+</sup> (CD45.1ʱCD45.2<sup>+</sup>) BM chimeric mice were immunized with SRBCs and flow cytometric analysis of B cell responses performed five days later.

Also in relation to this point, we now cite the recent report of Gatto et al., (Nat. Immunol. 2013, advanced online), that includes data showing the endogenous GC response to SRBC is reduced in mice conditionally deficient for EBI2 in CD11c-Cre expressing cells. Since EBI2 is minimally expressed in GC B cells, their data are most consistent with the reduced polyclonal GC B cell response being due to an EBI2 requirement in CD11c<sup>+</sup> DCs.</p><p>Given that many recent studies of B cell biology take advantage of Ig-transgenic (or knockin equivalent) mice for their entire analysis, we do not feel that our use of the approach as one part of the present study is out of line with currently accepted practice in the field. It will be valuable in the future to perform studies with mouse models that allow more selective ablation of DCs, such as the recently developed Zbtb46-DTR mice, but such studies would take many months to perform. We hope that the reviewers will agree that further addressing this concern, while valuable in the longer term, is not essential in the context of the current submission.</p></body></sub-article></article>
