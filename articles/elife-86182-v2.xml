Therefore, signaling sexual attractiveness is expected to be tightly coordinated in communication systems synchronizing senders and receivers. Chemical signaling has permeated through all taxa of life as the earliest and most widespread form of communication and is particularly prevalent in insects. However, it has been notoriously difficult to decipher how exactly information related to sexual signaling is encoded in complex chemical profiles. Similarly, our knowledge of the genetic basis of sexual signaling is very limited and usually restricted to a few case studies with comparably simple pheromonal communication mechanisms. The present study jointly addresses these two knowledge gaps by characterizing two fatty acid synthase genes that most likely evolved by tandem gene duplication and that simultaneously impact sexual attractiveness and complex chemical surface profiles in parasitic wasps. Gene knockdown in female wasps dramatically reduces their sexual attractiveness coinciding with a drastic decrease in male courtship and copulation behavior. Concordantly, we found a striking shift of methyl-branching patterns in the female surface pheromonal compounds, which we subsequently demonstrate to be the main cause for the greatly reduced male mating response. Intriguingly, this suggests a potential coding mechanism for sexual attractiveness mediated by specific methyl-branching patterns in complex cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) profiles. So far, the genetic underpinnings of methyl-branched CHCs are not well understood despite their high potential for encoding information. Our study sheds light on how biologically relevant information can be encoded in complex chemical profiles and on the genetic basis of sexual attractiveness.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Attracting a mate is critical in all species that sexually reproduce. Most animals, particularly insects, do this using chemical compounds called pheromones which can be sensed by potential mates.

The work by Sun et al. provides new insights into how these wasps sexually communicate, which may help scientists improve their rearing conditions and sustain them over multiple generations.

Particularly insects have exploited this type of signaling as their primary mode of communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buellesbach et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Greenfield, 2002</xref>). Nevertheless, exactly how specific information such as mating status or attractiveness is encoded in the myriad of signaling molecules documented to be involved in sexual communication remains poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stökl and Steiger, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allison and Carde, 2016</xref>). Cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs), major components on the epicuticle of insects, are capable of chemically encoding and conveying a wide variety of biologically relevant information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blomquist and Ginzel, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blomquist and Bagnères, 2010</xref>). Most prominently, CHCs have been shown to play pivotal roles in sexual communication as the main cues to attract and elicit courtship from conspecific mates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Würf et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Finck et al., 2016b</xref>) to enable discrimination of con- from heterospecific mating partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shahandeh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xue et al., 2018</xref>) and to signal receptivity and mating status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berson and Simmons, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Simmons, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Despite such diversified CHC-encoded signals and mediated behaviors, our knowledge on exactly how CHCs encode biologically relevant information has remained surprisingly scarce. This is particularly problematic in studies considering CHC profiles in their entirety as the main signaling entities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berson and Simmons, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buellesbach et al., 2018b</xref>). The exact compounds or their combinations actually encoding the relevant information within CHC profiles remain largely elusive, except for a few case studies mainly involving the dipteran model organism <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, where single unsaturated CHC compounds appear to be the main mediators in sexual communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marcillac and Ferveur, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grillet et al., 2006</xref>). In most other cases, chemical information appears to be encoded in a much more complex manner, involving several CHC compounds in different quantitative combinations, with no deeper understanding on the actual coding patterns conveying specific information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Würf et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buellesbach et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In addition to our limited understanding on how CHC profiles encode information, our knowledge of the genetic basis of CHC biosynthesis and its impact on sexual signaling has remained comparably restricted and biased toward the <italic>Drosophila</italic> model system as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blomquist and Bagnères, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Holze et al., 2021</xref>). In short, the CHC biosynthetic pathway consists of the elongation of fatty-acyl-Coenzyme A units to produce very long-chain fatty acids that are subsequently converted to CHCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blomquist and Bagnères, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nelson and Blomquist, 1995</xref>). An important early switch in CHC biosynthesis is either the incorporation of malonyl-CoA or methyl-malonyl-CoA, eventually leading to the production of straight-chain (<italic>n</italic>-) or methyl-branched (MB-) alkanes, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Holze et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nelson and Blomquist, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). It has been hypothesized that these processes are mediated by two types of fatty-acyl-synthases (FAS), microsomal for methylmalonyl-CoA and cytosolic for malonyl-CoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gu et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Juárez et al., 1992</xref>). To produce olefins (mono- and poly-unsaturated CHCs), desaturases introduce double bonds into straight-chain CHC precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blomquist and Bagnères, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Holze et al., 2021</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, a couple of genes have been identified that mainly affect the biosynthesis and ratios of unsaturated CHC compounds that function in sexual signaling. For instance, two desaturases (<italic>Desat1</italic> and <italic>DesatF</italic>) and one elongase (<italic>eloF</italic>) are involved in female diene production and consequently in their functionality as main sex pheromonal compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chertemps et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chertemps et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, in the Australian congeneric species <italic>D. serrata</italic>, the male-specific <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> orthologue <italic>FASN2</italic> has been shown to affect the biosynthesis of three MB-CHCs, among them the additional female mating stimulant 2-Me-C26 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wicker-Thomas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chung et al., 2014</xref>).

Then, further malonyl-CoA subunits are successively incorporated onto the acetyl-CoA primer to form long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) catalyzed by fatty acid synthase enzymes hypothesized to be subcellularly located in the cytosol (c-FAS). For the synthesis of methyl-branched (MB)-CHCs with internal methyl groups, methyl-malonyl-CoA units are incorporated at specific chain locations instead of malonyl-CoA units, catalyzed by m-FAS enzymes whose subcellular location has been hypothesized to be microsomal. The MB or straight-chain LCFAs are then further processed through a series of biosynthetic conversions catalyzed by the elongase (ELO) enzyme complex, fatty acyl-CoA reductase (FAR) enzymes and cytochrome P450 decarboxylase (CYP4G) enzymes to either MB or straight-chain, saturated CHCs, respectively. For the biosynthesis of unsaturated CHCs (olefins), desaturase (DESAT) enzymes introduce double bonds into the fatty acyl-CoA chain between elongation steps.

The CHC profiles of <italic>N. vitripennis</italic> females exhibit a high complexity, consisting of a mixture of <italic>n</italic>-alkanes, <italic>n</italic>-alkenes, and MB-alkanes in various quantities.

However, the entire female CHC profile has long been regarded as encoding their sexual attractiveness, with no single compound, compound classes, or particular patterns being identifiable as the main conveyers of the sexual signaling function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Steiner et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buellesbach, 2018</xref>). Moreover, despite recent advances in unraveling the genetic architecture of CHC biosynthesis and variation in the <italic>Nasonia</italic> genus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buellesbach et al., 2022</xref>), the effects of individual genes on CHC profiles and, more importantly, on the encoded sexual signaling function, could not be determined as of yet.</p><p>In this study, we characterize the phenotypic effects of two fatty acid synthase genes whose knockdown impacts the variation of several structurally related CHC components concordant with female sexual attractiveness. CHC profiles of knockdown females primarily showed significant up- and downregulations of MB-alkane compounds with correlated branching patterns. At the same time, these knockdown females elicited significantly less courtship and copulation attempts from conspecific males. These constitute the first hymenopteran genes with a demonstrated function in governing the variation of primarily MB-alkanes as well as communication, hinting at a chemical coding pattern for sexual attractiveness mostly conveyed by this CHC compound class.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Knockdown of <italic>fas5</italic> significantly reduced the gene expression of <italic>fas5</italic> and <italic>fas6</italic></title><p>We conducted gene expression analysis in adult wasps to assess the impact of dsRNAi micro-injection specifically targeting the <italic>N. vitripennis</italic> fatty acid synthase gene <italic>fas5</italic>.

Knocking down these two genes in <italic>N. vitripennis</italic> females leads to a consistent pattern of primarily up- and downregulated MB-alkanes with specific branching patterns. This dramatic shift is accompanied by a significant reduction of courtship and copulation behavior toward knockdown females by conspecific males which we demonstrate to be mainly determined by the altered MB-alkane fraction. This advances our understanding of how genetic information is translated into chemical information and brings us a step closer in decoding biologically relevant information from complex chemical profiles.</p><p>Most conspicuously in females, quantities of CHCs with their first methyl groups at the 7th and 9th (and higher) C-atom positions are dramatically downregulated, whereas the ones with their first methyl groups at the respective 3rd and 5th positions appear mainly upregulated, in most cases by several orders of magnitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Intriguingly, overall CHC quantities do not differ between knockdown and control individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>), suggesting a very specific regulatory function for <italic>fas5/fas6</italic> in governing these opposing and potentially compensatory branching patterns. Concordantly, this emphasizes the pivotal role of both these particular genes and the wild type MB-alkane branching patterns in encoding and maintaining the attractiveness of female <italic>N. vitripennis</italic> CHC profiles. Moreover, there appear to be a number of sex-specific differences in the knockdown effects on the different CHC compound classes, most notably apparent in significant upregulations of both total and <italic>n</italic>-alkane CHC quantities in knockdown males as opposed to females and partially differentially affected MB-alkane quantities (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). Curiously, GFP dsRNAi appears to have a generally upregulating effect as opposed to WT controls despite for <italic>n</italic>-alkene quantities in males, which has not been reported before. However, a recent study hints at potential off-target effects of GFP dsRNAi on a small subset of <italic>N. vitripennis</italic> genes mainly involved in microtubule and sperm development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rougeot et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, this appears to be also the case for the expressions of <italic>fas1</italic> and <italic>fas2</italic> gene transcripts, which are significantly upregulated in the GFP dsRNAi controls, again exclusively in males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Though no off-target effects on CHC profile biosynthesis and variation have been reported so far for GFP dsRNAi, we cannot exclude this possibility, particularly since a trend toward higher CHC quantities in GFP dsRNAi controls as opposed to WT controls is also discernible in some cases for the females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–G</xref>). Therefore, as Rougeot et al. already hinted at , we strongly suggest alternative non-target controls in future studies on the genetics of CHC biosynthesis and variation. Concerning the partially different effects of <italic>fas5</italic> on CHC quantities in females and males, as no functionality in chemical communication could be attributed to the latters’ CHC profiles so far, these could not be investigated any further. However, opposing sex-specific effects of CHC biosynthesis genes on the quantity of different compound classes appear to be a rather common occurrence, particularly in the insect model system <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Holze et al., 2021</xref>). Based mainly on research on the latter, CHC-based sexual signaling mechanisms have long been assumed to be comparatively simple, mainly mediated by two doubly unsaturated dienes in females and a mono-unsaturated <italic>n</italic>-alkene in males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marcillac and Ferveur, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grillet et al., 2006</xref>). However, experimental evidence has accumulated that other CHC compounds can also complement sexual signaling in <italic>Drosophila</italic> in various ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chung et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Everaerts et al., 2010</xref>). When regarding CHC profiles in their entirety as opposed to single compounds, direct causal links between sexual attractiveness and CHC profiles properties have rarely been experimentally demonstrated and have most often defied clear patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Würf et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xue et al., 2018</xref>). In the genus <italic>Nasonia</italic> and other related parasitoid wasp species, it has so far been assumed that sexual attractiveness is a trait attributed to their entire CHC profile as either present or absent depending on the studied species and also potentially reinforced by other factors such as polar cuticular compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buellesbach et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mair et al., 2017</xref>). Our study clearly shows that CHC-mediated sexual attractiveness is primarily conveyed through a relatively complex chemical pattern with a comparatively simple genetic basis.</p><p>Interestingly, knockdown of <italic>fas5</italic> also upregulated <italic>n</italic>-alkene quantities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C</xref>), which have recently been shown to have a repellent effect on <italic>N. vitripennis</italic> males, preventing them from engaging in homosexual courtship behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). However, our CHC compound class separation greatly reduced the increased proportion of <italic>n</italic>-alkenes in <italic>fas5</italic> knockdown females to levels almost equivalent to those found in wild type females (0.94% and 0.91 %, respectively, in the extract of <italic>fas5</italic> and WT MB fractions, compare <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref> to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). This renders the contribution of <italic>n</italic>-alkenes to the sharp reduction in sexual attractiveness in <italic>fas5</italic> knockdown females unlikely and strongly suggests that the female sexual signaling function is mainly mediated by MB-alkanes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We argue that this CHC compound class indeed possesses the highest potential for encoding a wide variety of chemical information through the myriad of possible positions and numbers of methyl branches. In fact, a couple of studies have already hinted at MB-alkanes as the main carriers for chemical information in insect CHC profiles, providing evidence for the involvement of MB-alkanes in chemical communication processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Spikes et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Holman et al., 2016</xref>). This might be of particular importance in Hymenoptera, an insect order with CHC profiles largely dominated by MB-alkanes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kather and Martin, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Martin and Drijfhout, 2009</xref>) and in which both theoretical considerations and empirical evidence have accumulated for the increased complexity and high sophistication of their chemical communication systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Saad et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Obiero et al., 2021</xref>). Contrary to this, it has been argued that olefins (mainly <italic>n</italic>-alkenes and dienes) have a higher potential for encoding chemical information than MB-alkanes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chung and Carroll, 2015</xref>). However, this view might have been biased and mainly informed by findings from <italic>Drosophila</italic>, where unsaturated compounds appear to be, in fact, the main mediators of sexual communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marcillac and Ferveur, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ferveur, 2005</xref>). In direct comparison, MB-alkanes constitute the dominant fraction in <italic>Nasonia</italic> CHC profiles (&gt;85%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buellesbach et al., 2022</xref>) as opposed to <italic>Drosophila</italic> profiles (16–24%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dembeck et al., 2015</xref>). Since the split between Hymenoptera and other holometabolous insects including Diptera has been estimated to have occurred 327 mya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Misof et al., 2014</xref>), fundamental shifts in basic properties of both surface profile compositions and chemical signaling functionalities might be expected. Therefore, the promising role of MB-alkanes in conveying chemical information should be investigated more prominently in future studies. Through a wider evolutionary lens, it will be interesting to investigate how the present findings compare to other CHC-based communication systems in the vastly diverse insect order Hymenoptera. Notably, whereas in solitary Hymenoptera CHCs can function as contact sex pheromones, they are prominent and fundamental nestmate and caste recognition cues in eusocial Hymenoptera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buellesbach et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vereecken et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Leonhardt et al., 2016</xref>). However, the main encoding mechanisms as well as the underlying genetic basis still remain largely elusive in most taxa, and our study constitutes an important stepping stone for investigating potential similarities in these important communication modalities in a larger evolutionary context. Moreover, since CHC profiles can be highly species-specific, their potential involvement in species recognition and assortative mating warrants further investigation to elucidate the exact underlying chemical and genetic differentiation mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buellesbach et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wurdack et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Weiss et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Concerning gene orthology, <italic>fas5</italic> has been annotated as a homolog to <italic>FASN3</italic> in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buellesbach et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lammers et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, knockdowns of <italic>FASN3</italic> alone do not induce any compound changes in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> CHC profiles but increase the flies’ sensitivity to desiccation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wicker-Thomas et al., 2015</xref>). A <italic>FASN3</italic> ortholog expressed in the kissing bug <italic>Rhodinius prolixus</italic> also contributes to desiccation resistance, but simultaneously downregulates MB- while upregulating straight-chain alkanes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moriconi et al., 2019</xref>). Similarly, in the migratory locust <italic>Locusta migratoria</italic>, silencing two <italic>FAS</italic> genes decreased insect survival under desiccation stress while altering the amounts of both MB- and straight-chain alkanes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast to these studies, we were not able confirm any functionality in desiccation resistance for <italic>fas5</italic> in both <italic>N. vitripennis</italic> males and females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), nor did the previous studies report any impact on CHC-based chemical signaling. There are two additional <italic>FAS</italic> genes characterized in <italic>D. melanogaster: FASN1</italic>, which is responsible for overall CHC production with no specific effects on any particular compound classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wicker-Thomas et al., 2015</xref>) and <italic>FASN2</italic>, which exclusively regulates MB-alkane production in males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chung et al., 2014</xref>). Although not a direct homolog, the main impact on MB-alkane variations of <italic>FASN2</italic> in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> is comparable to that of <italic>fas5</italic> in <italic>N. vitripennis</italic>, with the exception that we were able to document effects on this compound class for both sexes (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). Such diversified functionalities of the <italic>FAS</italic> genes characterized so far indicate their high versatility as early mediators in the CHC biosynthesis pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). <italic>FAS</italic> genes have been implied as instrumental for generating the huge diversity of different CHC profiles across insects, with high evolutionary turnover rates and differences in the specific functional recruitments of <italic>FAS</italic> gene family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Finck et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moriconi et al., 2019</xref>). However, <italic>FAS</italic> genes are far from restricted to impact CHC biosynthesis alone and have been documented to be involved in a wide variety of other physiological processes, ranging from lipogenesis to diapause induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lammers et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moriconi et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, specifically predicting functionalities of <italic>FAS</italic> genes and unambiguously associating them with CHC biosynthesis and variation has been notoriously difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Holze et al., 2021</xref>). Our study suggests a very specific affinity of <italic>fas5</italic> for particular methyl-branching patterns, potentially originating in an enzymatic preference for methyl-malonyl-CoA predecessors with pre-existing branching patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blomquist and Bagnères, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nelson and Blomquist, 1995</xref>). To clarify this, future studies should determine whether the <italic>fas5</italic> gene product constitutes a soluble cytosolic or membrane-bound microsomal FAS enzyme, the latter of which has been postulated to be specific for the incorporation of methyl-malonyl-CoA subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gu et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Juárez et al., 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>The previously uncharacterized <italic>fas</italic> gene <italic>fas6</italic> not only shows high sequence similarity to <italic>fas5</italic>,but is also its physical neighbor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Moreover, both of these genes show similarly high expression patterns in wild type <italic>N. vitripennis</italic> wasps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4I</xref>). This basically implies that these two genes originated from a tandem gene duplication event and therefore constitute paralogs of the <italic>D. melanogaster FASN3</italic>. Hence, we cannot state at this point whether either one of these two genes alone or both are responsible for the observed phenotypic changes. Interestingly, this mirrors a similar finding in <italic>N. vitripennis</italic> males concerning the biosynthesis of a lactone functioning in a long-range pheromonal blend attractive to virgin females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Niehuis et al., 2013</xref>). The production of this compound was unambiguously attributed to three short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase genes with high sequence similarity, which could also not be targeted independently by dsRNAi knockdowns. This demonstrates the difficulty to narrow down specific genes responsible for the biosynthesis of pheromonally active compounds when their sequences show particularly high degrees of similarity and simultaneously high expression patterns.</p><p>In conclusion, our study demonstrates the considerable impact of two highly similar fatty acid synthase genes on female sexual attractiveness in a parasitoid wasp, thereby immediately suggesting how this trait can be encoded through specific patterns of MB-alkanes. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first identified hymenopteran genes with a specific effect on MB-alkane ratios that simultaneously impact sexual attractiveness. Transcending the demonstrated impact on sexual signaling and elicited mating behavior, the present findings also substantially advance our general knowledge on the so far little investigated genetic underpinnings of MB-alkane variation and production. This particular compound class dominates the surface profiles of many insects, most notably in the ecologically and economically important insect order Hymenoptera, and harbors a considerable potential for encoding chemical information, inviting a stronger emphasis on these compounds in future studies on chemical signaling and its behavioral impact.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Nasonia</italic> strain maintenance and preparation</title><p>The standard laboratory strain AsymCX of <italic>N. vitripennis</italic>, originally collected in Leiden, the Netherlands, was used for all experiments.

Control vials with moderate desiccation stress (~55% relative humidity) were prepared similarly but without adding the desiccant. The relative humidity in the test tubes of different humidity treatments was monitored using a humidity–temperature probe (Feuchtemesssystem HYTELOG-USB, B+B Thermo-Technik GmbH, Donaueschingen, Germany) with a measurement accuracy of ±2% relative humidity at 25°C.

Where compound identifications were ambiguous due to multiple possible methyl-branch positions based on the detected ion pairs, all possible compound configurations are given.</p></caption><media xlink:href="elife-86182-supp3-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-86182-mdarchecklist1-v2.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>The datasets generated or analyzed during this study are available at the figshare data repository under <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.20411958">https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.20411958</ext-link>.</p><p>The following dataset was generated:</p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy" id="dataset1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><name><surname>Lange</surname><given-names>MI</given-names></name><name><surname>Gadau</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Buellesbach</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2023">2023</year><data-title>Decoding the genetic and chemical basis of sexual attractiveness in parasitoid wasps</data-title><source>figshare</source><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.6084/m9.figshare.20411958</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Marek Golian, Stella Schummer, Anastasia Dzemiantsei, and Lisa Sewald for assisting the experiments.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Claude Desplan as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Improved clarity of statistical tests, in line with comments made by Reviewers.</p><p>2) A revised discussion of the results in males, in line with comments made by Reviewers.</p><p>You are encouraged to also consider the various other comments by reviewers when making your revision.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>L127: Make it clearer that the 13.44% refers to Methyl position 3 and 47.5% to position 5 also indicate if you state the median or mean, adding standard deviation would further help to add context.</p><p>Figure 2B (and 4C and S2A). The changes in proportion are hard to compare between treatments from a stacked barplot. Consider showing the different compound classes rather in a side-by-side boxplot for each compound class across the 3 treatments.</p><p>Line 140: I don't agree that the pattern is similar in males. Unlike females, in Fas5 males there is also an increase in alkanes and a lack of change in 3Me and 9+Me at least between the two mutants. This has to be reworded and addressed accordingly. The lack of such results also contradicts to some extent your main conclusions in Line 200. If Fas5 regulates the up and down regulation of methyl groups at positions 3 and 5 differently than position 7+ why do you not see this pattern in males? The same problem is repeated in Line 268, you do not show the same effect for both sexes.</p><p>Line 226: Do you not mean &quot;alkene fraction&quot; instead of &quot;MB fraction&quot;?</p><p>L127: In figures 2C-F you show absolute amounts but in the main text you refer to relative abundances, why not use only one form of measurement for consistency?</p><p>L127: You refer to GFP RNAi females and later on you refer to GFP controls, if this is the same try to be consistent with your language.</p><p>Figure S1B does not seem to be mentioned in the main text, consider removing it.</p><p>The data availability for the raw data in Line 457 does not seem to work.</p><p>Stats:</p><p>Overall the Manuscript lacks any kind of detailed explanation of the statistical methods used nor are there any detailed statistical results mentioned throughout the manuscript. This makes it impossible to check if the significant differences mentioned in the manuscript are genuinely present, if the multiple comparisons are applied in a meaningful way, or if the used tests are appropriate for the distribution of the data (is the data parametric? Did they test for homogeneity of variance?). How was a Mann Whitney U test conducted on a GC figure (Figure 2A)? I strongly suggest the authors revise the statistics section with a much more thorough reporting of the tests used and their results before being able to properly evaluate the reported results.</p><p>For instance (but not limited to):</p><p>In Figure 2A: why did you not conduct an ANOVA to first test against general differences across groups and follow it up by a MANOVA (or similar) to test for significant differences across groups? A Random Forest analysis could also have elucidated the major compounds driving the differences across groups in a more statistically robust manner. I am also surprised that a standard method of illustrating differences across CHC groups (a PCA or NMDS) was not used in this study.</p><p>Line 644: why was a Mann Whitney U test directly performed (a posthoc test) and not a Kruskal Wallis test, or similar, for a first comparison across groups?</p><p>Table S2: While Table S2 states a detailed list of all the compounds it does not list any information on the stats.</p><p>Figure S3 How were the survival probabilities calculated?

Please specify.</p><p>I did not understand how the apparatus for the dummy experiments worked.</p><p>Figure 2: I found it confusing that the order of compound types in the chart is the opposite of that in the legend (in B).</p><p>Survival analysis: relatively low sample size although I agree there is no indication that the knockdown affects survival under any condition.</p><p>Table S2: indicate what statistics were used for testing significant changes in the individual substances. Correction for multiple testing?</p><p>There are a couple of small typos throughout the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I would suggest the authors display current Figure 2 C to G as a supplementary figure and rather display the equivalent figures displaying the ratio of the compounds in the total blends (as in Figure 2.B, but showing individual variability). More generally I would encourage the authors to show data points (i.e. using partly transparent dots) for all of their figures for which the number of replicates is not too high. See: Weissgerber, T. L. et al. 2019 « Reveal, Don't Conceal » Circulation.</p><p>The authors provide convincing evidence that CHCs modification induced by their RNAi experiment does not alter the resistance of females to desiccation. However, they do not present the results in the methods section and refer to the data supporting this conclusion in the discussion and methods sections only. I believe the authors should briefly present the results regarding the desiccation experiments in the Results section.</p><p>Line 248 to 252, the authors compare the sexual attractiveness they observed with the one conveyed through female sex pheromones in moths. While their sentence is not wrong, I think it conveys a wrong message. In moths, female sex pheromones attract males usually through one or a few necessary and sufficient compounds. This attraction is further modulated (positively or negatively) by other compounds in the blends and their ratio. I would suggest the authors convey more clearly this in this part of the discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86182.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>L127: Make it clearer that the 13.44% refers to Methyl position 3 and 47.5% to position 5 also indicate if you state the median or mean, adding standard deviation would further help to add context.</p></disp-quote><p>We now include standard deviations, and also rephrased the sentence to make it unambiguously clear.

Moreover, a Random Forest analysis or any form of “data distribution analysis” like NMDS, LDA and PCA is generally performed when the main differences in the variables are not immediately apparent or unclear. In our case, we directly observed a very conspicuous pattern change in chromatograms of <italic>fas5</italic> knockdown individuals and were thus able to access and confirm the individual variables significantly different between knockdowns and controls directly, which is actually quite rare in chemical ecological datasets. An NMDS reducing the multi-dimensional variable differences of the dataset to two dimensions simply depicted a shift in both <italic>fas5</italic> females and males as opposed to the control groups (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>), but we have foregone depicting this result as we instead chose to immediately go into a more in-depth analysis about which variables/CHC compound classes are mainly shifted here, therefore we also first depicted the stacked barplot (see reply to reviewer comment above).</p><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-86182-sa2-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 644: why was a Mann Whitney U test directly performed (a posthoc test) and not a Kruskal Wallis test, or similar, for a first comparison across groups?</p></disp-quote><p>Actually, a Mann-Whitney U test can be used to directly compare the means of two datasets, while the Kruskal-Wallis test is traditionally applied when there are more than two means to compare. Although it can be argued that this is the case for our dataset at first glance, we reverted to a sequential Mann-Whitney U test with a Bejamini-Hochberg correction for multiple testing as this is generally considered the most powerful adjustment method in multiple testings (Benjamini and Yekutieli 2001) to give the most accurate, validated indication of the variables (<italic>i.e.,</italic> CHC compounds) significantly shifted between the knockdowns and controls.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Table S2: While Table S2 states a detailed list of all the compounds it does not list any information on the stats.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed the reviewer's comment by incorporating the statistical method used for comparing single compounds among different treatments in both the corresponding Materials and methods section and the table caption (line 489-502; 1012-1015).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure S3 How were the survival probabilities calculated?

Each testing vial contained 10 individuals, allowing us to generate a robust survival curve. We had 10 replicates (vials) for each treatment, resulting in a total of 10 survival curves per treatment based on 100 individuals in total. We modeled the survival probability based on this adequately sized dataset, which is comparable to other desiccation resistance studies (Engl et al. 2018; Ferveur et al. 2018; Wang et al. 2022b).</p><p>We apologize for neglecting a detailed explanation of the survival analysis, which we now add to the statistical test section. The survival probabilities were calculated through the following steps: 1. the survival times were sorted in an ascending order; 2. the number of individuals “at risk” (in our study, death) at each time point was calculated; 3. the probability of survival at each time point was computed. Initially, the survival probability was set to 1. Afterwards, for each time point, the survival probability was adjusted based on the proportion of individuals who survive up to that time point; 4. multiply the survival probabilities across all time points to obtain the overall survival probability for each individual.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Knockdown methods: this sounds like the amount of solution that was injected was not quantified and only standardized visually using the food dye? Please specify.</p></disp-quote><p>You are correct in pointing out that the exact volume of the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) solution used for injections was challenging to quantify accurately. This was primarily due to the practical limitations encountered during the injection process that the opening of the needles was not fixed and became gradually blocked by the pupal tissue with each subsequent injection. To overcome this challenge, we employed the spread of a red dye within the pupal abdomen as a visual indicator, as demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4</xref>.

More generally I would encourage the authors to show data points (i.e. using partly transparent dots) for all of their figures for which the number of replicates is not too high. See: Weissgerber, T. L. et al. 2019 « Reveal, Don't Conceal » Circulation.</p></disp-quote><p>We kindly refer you to response to reviewer 1, where we show the plots of compound ratios as suggested, but we would still prefer to keep Figure 2 C-G as we strongly think that this communicates our main findings and message best.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors provide convincing evidence that CHCs modification induced by their RNAi experiment does not alter the resistance of females to desiccation. However, they do not present the results in the methods section and refer to the data supporting this conclusion in the discussion and methods sections only. I believe the authors should briefly present the results regarding the desiccation experiments in the Results section.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this suggestion, and now include the figure as well as the outcome description of our desiccation assays in the Results section (line 227-234).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 248 to 252, the authors compare the sexual attractiveness they observed with the one conveyed through female sex pheromones in moths. While their sentence is not wrong, I think it conveys a wrong message. In moths, female sex pheromones attract males usually through one or a few necessary and sufficient compounds. This attraction is further modulated (positively or negatively) by other compounds in the blends and their ratio. I would suggest the authors convey more clearly this in this part of the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s valid point, and now re-wrote that part to focus on CHC variation and its impact on sexual attractiveness within the scope of the evolution of Hymenoptera, to not extrapolate this quite specific communication modality too much and remove speculations on similarities to the differentially functioning moth pheromonal communication (line 321-327).</p></body></sub-article></article>
