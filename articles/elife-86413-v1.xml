However, the mechanisms involved remain incompletely understood. Here, we addressed the influence on allergic responses of dietary agonists of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). In cutaneous papain-induced allergy, we found that lack of dietary AhR ligands exacerbates allergic responses. This phenomenon was tissue-specific as airway allergy was unaffected by the diet. In addition, lack of dietary AhR ligands worsened asthma-like allergy in a model of ‘atopic march.’ Mice deprived of dietary AhR ligands displayed impaired Langerhans cell migration, leading to exaggerated T cell responses. Mechanistically, dietary AhR ligands regulated the inflammatory profile of epidermal cells, without affecting barrier function. In particular, we evidenced TGF-β hyperproduction in the skin of mice deprived of dietary AhR ligands, explaining Langerhans cell retention. Our work identifies an essential role for homeostatic activation of AhR by dietary ligands in the dampening of cutaneous allergic responses and uncovers the importance of the gut–skin axis in the development of allergic diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Langerhans cells</kwd><kwd>allergy</kwd><kwd>aryl hydrocarbon receptor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001677</institution-id><institution>Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>core funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Segura</surname><given-names>Elodie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010463</institution-id><institution>Institut Curie</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>core funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cros</surname><given-names>Adeline</given-names></name><name><surname>Segura</surname><given-names>Elodie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006364</institution-id><institution>Institut National Du Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018-1-PLBIO-01-ICR1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Segura</surname><given-names>Elodie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-LABX-0043</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>San Roman</surname><given-names>Mabel</given-names></name><name><surname>Maurin</surname><given-names>Mathieu</given-names></name><name><surname>Segura</surname><given-names>Elodie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-17-CE15-0011-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Segura</surname><given-names>Elodie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-IDEX-0001-02 PSL</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Segura</surname><given-names>Elodie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC Horizon 2020-Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions (No 842535)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>De Juan</surname><given-names>Alba</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Lack of aryl hydrocarbon receptor ligands in the diet of mice increases the inflammatory state in their epidermis, making cutaneous allergic reactions more severe and airway allergy more pronounced after skin sensitization.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Development of immune-mediated diseases is affected by numerous environmental factors, including nutrition. Dietary compounds can modulate immune cells homeostasis and inflammatory immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wu et al., 2018</xref>), affecting in particular the susceptibility to allergy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Julia et al., 2015</xref>). However, the impact of individual nutrients and the molecular mechanisms involved remain incompletely understood. In particular, whether dietary metabolites that activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) influence type 2 allergic responses remains unclear.</p><p>Type 2 allergic responses result from dysregulated immune responses mediated mainly by IL4, IL5, and IL13. In the skin and lungs, allergens trigger the secretion by keratinocytes or epithelial cells of alarmins, such as thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deckers et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akdis et al., 2020</xref>). These soluble mediators stimulate the production of IL4, IL5, and IL13 by type 2 innate-like lymphoid cells (ILCs) and basophils, and the activation of dendritic cells (DCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deckers et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akdis et al., 2020</xref>). After their migration to the lymph nodes, activated DCs polarize CD4 T cells into Th2 cells that themselves secrete IL4, IL5, and IL13, thereby stimulating the production of IgE and amplifying the type 2 inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deckers et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akdis et al., 2020</xref>). Nutritional compounds can affect multiple players of the type 2 inflammatory cascade through recognition by G-protein-coupled and nuclear receptors. For instance, mice fed on a high-fiber diet have increased levels of short-chain fatty acid propionate and decreased susceptibility to airway allergy due to impaired induction of Th2 polarization by lung DC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Trompette et al., 2014</xref>). Mice with a vitamin D-deficient diet display lung inflammation, high blood IgE levels, and increased numbers of lung Th2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vasiliou et al., 2014</xref>). Dietary interventions are therefore a promising strategy for preventing the development of allergic diseases, in particular in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Trambusti et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Trikamjee et al., 2020</xref>). However, a better understanding of the effects of each family of dietary compounds is needed.</p><p>AhR is a nuclear receptor-sensing metabolite produced mainly by the breakdown of food components or from tryptophan catabolism by intestinal microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rothhammer and Quintana, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">De Juan and Segura, 2021</xref>). Imbalance in gut-derived AhR ligands worsens inflammation in the intestine during inflammatory bowel disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Monteleone et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lamas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hubbard et al., 2017</xref>) and in the central nervous system during neuroinflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rothhammer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rothhammer et al., 2016</xref>). Whether dietary AhR ligands also play a role in other pathological contexts requires further investigation. In particular, AhR exerts broad functions in barrier tissues including skin and lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Esser and Rannug, 2015</xref>), where AhR activation has been reported to limit inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Di Meglio et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beamer and Shepherd, 2013</xref>). The impact of dietary AhR ligands in allergic responses at such barrier sites remains unknown.</p><p>In this study, we explored the role of dietary AhR ligands in the development of type 2 allergic responses using papain as a model allergen. We showed that lack of dietary AhR ligands exacerbates cutaneous, but not airway, papain-induced allergy. In addition, we found that lack of dietary AhR ligands during allergen cutaneous sensitization worsened asthma-like airway allergy in a recall phase, a model for ‘atopic march.’ We demonstrated that lack of dietary AhR ligands impacts the inflammatory profile of epidermal cells and increases the production of bioactive TGF-β, causing the retention of Langerhans cells in the skin, in turn leading to exaggerated Th2 responses in the lymph nodes. Our results identify a major role for dietary AhR ligands in the modulation of cutaneous allergic responses.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Lack of dietary AhR ligands exacerbates cutaneous allergic type 2 responses</title><p>To study the impact of dietary AhR agonists on allergic responses, we sought to compare mice fed with diets either poor or rich in AhR agonists. Normal mouse chow contains phytochemicals that can act as precursors of AhR agonists, in particular indole-3-carbinole (I3C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bjeldanes et al., 1991</xref>), which is detected in the serum of mice fed on normal chow diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To avoid confounding effects, we used a standard purified diet (AIN-93M) that is naturally poor in phytochemicals (hereafter termed ‘AhR-poor diet’) and the same diet enriched for I3C (hereafter termed ‘I3C diet’). As a proof of principle, we verified that I3C concentration in the serum of mice fed on the AhR-poor or I3C diet was significantly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To confirm that these diets induced different levels of AhR activation in vivo, we analyzed the expression in liver cells of the canonical AhR target gene <italic>Cyp1a1</italic>. Mice fed on the normal chow and I3C diets showed similar expression of <italic>Cyp1a1</italic>, while mice fed on the AhR-poor diet had almost undetectable expression of <italic>Cyp1a1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), validating that the AhR-poor diet contains negligeable amounts of natural AhR agonists. To study type 2 allergic responses, we chose the model protease allergen papain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shimura et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kamijo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sokol et al., 2008</xref>). To validate that the I3C diet would mimic normal conditions in this model, we analyzed Th2 cells induction in mice fed on normal chow or I3C diet. After footpad injection of papain, we observed similar Th2 induction in the draining lymph nodes in both groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). IL4 and IL13 were increased by papain exposure, while IL5 secretion was not significantly different from the control condition. Finally, to confirm that only AhR agonists from the diet were modulated in this setting, we measured the serum concentration of L-kynurenin (produced by host metabolism), 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM, generated by the degradation of I3C in the stomach), and indole-3-acetic acid (produced by microbiota metabolism from food components) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">De Juan and Segura, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bjeldanes et al., 1991</xref>). DIM, but not L-kynurenin or indole-3-acetic acid, was decreased in the serum of mice fed on the AhR-poor diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Collectively, these results validate our experimental set up. For the rest of the study, we compared mice fed on the I3C and AhR-poor diets.</p><p>We first analyzed cutaneous allergic responses to papain challenge in the footpad. Histological analysis showed epidermal hyperplasia upon papain exposure only in the foot of mice fed on the AhR-poor diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). To assess the induction of Th2 responses, we analyzed draining lymph nodes after 6 d. The number of CD4 T cells and B cells was similar in mice fed on the IC3 or AhR-poor diets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), suggesting that the diet had no impact on CD4 T cells or B cells proliferation. We restimulated normalized numbers of lymph nodes T cells ex vivo and measured cytokine secretion. While IL4 secretion was induced similarly in both groups of mice, the production by T cells of Th2 cytokines IL5 and IL13 was exacerbated in mice fed on the AhR-poor diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). To confirm these results in a setting of epicutaneous sensitization, we applied papain topically on the skin, without any abrasion, and restimulated T cells from the draining lymph node after 6 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Similarly, we found that mice fed on the AhR-poor diet showed higher secretion of IL5 and IL13 upon papain exposure. The secretion of IL10, IFN-γ, and IL17A upon papain challenge was also increased in mice fed on the AhR-poor diet in the footpad setting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>), but not with topical application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>).

Because of their central role in Th2 cells induction, we analyzed DC populations. One difference between skin and lung tissues is the presence of Langerhans cells, residing in the epidermis and absent from the lungs. AhR is expressed by Langerhans cells and has been proposed to regulate their numbers in the epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hong et al., 2020</xref>). To address whether lack of dietary AhR ligands affects Langerhans cells maintenance in the epidermis, we quantified epidermal Langerhans cells from mice fed on the I3C or AhR-poor diet.

We found no significant difference between diets in Langerhans cells density. To confirm this observation using another approach, we analyzed footpad epidermal cells by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>) and found no significant difference between diets in Langerhans cells numbers. We then analyzed skin DC migration to the skin-draining lymph nodes. We assessed DC numbers 24 hr and 48 hr after papain footpad injection compared with vehicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). Langerhans cells numbers in the lymph nodes were significantly lower upon papain exposure in mice fed on the AhR-poor diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). By contrast, papain exposure increased the number of migratory skin cDC1 and cDC2 independently of the diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In particular, migratory PDL2<sup>+</sup> cDC2 play an essential role in the induction of allergic Th2 responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kumamoto et al., 2013</xref>), and their number was similar in papain-treated mice from both diet groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

The numbers of resident and migratory cDC1 and cDC2 were increased in both diet groups upon papain exposure compared to vehicle treatment, while Langerhans cells number was significantly reduced in papain-treated mice fed on the AhR-poor diet.

FICZ is an endogenous AhR ligand produced from the photo-oxidation of tryptophan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oberg et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wincent et al., 2009</xref>). As expected, canonical AhR target genes were upregulated in the FICZ-treated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). By contrast, chemokine genes (<italic>CCL2, CCL3, CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL5</italic>) and <italic>ITGB8</italic> were more expressed in SR1-treated skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). These results are consistent with our transcriptomic data from mouse epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). To confirm that AhR activation regulates bioactive Tgf-β release by human keratinocytes, we used a human keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT cells). We cultured differentiated human keratinocytes in the presence of an AhR antagonist (SR1) or two different physiological AhR agonists, FICZ (produced by photo-oxidation) or DIM (produced from phytonutrients). AhR activation increased the expression of canonical target genes <italic>CYP1A1</italic> and <italic>CYP1B1</italic>, but decreased the expression of <italic>ITGB8</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). To directly address the impact of AhR activation on Tgf-β secretion, we measured total and bioactive Tgf-β in the supernatant. While total Tgf-β concentration was similar between treatments, bioactive Tgf-β was significantly more released by SR1-treated keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that lack of AhR activation increases the production of bioactive Tgf-β in the skin in both mouse and human, thereby inhibiting Langerhans cells migration.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this work, we showed that lack of dietary AhR ligands exacerbates cutaneous allergic Th2 responses and airway allergy after skin sensitization. We found that homeostatic activation of AhR by diet-derived agonists down-modulates inflammation pathways in epidermal cells. In particular, mice deprived of dietary AhR ligands displayed hyperproduction of bioactive Tgf-β in the skin, impairing Langerhans cells migration and their action as down-modulators of Th2 cells induction in the lymph nodes.</p><p>Previous work has reported a role for Langerhans cells in suppressing T cell responses in various models. In hapten-induced contact hypersensitivity, which is mediated by CD8 T cells, Langerhans cells are essential for tolerance to haptens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kaplan et al., 2005</xref>), and to down-modulate T cell responses by producing IL10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Igyarto et al., 2009</xref>) and by inducing regulatory CD4 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gomez de Agüero et al., 2012</xref>). In models of cutaneous sensitization to ovalbumin, Langerhans cells depletion increased Th2 cutaneous responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marschall et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Luo et al., 2019</xref>) and T follicular helper cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marschall et al., 2021</xref>), as well as airway inflammation after intranasal recall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marschall et al., 2021</xref>). Langerhans cells depletion also exacerbated lung Th2 responses after epicutaneous sensitization to house dust mite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deckers et al., 2017b</xref>). It has been proposed that Langerhans cells produce IL10 upon exposure to allergens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Luo et al., 2019</xref>), but the mechanisms by which Langerhans cells regulate Th2 responses, and whether regulatory T cells are involved, remain to be better characterized. Consistent with these observations, we propose a model whereby dietary AhR ligands regulate the severity of cutaneous Th2 responses via the control of Langerhans cells migration, with decreased numbers of Langerhans cells in skin-draining lymph nodes leading to exacerbated Th2 cytokine production.</p><p>We found that reduced Langerhans cells numbers in lymph nodes increased T cell secretion of IL5 and IL13, but not that of IL4. Similar observations were made in a model of house dust mite allergy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deckers et al., 2017b</xref>). These results are consistent with previous work showing that IL4 and IL13 are produced in lymph nodes by distinct populations of T cells during helminth infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liang et al., 2012</xref>), and that IL4 expression is regulated in vivo by distinct transcriptional mechanisms from IL5 and IL13 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tanaka et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bao and Reinhardt, 2015</xref>). We speculate that Langerhans cells modulate IL5- and IL13-producing T cells, but not IL4-producing T cells.</p><p>Previous studies have proposed a role for AhR in regulating airway inflammation. In a model of ovalbumin-induced airway allergy, AhR-deficient mice developed more severe allergic responses due to the increased ability of AhR-deficient T cells to proliferate and the higher activation of AhR-deficient lung DC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thatcher et al., 2016</xref>). In another study using ovalbumin-induced airway allergy, systemic injection of high doses of the AhR agonist FICZ reduced eosinophilia and Th2 cytokines in the lung and blood IgE levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jeong et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, in a model of cockroach allergen-induced allergy, mice deficient for AhR in type II alveolar epithelial cells had increased airway hyperreactivity including eosinophilia and elevated Th2 cytokine secretion due to dysregulated autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). By contrast, we found that airway allergic responses induced by papain exposure were not affected by the lack of dietary AhR ligands. Our results suggests that dietary AhR ligands do not play a role in the induction by lung DC of Th2 polarization per se, in cytokine secretion by lung ILC2 or in the inflammatory response of lung epithelial cells. This discrepancy could be explained by ligand-specific effects or by redundant effects of AhR agonists from different sources, the lack of dietary AhR ligand being compensated in the lung by endogenous or microbiota-derived ligands.</p><p>AhR can be activated by xenobiotics, diet-derived molecules, metabolites produced by microbiota metabolism, as well as endogenous ligands produced by cellular metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rothhammer and Quintana, 2019</xref>). Here, we specifically focused on natural diet-derived AhR agonists, delivered by a physiological route, that is, food absorption. In epidermal cells, we found that dietary AhR agonists regulate inflammatory pathways, but not keratinocyte barrier genes. By contrast, AhR ligands produced by skin commensal microbiota have been shown to control genes involved in keratinocyte differentiation and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Uberoi et al., 2021</xref>). These results could be explained by ligand-specific effects. In a model of MC903-induced atopic dermatitis, topical application or oral administration of microbiota-derived AhR ligand indole-3-aldehyde (IAId) reduced skin inflammation and type 2 responses, which was dependent on AhR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yu et al., 2019</xref>). However, application of other AhR agonists such as kynurenin (an endogenous ligand) or indole-3-acetic acid (produced by microbiota) had no impact on disease symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yu et al., 2019</xref>). Mechanistically, it was shown that AhR activation by IAId regulated TSLP production by keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yu et al., 2019</xref>). By contrast, here we did not find any impact of dietary AhR ligands on TSLP production during papain-induced allergy. In a model of imiquimod-induced psoriasis, AhR-deficient mice had exacerbated skin inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Di Meglio et al., 2014</xref>), while topical application of the AhR agonists FICZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Di Meglio et al., 2014</xref>) or Tapinarof (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Smith et al., 2017</xref>) ameliorated disease symptoms. Moreover, AhR-deficient keratinocytes were hyperresponsive to inflammatory stimuli ex vivo and overexpressed inflammatory mediators such as CXCL1 and CXCL5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Di Meglio et al., 2014</xref>), consistent with our findings. Collectively, these observations suggest ligand-specific effects of AhR activation in keratinocytes.</p><p>In addition, intestinal type 3 ILC and lymphoid follicles are reduced in mice fed on an AhR-poor diet compared to I3C diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kiss et al., 2011</xref>), but are normal in germ-free mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting distinct effects of diet-derived and microbiota-derived AhR ligands on type 3 ILC and lymphoid follicles. The underlying mechanisms of such ligand-specific effects remain unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rothhammer and Quintana, 2019</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, we show that diet-derived ligands are a major source of homeostatic stimulation of AhR in keratinocytes, dampening their response to inflammation and regulating the release of bioactive Tgf-β, but not the barrier function. These results provide novel insight into the gut–skin axis and could pave the way for optimizing diet interventions to reduce the development of cutaneous allergic diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

The authors present compelling data supporting the function of AhR ligands in limiting cutaneous allergic type 2 responses but not airway allergic responses, underscoring an interesting tissue-specific role of this axis.

Does this yield the same response?&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>To strengthen our results, we performed epicutaneous sensitization without barrier disruption by applying papain on shaved flank skin (without any skin abrasion). We analyzed T cell responses in the draining lymph nodes after 6 days and found similar results as with footpad injection, i.e increased IL5 and IL13 secretion in mice fed on the AhR-poor diet (added as fig1E). We also analyzed dendritic cells migration to the draining lymph nodes after 48h and found that papain exposure induced cDC1 and cDC2 migration similarly in both diet groups, but Langerhans cells were reduced in mice fed on AhR-poor diet (added in Figure 4—figure supplement 1F).</p><p>Text edits in response to reviewers’ comments</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comments from Reviewer 1</p><p>– &quot; in several places they cited review articles instead of original articles for key findings. Ex. For the expression of Mucin 5 and CLCA1 a review is cited.&quot; and &quot; the role of AHR in ILC2 (PMID: 30446384) and alveolar epithelial cells (PMID: 35935956) has been documented. The authors should add these references.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We added references to original research regarding Mucin 5 and CLCA1 : (Leverkoehne and Gruber, 2002; Nakanishi et al., 2001; Young et al., 2007). We also added references to alveolar epithelial cells in the Discussion section : &quot;In addition, in a model of cockroach allergen-induced allergy, mice deficient for AhR in type II alveolar epithelial cells had increased airway hyperreactivity including eosinophilia and elevated Th2 cytokine secretion, due to dysregulated autophagy (Wang et al., 2022).&quot;.</p><p>Regarding ILC2, because it was shown in the mentioned article that only gut ILC2 express AhR, and in particular not lung or skin ILC2, we believe that a reference to this work is not relevant in the context of our study, and therefore we did not add this reference.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>–&quot; Although the authors mentioned treatment schedule and stimulants used in the method, a short description in the figure legend will be helpful for the readers&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified all figure legends to better describe the treatment schedules.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– &quot;1. In the introduction section, the authors should explain adequately why they thought that AHR signaling is important for allergy. &quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We now better explain this point in the introduction : &quot; In particular, AhR exerts broad functions in barrier tissues including skin and lung (Esser and Rannug, 2015), where AhR activation has been reported to limit inflammation (DiMeglio et al., 2014; Beamer and Shepherd, 2013). The impact of dietary AhR ligands in allergic responses at such barrier sites remains unknown.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comments from Reviewer 2</p><p>–&quot;How to explain the difference between IL4 (no effect between the two diets/or absence/presence LCs in Figure 4D) and IL5/IL13 (small effect in Figure 1D and 4D). &quot;</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point. It has been shown that IL4 can be produced in lymph nodes by T cells distinct from those producing IL5 and IL13 (Liang et al., 2011). Consistent with this, IL4 expression is regulated in vivo by distinct mechanisms from IL5 and IL13 expression (Kim et al., 1999; Tanaka et al., 2010; Bao and Reinhardt, 2015).</p><p>We speculate that IL4-producing T cells are not affected by Langerhans cells presence. We added a point in the Discussion section to discuss this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– &quot;There are many more differences between germ free and specific pathogen free mice than only the presence/absence of AhR ligands. Hence, it seemed like a very big step to compare both conditions and draw the conclusion that microbiota-derived AhR ligands activate different sets of genes. It would also make more sense if Figure 5 would be immediately followed by Figure 7&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We have tuned down our conclusion regarding the different effect of diet-derived and microbiotaderived AhR ligands according to the comments of the reviewer. We now conclude: “Diet-derived AhR ligands do not affect keratinocyte barrier”. We have also moved Fig6 to the supplementary data (now Figure 5—figure supplement 3). Finally, we have modified the discussion: “In epidermal cells, we found that dietary AhR agonists regulate inflammatory pathways, but not keratinocyte barrier genes. By contrast, AhR ligands produced by skin commensal microbiota have been shown to control genes involved in keratinocyte differentiation and function (Uberoi et al., 2021). These results could be explained by ligand-specific effects.”</p><p>Other additional data</p><p>During the review of the manuscript, we had the opportunity to analyze the expression of Muc5ac in lungs in the ‘atopic march’ model. We also added a few biological replicates for this experiment. We have updated Figure 3C accordingly.</p><p>Response to other comments</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comments from Reviewer 1</p><p>&quot;In Figure 4, the authors show there is no difference in total number, but difference in migration, was there a difference in expression of migratory markers?&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We assume the reviewer is referring to the number of Langerhans cells in the epidermis in steadystate, which is not different between diets (Figure 4A). We actually already show in supplementary figure (now Figure 4—figure supplement 1E) some cell surface markers that are upregulated upon dendritic cells migration (MHC class II and CD40). We found no difference in the expression of these markers between diet groups.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“Since IL-5, IL-13 production by skin draining lymph nodes and pulmonary lymph nodes was different, is this difference due to difference in AHR expression?”</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that the differences in Th2 cytokine secretion in lymph nodes are due to the difference in models. In the footpad model, we analyzed an acute reaction (day 6 after papain treatment) while in the airway model, we analyzed chronic exposure (4 intra-nasal applications over 21 days).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“In Figure 3, the authors showed that intra-nasal stimulation does not induce eosinophil migration or IL-5, IL-13 induction in I3C diet group. These data and the data shown in figure-2 are in contrast. The authors should discuss this discrepancy.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>In figure 3, eosinophils are actually recruited to the lungs upon papain exposure with the I3C diet (median around 5000-10000 cells in figure 3A, compared to around 100 eosinophils found with vehicle treatment in figure 2A). The reviewer’s comment shows that the representation was misleading, therefore we changed it to a log10 scale, similar to figure 2A.</p><p>Concerning cytokine detection in BAL, IL5 levels are quite similar for the I3C diet between figure 2B and figure 3B (ranging between 0 and 80 pg/mL, with a median around 20 pg/mL). Similarly for IL13, the range is quite similar between models, although the median is lower in figure 3B. This could be due to variability between experiments. Because this is a minor discrepancy, we do not believe it is necessary to add a discussion on this point in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comments from Reviewer 2</p><p>&quot;Figure 1D Cytokine production</p><p>In AhR poor diet the spread between the individual data points is much larger and the difference between presence/absence of dietary ligands in IL5 and IL13 seems to be based merely on a few outliers (which especially in the case of IL13 appear to be completely out of range). Most other datapoints do not seem to be highly different from the ones in the AhR rich diet. Where does this high variation come from in AhR poor diet (and what is the reason for these high outliers)? Would the data have been significantly different without the outliers? &quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Throughout the manuscript, we have represented raw data and individual data points for transparency. We observed some variability between biological replicates, not just for cytokine secretion (fig1D) but in most assays (for instance cell counts in lymph nodes in Figure 1C or inflammatory cell counts in Figure 2A and Figure 3A or antibody production in fig2E), yet the reviewer focuses their comments on fig1D. In the case of fig1D, we have performed Kruskal-Wallis statistical tests to account for this variation, and the difference between diet groups was statistically significant. We do not understand how we could remove the so-called ‘outliers’ without data manipulation to perform an alternative statistical test. We also disagree with the reviewer that 4 out of 11 points can be considered ‘outliers’. In addition, we made similar observations in the topical application setting (added in Fig1E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;In general, increases of all canonical T-helper cytokine responses (except for IL4) can be noted in the LN and the difference in IL10, IL17 or IFNγ production between AhR poor and rich diet appears even more pronounced than the difference in IL5/IL13 (Figure S1F). Still the authors decide to focus the entire story on the allergic response after stating that a 'lack of dietary AhR ligands amplifies allergic responses'. Why was this choice made?&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Imbalance in gut-derived AhR ligands has been shown to be involved in inflammatory bowel disease and in neuro-inflammation. The aim of the project was to address the role of dietary AhR ligands in a context that had not been previously explored. We decided to focus on allergy because AhR has broad functions in barrier tissues homeostasis, which is directly relevant to allergy. We better explained this point in the introduction: &quot; In particular, AhR exerts broad functions in barrier tissues including skin and lung (Esser and Rannug, 2015), where AhR activation has been reported to limit inflammation (DiMeglio et al., 2014; Beamer and Shepherd, 2013). The impact of dietary AhR ligands in allergic responses at such barrier sites remains unknown.&quot;</p><p>In the course of the study, we analyzed IL10, IL17A and IFNγ production by lymph node T cells to get a complete view of helper responses, and we provided this data in supplementary information for transparency. We believe this information might be useful for other groups studying other types of skin inflammation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;Would the authors expect other inflammatory models via the skin (e.g. bacterial, viral infection) to confer better/worse outcomes under an AhR poor diet?&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question. Unfortunately, we do not have the means to analyze bacterial or viral skin infections for lack of adequate facilities (i.e. BSL2 animal facility) or ethics approval for this kind of experiments. We believe that our work may prompt in the future other groups to analyze the impact of dietary AhR ligands in other inflammatory skin contexts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;At a mechanistic level, how do LC suppress the activation of T cells in the LN, and how would this impact secretion of certain cytokines but not others?&quot;</p><p>&quot;it remains a bit speculative how migration of LCs to the dLNs of the skin contributes to suppressing Th2 immunity in the airways. Several hypotheses have been put forward in the discussion. What is their thought about this and how to validate experimentally?&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important question. A regulatory role for Langerhans cells has been evidenced by other studies, but the molecular mechanisms involved remain elusive. This point is discussed in the discussion part of the manuscript. We believe that deciphering the mechanism of action of Langerhans cells is outside the scope of the present study (and is unrelated to the diet), and would represent an entire project in itself.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3 – Why would the alteration of diet pose a confounding factor to the model? Did the authors determine that such diet-associated changes are only important at the sensitization phase? The footpad (Figure 1) and pulmonary (Figure 2) models were performed with the altered diets throughout the entire length of the experiment. If anything, wouldn't changing the diet after sensitization also provide an additional variable here? Is it known what happens (e.g. inflammatory state, genetic changes) when a normal diet is resumed after a period of adaptation? This reviewer does not understand the reason for all-of-a-sudden changing the diet after the sensitization phase.</p></disp-quote><p>Our goal with this experiment was to address the effect of the dietary AhR ligands during the skin sensitization phase only. This is why diets are different only in this phase of the protocol. We want to emphasize that the IC3 diet and the AhR-poor diet only differ in the presence of one molecule, which is I3C. The composition of the food is otherwise exactly the same, therefore we do not believe that a change between AhR-poor and I3C would represent a confounding factor. This is different to the adaptation period when we place the mice on I3C or AhR-poor diets instead of normal chow diet (which has a completely different formulation). We made this point clearer in the text: &quot; To this aim, we fed mice on the I3C or AhR-poor diet only during the sensitization phase, and placed all experimental groups on I3C diet 7 days after cutaneous exposure to papain or vehicle.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;Figure 7 Role of TGFb</p><p>At first site, it seems counterintuitive that TGFb, which is a molecule generally associated with homeostasis and dampening of inflammation, is associated here with more profound inflammation. How to reconcile? At this point the data on TGFb are merely correlative. Did the authors directly test the contribution of TGFb to LC migration? In addition, did they check whether they could restore defects in LC migration in absence of AhR ligands by blocking the formation of active TGFb? &quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the role of TGFb seems counter-intuitive. However, multiple studies have shown that TGFb produced by keratinocytes retains Langerhans cells in the epidermis, using a variety of experimental approaches including genetic tools (Bobr et al., 2012; Mohammed et al., 2016; de La Cruz Diaz et al., 2021; Kel et al., 2010). We do not have any reason to doubt the validity of these studies. Therefore, we believe that demonstrating again the role of TGFb in Langerhans cells migration is not necessary.</p><p>Using blocking antibodies against TGFb or its receptor, as suggested by the reviewer, would most probably not allow us to address whether it restores the defect in Langerhans cells migration. Indeed, results from the literature (cited above) indicate that such blocking would increase Langerhans cells migration in both diet groups, therefore it will most likely be impossible to conclude.</p><p>In addition, we have provided several lines of evidence that AhR activation regulates the expression of Integrin-beta8 in keratinocytes and the release of bioactive TGFb, at transcriptomic and protein levels, in both mouse and human keratinocytes (now figure 6). Therefore, we believe that additional experiments to support the link between AhR ligands and TGFb are not necessary within the scope of the revision.</p><p>References</p><p>Bao, K., and R.L.
