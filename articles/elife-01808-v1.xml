against microbial pathogens and mammalian tumor cells. Many CAPs act at the plasma membrane of cells leading to membrane destabilization and permeabilization. In this study, we describe a novel cell lysis mechanism for fungal and tumor cells by the plant defensin NaD1 that acts via direct binding to the plasma membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>). We determined the crystal structure of a NaD1:PIP<sub>2</sub> complex, revealing a striking oligomeric arrangement comprising seven dimers of NaD1 that cooperatively bind the anionic headgroups of 14 PIP<sub>2</sub> molecules through a unique ‘cationic grip’ configuration. Site-directed mutagenesis of NaD1 confirms that PIP<sub>2</sub>-mediated oligomerization is important for fungal and tumor cell permeabilization. These observations identify an innate recognition system by NaD1 for direct binding of PIP<sub>2</sub> that permeabilizes cells via a novel membrane disrupting mechanism.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01808.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01808.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01808.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>It is often said that attack is the best form of defense; and the immune systems of plants and animals will often target the cell membranes of microbes and other pathogens in order to defend themselves. Disrupting the cell membrane causes essential contents to leak from the cell, and eventually, the cell will burst and die.</p><p>Most plants and animals produce small proteins called defensins that kill microbes by attacking their cell membranes. These defensins are thought to either destabilize the cell membrane by coating its outer surface or to insert themselves into the membrane to form open pores that allow vital biomolecules to leak out of the cell. However, the exact mechanism by which defensins attack microbial membranes is not understood.</p><p>In this study, Poon, Baxter, Lay et al. show that a defensin called NaD1—which was isolated from the ornamental tobacco <italic>Nicotiana alata</italic>—binds to a molecule from the cell membrane called phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, or PIP<sub>2</sub> for short. By working out the three-dimensional structure of this complex, Poon, Baxter, Lay et al. show that it contains 14 PIP<sub>2</sub> molecules and 14 NaD1 molecules in an arch-shaped structure and suggest that sequestering large numbers of PIP<sub>2</sub> molecules in this way destabilizes the cell membrane of the microbe.</p><p>These findings raise a number of questions: are there other small proteins that can destabilize cell membranes in a similar manner to defensins? Do the immune systems of other organisms also recognize molecules from microbial cell membranes to trigger this kind of counterattack? Furthermore, since defensins can also kill tumor cells, a better understanding of how they work might also lead to new treatments for cancer and other diseases in humans.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01808.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01808.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>protein structure</kwd><kwd>X-ray crystallography</kwd><kwd>antimicrobial peptide</kwd><kwd>phospholipids</kwd><kwd>fungus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council Career Development Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>637372</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kvansakul</surname><given-names>Marc</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council Project Grant</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>APP1007918</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kvansakul</surname><given-names>Marc</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Australian Research Council Discovery Project Grant</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP120102694</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van der Weerden</surname><given-names>Nicole L</given-names></name><name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>Marilyn A</given-names></name><name><surname>Hulett</surname><given-names>Mark D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Australian Research Council Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FT130101349</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kvansakul</surname><given-names>Marc</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel innate defense mechanism of cell lysis involves the coordinated oligomerization of a defensin by interaction with the membrane lipid, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Host defense peptides, which include cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAPs), are a group of innate immune molecules produced by essentially all plant and animal species that act as a first line of defense against microbial invasion. In common with most innate immunity peptides, they are relatively small (typically &lt;100 amino acid residues), are predominantly cationic, and typically harbor a substantial number of hydrophobic amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hancock and Lehrer, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brogden, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lai and Gallo, 2009</xref>). Although originally identified due to their potent activity against microbial pathogens, several CAPs also exhibit cytolytic activity against a range of mammalian tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lichtenstein et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cruciani et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hancock and Sahl, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schweizer, 2009</xref>).</p><p>The defensins are a family of CAPs that are ubiquitously expressed in plants, animals, insects, and fungi that play an important role in innate immune defense against microbial threats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brogden, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lay and Anderson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hancock and Sahl, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lai and Gallo, 2009</xref>). The plant defensins belong to a large family of molecules that are highly variable in sequence but have a conserved structure. The sequence variability leads to several biological functions including antimicrobial activity, regulation of plant development, and pollen tube guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carvalho and Gomes, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Coninck et al., 2013</xref>). Even those plant defensins that have been ascribed antifungal activity have large differences in sequence and are likely to act by different mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">van der Weerden and Anderson, 2013</xref>). The plant defensins are small (∼5 kDa, 45–54 amino acids), basic, cysteine-rich proteins that display a family-defining disulfide bond array (in a C<sub>I</sub>–C<sub>VIII</sub>, C<sub>II</sub>–C<sub>V</sub>, C<sub>III</sub>–C<sub>VI</sub>, and C<sub>IV</sub>–C<sub>VII</sub> configuration) known as the cysteine-stabilized αβ (CSαβ) motif. This motif consists of a triple-stranded antiparallel β-sheet, which is cross-braced via three disulfide bonds at the core of the molecule to an α-helix (in a βαββ arrangement). The fourth conserved disulfide bond further rigidifies the protein by linking together the N- and C-terminal regions of the molecule, effectively generating a highly stable pseudocyclic molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Janssen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lay et al., 2003b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lay and Anderson, 2005</xref>). This CSαβ fold is also conserved in defensins found in other organisms, including insects and fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lay and Anderson, 2005</xref>).</p><p>NaD1, a plant defensin isolated from the flowers of the ornamental tobacco (<italic>Nicotiana alata</italic>), exhibits potent antifungal activity against pathogenic fungi, including <italic>Fusarium oxysporum, Botrytis cinerea, Aspergillus niger, Cryptococcus species</italic>, as well as the yeasts <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Candida albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lay et al., 2003a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">2003b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">van der Weerden et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hayes et al., 2013</xref>). NaD1 inhibits fungal growth in a three-stage process that involves specific interaction with the cell wall and entry into the cytoplasm before cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">van der Weerden et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">2010</xref>). Interaction with NaD1 also leads to hyper-production of reactive oxygen species, inducing oxidative damage that contributes to its fungicidal activity on <italic>Candida albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hayes et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Many CAPs have been postulated to act at the level of the plasma membrane of target cells. Suggested mechanisms of action for membrane permeabilization are based on the (1) carpet, (2) barrel-stave, and (3) toroidal-pore models (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brogden, 2005</xref>). In the carpet model, the CAPs act like classic detergents, accumulating and forming a carpet layer on the membrane outer surface, leading to local disintegration (including membrane micellization or fragmentation) upon reaching a critical concentration. Other CAPs are suggested to aggregate on the membrane surface before inserting into the bilayer forming a ‘barrel-stave’ pore where the hydrophobic peptide regions align with the lipid core and the hydrophilic peptide regions form the interior of the pore. Alternatively, in the toroidal pore model, the CAPs induce the lipid monolayers to bend continuously through the pore, with the polar peptide faces associating with the polar lipid head groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brogden, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Although these models have been useful for describing potential mechanisms underlying the antimicrobial activity of various CAPs, it is not clear how well they represent the actual configuration of CAPs at the membrane. Furthermore, the oligomeric state of CAPs required for their activity based on the postulated models remains unknown. Indeed, it has long been hypothesized that the molecules could form proteinaceous pores and function through insertion into membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brogden, 2005</xref>). However, to date, the structural basis of CAP activity at the target membrane has not been defined. In addition to the uncertainty about the configuration of CAPs at the membrane, the role of ligands in modulating the recognition of target surfaces by CAPs remains unclear.</p><p>One class of ligands that has been linked to plant defensin antifungal activity are sphingolipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wilmes et al., 2011</xref>), a key component of fungal cell walls and membranes. Plant defensins that bind sphingolipids include RsAFP2 from radish (binds glucosylceramide, GlcCer) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Thomma et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Thevissen et al., 2004</xref>), DmAMP1 from dahlia (binds mannose-(inositol-phosphate)<sub>2</sub>-ceramide, M(IP)<sub>2</sub>C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Thevissen et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">2003</xref>), as well as the pea defensin Psd1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goncalves et al., 2012</xref>) and sugarcane defensin Sd5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Paula et al., 2011</xref>) that both bind membranes enriched for specific glycosphingolipids. MsDef1, a defensin from <italic>Medicago sativa</italic>, has also been implicated in binding sphingolipids, as a mutant of the fungus <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic> that is depleted in glucosylceramide, is highly resistant to MsDef1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ramamoorthy et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>In this report, we have identified the cellular phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) as a key ligand that is recognized during membrane permeabilization of fungal and mammalian plasma membranes. Using X-ray crystallography, we have defined the molecular interaction of NaD1 with PIP<sub>2</sub> and demonstrate that NaD1 forms oligomeric complexes with PIP<sub>2</sub>. Structure-guided mutagenesis revealed a critical arginine residue (R40) that is pivotal for NaD1:PIP<sub>2</sub> oligomer formation and that oligomerization is required for plasma membrane permeabilization. Engagement of PIP<sub>2</sub> is mediated by NaD1 dimers that form a distinctive PIP<sub>2</sub>-binding ‘cationic grip’ that interacts with the head groups of two PIP<sub>2</sub> molecules. Functional assays using NaD1 mutants reveal that the mechanism of membrane permeabilization by NaD1 is likely to be conserved between fungal and mammalian tumor cells. Together, these data lead to a new perspective on the role of ligand binding and oligomer formation of defensins during membrane permeabilization.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>NaD1 binds phospholipids including phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>)</title><p>To define the molecular basis of NaD1 target cell membrane permeabilization activity, we set out to identify potential ligands for NaD1. Membrane lipids represent an attractive target for NaD1; therefore, we investigated whether NaD1 interacts with cellular lipids using protein–lipid overlay assays based on lipid strips immobilized with 100 pmoles of various biologically active lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Poon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Patel et al., 2013</xref>).

Interestingly, NaD1 bound the functionally important plasma membrane phospholipid PIP<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) but did not bind to a panel of other membrane lipids or sphingolipids. To confirm that the ability of NaD1 to engage PIP<sub>2</sub> was not a result of immobilization on the lipid strip, we confirmed that NaD1 also bound PIP<sub>2</sub> in the context of a membrane bilayer using a liposome pull-down assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01808.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Interaction of NaD1 with lipids.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Detection of NaD1 binding to cellular lipids by protein-lipid overlay assay.

The structure of monomeric NaD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lay et al., 2012</xref>) was used to solve the structure of a NaD1:PIP<sub>2</sub> complex by molecular replacement and refined to a resolution of 1.6 Å with values of R<sub>work</sub>/R<sub>free</sub> of 0.155/0.184 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Upon PIP<sub>2</sub> binding, NaD1 forms an arch composed of 14 NaD1 molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), with a final arch diameter of 90 Å and a width of 35 Å. The asymmetric unit contains all 14 NaD1 molecules that form the final arch, with the symmetry of the arch being entirely non-crystallographic.

The first interface is formed by an antiparallel alignment of the β1-strand from each of two NaD1 molecules (monomers I and II) and exhibits two-fold symmetry between the associated monomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). It comprises an average buried surface area of 430 Å<sup>2</sup> and is formed by a network of six hydrogen bonds involving R1, K4, E6, E27, K45, and C47. This dimeric arrangement leads to the formation of a ‘cationic grip’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>), which is able to accommodate two PIP<sub>2</sub> head groups simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). A second interface is formed by the dimeric NaD1 (comprising monomers I and II) and adjacent NaD1 monomers III and IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

Although the NaD1:PIP<sub>2</sub> oligomer we observed by crystallography displays a subtle pitch, it is not sufficient to allow continuous addition or concatenation of 14-mers to form the fibrils observed by TEM, with the ends of two 14-mers running into each other. However, given that the crystal structure of the oligomer reveal an outer diameter of 90 Å, with a corresponding diameter of the fibrils under TEM of 10 nM, additional twisting of the 14-mer could allow for the formation of continuous coils with a diameter to match the fibrils observed under TEM.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>PIP<sub>2</sub> binding and oligomerization of NaD1 are critical for fungal cell killing</title><p>Based on our oligomeric NaD1:PIP<sub>2</sub> structure, we performed site-directed mutagenesis on NaD1 to confirm the role of proposed key amino acid residues in PIP<sub>2</sub> binding, oligomerization, and fungal cell killing.

NaD1 is a defensin from the ornamental tobacco that has potent activity against fungi and yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lay et al., 2003a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">van der Weerden et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hayes et al., 2013</xref>). This defensin operates by a three-step mechanism—specific interaction with the cell wall followed by permeabilization of the plasma membrane and entry into the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van der Weerden et al., 2010</xref>). However, the precise molecular basis of membrane permeabilization and passage through the membrane is poorly defined, particularly in terms of the specific lipid targets on the membrane and the structural definition of defensin-lipid interactions.</p><p>In this study, we identified the lipid targets of NaD1 as phosphoinositides (PIPs) and show that the binding of particular PIPs such as PIP<sub>2</sub>, mediates NaD1 oligomerization and membrane permeabilization. This expands on our previous study revealing that the ability of NaD1 to homo-dimerize enhances its antifungal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lay et al., 2012</xref>). It has been postulated that the ability of human defensins and other CAPs to form higher oligomeric states at the plasma membranes of target cells is a contributing factor in membrane disruption and/or permeabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hill et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wimley et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hoover et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mader and Hoskin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wei et al., 2010</xref>), but to date no structural explanations have been reported. Our crystal structure of a NaD1:PIP<sub>2</sub> oligomeric complex reveals the first detailed molecular description of a plant defensin-lipid interaction and identifies a new mechanism of membrane permeabilization.</p><p>The proposed antifungal mechanisms of action for plant defensins are diverse and includes membrane permeabilization, generation of reactive oxygen species with induction of apoptosis, and dysregulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and K<sup>+</sup> efflux (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Coninck et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">van der Weerden and Anderson, 2013</xref>). The structural basis of the interaction of these defensins with lipid has not been defined. However, it is interesting to note that the equivalent region to the ‘KILRR’ loop of NaD1 (the loop between the β2 and β3 strands), that is critical in forming the lipid-binding ‘cationic grip’, has been implicated as functionally important for the antifungal activity of a number of plant defensins. For example, mutations in the equivalent region of RsAFP2 abolished antifungal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">De Samblanx et al., 1997</xref>), and a chimeric protein generated by replacing this region of MsDef1 with the equivalent region of MtDef4 (a functionally distinct defensin that does not bind sphingolipid) resulted in functional conversion into a defensin able to inhibit the growth of a glucosylceramide-deficient, MsDef1-resistant <italic>F. graminearum</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sagaram et al., 2011</xref>). Based on our observation that NaD1 binds phosphoinositides through the same loop region, it is tempting to speculate that plants have evolved a suite of defensins that specifically interact through their β2–β3 loop regions with different membrane lipids to mediate fungal cell killing. The β2–β3 region has also been implicated in the α-amylase activity of the plant defensin, VrD1, suggesting that this region is also functionally important in defensins with different activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lin et al., 2007</xref>). Not surprisingly, the β2–β3 region of plant defensins exhibits considerable sequence divergence which is likely to reflect their ability to bind different ligands and therefore the various mechanisms of antifungal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">van der Weerden and Anderson, 2013</xref>).</p><p>The antifungal plant defensins, DmAMP1 and RsAFP2, interact with different sphingolipids. DmAMP1 binds M(IP)<sub>2</sub>C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Thevissen et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">2003</xref>) and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains that have gene disruptions to encoded proteins within the M(IP)<sub>2</sub>C biosynthetic pathway are rendered DmAMP1-resistant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Thevissen et al., 2005</xref>). In contrast, RsAFP2 binds to GlcCer, present in fungi such as <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic> and <italic>C. albicans</italic> and does not cause permeabilization or growth inhibition of strains that do not express GlcCer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Thevissen et al., 2004</xref>). The fact that DmAMP1 is able to act on these strains supports the notion that DmAMP1 and RsAFP2 have different lipid targets. It is worthwhile noting that RsAFP2 does not bind to GlcCer derived from human or soybean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Thevissen et al., 2004</xref>), suggesting that there is some level of selectivity, while its inability to permeabilize artificial liposomes containing GlcCer indicates that binding alone is insufficient for its permeabilization action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Thevissen et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>This is the first report of a defensin from any species targeting a phosphoinositide, such as PIP<sub>2</sub>. Interestingly, a number of toxins have been reported to directly or indirectly target PIP<sub>2</sub>, resulting in plasma membrane reorganization and permeabilization. The marine bacterium <italic>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</italic> causes gastroenteritis in humans by acting as an inositol polyphospholipid 5′ phosphatase. It targets PIP<sub>2</sub> by catalyzing the removal of the 5′ phosphate moiety, resulting in the disruption of PIP<sub>2</sub>-mediated cytoskeletal interactions leading to membrane blebbing and cell lysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Broberg et al., 2010</xref>). A similar mode of action has also been described for the effector protein ipgD of the bacillary dysentery causing Gram-negative pathogen <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Niebuhr et al., 2002</xref>). The equinatoxin from the sea anemone <italic>Actinia equina</italic> also causes membrane blebbing and cell lysis via a mechanism involving Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated PIP<sub>2</sub> hydrolysis at the inner membrane and the formation of membrane pores in target cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Garcia-Saez et al., 2011</xref>). In this study, we show that NaD1 also causes plasma membrane blebbing and permeabilization of human cells. However, in contrast to the enzymatic or pore-forming mechanism(s) of the above toxins, it does so through the direct binding of PIP<sub>2</sub>. The ability of NaD1 to form an oligomeric complex with PIP<sub>2</sub> suggests it could potentially sequester PIP<sub>2</sub> from the plasma membrane, leading to membrane destabilization, blebbing, and ultimately cell lysis. Such an oligomerization process would be predicted to efficiently displace any PIP<sub>2</sub>-binding molecules. Indeed, the ability of lipid-binding proteins to oligomerize on membranes has been proposed as an important mechanism in mediating high-avidity membrane interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lemmon, 2008</xref>).</p><p>The increased sensitivity of tumor cells to NaD1 compared with its effects on healthy primary cells may be attributed to a number of differences in the physical properties of the plasma membranes of these two cell types. These include an increase in the expression of negatively charged outer membrane components, such as O-glycosylated mucins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yoon et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kufe, 2009</xref>) and phosphatidylserine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Utsugi et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ran et al., 2002</xref>), which could allow stronger initial electrostatic interactions between the cationic NaD1 and the cell surface. The increased levels of microvilli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chaudhary and Munshi, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ino et al., 2002</xref>) and higher degree of membrane fluidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sok et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zeisig et al., 2007</xref>) in tumor cells may also facilitate the aggregation of a greater number of NaD1 molecules to the cell surface and assist in penetration and/or destabilization of the membrane, respectively. The precise mechanism of action for the increased sensitivity of mammalian tumor cells over normal cells to defensins and whether this approach can be harnessed for selective tumor cell killing remains to be determined.</p><p>The ability of NaD1 to permeabilize both fungal and mammalian cell membranes suggests a common mode of interaction with membranes and our findings described herein implicate PIP<sub>2</sub> in both settings. Although the plasma membranes on mammalian and fungal cells are different in overall lipid compositions (typically mammalian cells are rich in zwitterionic phospholipids whereas fungal membrane have higher levels of anionic phospholipids), PIP<sub>2</sub> is important in both species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Di Paolo and De Camilli, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">van Meer et al., 2008</xref>). PIP<sub>2</sub> is normally found on the inner leaflet of mammalian cells and although it is a minor species comprising only 0.5–1% of phospholipids, it plays a major regulatory role in a number of important membrane-related processes, including signal transduction, ion channel function, and cytoskeletal attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McLaughlin and Murray, 2005</xref>). Similar functions for PIP2 have been reported or suggested in the plasma membrane of fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">van Meer et al., 2008</xref>). The importance of PIP2 in many fundamental cellular processes would certainly make it an attractive target for defense against pathogens.</p><p>In addition to binding PIP<sub>2</sub>, we show that NaD1 is also able to bind to a number of other phospholipids. The functional consequences of the promiscuous binding by NaD1 remains to be determined. The various phospholipids recognized by NaD1 have different subcellular distributions and functions. In its normal physiological setting as a plant antifungal molecule, the ability of NaD1 to bind a number of different phospholipids may enable defense against a wide array of different fungal pathogens. How NaD1 is able to enter cells remains to be defined. It is possible that the binding of PIPs such as PI(3)P may mediate entry of NaD1 into cells. Indeed, cell surface-expressed PI(3)P has been suggested to mediate entry of eukaryotic pathogen effector molecules, such as Avr from oomycetes and fungi, into plant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kale et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Structurally, one can envisage that PIPs other than PIP<sub>2</sub> can fit into the cationic grip and be able to induce NaD1 oligomerization. Inspection of the cationic grip indicates that an additional phosphate group at the 3-inositol position can be accommodated and would contact R40 in a manner similar to the phosphate in the 4-inositol position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>) and may induce oligomerization in a manner analogous to the 4-phosphate. In contrast, a phosphate at the 6-inositol position is unlikely to be tolerated without reorganization of the binding site due to a steric clash with S35. Overall, a combination of phosphate groups on the inositol ring in position 5, together with an additional phosphate in position 3 or 4, appears to be capable of oligomerization.

Notably, this dimeric arrangement is different to the dimers we previously observed for NaD1 alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lay et al., 2012</xref>). Although one of the two dimer configurations observed was based on an interface formed by two opposing β1 strands, the overall configuration places the β2–β3 loops at opposite ends of the dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lay et al., 2012</xref>), so that the ‘cationic grip’ is absent. Consequently, a substantial reorientation is required to convert the NaD1 dimer observed in the absence of PIP<sub>2</sub> into a configuration that can engage PIP<sub>2</sub> and oligomerize.</p><p>Although CAP:lipid interactions (e.g., nisin:lipid II, plectasin:lipid II) have been investigated using structural methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hsu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schneider et al., 2010</xref>), the formation of defensin:ligand oligomers as observed for NaD1:PIP<sub>2</sub> is unique. NaD1 engages PIP<sub>2</sub> in a cooperative manner where three NaD1 monomers form a complete PIP<sub>2</sub> binding site, with each NaD1 monomer participating in the formation of three distinct PIP<sub>2</sub> binding sites. This ability to participate in the engagement of multiple PIP<sub>2</sub> molecules is mediated by two key basic residues, K4 and R40. The lantibiotic peptide nisin binds specifically to the membrane-bound cell wall precursor lipid II [undecaprenyl-pyrophosphoryl-MurNAc-(pentapeptide)-GlcNAc], leading to pore formation and permeabilization of the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sahl and Bierbaum, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wiedemann et al., 2001</xref>). Structural studies have revealed that nisin forms a 1:1 complex with lipid II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hsu et al., 2004</xref>), however the precise contribution of lipid II binding to plasma membrane permeabilization is not fully established. Interestingly, the report on the nisin:lipid II structure indicated that nisin precipitated upon lipid II addition and the structure could only be determined by dissolving the nisin:lipid II complex in DMSO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hsu et al., 2004</xref>). It is conceivable that nisin also forms oligomers that were present in the precipitated sample that was discarded. The fungal defensin plectasin is another antimicrobial peptide that requires lipid II binding for its biological activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schneider et al., 2010</xref>). NMR spectroscopy was used to map a putative lipid II binding site on plectasin, however the interaction appears again to be a 1:1 complex, with no suggestion of oligomer formation. Furthermore, plectasin does not permeabilize target microbial membranes and acts by directly targeting bacterial cell wall biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schneider et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Amongst the many described phospholipid-binding proteins, a number of different domain structures have been defined that exhibit stereospecific recognition of specific phosphoinositide head groups in the context of cellular membrane surfaces. These include the pleckstrin homology (PH), ‘Fab1, YOTB, Vac1, EEA1’ (FYVE), and Phox-homology (PX) domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bravo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lemmon, 2008</xref>), with all three showing structural similarities to that we describe for PIP<sub>2</sub> binding by NaD1. In each of these domains, phosphoinositide binding is mediated through pockets that are strategically lined with basic residues formed by two distal β loops. Pleckstrin homology domains consist of two perpendicular antiparallel β-sheets followed by a C-terminal amphipathic helix, with the canonical phosphoinositide binding pocket comprising basic residues derived from two distal β-loops on the two β-sheets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lietzke et al., 2000</xref>). PX domains contain a triple-stranded antiparallel β-sheet followed by a helical subdomain made up of four α-helices, with the β1 and β2 loops together with α-helix 3 forming a positively-charged pocket responsible for binding phosphoinositides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bravo et al., 2001</xref>). FYVE domains are small cysteine-rich Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding domains, consisting of two β-strands followed by a small C-terminal α-helix, with the binding pocket for the inositol head group of PI(3)P comprising basic clusters at either end of the β1 strand, one of which possesses a common (R/K)(R/K)HHCR motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kutateladze and Overduin, 2001</xref>). The topology of the phosphoinositide binding pocket formed by the NaD1 dimer is similar to that of the PH domains, however the formation of the pocket is unique and involves the symmetrical juxtaposition of identical β2–β3 loops (comprised of KILRR) by dimerization of two NaD1 monomers. Thus, despite the very different overall folds of NaD1 and the other phosphoinositide binding domains, key structural features that govern how they recognize phosphoinositides are generally conserved.</p><p>It is of interest that a recent report describes the ability of human α-defensin 6 to self-assemble into high-order oligomers termed nanonets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chu et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast to NaD1:PIP<sub>2</sub> oligomers, these fibril-like structures appear to form without involvement of defined extrinsic ligands and rely on stochastic binding to bacterial surface proteins to initiate self-assembly. Although composed of defensins, these nanonets do not harbor direct antibacterial activity per se, but rather act by trapping bacteria to prevent cellular adhesion and invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chu et al., 2012</xref>). Together with our findings, these studies indicate that defensins are able to form different fibrils or oligomers for diverse functions in innate immunity.</p><p>Certain CAPs and cell penetrating peptides have been reported to penetrate biological membranes with or without membrane permeabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Henriques et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashida et al., 2011</xref>). Although it is yet to be elucidated how NaD1 could pass through the plasma membrane to interact with phospholipids at the inner leaflet, our data provide several significant insights. NaD1 permeabilizes mammalian cells by forming a novel phosphoinositide recognition complex associated with the formation of membrane blebs and membrane rupture, possibly involving disruption of cytoskeleton-membrane interactions through the binding of PIP<sub>2</sub> at the inner leaflet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref>). This novel mechanism of cell lysis is distinct from that proposed for other CAPs that act via pore formation or a non-specific charge-based interaction with the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brogden, 2005</xref>) and the well-defined pore-forming ability of cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rossjohn et al., 1997</xref>), perforin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Law et al., 2010</xref>) or complement membrane attack complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hadders et al., 2007</xref>). These findings not only reveal a new mechanism of cell lysis but also uncover a potential evolutionarily conserved innate defense mechanism that can target cell membranes through the recognition of a ‘phospholipid pattern/code’.<fig id="fig13" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01808.032</object-id><label>Figure 13.</label><caption><title>Proposed molecular mechanism of NaD1-mediated tumor cell lysis.</title><p>Schematic representation of NaD1-induced membrane blebbing and permeabilization.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, John Kuriyan, and 2 reviewers.</p><p>The editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript by Poon et al. describes a thorough structure-function study of the ornamental tobacco defensin NaD1. Defensins belong to the group of cationic antimicrobial peptides, which function as ubiquitously expressed innate immune molecules that often destabilize membrane structure as the detrimental step for the target cells. While plant defensins share a common structure, their primary sequences are less conserved, which is likely linked to their apparent ligand specificity. In previous work, this research team determined the basic structure and cellular mode of action of NaD1. Here, they describe several new discoveries that present a large step forward in our molecular understanding of these peptides. In particular, this is the first report of any defensin making a specific interaction with a phosphoinositide, and the structural information provided by the work is really first-rate and informative.</p><p>The authors identify the membrane lipid PIP<sub>2</sub> as the high-affinity ligand for NaD1 in fungal and mammalian cells. Furthermore, they demonstrate, based on a novel crystal structure and biochemical data, that NaD1 oligomerizes upon PIP<sub>2</sub> binding and this step significantly increases NaD1's cytolytic activity. While the PIP<sub>2</sub> binding sites created by NaD1 oligomers has features seen in other PIP<sub>2</sub> binding modules, NaD1 adopts a fold distinct from the other well-established protein domains. Finally, elegant experiments establish the timing of events triggered by NaD1, in particular membrane blebbing, cell permeabilization and cytolysis. Taken together, this is a well-written and executed study that makes a significant contribution to the field. Given the broad expression of defensins and the general importance of PIP2 for cellular physiology, this work should be of great interest to the diverse readership of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers have identified one issue that should perhaps be addressed experimentally before submitting a revised paper, and hopefully this should cause little difficulty. The revised manuscript will be considered by the editor without further input from the reviewers, and so a clear description of what is done in the revision would help make a quick decision.</p><p>Important experimental issue:</p><p>The discussion on PIP specificity relies heavily on the protein-overlay assays that utilize PIP Strips, which are notoriously unreliable. The manner in which the lipids are displayed on these blots bears little resemblance to how they are displayed in lipid bilayers. The authors have presented single blots and their quantitation is simply densitometry of these single strips. The authors should give the readers a realistic indication as to how reproducible these blots are. There should be errors indicated on the quantitation that refer to biological replicates. These strips can vary wildly from one experiment to another and from batch to batch (they were commercially supplied). Ideally, it would be helpful if the authors used measurements on liposomes, but this is not essential. But, unless validated by liposome binding experiments, the authors should refrain from quantitative arguments. Along these lines, quantification of NaD1 binding (wild type vs mutant) to PIP-containing liposomes is also desirable since it may reveal significant differences that are not apparent in the more artificial PIP Strip assays.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01808.034</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The discussion on PIP specificity relies heavily on the protein-overlay assays that utilize PIP Strips, which are notoriously unreliable.

We have performed statistical analysis on biological replicates for the relevant experiments, and have amended <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref>, accordingly.</p><p>The reviewers also suggested that it would be helpful (but not essential) to use liposome-binding experiments to quantify NaD1 binding (wild-type vs mutant). We agree that these data would provide support to the lipid-blot data and have attempted the experiments. However, we were not able to adequately resolve a number of technical challenges in a reasonable time frame, which was exacerbated by the subsequent need for the production of additional recombinant proteins. The reviewers suggested that if were unable to provide quantitative liposome pull-down data, we should refrain from quantitative arguments. As such, we have modified the text accordingly by replacing several statements, as follows:</p><p>A) In the first Results paragraph “Noticeably, NaD1 bound strongest to PIP2 relative to all other lipids tested....”, has been changed to “Interestingly, NaD1 bound the functionally important phospholipid PIP2....”</p><p>B) In the Results section entitled “PIP2 binding and oligomerization of NaD1 are critical for fungal cell killing”, “...resulted in a dramatic reduction in the binding of PI(4)P” has been replaced with “However, it did result in reduced binding of PI(4)P...”</p></body></sub-article></article>
