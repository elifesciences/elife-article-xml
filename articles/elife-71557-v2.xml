functional RNAs, including a full-length copy of its own evolutionary ancestor. During the course of evolution, the catalytic core of the ribozyme has undergone a major structural rearrangement, resulting in a novel tertiary structural element that lies in close proximity to the active site. Through a combination of site-directed mutagenesis, structural probing, and deep sequencing analysis, the trajectory of evolution was seen to involve the progressive stabilization of the new structure, which provides the basis for improved catalytic activity of the ribozyme. Multiple paths to the new structure were explored by the evolving population, converging upon a common solution. Tertiary structural remodeling of RNA is known to occur in nature, as evidenced by the phylogenetic analysis of extant organisms, but this type of structural innovation had not previously been observed in an experimental setting. Despite prior speculation that the catalytic core of the ribozyme had become trapped in a narrow local fitness optimum, the evolving population has broken through to a new fitness locale, raising the possibility that further improvement of polymerase activity may be achievable.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ribozyme</kwd><kwd>RNA polymerase</kwd><kwd>molecular evolution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000104</institution-id><institution>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NSSC19K0481</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Joyce</surname><given-names>Gerald F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000893</institution-id><institution>Simons Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>287624</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Joyce</surname><given-names>Gerald F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01GM022778</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Breaker</surname><given-names>Ronald R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Breaker</surname><given-names>Ronald R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DGE1752134</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Portillo</surname><given-names>Xavier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An RNA enzyme is caught in the act of evolving a new structural domain within its active site, resulting in enhanced catalytic function.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Directed evolution in the laboratory has proven to be a powerful means for obtaining proteins and nucleic acids with desired functional properties. Starting from molecules that contain either regions of random sequence or a defined sequence that has been diversified, one carries out iterative rounds of selection and amplification to obtain ever more fit variants in pursuit of the desired phenotype. This process is analogous to Darwinian evolution in biology, except that the fitness criteria are imposed by the experimenter, rather than being the result of natural selection.</p><p>Whereas biological evolution has been operating on Earth for billions of years across highly diverse environments, directed evolution experiments typically involve only a dozen ‘generations’ and are confined to narrowly defined reaction conditions. Thus, it is perhaps not surprising that the trajectory of evolution in the laboratory tends to follow a narrow path. Once a functional motif has been defined, subsequent rounds of evolution typically refine rather than remodel that motif. In some cases, the experimenter intervenes by appending a new region of random or defined sequence that can evolve into a new structural domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jaeger et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Johnston et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ikawa et al., 2004</xref>) or evolves a different function that emerges together with a new structural motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lorsch and Szostak, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schultes and Bartel, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huang and Szostak, 2003</xref>). However, more extensive evolution appears to be required to achieve tertiary structural remodeling while maintaining the same function throughout the evolutionary process.</p><p>Here, from the perspective of 52 consecutive rounds of directed evolution under progressively more demanding selection constraints, an RNA polymerase ribozyme was seen to undergo a tertiary structural change, similar to changes that are inferred to have occurred in nature based on phylogenetic analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gutell et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Williams and Bartel, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pfingsten et al., 2007</xref>). Multiple evolutionary pathways were explored by the evolving population of RNA molecules as they transitioned from one structural configuration to another, ultimately converging upon a new fold that results in improved catalytic activity. The details of this transition are witnessed by a combination of structural, biochemical, and deep sequencing analyses, providing a clear-eyed view of the molecular evolution of structural innovation.</p><p>The RNA-catalyzed polymerization of RNA has received special attention because it is thought to be the central function of the ‘RNA world’, a time in the early history of life, prior to the emergence of DNA and proteins, when RNA served as both the genetic material and the chief agent of catalytic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Crick, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gilbert, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Joyce, 2002</xref>). An RNA enzyme that catalyzes the RNA-templated copying of RNA could, in principle, generate additional copies of itself and thus serve as the basis for self-sustained Darwinian evolution. No such enzyme currently exists, although diligent efforts by several laboratories have used directed evolution to isolate an RNA ligase ribozyme from a population of random-sequence RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartel and Szostak, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ekland et al., 1995</xref>), then drive the ribozyme to function as an ever more efficient RNA polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Johnston et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zaher and Unrau, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wochner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Horning and Joyce, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cojocaru and Unrau, 2021</xref>), now with the ability to synthesize RNAs as complex as the parental ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Attwater et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tjhung et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>All of the previously described descendants of the original class I ligase ribozyme retain the same catalytic core. In 2001, Bartel and colleagues appended 76 random-sequence nucleotides to the 3’ end of the ligase and selected for its ability to catalyze the polymerization of nucleoside 5’-triphosphates (NTPs). This effort resulted in a novel ‘accessory domain’ that enables the addition of up to 14 successive NTPs on the most favorable templates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Johnston et al., 2001</xref>). Following further evolutionary optimization, the maximum length of extension by the polymerase was increased to 20 NTPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zaher and Unrau, 2007</xref>). Holliger and colleagues then added 48 random-sequence nucleotides to the 5’ end of the ribozyme and selected for its ability to catalyze multiple NTP additions. This procedure resulted in the discovery of a ‘processivity tag’ that forms a region of Watson-Crick pairing between the 5’ end of the ribozyme and the 5’ end of the template, enabling addition of up to 95 NTPs on a template that contains multiple repeats of an especially favorable sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wochner et al., 2011</xref>). Throughout these many rounds of evolution, only a single point mutation became fixed within the core ligase domain, converting a G-C pair to a G-U wobble pair. However, the combination of the added accessory domain and processivity tag, hereafter referred to as the ‘wild type’, provided a more robust polymerase that made it possible to impose more stringent selection criteria going forward.</p><p>In two subsequent studies, the wild-type polymerase ribozyme was further evolved by requiring it to synthesize functional RNAs, with selection of the ribozyme being dependent on the function of the synthesized product. In the first study, the ribozyme was required to synthesize two different RNA aptamers, each involving the copying of a challenging template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Horning and Joyce, 2016</xref>). The resulting ‘24-3’ polymerase, obtained after 24 rounds of evolution, has substantially improved activity compared to its predecessors, especially when copying structured templates with heterogeneous base composition. It is able to synthesize the entire 33-nucleotide hammerhead ribozyme, which became the requirement for selection in the second study. Another 14 rounds of evolution were then carried out, culminating in the ‘38-6’ polymerase, which is ~10-fold more active than the 24-3 polymerase and can more efficiently synthesize complex RNA products, such as yeast phenylalanyl-tRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tjhung et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>This lineage continues in the present study, which began with a population of variants of the 38-6 polymerase that had been randomized at a frequency of 10% per nucleotide position, and entailed 14 additional rounds of evolution that sought to improve both the activity and fidelity of the polymerase. The resulting ‘52-2’ polymerase is indeed further improved, but also reveals that the ribozyme underwent structural rearrangement of its catalytic core, enabled by 11 substitution, 2 insertion, and 2 deletion mutations that accumulated over the course of evolution starting from the wild-type polymerase. An existing stem element became shortened while a new stem element was formed, together creating a pseudoknot structure that lies in close proximity to the ribozyme’s active site. This new structure became stabilized over time through the sampling and fixation of successive mutations, providing a compelling demonstration of the blind inventiveness of Darwinian evolution. The new structure also shows that the ribozyme was not trapped on a local fitness peak, but instead is actively evolving, with the opportunity to explore novel regions of sequence space.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Advanced evolution of an RNA polymerase ribozyme</title><p>The 38-6 polymerase ribozyme contains 182 nucleotides, with 20 substitution, 4 insertion, and 2 deletion mutations compared to the wild-type ribozyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tjhung et al., 2020</xref>). Random mutations were introduced throughout the 38-6 polymerase at a frequency of 10% per nucleotide position, excluding 14 nucleotides at the 5’ end and 15 nucleotides at the 3’ end that served as primer binding sites for amplification of the selected RNAs. A starting population of approximately three copies each of 4 × 10<sup>14</sup> different RNAs was used to initiate subsequent rounds of directed evolution, requiring the polymerase to synthesize a functional hammerhead ribozyme and further requiring the polymerase to operate under conditions of reduced Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion concentration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The latter constraint sought to provide conditions that may be conducive to increased polymerase fidelity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eckert and Kunkel, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Achuthan et al., 2014</xref>) and to the reduced degradation of RNA. Fourteen rounds of evolution were carried out, performing error-prone PCR during most rounds to maintain genetic diversity in the population, although not during the final two rounds so that the population could converge on the fittest variants.</p><p>Following the 14th round, 52 rounds in total relative to the wild-type polymerase, 30 individuals were cloned from the population and sequenced. The majority of these individuals, including the 52-2 polymerase that dominated the final population, exhibited increased activity compared to the 38-6 polymerase in the presence of either standard (200 mM) or reduced (50 mM) concentrations of Mg<sup>2+</sup>. A dominant clone, termed ‘52-2’, was chosen for further study. It contains four mutations relative to the 38-6 polymerase, is 3-fold more efficient in synthesizing the hammerhead ribozyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), and is 23-fold more efficient in synthesizing the class I ligase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The synthesized ligase is catalytically active, with an observed rate of RNA-templated RNA ligation of 0.31 ± 0.02 hr<sup>–1</sup>, which corresponds to a rate acceleration of 1500-fold compared to the uncatalyzed reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). However, this rate is substantially lower than that of the class I ligase synthesized by T7 RNA polymerase, which has an observed rate of 6.3 ± 0.6 min<sup>–1</sup> under the same reaction conditions.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Synthesis of functional RNA molecules by the 38-6 and 52-2 polymerases.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Synthesis of the hammerhead ribozyme in the presence of either 50 or 200 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> after 1 hr.

Deep sequencing was carried out to analyze both the hammerhead and class I ligase ribozymes synthesized by the 52-2 polymerase. For the hammerhead, synthesized in the presence of either 200 or 50 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>, the average fidelity per nucleotide position was 91.7% or 94.4%, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The most common mutations are the result of G•U wobble pairing, with all types of mutations being less frequent in the presence of the lower concentration of Mg<sup>2+</sup>. For the class I ligase, synthesized in the presence of 200 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>, the average fidelity was 84.1%. There are an average of 12 mutations per copy of the ligase, which explains its reduced activity compared to that of the protein-synthesized material.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Sequence changes over the course of evolution</title><p>The 24-3, 38-6, and 52-2 polymerases represent distinct points along a lineage that has diverged substantially from the wild type. Overall, the 52-2 polymerase differs by 26 mutations compared to the wild type, which corresponds to 14% of its total sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Fifteen of these mutations are within the catalytic core. Two core mutations that arose between the 38-6 and 52-2 polymerase are notable because they change A and U residues at positions 15 and 85 to C and G, respectively. Position 15 is the first nucleotide beyond the fixed primer binding site and had been thought to be part of a single-stranded region (termed J1/3) that helps to position a catalytic Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion within the active site of the parental ligase ribozyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shechner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shechner and Bartel, 2011</xref>). Position 85 lies within what was thought to be a loop region that closes the P7 stem of the catalytic core, but otherwise has no functional importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ekland and Bartel, 1995</xref>). Yet, these two mutations arising in concert raised suspicion that they might form a Watson-Crick pair, which would require a very different structural arrangement within the catalytic core.</p><p>Neither the J1/3 nor the P7 portion of the ribozyme was mutated during the many rounds of evolution leading from the ligase to the wild-type polymerase. However, both of these regions accumulated numerous mutations during the subsequent rounds of evolution, with seven changes in the 24-3 polymerase, six more in the 38-6 polymerase, and two more in the 52-2 polymerase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Taken together, these mutations suggest that a new stem, termed P8, has evolved. One strand of this stem contains six nucleotides derived from the J1/3 region, while the complementary strand contains six nucleotides derived from the P7 stem-loop. The proximal portion of the P7 stem appears to remain intact. The new P8 stem would result in a pseudoknot structure that alters the orientation of the P7-derived nucleotides in a manner that is mutually exclusive to the prior core structure of the ribozyme.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Evolution of the novel pseudoknot structure.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sequence and secondary structure of the 52-2 polymerase.

For the two adjacent pairs (G11-C89 and C15-G85), activity was substantially increased in the corresponding double mutant (C11-G89 and G15-C85), although not fully to the level of the 52-2 polymerase. For the most distal pair (A16-U84), mutation of A16 was highly disruptive and activity could not be restored through compensatory mutation. In the class I ligase, the nucleotide corresponding to A16 is known to make a base-specific contact with the template-primer duplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shechner and Bartel, 2011</xref>), and therefore may be required to play a similar role in the polymerase. Nonetheless, sequence covariation in support of this distal pairing is observed among other evolved variants (e.g., G16-C84 and C16-G84), perhaps requiring accompanying mutations to compensate for substitution of A16.</p><p>These data supporting the existence of the P8 stem need to be reconciled with the consequences for the P7 stem. Nucleotides 84–89 were previously required to form the P7 stem-loop, with U87, G88, and C89 engaging in Watson-Crick pairs to close one end of the stem. However, mutations that would be expected to disrupt the pairing of either U87-A82 or G88-C81 did not have a deleterious effect, nor was there a beneficial effect of mutations that would be expected to provide additional pairing of C89-G80 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, the distal portion of the P7 stem-loop no longer appears to form, with some of those nucleotides instead helping to form the new P8 stem.</p><p>Kinetic studies were carried out to assess more quantitatively the effect of disruptive and compensatory mutations within the P8 stem. The 52-2 polymerase was compared to the C12G and G88C single mutants, as well as the corresponding double mutant, in a reaction involving an 11-nucleotide templating region that enables measurement of both the rate of the first NTP addition and the average rate of NTP additions across the entire template sequence.

Multiple nucleotide additions are seen during this short burst phase, including full-length products, suggesting that there is a subpopulation of molecules with a very rapid rate of reaction.

The sequences of the 24-3, 38-6, and 52-2 polymerases first became apparent at rounds 11, 31, and 46, respectively, and were the dominant cluster at the time they were first isolated from the population, following rounds 24, 38, and 52, respectively.</p><p>Among the distinct forms of the P8 stem that became abundant over the course of evolution, most contained five base pairs, but some contained either four or six base pairs. All of the variability among these sequences occurs at the distal end of the P8 stem, whereas the proximal nucleotides G11, C12, A13, and C14 (and their pairing partners) are universally conserved. This is not surprising because nucleotides 11–14 are part of the primer binding site that remains fixed during each round of selective amplification. Nucleotides 15 and 16 are free to vary, and do so, so long as complementarity is maintained with the corresponding nucleotides of the opposing strand.</p><p>The 5’ and 3’ strands of the P8 stem were also considered individually to determine whether the frequency of occurrence of particular variants of the two strands is correlated over time. Because sequence variation within the 5’ strand is limited to two nucleotides, there was insufficient variation to track all 18 highly represented clusters, but this could be done for variants corresponding to the wild-type, 24-3, 38-6, and 52-2 polymerases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

It has proven to be a remarkably stable motif, perhaps due to the high catalytic efficiency of the parental ligase, which is comparable to that of RNA ligase proteins and approaches the physical limit of substrate recognition through Watson-Crick base pairing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bergman et al., 2000</xref>). As a polymerase, however, the ribozyme has considerably lower activity due to its poor affinity for the primer-template complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lawrence and Bartel, 2003</xref>). This limitation has been partially circumvented by adding a processivity tag that enables the ribozyme to bind tightly to the template though Watson-Crick pairing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wochner et al., 2011</xref>). More recently, the polymerase was evolved to recognize a ‘promoter’ sequence on the template through a clamp-like mechanism, which enables it to operate in a more processive manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cojocaru and Unrau, 2021</xref>). Extensive rounds of directed evolution have also been used to increase the catalytic efficiency and sequence generality of the polymerase, to the level that it is now capable of synthesizing the class I ligase and other complex functional RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tjhung et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>It has been suggested that the ribozyme occupies a high and isolated fitness peak, whereby its structural elements are so tightly interwoven that any exploration of alternative structures would have severe negative consequences for fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ellington, 2008</xref>). Similar isolation in sequence space has been observed for smaller artificial ribozymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pitt and Ferré-D’Amaré, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blanco et al., 2019</xref>), although it could be argued that the more complex structure of the ligase affords more degenerate tertiary interactions that support greater evolvability compared to simpler structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Edelman and Gally, 2001</xref>).</p><p>The new pseudoknot structure emerged spontaneously during the directed evolution process and clearly contributes to the improved fitness of the polymerase ribozyme, demonstrating that the ligase core can indeed access alternative structures in response to stringent selection pressure. Notably, the only major structural changes that this motif had undergone previously were also the result of selection pressures that aimed to improve polymerase activity, although those new structures arose from regions of random-sequence nucleotides that were appended to the ends of the motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Johnston et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wochner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cojocaru and Unrau, 2021</xref>).</p><p>Pseudoknots are compact and informationally economical structures that need not alter the global architecture of an RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gutell et al., 1994</xref>).

The more processive polymerase variant that was evolved by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cojocaru and Unrau, 2021</xref>, does not contain, nor could it accommodate, the pseudoknot structure, demonstrating that there are alternative solutions to achieve improved catalytic activity.</p><p>Both structural probing and sequence analysis of the evolving population over the course of 52 rounds revealed that the new core structure did not appear suddenly as a ‘hopeful monster’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goldschmidt, 1940</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gould, 1977</xref>), but rather was the result of gradual remodeling of the core through a succession of variants along multiple mutational pathways. Prior studies have shown that the nucleotides that gave rise to the P8 stem are relatively tolerant of mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Petrie and Joyce, 2014</xref>). However, the structural stasis of the ligase fold was broken only when selection required a very challenging enzymatic activity, involving the accurate copying of 10–30 nucleotides from structured RNA templates. Presumably, this phenotype could not have been achieved by more subtle modification of the prior structure. Comparing the core sequence of the 52-2 polymerase to that of the wild type, there are only four substitution and two deletion mutations outside the region of the P7 and P8 stems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), none of which would alter the secondary and presumed tertiary structure of the ribozyme.</p><p>Due to the requirement to provide a primer binding site for selective amplification, the 14 nucleotides at the 5’ end of the polymerase were immutable throughout the evolution process. The last four of these nucleotides became part of the new P8 stem, which necessitated a C-to-U mutation at position 87 and a C insertion at position 89 to achieve complementary pairing with the fixed nucleotides. It is tempting to wonder how the evolutionary solution might have been different, perhaps better, if this constraint had not been in place. Clearly, there is sequence flexibility within the region that connects the 3’ end of the processivity tag to the 5’ end of the P8 stem, suggesting that the nucleotides both upstream and within the 5’ half of the P8 stem should be allowed to vary in future rounds of evolution. The new topology of the catalytic core also suggests locations where the insertion of random-sequence nucleotides would be tolerated and may provide an opportunity for further evolutionary improvement.</p><p>The new pseudoknot structure results in more than a change of primary and secondary structure, also having remodeled the tertiary structure of the catalytic core. One strand of the P8 stem derives from the former J1/3 region and the other from the distal portion of the P7 stem-loop. Based on the X-ray crystal structure of the class I ligase, the P7 stem-loop had previously been oriented away from the active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shechner et al., 2009</xref>), but the new topology draws those nucleotides back toward the active site. The crystal structure also shows that the J1/3 region lies in direct contact with the minor groove of the primer-template duplex, with three adenosine residues of J1/3 forming A-minor interactions with nucleotides located 3 and 4 positions upstream of the ligation junction. One of those adenosines has been deleted in the 52-2 polymerase. Other residues of J1/3, which are retained in the 52-2 polymerase, coordinate a Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion that helps to catalyze the phosphoester transfer reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shechner and Bartel, 2011</xref>).</p><p>The comparative in-line probing studies show that there has been subtle alteration of the polymerase structure in regions beyond the P7 and P8 stems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), most notably in the P3 and P6 stems that form a coaxial stack with P7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shechner et al., 2009</xref>). There also were changes in peripheral regions of the ribozyme, perhaps secondary adaptations to the changes that occurred within the catalytic core. The burst-phase kinetics of the 52-2 polymerase suggests that it can adopt multiple folded states, some that are highly active and might be stabilized by further evolution through a combination of core and peripheral mutations.</p><p>Further improvement of the polymerase, especially with regard to template processivity and copying fidelity, will be required to develop a general RNA replicase. Fidelity is a major obstacle if the aim is to synthesize functional products as long as the polymerase itself. A previous study demonstrated that there is a trade-off between product length and fidelity, especially when copying challenging templates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tjhung et al., 2020</xref>). The more time that is required to complete the synthesis, the more opportunity there is to extend a mismatched terminus and thereby incorporate a mutation among the full-length materials. In synthesizing the hammerhead ribozyme in the presence of 200 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>, the 24-3, 38-6, and 52-2 polymerases all have a fidelity of ~92% per nucleotide position. The 52-2 polymerase is able to operate in the presence of 50 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and under that condition the fidelity of hammerhead synthesis improves to 94.4%. But when synthesizing the class I ligase, which requires 200 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> to achieve good yield, the fidelity of the 52-2 polymerase is only 84.1%. The evolutionary path to substantially improved polymerase fidelity likely will entail both improved catalytic activity and an ability to operate under conditions that are less conducive to base mismatch.</p><p>With the heritage of 52 successive generations, it has been illuminating to follow the trajectory of evolution as the population sifted through an astronomical number of possibilities to find those that confer selective advantage. Directed evolution is a highly reductionistic process compared to biological evolution, but has few unseen variables and can provide a detailed picture of how novel sequence begets novel structure and corresponding novel function. The class I ligase motif is old by the standard of ribozymes evolved in the laboratory, but vastly younger than ribozymes found in nature, and thus has not been shaped by long-term selection for evolvability. Nonetheless, through sustained selection for novel function, structural novelty emerged as the population escaped the prior fitness peak and entered a new and more promising fitness regime.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Materials</title><p>All oligonucleotides used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>.

The DNA was made double-stranded by primer extension using SuperScript IV reverse transcriptase, including 1.5 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub> in the reaction mixture to promote extension through lesions that arose during DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chaput et al., 2003</xref>). The dsDNA was amplified linearly by eight cycles of PCR using only the upstream primer, which introduced the T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence. The DNA products were purified using the PureLink PCR cleanup kit, then 650 pmol dsDNA was used to prepare 2 nmol RNA to initiate the first round of evolution (round 39; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The starting population consisted of an average of three copies each of 4 × 10<sup>14</sup> different RNAs. In all subsequent rounds, the size of the RNA population was 200 pmol.</p><p>In vitro evolution was carried out as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tjhung et al., 2020</xref>). The polymerase ribozymes were tethered at their 5’ end to an RNA primer that was annealed to a complementary RNA template and extended by the ribozyme using the four NTPs. The resulting materials were subjected to the selection protocols described below, then reverse-transcribed, PCR-amplified, and forward-transcribed to yield progeny RNAs to begin the next round of evolution. Error-prone PCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cadwell and Joyce, 1992</xref>) was performed after rounds 43–50.</p><p>During rounds 39 and 40, the RNA template was biotinylated and all template-bound materials were captured on streptavidin-coated magnetic beads, which were washed twice with a solution of 8 M urea, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 0.05% Tween-20. The extended products were then eluted from the template with a solution containing 25 mM NaOH, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.05% Tween-20, neutralized with HCl, and precipitated with ethanol. The wash and elution conditions were optimized to exclude polymerases that failed to extend the attached primer, while retaining those that had extended the primer to yield full-length products.</p><p>In all subsequent rounds, selection was based on the ability of the polymerase to synthesize a functional hammerhead ribozyme. In those rounds, the 5’ end of the polymerase was tethered to the 5’ end of an RNA primer via a synthetic linker that contained both a biotin moiety and a substrate for the hammerhead ribozyme. The primer was then annealed through Watson-Crick pairing to a separate template encoding the sequence of the hammerhead. Following extension of the primer by the polymerase to generate the hammerhead ribozyme, the full-length products were purified by PAGE, then bound to streptavidin beads in the presence of 1 mM EDTA, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 0.05% Tween-20, which prevented premature cleavage of the substrate by the hammerhead. The beads were washed with this same solution, then incubated in the presence of 20 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> at 23°C for 30 min. Under the latter conditions, active hammerhead ribozymes cleaved the attached RNA substrate, thereby releasing the corresponding polymerase from the beads.</p><p>Over the course of evolution, both the time allotted for RNA polymerization and the concentration of MgCl<sub>2</sub> were reduced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

Figure 5 summarizes a lot of high detailed sequence information centered on understanding the emergence of the new P8 helix. This figure shows highly represented sequence clusters and their sequential emergence and decline through the evolutionary process. Each cluster results from mutations in the top and the bottom strands of the P8 helix, but are such mutations correlated across clusters when considered by strand? So for example does the second G in the top strand of 24-3 result in the G in 18.1, 24.1, 31.2 and 31.3? Similarly on the bottom strand do the double U mutations in 11.3 give rise to the same mutations in 38.6 and 31.1? It would seem that for each cluster one could quite easily plot the frequency of the top strand and the bottom strands as a function of round (say show the top strand frequencies in shades of green, the bottom strand frequencies in shades of red and the intersection in shaded of blue as currently shown). This could reveal some interesting information about the evolutionary progression that is currently suppressed in the figure. So perhaps the 24-3 top strand pattern declines when 31.3 top strand mutation emerges etc?</p><p>2. Further to this point: Are there evolutionary correlations between the emergence of the new P8 helix and the additional mutations found in the accessory domain of the polymerase? Figure 2 (Supplement 1) seems to suggest this possibility. One could simply hypothesize that the new P8 structure rotates the P7-P6-P3 stack and requires compensatory mutations in other regions of the ribozyme as a result. I was therefore a bit puzzled as to why the authors do not search for such a potential correlation. It would be a fairly simple analysis to explore and would place the importance of the P8 helical mutations in a clearer evolutionary perspective.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) &quot;…. provide conditions that are conducive to both increased polymerase fidelity and reduced degradation of RNA.&quot; How is low magnesium concentration conducive to increased polymerase fidelity? A comment or reference for this statement should be included.</p><p>2) The paper analyzes the endpoint of 52 consecutive rounds of directed evolution under progressively more demanding selection conditions. However, it's important for the authors to better clarify from the start that this manuscript consists of only 14 new rounds of selection (and a deeper analysis of rounds of selection previously carried out and described in earlier publications).</p><p>In the same vein, the authors should define the &quot;wild-type polymerase&quot; as the starting point of their directed evolution experiments leading to 24-3 (PNAS 113: 9786) and finally to 52-2 described here.</p><p>3) The template 5 ́-GUGUGGAGUGACCUCUCCUGUGUGAGUG-3 ́ doesn't seem to be defined nor described in the oligo table.</p><p>4) Given the substantial comparisons between older generations of ribozymes, it would be useful for the reader to have a supplementary figure containing the wildtype sequence with the same notation and numbering showed in figure 2 for 52-2.</p><p>5) P10 l6 refer to figure 5 not 4.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Abstract, last line: Change &quot;suggesting&quot; to &quot;raising the possibility,&quot; &quot;hence, we suggest,&quot; or some similar phrase that does not imply a direct extrapolation from the data in this paper to predictions of how future rounds of evolution may play out.</p><p>The last sentence of p6 states that the new stem (P8) is &quot;mutually exclusive to the prior core structure of the ribozyme.&quot; This is overstated. P7 forms in both the 'old' and 'new' structures, although it is shorter in the 'new' structure because some of the nucleotides have shifted pairing partners to form P8.</p><p>At the bottom of p9, please give an indication of the sizes of the datasets that went into RNASeq analyses, as this speaks to the relative strength of the analysis. Materials and methods notes that the NovaSeq6000 can generate ~20M reads per sample, but there is no indication as to whether &quot;sample&quot; refers to the entire sample to be sequenced (e.g., all pools labeled with indices and merged) or to each population separately. My guess is that there were ~1M reads per population for the 19 sequenced populations; please clarify.</p><p>On p16, this sentence is unclear: &quot;In those rounds, the polymerase was tethered to an RNA primer that was linked to a biotinylated substrate for the hammerhead ribozyme.&quot; Presumably the primer 3' OH was free to be extended; hence, both the 'tethering' (to the polymerase) and 'linking' (to biotinylated substrate) must occur elsewhere.

For each of the major forms of the polymerase, there is a high degree of correlation between the frequency of occurrence of particular variants of the two strands, indicating that they rose and fell in concert. These data are shown in a new figure supplement to Figure 5 and are discussed in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

To investigate this issue biochemically, and prompted by the suggestion of Reviewer 3, we “transplanted” the new pseudoknot structure onto the wild-type polymerase, without any of the other mutations, and found that the resulting chimeric molecule has comparable activity to that of the final evolved 52-2 polymerase. These results are described in the text. We revised Figure 2—figure supplement 1 to include the sequence of the chimeric construct and added figure supplement 2 to show the comparative activity of the wild-type, 52-2, and chimeric polymerases.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) &quot;…. provide conditions that are conducive to both increased polymerase fidelity and reduced degradation of RNA.&quot; How is low magnesium concentration conducive to increased polymerase fidelity?

Also, in response to point #2, we carried out deep sequencing analysis of the ribozyme-synthesized products, generated in the presence of either 50 or 200 mM MgCl2. We did this for the hammerhead ribozyme, which is obtained in reasonable yield at either concentration, and found the error rate is indeed lower at 50 compared to 200 mM MgCl2 (5.6% vs. 8.3%, respectively). We added a discussion of polymerase fidelity as a function of both template length and Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The paper analyzes the endpoint of 52 consecutive rounds of directed evolution under progressively more demanding selection conditions.
