resistance cassettes by shuffling their position from a common promoter. Antibiotic stress induces the expression of an integrase that excises and integrates cassettes, and this unique recombination and expression system is thought to allow bacteria to ‘evolve on demand’ in response to antibiotic pressure. To test this hypothesis, we inserted a custom three-cassette integron into <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and used experimental evolution to measure the impact of integrase activity on adaptation to gentamicin. Crucially, integrase activity accelerated evolution by increasing the expression of a gentamicin resistance cassette through duplications and by eliminating redundant cassettes. Importantly, we found no evidence of deleterious off-target effects of integrase activity. In summary, integrons accelerate resistance evolution by rapidly generating combinatorial variation in cassette composition while maintaining genomic integrity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>From urinary tract infections to bacterial pneumonia, many diseases can now be treated through a course of antibiotics. Yet bacteria have evolved to respond to this threat, gaining new antibiotic resistance genes that allow them to evade the drugs. Addressing this growing issue requires to either discover new antibiotics, or to stop resistance before it emerges – a strategy that can only work if scientists know exactly how this mechanism takes place.</p><p>For bacteria, it is a waste of resources to produce the proteins that confer resistance if antibiotics are absent. In fact, doing so can decrease their chance to survive and reproduce. A genetic element known as an integron can help to manage that burden. This piece of genetic information is formed of a succession of ‘cassettes’ containing antibiotic resistance genes. More proteins are made from the genes present at the start of the integron, compared to the ones towards the end. When bacteria encounter antibiotics, an enzyme called integrase is activated, allowing the organisms to shuffle the order of their cassettes in the integron. It is thought – but not yet proven – that this mechanism helps bacteria to activate their resistance ‘on demand’.</p><p>To find out, Souque et al. engineered the bacteria <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> to carry a custom integron with three cassettes, each helping the organism to resist to a different antibiotic. In addition, only half of the bacteria had a working integrase and could therefore shuffle their gene cassettes. The organisms were then exposed to an increasing amount of the antibiotics for which the cassette in the last position provided resistance. The bacteria with a working integrase survived longer than those without, as they were able to shuffle their cassettes and move the useful antibiotic resistance gene into top position. In addition, the cassettes carrying the genes to resist to other types of antibiotics were excised from the genetic information and lost.</p><p>Understanding integrons could guide future antibiotic treatment strategies, for instance by combining antibiotics with chemicals that block integrase activity. It might also be possible to force bacteria to delete resistance cassettes by cycling through different antibiotics.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>P. aeruginosa</italic></kwd><kwd>experimental evolution</kwd><kwd>antibiotic resistance</kwd><kwd>integron</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>106918/Z/15/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>MacLean</surname><given-names>R Craig</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/M011224/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Souque</surname><given-names>Célia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>803375</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Escudero</surname><given-names>José Antonio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012818</institution-id><institution>Comunidad de Madrid</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016-T1/BIO-1105</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Escudero</surname><given-names>José Antonio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BIO2017-85056-P</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Escudero</surname><given-names>José Antonio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Integrons deploy a variety of adaptive strategies including excision, shuffling, and duplication of cassettes that foster rapid bacterial adaptation and resistance evolution while protecting the genomic integrity of the host.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Given the mounting threat posed by antibiotic resistance, we need a better understanding of the mechanisms used by bacteria to evolve resistance to antibiotics. Mobile integrons (MIs) are widespread elements providing a platform for the acquisition, shuffling, and expression of gene cassettes, many of which are antibiotic resistance genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Recchia and Hall, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Escudero et al., 2015</xref>). These elements are typically associated with transposons and conjugative plasmids and have played an important role in the evolution of resistance in pathogenic bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Partridge et al., 2018</xref>). Five classes of MIs, based on the sequence of their integrase, have arisen independently through association with diverse mobile elements, but the class 1 integron is, by far, the most prevalent and clinically relevant. The first multidrug resistance plasmids that were isolated in the 1950s carried class 1 MIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liebert et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mitsuhashi et al., 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rownd et al., 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Stokes and Hall, 1989</xref>), and recent surveys have shown that class 1 integrons are found in a substantial fraction of isolates of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Halaji et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yu et al., 2003</xref>), <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Firoozeh et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li et al., 2013</xref>)<italic>, Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Oliver et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ruiz-Martínez et al., 2011</xref>), and <italic>Acinetobacter baumanii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Turton et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Mobile integrons consist of an integrase encoding gene named <italic>intI</italic> followed by a recombination site, <italic>attI</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hall et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Partridge et al., 2000</xref>) and a variable array of mobile gene cassettes (typically 2–5 in mobile integrons) ending each in a characteristic hairpin recombination site called the <italic>attC</italic> site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hall et al., 1991</xref>). Integron cassettes usually lack a promoter, and their expression is driven by the Pc promoter located upstream of the array (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Collis and Hall, 1995</xref>), such that expression levels are highest for cassettes closest to the promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Collis and Hall, 1995</xref>). The SOS response (named after the Morse code ...---...) induces the expression of integrases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guerin et al., 2009</xref>), which then allows for the efficient integration and excision of cassettes in the array through <italic>attC × attI</italic> and <italic>attC × attC</italic> reactions, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Collis and Hall, 1992</xref>). A peculiarity of this system is that integron recombination is semi-conservative, as only the bottom strand of the cassette is excised from the array following a recombination pathway that includes a replication step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Loot et al., 2012</xref>). The implication of this is that cassette excision and re-integration can lead to two different results: either a ‘cut and paste’ outcome, resulting in the movement of a cassette within an array, or a ‘copy and paste’ outcome, leading to the insertion of a duplicate copy of a cassette in the conserved array (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Escudero et al., 2015</xref>). An overview of the mechanisms of integron activity is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Overview of integron system.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Diagram of the integron mechanism: the integron consists of an integrase gene, <italic>intI</italic>, followed by an array of promoterless gene cassettes (represented here by arrows). Cassettes are expressed from the Pc promoter within the integrase gene, with decreasing cassette expression along the array. Following the induction of the SOS response, the integrase enzyme promotes cassette excision (recombination between a cassette <italic>attC</italic> site and the <italic>attC</italic> of the preceding cassette, causing excision of the cassette into its circular form). Due to the presence of a replication step in the excision process, a copy of the original array is conserved. Re-integration of the circular cassette can then occur through recombination between the cassette <italic>attC</italic> site and the <italic>attI</italic> site located at the start of either array, leading to an apparent ‘cut-and-paste’ recombination if the cassette integrates in the excised array, or can be assimilated to a ‘copy-and-paste’ outcome if it integrates in a conserved copy of the array. By shuffling and duplicating cassettes, the integron has the potential to quickly modulate cassette expression levels.

According to this hypothesis, integrase-mediated cassette re-shuffling in stressful environments allows bacteria to optimize cassette expression and maximize fitness: useful cassettes can be brought forward to ensure maximal expression, while unnecessary cassettes can be kept at the end of the array as a low cost memory of once-adaptive functions, ready to be brought forward when needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Escudero et al., 2015</xref>). Stress-inducible regulation also helps to minimize the costs associated with integrase expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lacotte et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Starikova et al., 2012</xref>), which are thought to come from increased genomic instability created by off-target integrase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harms et al., 2013</xref>). Although antibiotics have diverse modes of action, many of the most common classes of antibiotic cause DNA damage that induces the SOS response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kohanski et al., 2010</xref>). This link between antibiotic exposure and integrase activity suggests that cassette re-shuffling may allow pathogenic bacteria to rapidly adapt to novel antibiotic challenges.</p><p>While the molecular mechanisms of integron shuffling are known in detail, our ability to understand the evolutionary benefits provided by this fascinating genetic platform is limited by our understanding of the population biology of integron-mediated antibiotic resistance. For example, constitutive over-expression of the integrase enzyme has been shown to accelerate the evolution of chloramphenicol resistance through the loss of cassettes between Pc and the resistance cassette as well as the formation of co-integrates between integron copies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barraud and Ploy, 2015</xref>). However, to the best of our knowledge, the benefits of cassette shuffling under the integrase natural promoter and its associated LexA regulation have never been investigated. This is an important limitation, as parameters such as the re-insertion rate of excised cassettes and fitness costs of integrase expression are predicted to have a strong impact on the evolutionary benefits of the integrase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Engelstädter et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, integron cassette shuffling has rarely been studied in the large, natural plasmids where class 1 integrons often occur.</p><p>Here we directly test the ‘adaptation on demand’ hypothesis using experimental evolution in populations of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> carrying a variant of the broad host range plasmid R388. We replaced the naturally occurring class 1 mobile integron in R388 with a customized integron containing three antibiotic resistance cassettes: <italic>dfrA5</italic> (a trimethoprim resistant dihydrofolate reductase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sundström et al., 1988</xref>]), <italic>bla<sub>VEB-1</sub></italic> (an extended-spectrum-β-lactamase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Poirel et al., 1999</xref>]), and <italic>aadB</italic> (an aminoglycoside-2′-adenylyltransferase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cameron et al., 1986</xref>]). To directly investigate the role of integrase activity in this system, we also generated a truncated integrase mutant that allows normal levels of cassette expression, but not recombination. Using this system, we found that integrase activity leads to rapid and extensive cassette re-shuffling in response to strong selection for increased gentamicin resistance. Specifically, integrase activity caused the insertion of duplicate copies of <italic>aadB</italic> cassettes in the first position of the integron, followed by the loss of redundant cassettes. Crucially, this accelerated the ability of populations to adapt to antibiotic stress, providing good support for the ‘adaptation on demand’ hypothesis. Finally, we show that rapid duplications can also occur with <italic>bla<sub>VIM-1</sub></italic> cassettes, which confer resistance to ‘last line of defense’ carbapenem antibiotics, in a recently isolated clinical plasmid under meropenem selection.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A combinatorial, three-cassette integron system to investigate the impact of cassette position</title><p>We replaced the naturally occurring class 1 integron of plasmid R388 with all six possible configurations of a class 1 integron containing three antibiotic resistance cassettes, including <italic>dfrA5</italic>, <italic>aadB</italic>, and <italic>bla<sub>VEB-1</sub></italic> and transformed our integron variants into <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA01 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>).

Interestingly, the relationship between <italic>aadB</italic> position and resistance was not linear: we observed a 6- to 24-fold difference in minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) between arrays containing <italic>aadB</italic> in first and second positions, but a less than twofold difference between arrays with <italic>aadB</italic> in second and third places. In order to investigate the mechanisms behind this trend, we measured the <italic>aadB</italic> cassette transcription levels of the different arrays. Instead of a sharp drop, we observed a steady decrease depending on the cassette position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Previous work has shown that two short open-reading frames contained within the <italic>attI</italic> site can substantially enhance the translation of a cassette lacking a Shine–Dalgarno (SD) sequence when the cassette is located in first position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hanau-Berçot et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Papagiannitsis et al., 2017</xref>), showing that cassette position can also modulate translation levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hanau-Berçot et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jacquier et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, the <italic>aadB</italic> cassette contains a reduced SD box (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>), suggesting that the steep gradient in gentamicin resistance between first and second positions was mostly due to decreased translation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Integrase activity accelerates the evolution of antibiotic resistance</title><p>Given the strong effect of <italic>aadB</italic> cassette position on gentamicin resistance, we decided to use this combination of cassette and antibiotic to experimentally test the hypothesis that integrase activity accelerates resistance evolution.

As controls, 15 populations of each strain were passaged without antibiotic (no selection for gentamicin resistance), while 15 populations were passaged at a constant dose of 1/8 MIC (3 mg/L) to generate weak selection for gentamicin resistance and plasmid maintenance.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Integrase activity can increase bacteria evolvability against antibiotics.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic representation of the experimental evolution protocol.

We did not detect any extinctions in either of the controls, showing that the higher extinction rate of <italic>ΔintI1</italic>A3 populations was driven by exposure to high doses of gentamicin.

We measured the impact of this novel array on gentamicin resistance level by transferring the evolved plasmids into the ancestral chromosomal background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). This novel integron is associated with a large increase (64-fold) in gentamicin resistance due to the dominant effect of first position on <italic>aadB</italic>, with similar levels to our constructed arrays with <italic>aadB</italic> in first position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). Interestingly, we did not identify any <italic>aadBbla<sub>VEB-1</sub>dfrA5</italic> arrays, which would be the result of an <italic>aadB</italic> excision followed by reintegration of <italic>aadB</italic> in first position within the same array, highlighting the prevalence of ‘copy and paste’ cassette insertions. Degenerate integrons that lack the <italic>bla</italic><sub>VEB-1</sub> and <italic>dfrA5</italic> cassettes (i.e. either <italic>aadB</italic> or <italic>aadBaadB arrays</italic>) were also present at relatively high frequency at both the ×4 and ×1024 MIC time points. Interestingly, in mixed arrays populations, these reduced arrays were always observed in conjunction with the <italic>aadB-bla<sub>VEB-1</sub>dfrA5aadB</italic> array and never with the ancestral array. This repeated association provides good evidence that degenerate arrays evolved via <italic>aadB</italic> insertion in first position, to form the common <italic>aadB-bla<sub>VEB-1</sub>dfrA5aadB</italic> array, followed by the en bloc deletion of the other cassettes (<italic>bla<sub>VEB-1</sub>dfrA5aadB</italic> or <italic>bla<sub>VEB-1</sub>dfrA5</italic>) to form <italic>aadB</italic> and <italic>aadBaadB</italic> arrays. Recombination happened at the 5′-GTT-3′ triplet of the R box of <italic>attC<sub>aadB</sub></italic> and <italic>attC<sub>dfrA5</sub></italic> sites, suggesting that these deletions were driven by integrase activity, although we cannot rule out the possibility that the <italic>bla<sub>VEB-1</sub>dfrA5aadB</italic> cassette deletion was driven by homologous recombination between <italic>aadB</italic> cassettes. The relative prevalence of these two degenerate arrays did not change between the ×4 and ×1024 MIC time points (four <italic>aadB</italic> against three <italic>aadBaadB</italic> arrays at ×4 MIC and three <italic>aadB</italic> against three <italic>aadBaadB</italic> arrays at ×1024 MIC), which suggests that the second <italic>aadB</italic> cassette in the <italic>aadBaadB</italic> array is redundant. In line with this argument, we found a marginal difference (×2) in MIC between evolved plasmids carrying <italic>aadB</italic> (mean = 512, s.d. = 0) and <italic>aadBaadB (</italic>mean = 939, s.d. = 121). Finally, we found arrays containing a duplicate copy of <italic>aadB</italic> at the end of the array (<italic>bla<sub>VEB-1</sub>dfrA5aadBaadB</italic>), which are likely to have been formed by the insertion of an <italic>aadB</italic> cassette in the middle or at the end of the array through the less frequent <italic>attC</italic> × <italic>attC</italic> integration (intermolecular) reaction. These arrays were only found at the ×4 MIC time point, strongly suggesting that they conferred a small increase in gentamicin resistance that was ultimately an evolutionary dead end under strong selection for elevated resistance.</p><p>In addition to changes in integron structure, we found widespread integron evolution by mutations in both the WTA3 and <italic>ΔintI1</italic>A3 populations. Mutations in <italic>bla</italic><sub>VEB-1</sub> were found in more than 80% of WTA3 and <italic>ΔintI1</italic>A3 populations from the ×4 MIC time point, and in almost all populations where the <italic>bla<sub>VEB-1</sub></italic> cassette was maintained at the ×1024 MIC time point, including 5/6 <italic>ΔintI1</italic>A3 and 16/16 WTA3 populations. All mutations in <italic>bla<sub>VEB-1</sub></italic> were amino acid substitutions (n = 9) or indels (n = 16) and the 23 amino acid signal peptide was a hotspot for mutations (12 of 25 <italic>bla<sub>VEB-1</sub></italic> mutations), suggesting strong selection to eliminate the secretion of this redundant resistance protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary files 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">3</xref>). Furthermore, similar <italic>bla</italic><sub>VEB-1</sub> mutations were also found in the ⅛ MIC controls, demonstrating that these mutations were beneficial under low doses of gentamicin, as we would expect if this cassette imposed an important fitness cost. It is unclear if this cost of <italic>bla<sub>VEB-1</sub></italic> was driven by the presence of gentamicin (i.e. collateral sensitivity) because the entire R388 plasmid was lost in every control population that was passaged in antibiotic-free medium. Parallel evolution also occurred close to the putative translation initiation site of the <italic>aadB</italic> cassette. These mutations were very rare at the ×4 MIC time points (2/46 populations), but were present at a high frequency in <italic>ΔintI1</italic>A3 populations from the final time point (4/6 populations) and are linked with high level of gentamicin resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). We speculate that these mutations were favored in <italic>ΔintI1</italic>A3 populations as they increased the translation rate of the weakly expressed third position <italic>aadB</italic> cassette and offer an alternative mechanism to increase <italic>aadB</italic> expression in the absence of re-arrangements. Similarly, we identified one 41 bp deletion within the <italic>dfrA5 attC</italic> site of a WTA3 population, which may increase translational coupling with the previous <italic>dfrA5</italic> cassette (as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jacquier et al., 2009</xref>) or lead to the creation of a fused protein with part of the previous cassette. Finally, we observed similar extended deletions in one WTA3 population and in the 1/8 MIC WTA3 pooled control. These deletions occur between <italic>attC<sub>aadB</sub></italic> and different positions within the plasmid <italic>trwF</italic> gene, effectively deleting most of the genes involved in mating pore formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), with the sequence of the junction sites pointing toward potential off-target activity of the integrase (abundance of 5′-GNT-3′ secondary sites) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Chromosomal evolution</title><p>The integron integrase is known to have off-target effects, suggesting that integrase activity may also have an important effect on chromosomal evolution by reducing genomic stability through recombination between chromosomal pseudo-<italic>attC</italic> or pseudo-<italic>attI</italic> sites, leading to an increase in deletions and re-arrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harms et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Chromosomal evolution occurred more rapidly in the <italic>ΔintI1</italic>A3 populations than in the WTA3 populations, as demonstrated by the high cumulative frequency of mutations in <italic>ΔintI1</italic>A3 populations (mean = 1.01; s.e. = 0.17, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) at ×4 MIC compared to WTA3 populations (mean = 0.48; s.e. = 0.11; t = −2.69, df = 35.83, p=0.01, Welch two-sample t-test). However, accelerated chromosomal evolution in the absence of integrase activity was short-lived, and cumulative frequency of mutations in the WTA3 and <italic>ΔintI1</italic>A3 populations was almost identical at the end of the experiment (mean WTA3 = 2.45 SNPs; mean <italic>ΔintI1</italic>A3 = 2.65 SNPs, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Crucially, we found only one case of chromosomal recombination, with a 3.5 kb deletion between the two highly homologous ccoN1 and ccoN2 cytochrome C subunits in one WTA3 population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), showing that off-target effects of the integrase were undetectable in our experiment, in spite of our extensive genomic sequencing.</p><p>In total, we identified 41 different SNPs and 58 short indels in eight intergenic regions and 41 genes, with a similar spectrum of mutations in the ramping WTA3 and <italic>ΔintI1</italic>A3 populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary files 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">3</xref>). Several lines of evidence indicate that the overwhelming majority of mutations were beneficial mutations that reached high frequency as a result of selection. First, many of the mutated genes have known roles in antibiotic resistance; for example, 11/41 mutated genes have also been identified in an aminoglycoside resistance screen in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schurek et al., 2008</xref>). Second, parallel evolution was very common. Repeated evolution occurred in 11 of 42 (26%) genes and 3 of 8 (38%) intergenic regions with 68% of mutations occurring in these genes. Only 1 of 41 mutations in coding regions was synonymous, providing evidence that the rapid evolution of proteins was driven by positive selection, and not simply by an elevated mutation rate. Finally, we found almost no overlap between the genes that were mutated in the ramping populations and the controls, implying that the evolutionary response of the ramping populations was dominated by selection for high levels of gentamicin resistance. For both control regimens, the chromosomal genes with the most mutations were <italic>cdrA</italic> (PA4625), involved in biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Reichhardt et al., 2018</xref>), and PA1874, a hypothetical protein.

We tested this hypothesis by quantifying the impact of integrase activity on adaptation to increasing doses of gentamicin in populations of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> carrying a customized integron on a broad host range plasmid. Crucially, integrase activity accelerated the evolution of gentamicin resistance through rapid and repeated re-shuffling of the <italic>aadB</italic> resistance cassette, providing experimental support for the ‘adaptation on demand’ hypothesis.</p><p>We observed a diversity of cassette re-arrangements as a result of integrase activity, whose diverse prevalences can help us understand the evolutionary dynamics underlying cassette shuffling. Cassette shuffling and duplication were extremely frequent, both with the <italic>aadB</italic> and the <italic>bla<sub>VIM-1</sub></italic> cassettes. The semi-conservative nature of cassette excision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Escudero et al., 2015</xref>) implies that cassette re-shuffling can lead to either ‘cut and paste’ or ‘copy and paste’ outcomes. Strikingly, all of the <italic>aadB</italic> re-arrangements that we observed were ‘copy and paste’ outcomes, resulting in the duplication of <italic>aadB</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). A bias towards evolution by ‘copy and paste’ is expected if increased copy number of the cassette under selection is beneficial. In this case, the benefit provided by <italic>aadB</italic> is strongly dependent on position, suggesting that ‘copy and paste’ insertions are unlikely to have provided stronger benefits than ‘cut and paste’ re-arrangements in first position. Furthermore, we only observe a slight advantage provided by <italic>aadB-aadB</italic> as compared to <italic>aadB</italic> arrays, suggesting that secondary copies of <italic>aadB</italic> were mostly redundant in arrays containing an <italic>aadB</italic> cassette in first position. The presence of multiple integrons within the same cell may also create an apparent bias towards ‘copy and paste’ re-shuffling: if re-insertion of an excised cassette is equally likely between all the integron copies present in a cell, we would expect the chance of an excised <italic>aadB</italic> cassette to re-insert into its original array to be 25–30% given the copy number of the R388 plasmid (2–3 per cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fernández-López et al., 2006</xref>]). However, the absence of any ‘cut and paste’ products in our experiments, instead of the expected 30%, suggests that the integrase enzyme may be inherently biased towards ‘copy and paste’ cassette re-arrangement, potentially by favoring the reinsertion of an excised cassette into the conserved array.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Representation of the proposed reactions leading to the various arrays observed in this study.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-62474-fig6-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Although duplicated cassettes are relatively common in large chromosomal integrons, such as the <italic>V. cholerae</italic> superintegron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Escudero et al., 2015</xref>), they are rarely found in mobile integrons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">San Millan et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Stokes and Hall, 1992</xref>). For example, duplicate cassettes are only found in 5% of the integrons that contain two or more cassettes in the INTEGRALL database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Moura et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Difficulties associated with resolving duplications from short-read sequencing data probably contribute to this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alkan et al., 2011</xref>), but it is clear that duplicate cassettes are rare. Interestingly, the duplicate copies of selected cassettes created by ‘copy and paste’ re-shuffling facilitate the loss of redundant cassettes. First, duplication of cassettes with highly recombinogenic <italic>attC</italic> sites, such as <italic>aadB</italic>, facilitates the integrase-mediated excision of redundant cassettes. In this case, the insertion of <italic>aadB</italic> in first position created the opportunity for the loss of the <italic>bla</italic><sub>VEB-1</sub>-<italic>dfrA5</italic> cassettes, through an <italic>attC</italic><sub>aadB</sub> × <italic>attC<sub>dfrA5</sub></italic> reaction, or the excision of <italic>bla<sub>VEB-1</sub>-dfrA5-aadB</italic>, through an <italic>attC<sub>aadB</sub></italic> x <italic>attC<sub>aadB</sub></italic> recombination. Homologous recombination between duplicate cassettes or between copies of integrons on different plasmids provides a second mechanism for integron degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersson and Hughes, 2009</xref>), in this case resulting in the formation of a single copy of the duplicate gene. This also highlights how extremely mobile cassettes, such as <italic>aadB</italic>, can compensate for the lack of mobility of other less recombinogenic cassettes, like <italic>bla<sub>VEB-1</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aubert et al., 2012</xref>). This bias toward integron degeneration may be detrimental over the long term by leading to the loss of potentially useful cassettes but may also promote the deletion of redundant cassettes with low excision rate, which could not otherwise be easily excised by the integrase. The constitutive expression of cassettes from the Pc promoter ensures that redundant cassettes impose a fitness cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lacotte et al., 2017</xref>), implying that selection for cassette loss is likely to be common. Given this, we argue that semi-conservative nature of cassette excision is key to the evolutionary benefits of integrase activity, as it allows integrons to rapidly gain additional copies of selected cassettes and facilitates the subsequent elimination of costly redundant cassettes.</p><p>In our experiments, mutations in the chromosome and in the integron made an important contribution to resistance evolution and are key to understanding the effective integrase evolutionary benefits. For example, integrase activity was associated with the loss of the redundant <italic>bla<sub>VEB-1</sub></italic> cassette, which is in line with the integrase-mediated loss of redundant cassettes during selection for elevated chloramphenicol resistance observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barraud and Ploy, 2015</xref>. However, the <italic>bla<sub>VEB-1</sub></italic> cassette was also rapidly inactivated by mutations in <italic>ΔintI1</italic> populations. While integrase activity offers additional evolutionary pathways to alleviate the cost of <italic>bla<sub>VEB-1</sub></italic>, the presence of numerous mutational targets achieving the same effect may offset the observable evolutionary benefit of the integrase. Similarly, mutations in the promoter of the <italic>aadB</italic> cassette provided an alternative mechanism to increase the expression of this cassette that did not depend on integrase activity. Moreover, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> has a strong potential to adapt to aminoglycosides via chromosomal mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">López-Causapé et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schurek et al., 2008</xref>). Given our populations possess a sizable evolvability potential through mutations, even in the absence of integrase activity, we hypothesize an even stronger impact of the integrase should be observable in environments or species where evolution possibilities through mutations are more limited. Finally, we detected an interesting interplay between chromosomal evolution and integrase activity, with a divergence in the evolution of the two genotypes at the early ×4 MIC time point, which is potentially the most clinically relevant. Rapid chromosomal and plasmid evolution via mutations across a wide range of target genes allowed populations lacking a functional integrase to evolve resistance to increasing concentrations of gentamicin. The wild-type populations, on the other hand, showed a much-reduced mutation prevalence, as chromosomal mutations were potentially out-competed by the frequent and more efficient cassette re-arrangements. This accelerated chromosomal evolution in <italic>ΔintI1A3</italic> populations was short lived, confirming that rapid evolution was driven by more effective selection for mutations in populations lacking an integrase, rather than a difference in mutation rate per se. All populations that were able to survive very high levels of gentamicin exposure evolved by mutations of a common suite of target genes involved in antibiotic efflux and ribosomal modification, highlighting the fact that integrase activity did not ultimately alter the mutational routes to high-level resistance, but can impact chromosomal evolution during the early evolution of resistance.</p><p>Systems that upregulate the mutation rate under stress are widespread in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Foster, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">MacLean et al., 2013</xref>), and beneficial mutations generated by these systems can accelerate adaptation to stress (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Torres-Barceló et al., 2015</xref>). However, most of the mutations generated by these systems will be deleterious, and stress-induced mutagenesis will therefore tend to reduce fitness, particularly if the deleterious effects of mutations are exacerbated by stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kishony and Leibler, 2003</xref>). The integron integrase is known to have off-target activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Recchia et al., 1994</xref>), and it has been argued that the costs associated with off-target recombination contribute to the cost of integrase expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harms et al., 2013</xref>), limiting the evolutionary benefit of this system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Engelstädter et al., 2016</xref>). Although our sequencing strategy had limited ability to detect rare re-arrangements (we imposed a cut-off of &gt;30% prevalence) in any particular population, we compensated for this limitation by sequencing many replicate populations samples. We found no evidence of chromosomal re-arrangements or increased mutation rates that could be linked to integrase activity, with the exception of a single deletion in the R388 plasmid that was suggestive of integrase activity, suggesting a low rate of off-target recombination. It could be argued that the strong selection and regular population bottlenecking imposed by our experiment is likely to have been effective at purging populations from rare neutral and weakly deleterious variants produced by off-target integrase activity. However, a high rate of off-target integrase activity could have also resulted in an increased rate of fixation of mutations and/or re-arrangements, as a result of either positive selection (beneficial mutations produced by integrase activity) or hitch-hiking (neutral integrase-produced mutations linked to other beneficial mutations). In summary, our results support the idea that integrase activity accelerates evolution by creating high levels of variation exclusively in a region of the genome containing genes involved in response to stress, allowing bacteria to benefit from increased diversity without compromising genomic integrity. This contrasts with stress-induced mutagenesis, where the vast majority of mutations occur in genes that are not related to stress response, but further work is required to improve our understanding of the rate and spectrum of off-target recombination generated by integrase activity.</p><p>In conclusion, our study supports the view that integrons provide bacteria with an incredible opportunity to evolve in response to new antibiotic challenges by rapidly optimizing the expression of cassettes. Integrase activity allows bacteria to modulate cassette expression, rapidly gain additional copies of selected cassettes and eliminate redundant cassettes, while the high specificity of integrase-mediated recombination maintains genomic integrity, minimizing the costs of integrase activity. Given the importance of cassette re-shuffling, we argue that integrase activity will accelerate resistance evolution most for highly mobile cassettes that display strong positional effects, such as <italic>aadB</italic>. Given this, we argue that cassette re-shuffling will be most important in cases where bacteria have limited ability to adapt to antibiotics, for example when only a small number of mutations can increase resistance, or where resistance mutations carry large fitness costs. Integrase activity also provides bacteria with the opportunity to capture new resistance cassettes, an important challenge for future work will be to study the evolutionary processes driving cassette acquisition. Our work also supports the view that treatment strategies should seek to target integrons, for example by combining antibiotics with adjuvants that limit integrase activity by inhibiting the SOS response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hocquet et al., 2012</xref>), or by using combinations of antibiotics that impose conflicting selective pressures on the integron.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>)</td><td valign="top">PA01</td><td valign="top">Lab strain</td><td valign="top">NC_002516</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td valign="top">MG-1</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Poirel et al., 1999</xref></td><td valign="top">AF205943</td><td valign="top"><italic>E. coli</italic> clinical isolate containing a <italic>qacI–aadB–aacA1/orfG–blaVEB1–aadB–arr2–cmIA5–blaOXA–10/aadA1</italic> integron array</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td valign="top">EIEC-4</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gassama et al., 2004</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"><italic>E. coli</italic> clinical isolate containing a <italic>dfrA5</italic> integron cassette</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">R388</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Avila and de la Cruz, 1988</xref></td><td valign="top">NC_028464.1</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">WTA1</td><td valign="top">This study</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Custom integron array <italic>drfA5–blaVEB1–aadB</italic> on R388 plasmid backbone</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">WTA2</td><td valign="top">This study</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Custom integron array <italic>blaVEB1– aadB–dfrA5</italic> on R388 plasmid backbone</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">WTA3</td><td valign="top">This study</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Custom integron array <italic>blaVEB1–dfrA5–aadB</italic> on R388 plasmid backbone</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">WTA4</td><td valign="top">This study</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Custom integron array <italic>dfrA5–aadB–blaVEB1</italic> on R388 plasmid backbone</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">WTA5</td><td valign="top">This study</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Custom integron array <italic>aadB–blaVEB1– dfrA5</italic> on R388 plasmid backbone</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">WTA6</td><td valign="top">This study</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Custom integron array <italic>aadB–dfrA5–blaVEB1</italic> on R388 plasmid backbone</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top"><italic>Δint1A3</italic></td><td valign="top">This study</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Array WTA3 with a 948 bp deletion of the integrase <italic>intI1</italic></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pAMBL1</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">San Millan et al., 2015a</xref></td><td valign="top">KP873172.1</td><td valign="top">Clinical plasmid containing a <italic>blaVIM-1–aadB</italic> integron array</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">breseq</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barrick et al., 2014</xref></td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_010810">SCR_010810</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Version 0.33.2</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">CNOGpro</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brynildsrud, 2018</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacteria and growth conditions</title><p>A complete list of strains and plasmids can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

PA3734 is predicted to be a lipase involved in cell-wall metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dettman et al., 2015</xref>) and may be involved in quorum-sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Levesque, 2006</xref>), while phzM and phzA1 are involved in the production of pyocyanins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Higgins et al., 2018</xref>). No literature linking those genes to aminoglycoside resistance was identified. Four PA01:<italic>ΔintI1</italic>A3 samples and one PA01:WTA3 sample from the ×4 MIC time point were removed from the analysis due to a wrong or mixed genotype from potential mislabeling or mishandling during DNA processing, leading to a final genomic dataset of 22 PA01:<italic>ΔintI1</italic>A3 and 24 PA01:WTA3 populations at ×4 MIC. All samples from the ×1024 MIC time point were of the correct genotype.</p><p>Potential new junctions between distant regions of the reference genome were identified through the <italic>breseq</italic> software on the plasmid and on the chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barrick et al., 2014</xref>). We detected any re-arrangement present in more than 5% of a population, but kept only re-arrangements above 30% for further analysis, which excluded four re-arrangements, all deletions of less than 1 kb. Copy number variants were identified with CNOGpro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brynildsrud, 2018</xref>) and used to confirm potential duplications or large-scale deletions. Finally, de novo assembly of the plasmids using plasmidSPAdes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antipov et al., 2016</xref>) was carried out to provide additional evidence for the cassette rearrangements and visualized using Bandage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wick et al., 2015</xref>). The robustness of the detection of cassette re-arrangement from the sequencing data was tested by cross-referencing the predicted recombinations with the results from the PCR screen at ×1024 MIC: all predicted recombinations matched the bands of the PCR screen, and only two extraneous bands could not be explained in three populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), confirming the robustness of the bioinformatic analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>MIC determination of evolved populations</title><p>The MICs of 15 PA01:WTA3 and 5 PA01:<italic>ΔintI1</italic>A3 evolved populations from the final ×1024 MIC time point were determined as described above using individual colonies plated on in LB Miller media supplemented with gentamicin at ×128 MICexp from the frozen stocks.</p><p>To create populations containing the evolved plasmids in the ancestral chromosomal background, the plasmids of 15 PA01:WTA3 and 2 PA01:<italic>ΔintI1</italic>A3 ×1024 MIC populations containing a single type of array were first extracted using the QIAprep Miniprep (Qiagen) on the QiaCube extraction platform (Qiagen) from liquid culture in LB Miller supplemented with gentamicin at x64 MICexp. These plasmids were then electroporated back into the ancestral PA01 background using the protocol described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Choi and Schweizer, 2006</xref> and plated on agar supplemented with gentamicin at 24 mg/L. The presence of the plasmid was controlled by PCR targeting the integrase, and MICs were performed following the protocol described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Experimental evolution with pAMBL1</title><p>Thirty colonies of PA01:pAMBL1 were inoculated in 100 μL of MH2 broth and transferred every day in doubling concentrations of meropenem with a 1/10,000 dilution and frozen in 15% glycerol every other day. Population survival was monitored each day after reaching a concentration of ×1 MIC<sub>exp</sub> by plating every well on a MH2 agar plate without antibiotic using a pin replicator. Extinction of a population was defined as the absence of a visible colony after 24 hr incubation at 37°C.</p><p>Surviving populations at ×2 MIC<sub>exp</sub> were grown on a MH2 agar plate without antibiotic and used as substrate for PCR. Primers were used to identify potential duplications of the bla<sub>VIM</sub> cassette by PCR. PCR were carried out using the GoTaq G2 DNA mastermix (Promega) and the following protocol: 30 s at 95°C, 30 s at 55°C, 3 min at 72°C for 30 cycles. Single clones from two different populations were sequenced through whole genome sequencing and analyzed using the same protocol as described previously.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was carried out using R (version 3.6.1) and RStudio (Version 1.2.5).

&quot;evolution-on-demand&quot;. Using a combination of custom integrons and experimental evolution examining resistance to gentamycin, the authors present a convincing body of work supporting this hypothesis.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Integron activity accelerates the evolution of antibiotic resistance&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor.</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors test the long-standing &quot;evolution-on-demand&quot; hypothesis of integrons. Using a combination of genetic construction work, experimental evolution, and WGS the authors present a convincing body of work favoring the presented hypothesis. They introduce three antibiotic gene cassettes into an integron and use an &quot;evolutionary ramp&quot; approach with gentamicin and demonstrate that the gentamicin resistance cassette shuffles towards the start of the integron. This provides compelling evidence favoring the evolutionary effects of an active class 1 integrase.</p><p>The paper is clear, well written and demonstrates neatly the benefits of integron shuffling. The authors should also be given credit for including experimental data from an integron containing a clinical plasmid including resistance cassettes to the last resort antibiotics carbapenems. This is largely missing in the field.</p><p>Our overall assessment of the manuscript is positive. However, a number of questions have been raised regarding the mechanistic aspects and conclusions of the paper. We are therefore suggesting additional assays to measure phenotypic effects of evolved integrons, and data analyses on the negative controls. If these are not possible to perform, the main conclusions could be slightly altered instead to focus more on the genomics. Finally, we provide some suggestions on making the Discussion more balanced and in clarifying the role of chromosomal mutations in the integron-facilitated evolution.</p><p>For the manuscript to be accepted, the following points should be addressed:</p><p>1) The paper is framed around the evolution of increased antibiotic resistance, which is not directly quantified. Assays to measure resistance of evolved clones (from the populations in which integrons are not polymorphic (Figure 3B)) would demonstrate and quantify the evolution of increased resistance associated with the different integron arrays (aadB-bla<sub>VEB-1</sub>-dfrA5-aadB, aadB-aadB, aadB and the ancestral array), allowing to link genotype and phenotype. By transferring evolved plasmids to an unevolved host, effects of plasmid evolution could also relatively easily be separated from chromosomal mutations that may contribute to gentamicin resistance. If these additional experiments are not possible, the text should be reformulated to focus on the genetics and not on phenotypic resistance.</p><p>2) One question that came up was whether there were any re-arrangements in the negative control that was evolved without antibiotics. After discussion, we concluded that the absence of this analysis was &quot;because the entire R388 plasmid was lost in every control population that was passaged in antibiotic-free medium&quot;. It may be worth highlighting this plasmid loss and more generally clarifying the results of the different controls (1/8 MIC and no antibiotic).</p><p>3) What sequence coverage was used? Could it be that random re-arrangements appear at a very low frequency that are only fixed under changing conditions (similar to mutations)?</p><p>4) Explain better Figure 3—figure supplement 2, showing the crucial control where PCRs confirm data from Illumina short read sequencing on whole populations. A schematic figure of each combination of cassettes, primer positions, and expected band length combined with proper lane descriptions should be prepared in a revised version of the manuscript.</p><p>5) The authors argue that intI1 has a bias towards &quot;copy and paste&quot; as opposed to &quot;cut and paste&quot; cassette rearrangements. Why use the term &quot;copy&quot; and how is this novel? In the two outcomes in integron structure, the cassette is excised (cut) from the ancestral integron before it is inserted (paste) into either arrays. Moreover, is there sufficient evidence to support the proposed &quot;copy and paste&quot; bias of IntI1? As the authors discuss thoroughly, the presence of multiple copies of the ancestral structure provides more &quot;ancestral&quot; integration targets for the excised cassettes. The authors exclude the alternative hypothesis that a second copy of aadB increased fitness as compared to a single copy (as expected from copy and paste). Measuring the fitness effects of different arrays (point 1) would address this point.</p><p>6) The authors highlight that they found no evidence of deleterious off-target integrase effects. They suggest that integrase activity may purge deleterious chromosomal mutations and enable more targeted beneficial adaptive responses. The authors present cases where likely beneficial off target recombination events occurred. To what extent do the authors think the absence of deleterious off target effects is due to the experimental conditions (continuous increments in gentamicin concentrations combined with strong bottlenecks)?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.62474.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] Our overall assessment of the manuscript is positive.

Importantly, we show that all WT and ∆intI1 populations evolved to similar levels of gentamicin resistance (MIC= 25g/L). The methods for this experiment are described in the text and the results are represented in Figure 2C and reported in the text.</p><p>b) Second, we measured the resistance level provided by evolved integrons by transforming evolved plasmids into a PA01 reference strain. This experiment allowed us to confirm that the integron evolved to provide large increases in resistance in all populations. The methods for this experiment are described in the text and the results are represented in Figure 3E and reported in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) One question that came up was whether there were any re-arrangements in the negative control that was evolved without antibiotics.

We also highlight the plasmid mutations and the rearrangement of the 1/8 MIC controls. (Results).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) What sequence coverage was used? Could it be that random re-arrangements appear at a very low frequency that are only fixed under changing conditions (similar to mutations)?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that our sequencing has limited ability to detect very rare integron re-arrangements. Our depth of sequencing coverage was high (760 +/- 258 for the plasmid, 171 +/- 24 for the chromosome) and while we restricted our analysis to variants present in a least 30% of a single population, our bioinformatic pipeline should be able to detect any re-arrangements with a frequency greater than about 5%. We only detected 4 rearrangements that did not reach the 30% threshold, equally divided between both genotypes, and all were deletions under 1kb. Given the uncertainties regarding these rare rearrangements, we did not include them in our manuscript. One strength of our experimental design is that we sequenced a large number of populations with a functional integrase, and this high level of replication is key to our conclusion that off-target effects of the integrase were rare (Results).</p><p>We have added information on coverage for each population in Supplementary files 2 and 3, and indicated average sequence coverage in the Materials and methods. We also added a sentence about our lower bound for rearrangement detection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Explain better Figure 3—figure supplement 2, showing the crucial control where PCRs confirm data from Illumina short read sequencing on whole populations. A schematic figure of each combination of cassettes, primer positions, and expected band length combined with proper lane descriptions should be prepared in a revised version of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised this important supplementary figure showing confirmatory data along the lines suggested by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors argue that intI1 has a bias towards &quot;copy and paste&quot; as opposed to &quot;cut and paste&quot; cassette rearrangements. Why use the term &quot;copy&quot; and how is this novel? In the two outcomes in integron structure, the cassette is excised (cut) from the ancestral integron before it is inserted (paste) into either arrays. Moreover, is there sufficient evidence to support the proposed &quot;copy and paste&quot; bias of IntI1? As the authors discuss thoroughly, the presence of multiple copies of the ancestral structure provides more &quot;ancestral&quot; integration targets for the excised cassettes.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that “copy and paste” and “cut and paste” reflect the fact that the same process (integron cassette excision and integration) can have two different outcomes, and we have clarified this point in the revised manuscript (Introduction and Discussion). We also agree with the reviewer that, all else being equal, the multi-copy nature of the integron should create a statistical bias towards observing “copy and paste”. Given the copy number of the integron in our system, we argue that our default expectation should be a 75% of “copy and paste” (Discussion). What is remarkable is that we observe “copy and paste” in 100% cases (n=14 of populations with a simple aadB insertion at x1024 MIC), suggesting an inherent bias towards “copy and paste”, as the chance of never seeing the insertion of the excised copy in the ancestral array in 14 populations is around (3/4)<sup>14</sup>~1.9%.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors exclude the alternative hypothesis that a second copy of aadB increased fitness as compared to a single copy (as expected from copy and paste). Measuring the fitness effects of different arrays (point 1) would address this point.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this helpful point, as a similar fitness between the two arrays is necessary in our reasoning. In the revised manuscript, we show that evolved integrons carrying duplicate copies of aadB from a “copy and paste” outcome have very similar MICs to the ancestral WTA5 array, which would have come from “cut and paste” outcome. This is not a perfect comparison, because the evolved “copy and paste” arrays also carry mutations in bla<sub>VEB-1</sub>, but is clear that any differences in resistance associated with “copy and paste” and “cut and paste” outcomes must be small (Figure 3E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors highlight that they found no evidence of deleterious off-target integrase effects. They suggest that integrase activity may purge deleterious chromosomal mutations and enable more targeted beneficial adaptive responses.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers’ point here is somewhat unclear to us. Deleterious mutations are purged from populations by selection, not integrase activity. Rather, we have tried to contrast stress-induced integrase activity, which generates large variation in a small region of the genome, with stress-induced mutagenesis, which creates variation across the entire genome (Discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors present cases where likely beneficial off target recombination events occurred. To what extent do the authors think the absence of deleterious off target effects is due to the experimental conditions (continuous increments in gentamicin concentrations combined with strong bottlenecks)?</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript we highlight that we only uncovered a single instance of potential off target recombination. Although theoretical considerations suggest that our experimental design may have limited our ability to detect rare neutral or mildly deleterious variants produced by off-target recombination, it also opened up the possibility for beneficial off-target variants to spread. Thus, it is unclear to what extent our experimental design biased our detection of off-target recombination, and we have emphasized the need to further understand the off-target effects of the integron (Discussion).</p></body></sub-article></article>
