et al., 2015; Scheuring et al., 2016; Dünser et al., 2019). Despite its importance for cell size determination in plants, very little is known about the mechanisms that define vacuolar size. Here, we show that the cellular and vacuolar size expansions are coordinated. By developing a pharmacological tool, we enabled the investigation of membrane delivery to the vacuole during cellular expansion. Our data reveal that endocytic membrane sorting from the plasma membrane to the vacuole is enhanced in the course of rapid root cell expansion. While this ‘compromise’ mechanism may theoretically at first decelerate cell surface enlargements, it fuels vacuolar expansion and, thereby, ensures the coordinated augmentation of vacuolar occupancy in dynamically expanding plant cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>small molecules</kwd><kwd>vacuole</kwd><kwd>plasma membrane</kwd><kwd>cell elongation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P 33044</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kleine-Vehn</surname><given-names>Jürgen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>470007283</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kleine-Vehn</surname><given-names>Jürgen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>CIBSS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EXC-2189</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kleine-Vehn</surname><given-names>Jürgen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>639478-AuxinER</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kleine-Vehn</surname><given-names>Jürgen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic (European Regional Development Fund-Project &quot;Plants as a tool for sustainable global development&quot;</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_019/0000827</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Novák</surname><given-names>Ondřej</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>426849454</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rodriguez-Franco</surname><given-names>Marta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001822</institution-id><institution>Austrian Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DOC fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dünser</surname><given-names>Kai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cellular and vacuolar size expansion are coordinated.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Animals and plants take many shapes and come in great diversity of sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Marshall et al., 2012</xref>). During cellular expansion, the surface area to intracellular volume ratio gets smaller and if cells grow beyond a critical limit, the surface of the plasma membrane may cease to accommodate cellular needs. Cells typically remain, hence, relatively small or eventually induce membrane furcation to enlarge the cellular surface. Compared to animals, plant cells can dramatically increase their size without the apparent need for surface furcation. The vacuole, occupying up to 90% of a cellular volume, is the biggest organelle in plants and its size correlates with and determines the cell size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Owens and Poole, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berger et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Löfke et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Scheuring et al., 2016</xref>). The size of the vacuole increases during cell expansion and vacuolar morphology is a reliable intracellular read-out for cellular expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dünser et al., 2019</xref>). The dynamic regulation of vacuolar size allows plant cells to expand with little increase of the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dünser et al., 2019</xref>), maintaining a favorable cell surface to cytosol ratio during growth. Despite its anticipated importance for fast cellular expansion, very little is known about how cells dynamically scale and coordinate its vacuolar size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dünser and Kleine-Vehn, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Krüger and Schumacher, 2018</xref>). Vacuolar soluble <italic>N</italic>-ethylmaleimide-sensitive-factor attachment receptors (SNAREs) reliant membrane remodeling as well as actin/myosin-dependent vacuolar constrictions define the auxin-dependent vacuolar occupancy of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Löfke et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Scheuring et al., 2016</xref>). The vacuolar SNARE complex, consisting of R-SNARE VAMP711, Qa-SNARE SYP22, Qb-SNARE VTI11, as well as Qc-SNAREs SYP51 and SYP52, regulates hetero- and homotypic membrane fusion at the tonoplast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fujiwara et al., 2014</xref>). Despite our molecular knowledge on vesicle trafficking toward the vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Krüger and Schumacher, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kang et al., 2022</xref>), very little is known about the dynamics of membrane delivery to the vacuole and its implication for cellular expansion.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In this project, we hypothesized that the interference with vacuolar SNAREs could aid us to visualize the rate and importance of membrane delivery to the vacuole. Mutations in the vacuolar SNARE subunit <italic>VTI11</italic> leads to strongly affected, roundish, and partially fragmented vacuoles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yano et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zheng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Löfke et al., 2015</xref>). Despite the strongly affected vacuolar morphology, the root length, as well as the size of fully elongated epidermal cells of untreated <italic>vti11</italic> mutants, were hardly distinguishable from wild-type seedlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A-D</xref>). This finding seemingly questions the contribution of vacuolar SNARE-dependent membrane fusions at the tonoplast for cellular expansion. Considering that the space-filling function of the vacuole defines cell size determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dünser et al., 2019</xref>), we next analyzed the contribution of <italic>VTI11</italic> for vacuolar occupancy of the cell, using confocal z-stack imaging and 3D renderings of epidermal atrichoblast cell files in the meristematic and elongation zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Although <italic>vti11</italic> mutant vacuoles are morphologically distinct from wild-type vacuoles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yano et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zheng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Löfke et al., 2015</xref>), their vacuolar occupancy of epidermal root cells was not distinguishable from wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). This finding suggests that redundancy may ensure the space-filling function of the <italic>vti11</italic> mutant vacuole and, thereby, likely safeguards cell expansion.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Vacuolar occupancy of the cell defines cell expansion.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images (scale bars: 0.5 cm) and (<bold>B</bold>) quantification of the main root length of 6-day-old Col-0 (n=36) and <italic>vti11</italic> seedlings (n=32).

In order to overcome genetic redundancy as well as lethality in the crucial control of vesicle trafficking toward the vacuole, we conducted a small molecule screen with the aim to identify compounds impacting on SNARE-dependent delivery of vesicles to the vacuole. For our primary screen, we germinated seedlings constitutively expressing the vacuolar R-SNARE marker pUBQ10::YFP-VAMP711 in growth medium supplemented with bioactive chemicals from a library of 360 compounds, which likely affect cell expansion in planta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Drakakaki et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We subsequently employed a fluorescence binocular to identify compounds that intensified the YFP-VAMP711 signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In a secondary, CLSM (confocal laser scanning microscopy)-based validation screen, we recorded vacuolar morphology changes in the samples treated with the compounds in comparison to solvent (control) treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Due to the possibly hydrolyzable acylhydrazone bond in VAC1, we wondered whether VAC1 could be potentially metabolized in planta into some of its sub-structures or other metabolic products. VAC1 can be synthesized from 2,4-dibromo-5-hydroxybenzaldehyde and phenylacetic acid (PAA) hydrazide, but the application of these substances (here referred to as precursors) did not cause any alterations to vacuolar morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>). We also analyzed the potential VAC1 conversion to PAA, because it is a naturally occurring compound with low auxin activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abe et al., 1974</xref>). The ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-selected ion recording-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-SIR-MS) analysis however did not detect PAA in VAC1-treated seedlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B-D</xref>).</p><p>We conclude that VAC1 is not detectably converted to PAA under our conditions. On the other hand, in VAC1-treated samples, the UHPLC-UV-MS analysis revealed three additional peaks for potential VAC1 metabolites (M1-M3) with a retention time of 4.37, 5.26, and 5.39 min for M1, M2, and M3, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3E-F</xref>). High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) identified these metabolites based on exact mass determination and characteristic distribution of bromine isotopes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3G</xref>). Metabolite M1 was predicted to be the hydroxylated form (VAC-OH, Rt 4.37 min, [M-H<sup>-</sup>]: 424.9129 Da, calculated elemental composition C<sub>15</sub>H<sub>11</sub>Br<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) and the other two derivatives relate to glycosylated forms. The detected compound M2 likely represented VAC1-3-<italic>O</italic>-glucoside (VAC1-Glc, Rt 5.26 min, [M-H<sup>-</sup>]: 570.9706 Da, C<sub>21</sub>H<sub>2</sub>1Br<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>) and M3 was identified as VAC1-3-O-6-<italic>O</italic>-acetylglucoside (VAC1-AcGlc, Rt 5.39 min, C<sub>23</sub>H<sub>2</sub>3Br<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>, [M-H<sup>-</sup>]: 612.9805 Da) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3G</xref>). Using UHPLC–UV (λ<sub>max</sub> = 291 nm for all compounds), we revealed VAC1-AcGlc (56.3% ± 0.8%) as the most abundant metabolite, followed by VAC1-Glc (31.3% ± 0.4%) and VAC1 (12.4% ± 0.6%), while the UV signal of hydroxylated VAC1-OH (&lt;0.1%) was close to the detection limit of the photodiode array detector used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3H</xref>). This set of data shows that a substantial amount of VAC1 undergoes glycosylation in planta, which could affect its activity in long-term experiments.</p><p>Next, we used structurally related derivatives of VAC1, termed VAC1-analogue (VAC1A), to further address whether the entity of VAC1 is required for its effects on vacuolar morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A</xref>). At the concentration and treatment time used for the subcellular effect of VAC1 (10 µM for 2.5 hr), solely VAC1A4, which displays an additional hydroxy group, induced severe vacuolar morphology defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B</xref>). The cellular effects of VAC1A4 were, however, visually distinct from VAC1. While short-term (2.5 hr) VAC1A4-treated cells appeared viable (based on the intact extracellular propidium iodide [PI] staining) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B</xref>), the main root growth did not resume after wash-out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4C</xref>), indicating some degree of toxicity. On the other hand, interference with either the phenyl group or the functional groups of the 2,4-dibromo-5-hydroxybenzaldehyde reduced the in planta activity and/or stability of VAC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B</xref>). At higher concentrations (25 and 50 µM), VAC1A2 and VAC1A5 also impacted to some degree on vacuolar morphology, while VAC1A1 and VAC1A3 appeared largely inactive in regard to vacuolar morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B</xref>). These results imply that the entity of VAC1 (phenyl- as well as the benzaldehyde rings) contributes to its effect on vacuolar morphology.</p><p>Next, we addressed the subcellular effects of VAC1 on the endomembrane system. When compared to YFP-VAMP711, we observed similar VAC1 effects on vacuolar morphology and strong aster-like protein accumulation of <italic>pUBQ10::pHGFP-VTI11</italic>- and <italic>pSYP22::SYP22-GFP</italic>- (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This finding suggests that VAC1 affects the distribution of vacuolar SNARE complex components. VAC1 also induced similar ectopic accumulation of vacuolar membrane marker VHA-a3-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>), suggesting that other tonoplast proteins are not excluded from the region of aster-like aggregations and that these structures are part of the tonoplast. To obtain a better understanding of the VAC1-reliant subcellular defects, we subsequently performed electron microscopy. When compared to control treatments, VAC1 induced ectopic extensions of the vacuole, which were reminiscent to the before mentioned aster-like structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>). In addition, we observed VAC1-dependent clusters of vesicles in close proximity to the malformed vacuole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), possibly visualizing defective vesicle delivery to the vacuole. To address whether VAC1 disrupts vesicle trafficking to the vacuole, we next employed the styryl dye FM4-64 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Vida and Emr, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Scheuring et al., 2015</xref>). The endocytic tracer FM4-64 initially labels the plasma membrane and is rapidly internalized following the endocytic pathway, eventually staining the vacuolar membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ueda et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Scheuring et al., 2015</xref>). Tonoplast labelling with FM4-64 was observed within 3 hr following the pulse staining in mock-treated seedlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Strikingly, staining of the vacuolar membrane was absent in VAC1-treated samples and instead FM4-64 accumulated in roundish structures (VAC1 bodies) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This set of data demonstrates that VAC1 treatments prevent the fusion of FM4-64-positive endocytic vesicles to the central vacuole.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>VAC1 interferes with vesicle trafficking to the vacuole.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Tonoplast and plasma membrane of late meristematic atrichoblast cells were visualized with FM4-64 (magenta) and pUBQ10::NPSN12-YFP (gray), respectively.

When compared to the ectopic FM4-64 accumulations, the examined lines showed comparably weak, but clearly detectable VAC1-induced aggregation of the fluorescently tagged proteins, which were absent in the solvent control treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This finding corroborates our assumption that VAC1 interferes with vesicle trafficking to the vacuole. On the other hand, VAC1 did not visibly affect clathrin light chain marker CLC-GFP and F-actin marker Lifeact-venus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Similarly, early and late endosome marker lines, such as GOT1-YFP (WAVE18Y), VHA-a1-GFP, and RABF2A-YFP (RHA1), were not disrupted upon VAC1 administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This set of data suggests that early vesicle sorting toward the vacuole is likely not disturbed, but stalls in close proximity to the vacuole.</p><p>To further assess VAC1-sensitive vesicle trafficking, we initially used brefeldin A (BFA), which is a specific inhibitor of ARF-GEFs (ADP-ribosylation factor – guanine-nucleotide exchange factors) and blocks endocytic trafficking toward the vacuole at the level of the trans-Golgi network (TGN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kleine-Vehn et al., 2008</xref>). The VAC1-induced accumulation of vacuolar SNARE SYP21-GFP surrounded the FM4-64 accumulation in VAC1 bodies, which was significantly reduced in BFA co-treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>). We, hence, conclude that VAC1 affects vacuolar vesicle trafficking downstream of the TGN. To further decipher the VAC1 effect downstream of the TGN, we next addressed its dependency on the CLASS C CORE VACUOLE/ENDOSOME TETHERING (CORVET) and homotypic fusion and protein sorting (HOPS) machineries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Takemoto et al., 2018</xref>), because these membrane tethering complexes supply the vacuolar SNAREs with heterotypic (endosomal derived) and homotypic (vacuole derived) membranes, respectively. The dexamethasone (DEX)-inducible amiRNA lines that target either the CORVET-specific subunit VPS3 or the HOPS-specific subunit VPS39 enable the selective repression of the CORVET and HOPS complex, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Takemoto et al., 2018</xref>). The transcriptional repression of CORVET or HOPS inhibits root growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-C</xref>). In agreement, seedlings germinated on VAC1 containing media also displayed reduced main root growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B, F, G</xref>), suggesting that vesicle trafficking to the vacuole contributes to root growth. Homotypic membrane fusion unlikely contributes to the VAC1 effect, because VPS39 depleted roots remained fully sensitive to VAC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-C</xref>). In contrast, the repression of CORVET function induced a partially resistant root growth to VAC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>), suggesting that defects in heterotypic vesicle trafficking toward the vacuole contribute to the VAC1-dependent interference with root growth. To visualize vacuolar morphology after CORVET repression, we used the pUBQ10::YFP-VAMP711 marker crossed to the DEX-inducible VPS3 amiRNA line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Takemoto et al., 2018</xref>).

We accordingly conclude that VAC1 interferes with the redundant, SNARE-dependent membrane delivery to the vacuole. Accordingly, we propose that VTI11 is not the sole or main target of VAC1, assuming functional redundancy at the level of vacuolar SNAREs and/or other accessory molecular targets.</p><p>Considering that VAC1 interferes with vacuolar SNARE-dependent vesicle trafficking to the vacuole, this pharmacological tool subsequently allowed us to address the importance of vesicle trafficking toward the vacuole in elongating cells. We next utilized VAC1 to visualize the rate of endocytic trafficking to the vacuole in early and late meristematic as well as early and late elongation zones. We therefore used plasma membrane marker BRI1-GFP and FM4-64-based pulse labelling of plasma membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A-D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–I</xref>).

This finding implies either meristematic and elongating cells to differ in endocytic membrane trafficking or alternatively inhomogeneous VAC1 activity/uptake. To further address the possibility of altered endomembrane sorting during cellular elongation, we similarly used the well characterized inhibitor BFA to block membrane recycling and sorting toward the vacuole at the level of the TGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kleine-Vehn et al., 2008</xref>).

Hence, we next performed whole-cell 3D reconstructions of early as well as late meristematic cells and observed that these cells displayed roughly a doubling of surface area and volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>). Compared to the cellular size increase, the volume of FM4-64 containing BFA bodies showed a much stronger relative size increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>). Considering that the volume of the BFA compartment is filled with small vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Geldner et al., 2001</xref>), we anticipate that cellular surface enlargement alone does not fully account for the observed alterations in intracellular dynamics. We, hence, rather conclude that endocytic membrane sorting toward the vacuole undergoes reprogramming in elongating cells.</p><p>Next, we tested whether membrane delivery from the plasma membrane to the vacuole is enhanced during cellular elongation when we do not apply vesicle trafficking inhibitors. To this end, we quantified the co-localization of FM4-64 with the tonoplast marker YFP-VAMP711 in meristematic and elongating cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Three hours after the relatively equal pulse staining of FM4-64 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>), the co-localization between FM4-64 and YFP-VAMP711 at the vacuolar membrane was significantly lower in the meristematic zone when compared to the elongation zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H, I</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that endocytic membrane sorting from the plasma membrane toward the vacuole undergoes significant rate changes during cellular elongation.</p><p>Based on our data, it is conceivable that endocytic trafficking impacts cell expansion via its contribution to vacuolar size. To approach this, we initially quantified cell and vacuole surface areas of (early and late) meristematic and (early and late) elongating cells using 3D reconstructions. We found that the area increase of both cell and vacuole surface is remarkably similar during the course of cell expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> left panel, B). To address this coordinative mechanism, we applied VAC1 and employed whole-cell 3D reconstructions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> right panel). Within only 2.5 hr, VAC1 induced an already detectable imbalance of cell and tonoplast surface size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). This result indicates that intensified membrane delivery is not only required at the plasma membrane, but similarly occurs at the tonoplast during cellular expansion. Accordingly, not only actin- and myosin-dependent vacuolar unfolding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Scheuring et al., 2016</xref>), but also membrane delivery greatly contributes to vacuolar size control.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Coordinated surface increase at plasma membrane and tonoplast during cell elongation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) 3D reconstructions of propidium iodide (PI)-stained cell walls (gray) and BCECF-stained vacuoles (magenta) in the early and late meristem and in the early and late elongation zone.

To address this, we used VAC1 to temporally block the vesicle fusion to the tonoplast during cell expansion. Accordingly, we mounted Col-0 seedlings in VAC1 or solvent (control) containing slide chambers and immediately inspected root growth under these conditions using confocal microscopy. VAC1 induced without a further delay a slower root growth (tip displacement) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and E</xref>), which correlated with reduced cellular expansion rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F and G</xref>) when compared to the solvent control. Accordingly, we conclude that vesicle trafficking to the vacuole is required for fast cellular expansion rates. In summary, our set of data suggests that endocytic trafficking toward the vacuole coordinates cellular and vacuolar surface increase, enabling rapid cell enlargements in plants.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we isolated and characterized VAC1, which interferes with the final steps of membrane delivery to the tonoplast. The molecular target of VAC1 remains currently unknown, but the structure-activity assessment suggests that the entirety of the compound is contributing to its activity, possibly insulating a complex mode of VAC1 action. Our data suggest that VAC1 disrupts SNARE-dependent, heterotypic vesicle delivery to the tonoplast. It is tempting to speculate that VAC1 interferes with possibly several subunits of the vacuolar SNARE complex or yet to be identified accessory proteins. Accordingly, in-depth characterization of the mode of VAC1 action could reveal intermolecular mechanisms of vesicle fusion at the tonoplast.</p><p>We used VAC1 to visualize the rate of vesicle trafficking toward the vacuole. Mechanistically, our data suggests that endocytic trafficking is accelerated at the onset of elongation, suggesting that plasma membrane-derived vesicles at least in part fuel the size increase of the vacuole. We propose that cell and vacuolar surface enlargements are thereby coordinated and pinpoint the importance of vacuolar size control for cell expansion and overall root growth. It remains to be seen how plant cells molecularly reprogram and monitor the rate of endocytic trafficking for ensuring fast cellular elongation. Not only VAC1 but also BFA treatments visualized higher rates of endocytic membrane accumulation in expanding cells. We, therefore, assume that the proposed reprogramming of membrane sorting occurs upstream or at the level of the TGN. The accelerated endocytic membrane flow toward the vacuole could relate to rate changes in endocytosis, but alternatively also the endosomal sorting machinery could shift the balance between endocytic recycling (back to the plasma membrane) and membrane drainage toward the vacuole.</p><p>The enhanced delivery of plasma membrane-derived membranes toward the vacuole during cell expansion seems somewhat counterintuitive, because it appears to slow down the theoretically possible cell surface increase. In addition, a high degree of membrane recycling at the plasma membrane is needed to fuel the high demand for cell wall synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Robert et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ketelaar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ebine and Ueda, 2015</xref>) and, hence, draining membranes toward the vacuole may even constrain the crucial cell wall remodeling during cell expansion. On the other hand, this vesicle trafficking-based compromise model for enlargements of plant cells allows the steady increase in vacuolar occupancy in dynamically expanding cells, which enables growth with little de novo synthesis of cytosolic components. This coordinated membrane flow mechanism is able to synchronize cell and vacuolar surface increase, which is likely the reason why plant cells excel in the speed of cellular expansion.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant material and growth conditions</title><p>Experiments were carried out in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (Col-0 ecotype).

Both analytes were detected by selected ion recording (SIR) using the positive and negative electrospray modes (ESI<sup>+</sup> and ESI<sup>-</sup>) as follows: VAC1 detected as [M+H]<sup>+</sup>, m/z 411.0, and PAA as [M-H]<sup>-</sup>, m/z 135.0. The MS settings were optimized as follows: source temperature, 120°C; desolvation temperature, 600°C; capillary voltage, 0.8 kV. Chromatograms were processed by MassLynx V4.2 software (Waters) and quantification was performed from external calibration using a recovery factor. Additionally, M1-M3 metabolites of VAC1 were detected using a full-scan mode (m/z 50–1000) operated in ESI<sup>-</sup> with post-data acquisition extraction of ion chromatograms for m/z 425.0, 571.0, and 613.0 for M1, M2, and M3, respectively. To determine the distribution of VAC1 metabolites, the UV chromatograms were extracted for λ<sub>max</sub> (291 nm) and the percentage representation of metabolites in plant extracts was determined by the integration of peak areas in respective retention times (M1, 4.37 min; M2, 5.26 min; M3, 5.39 min; VAC1, 6.65 min).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>UHPLC-HRMS</title><p>Samples of DMSO- and VAC1-treated plants were prepared as described above (UHPLC-SIR-MS). Plant extracts (2 µl) were injected onto a Kinetex C18 column and separated using chromatographic conditions as described above. The HRMS analysis was achieved by a hybrid Q-TOF tandem mass spectrometer Synapt G2-Si (Waters MS Technologies) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Buček et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, the effluents were introduced into the HRMS instrument (ESI<sup>-</sup>; capillary voltage, 0.75 kV; source offset, 30 V; desolvation/source temperature, 550/120°C; desolvation/cone gas flow, 1000/50 l·hr<sup>-1</sup>; LM/HM resolution, 2.8/14.75; ion energy 1/2, 0.5/1.0 V; entrance/exit voltages, 0.5 V; collision energy, 6 eV). The determination of exact mass was performed by the external calibration using lock spray technology and a mixture of leucine/encephalin (1 ng·μl<sup>-1</sup>) in an acetonitrile and water (1:1) solution with 0.1% formic acid as a reference. Data acquisition was performed in full-scan mode (50–1000 Da) with a scan time of 0.5 s and all analytes were detected as [M-H]<sup>-</sup> in the MS spectrum. All data were processed using MassLynx 4.1 software (Waters). The accurate masses of VAC1 metabolites were calculated and then used to determine the elemental composition of the analytes with a fidelity ranging from 1.6 to 2.6 ppm. The VAC1 metabolites were identified based on correlation of the theoretical monoisotopic weights of deprotonated forms [M-H]<sup>-</sup> and detected accurate masses of each precursor of M1-M3 as well as based on the presence of two bromine stable isotopes (79Br and 81Br) in HRMS spectrum resulting in the characteristic isotope pattern of dibromo derivatives.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Phenotype analysis</title><p>Vacuolar occupancy and vacuole surface area as well as cell surface area and BFA body volume were quantified in 6-day-old seedlings. For 3D reconstructions of cells, confocal images were processed using Imaris (vacuolar occupancy of cells, BFA bodies, vacuole, and cell surface) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dünser et al., 2019</xref>). BCECF staining was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Scheuring et al., 2015</xref>). For the analysis of main root growth, 6-day-old seedlings were used, unless indicated otherwise. For the analysis of main root growth of amiR <italic>vps3</italic> and amiR <italic>vps39</italic> seedlings were grown for 4 days before transfer to DMSO, DEX, VAC1, or DEX + VAC1 and then grown for additional 3 days.

GFP and BCECF were excited at 488 nm (fluorescence emission: 500–550 nm), YFP and FM4-64 at 514 nm (fluorescence emission YFP: 525–578 nm; fluorescence emission FM4-64: 670–790 nm), and PI at 561 nm (fluorescence emission: 644–753 nm). Roots were mounted in PI solution (0.02 mg/ml) for the counterstaining of cell walls. Z-stacks were recorded with a step size of 420 nm (for 3D reconstructions) or 1.5 µm (for maximum projections of VAC1 bodies).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>3D reconstruction of cells</title><p>Imaris 8.4.0 and 9.0 were used for the reconstruction of cell, vacuole, and BFA body volumes. Based on the PI channel, every third slice of the z-stack was utilized to define the cell borders using the isoline, magic wand, or manual (distance) drawing functions in the manual surface creation tool. After creating the surface corresponding to the entire cell, a masked channel (based on BCECF or FM4-64) was generated by setting the voxels outside the surface to 0. Subsequently, a second surface (based on the masked BCECF or FM4-64 channel) was generated automatically with the smooth option checked. Surface detail was set to identical values within each region (early and late meristem and early and late elongation zone) to ensure comparability of obtained surface area values. The obtained surface was visually compared to the underlying BCECF or FM4-64 channel and, if necessary, the surface was fitted to the underlying signal by adjusting the absolute intensity threshold slider. Finally, volumes and surface areas of both surfaces were extracted from the statistics window.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Sample preparation for electron microscopy</title><p>Around 3 mm of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> root tips were sectioned and immediately submerged in fixative solution containing 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 4% p-formaldehyde in MTSB buffer. Samples were vacuum infiltrated for 15 min at room temperature, fixed for 4 hr at room temperature, and kept in fixative overnight at 4°C. After five times washing (10 min each) in MTSB buffer, samples were post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in H<sub>2</sub>O on ice for 4 hr with shaking. Samples were washed with water four times (5 min each), and in bloc stained for 2 hr with 2% uranyl acetate in water. After washing three times with water (5 min each), samples were dehydrated in EtOH graded series (30%–50%−70%–80%−90%–95%, 15 min each). Fully dehydration was achieved by incubating the samples twice in 100% EtOH for 30 min followed by incubation in acetone twice (30 min each). Samples were gradually embedded in resin by incubating them in acetone: Agar 100 mixtures (3:1, 1:1, 1:3–8 hr each) and finally in pure Agar 100 resin three times (8 hr each).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Takashi Ueda (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers agree that the paper will be interesting to a wide audience, but have highlighted three key points that are essential to address with revisions:</p><p>1. Conduct live cell imaging of endocytic markers (e.g. CME components) and/or an additional cargo to support the claim that endocytic rate is different between meristematic and elongating cells, according to suggestions made by Reviewers 1 and 2.</p><p>2. Revise the discussion around Figures 5 and 6 to clarify why cell surface area is being compared to BFA body volume (as Reviewer 2 suggests) and/or provide a more rigorous analysis (as Reviewers 1 and 3 suggest).</p><p>3. Revise the results and discussion surrounding the WM experiment as indicated by Reviewers 2 and 3. An additional PI3K inhibitor (e.g. LY294002) and/or treatment with a PI4K inhibitor (e.g. PAO) as a negative control would further support these claims.</p><p>The reviewers have also raised a number of additional points that are worth consideration, and their reviews are included below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. From the perspective of cell wall synthesis, it's unsurprising that increased endocytic trafficking is correlated with cell expansion since the volume of the cell wall must increase much greater than the surface area of the plasma membrane during elongative growth. I think the discussion could be improved by incorporating this idea, e.g. the work of Anne-Mie Emons (Ketelaar et al. 2008).</p><p>2. FM4-64 quantification is difficult because it is challenging to ensure that uptake is equal across cells. For example, I am surprised that so many cells in the meristematic zone showed R = 0 (data points at the bottom of the boxes in Figure 5I), indicating that even after 2 hours, no FM4-64 has reached the tonoplast. This is especially puzzling because the authors have presented images of meristematic cells with clear FM4-64 labelling of the tonoplast in other figures (e.g. Figure 3A, Figure 5G). What do the authors speculate is happening in these cases?</p><p>3. Does the difference in &quot;endocytic rate&quot; implied by more intense FM4-64 staining and larger BFA bodies in the elongation zone, compared to the meristematic zone really imply more endocytosis? Isn't there also more FM4-64 available since there is more surface area to the cell? Then the BFA bodies might appear brighter or larger simply because there is more dye in them? This claim probably requires secondary evidence, such as quantification of density and dynamics of a clathrin marker in these different cell types, or pulse-chase of a marker (e.g. photoactivatable or photoconvertible). In particular, the authors' hypothesis makes an easily-testable prediction: that endocytic events should be more frequent at the PM in elongation-zone cells, compared to the meristematic zone, even after accounting for the change in surface area. The authors already have a CME marker, so this is a straight-forward experiment for them to conduct.</p><p>4. It is confusing to compare surface area of a large object (the cell) to volume of a small object (the BFA body) as in Figure 5F. There is a crossover point in surface area-to-volume ratios at which the ratio is &gt;1 for a small object and &lt;1 for a large object and I think this graph oversimplifies this important point. The volume of the BFA body is small relative to the surface area of the cell, so the FM4-64 signal in the BFA body is concentrated, compared to the signal at the cell surface. I suggest the authors present these data some other way (e.g. plot surface area vs volume for BFA bodies and cells at different stages) to better illustrate this. I also think that the results and discussion surrounding this figure should be revised to clearly articulate this issue.</p><p>5. For the wide readership of <italic>eLife</italic>, it would be great to see whether VAC1 has any activity on vacuolar shape in other plants, or whether it has any effects on the endomembrane system in mammalian or fungal cells.</p><p>6. After introducing the vti11 phenotype, the authors conclude that &quot;compensatory mechanisms&quot; ensure vacuolar occupancy of the cell and &quot;safeguard cell expansion&quot; however vti11 vti12 double mutants are lethal, indicating that genetic redundancy, not compensatory mechanisms, are at work. Please correct.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– A marker-assisted comparison between VAC1 and Concanamycin A might be useful here as the latter compound also interferes with vacuolar membrane fusion, albeit likely less specific.</p><p>– For some of the cell types analyzed in Figure 1F, the numbers are a bit low. Some additional quantifications could be performed here to strengthen the data.</p><p>– On line 89, I would rephrase the striking effect of VAC1 on vacuolar morphology as several other VACs have different, yet equally striking effects.</p><p>– The viability of the cells upon treatment with VAC1A4 would be better addressed by FDA rather than with PI.</p><p>– On line 129, as it was not tested, the authors could include the possibility that the alternative compounds do not have a similar effect because they might be less stable that the original VAC1.</p><p>– On line 134, the statement that VAC1 interferes with the localization of the SNARE complex is odd. It affects vacuolar morphology, hence obviously it affects vacuolar SNARE localization. The authors might want to rephrase this by saying that VAC1 does not specifically affect one of the components of the SNARE complex as they observe similar localizations for various subunits of this complex.</p><p>– On line 136, it is strange to use Scheuring et al., 2015 as initial reference for the styryl dye FM4-64.</p><p>– On line 144, the assessment of the trafficking of PM resident proteins to the vacuole might be better visualized using dark-treatment to visualize differential vacuolar GFP accumulation.</p><p>– On line 150, the conclusion that VAC1 does not affect endocytic trafficking or actin dynamics could be better addressed using dynamic imaging e.g. using TIRF or via rainbow-color overlays of different timepoints of confocal slices for example.</p><p>– In Figure 3F, optimally, the quantifications could be normalized instead of measured by mean grey values. The PM signal appears very different between VAC1 and VAC1 + BFA. Also, the results of VAC1 + Wm are puzzling, the PM staining of FM in panel G is very different from the one in panel E and the disappearance of BRI1 from the TGN upon the combined treatment of VAC1 and Wm is not addressed. For clarity, I would remove the Wm data as the observations cannot be accurately explained for the moment and no clear conclusion can be drawn from this.</p><p>– In supplemental Figure 5, it is unclear to me why the emphasis lies on transversal PM.</p><p>– On line 217 and following, the authors propose enhanced endocytic trafficking correlating with elongation based on the size of VAC1 compartments and BFA bodies, which are larger in elongating cells versus meristematic cells. This conclusion assumes that there are no differences between these cells in terms of compound penetrance or the differential activity of trafficking pathways other than endocytic that could affect the size of the observed bodies. This assumption could be mentioned/discussed. In order to provide stronger support for their claim that endocytic trafficking is enhanced in elongating cells versus meristematic cells, time lapse imaging of roots using PM resident markers transiently expressed via a heat shock promotor or constitutively expressed following CHX could be considered.</p><p>– On line 229-230, the authors might want to explain better their choice to measure area instead of volume for the non-expert reader.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Figure 3G.

We personally reached out to the first author of the mentioned publication and discussed this aspect. Based on the published assumption, plants have a substantial need for membrane trafficking at the plasma membrane, which is likely maintained by membrane recycling between the plasma membrane and the trans golgi network/early endosome (facilitated by constitutive endocytosis and exocytosis). Accordingly, vesicle sorting to the vacuole drains membranes away from the recycling pathway, possibly affecting not only surface enlargements, but also cell wall synthesis during cellular elongation. We thank you for raising this aspect and we have modified the discussion along these lines.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

The initial FM4-64 labelling of the plasma membrane was relatively constant along the root zonation (see Figure 5—figure supplement 1 A-B).</p><p>The degree of FM4-64 labeling may slightly fluctuate in individual cells (at/before onset of elongation) and experimental conditions, but was overall consistent in all our experiments. We reproducibly observe enhanced FM4-64 accumulation in BFA and VAC1 bodies in elongating cells. This effect could relate to regulations of endocytosis at the plasma membrane and/or altered membrane sorting at the trans golgi network. Both endocytosis and endosomal sorting independently contribute to the rate of endocytic membrane trafficking to the vacuole. We feel this aspect was unclear and we improved the discussion on this matter in the revised version of our manuscript.</p><p>Figure 3A display epidermal cells at the onset of elongation (note that cells are slightly longer than wide) in the transition zone of wild type seedlings, displaying FM4-64 labeling at the tonoplast. Figure 5G shows FM4-64 labeling in the transgenic pUBQ10:YFP-VAMP711 line, which may differ in some aspects compared to wild type, but does allow the assessment of colocalization. While most cells show some degree of FM4-64 at the tonoplast in late meristematic cells, we indeed captured early meristematic cells with less FM4-64 tonoplast labeling (Figure 5G). In contrast, elongating cells always showed a high degree of colocalization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

We realized that the term endocytic trafficking towards the vacuole can be misleading. The degree of membrane flow from the plasma membrane to the vacuole indeed depends on endocytosis, but is also defined by sorting endosomes, which gate recycling of membranes back to the plasma membrane and further endocytic membrane trafficking to the vacuole. Accordingly, enhanced endocytic trafficking to the vacuole could be achieved independent of the endocytosis rates. We have improved the discussion on this matter and hope to have thereby clarified this aspect. While our work suggests a reprogramming of vesicle trafficking events at the onset of elongation, upcoming work should in depth address the underlying molecular mechanism. Considering its potential complexity, this aspect is however beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><p>If the endocytosis rate remains constant, a cellular surface increase could indeed lead to higher uptake of endocytic dyes. The elucidation of the cellular surface is a read-out for the amount of plasma membranes. In contrast, a BFA compartment is filled with secretory vesicles (with a diameter of below 0,1 µm; see Geldner et al., 2001) and hence the BFA body surface insufficiently quantifies these membranes. We hence addressed both the relative increase in cellular surface and volume between early and late meristematic cells. While these cells roughly doubled in size, particularly the BFA volume showed a much stronger relative increase. Accordingly, we assume that the increase in cell surface does not recapitulate the increases in vacuolar membrane trafficking, suggesting that vesicle trafficking undergoes reprogramming during cellular elongation. We however certainly do not rule out that the surface increase contributes to this mechanism. We improved the depiction and discussion of this set of data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

In both cases, the relative increase of the BFA compartment (surface and volume) exceeds the relative size increase of the cell. Considering the accumulation of the secretory vesicles in the BFA compartment, we propose that the relative increase in BFA compartment size is not a mere consequence of cell size increase. We improved the discussion surrounding this finding in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

The result presented in Figure 3G and H should be interpreted taking this effect of WM into authors' account.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with your concerns, which were also raised by reviewer 2. Considering that the interpretation of the data is troubling, we followed the suggestion of Reviewer 2 and removed the data in the revised version of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4C, G, and S4. The definition of &quot;relative growth&quot; is unclear. Is this a relative value of root lengths to the mean value of root length of control plants? If this is the case, variation in the control plants is not correctly reflected in the data. Authors should interpret the results based on Figure 4B and Figure 4G?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment. We adapted this analysis and displayed the variation of control plants in the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5A-D. It would be not appropriate to compare just the mean grey value to see an endocytic activity. The mean grey value could be higher in larger cells with a larger area of the PM even if the endocytic rate is constant between these cell types.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank you for this comment. We agree that an increase in endocytic membrane flow to the vacuole may not be dependent on an increase in endocytosis rate. We improved the discussion on this matter in the revised version of the manuscript. When compared to the cell size increase, we however observed accelerated size increase of BFA compartments during cellular enlargements, rather suggesting that a reprogramming of intracellular membrane trafficking contributes to this effect.
