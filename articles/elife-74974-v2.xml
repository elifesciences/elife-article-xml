RNA virus SARS-CoV-2, a global vaccination campaign is in progress to achieve the immunization of billions of people mainly with adenoviral vector- or mRNA-based vaccines, all of which encode the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. In some rare cases, cerebral venous sinus thromboses (CVST) have been reported as a severe side effect occurring 4–14 days after the first vaccination and were often accompanied by thrombocytopenia. Besides CVST, splanchnic vein thromboses (SVT) and other thromboembolic events have been observed. These events only occurred following vaccination with adenoviral vector-based vaccines but not following vaccination with mRNA-based vaccines. Meanwhile, scientists have proposed an immune-based pathomechanism and the condition has been coined vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT). Here, we describe an unexpected mechanism that could explain thromboembolic events occurring with DNA-based but not with RNA-based vaccines. We show that DNA-encoded mRNA coding for Spike protein can be spliced in a way that the transmembrane anchor of Spike is lost, so that nearly full-length Spike is secreted from cells. Secreted Spike variants could potentially initiate severe side effects when binding to cells via the ACE2 receptor. Avoiding such splicing events should become part of a rational vaccine design to increase safety of prospective vaccines.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>vaccines</kwd><kwd>RNA</kwd><kwd>splicing</kwd><kwd>splice variants</kwd><kwd>thrombosis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005687</institution-id><institution>Goethe University Corona Task Force</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marschalek</surname><given-names>Rolf</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The Spike gene expressed by the vector-based vaccine Vaxzevria bears the risk of cryptic splicing, which in turn may lead to cellular production of soluble, instead of membrane-anchored, Spike protein variants.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The COVID-19 pandemic, starting in the last months of 2019 in Wuhan (China) and caused by the RNA virus SARS-CoV-2, so far (January 4, 2022) has resulted in more than 293.0 million (Mio) infections and more than 5.46 Mio deaths (data source: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/">https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/</ext-link>). The world has faced the fastest development and production of vaccines ever, resulting in a total of four vaccines that have received conditional market authorizations by the regulatory bodies: the mRNA vaccines from BioNTech/Pfizer (BTN162b2/Comirnaty; EMA: 21.12.20) and Moderna (mRNA-1273/Spikevax; EMA: 6.1.21), as well as the adenoviral vector-based vaccines from AstraZeneca (AZD1222/ChAdOx1-S/Vaxzevria; EMA: 29.1.21) and Janssen (Ad26.COV2.S; EMA: 11.3.21). All four vaccines encode slightly different forms of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein, which mediates virus binding to the host cell membrane and entry via ACE2 and TMPRSS2, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hoffmann et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>While vaccination with BioNTech and Moderna mostly causes only mild and typical immediate vaccination side effects, severe side effects thromboses (ITP) or thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) were first observed with Vaxzevria in Europe (in March 2021). The most severe side effects entailed rare events of thrombocytopenia combined with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). The higher than expected occurrence of CVST led to a rapid suspension of the Vaxzevria vaccination campaign in several European countries (March 11–14, 2021: Denmark, several northern European countries, Thailand, Ireland; March 15, 2021: Germany, Italy, France, and Spain).</p><p>The latest data from the security surveillance of the Paul-Ehrlich-Institute in Germany (report dated from December 23, 2021; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pei.de/DE/newsroom/dossier/coronavirus/sicherheitsbericht-covid-19-impfstoffe-aktuell.html">https://www.pei.de/DE/newsroom/dossier/coronavirus/sicherheitsbericht-covid-19-impfstoffe-aktuell.html</ext-link>) revealed still a significant risk increase for the AstraZeneca vaccine compared to the other vaccines (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Thrombocytopenia and immunothrombocytopenia (ITP) have been observed in 314 cases after 96.6 Mio vaccination doses with Comirnaty (3.3 cases per Mio injections), in 28 cases with Spikevax after 10.5 Mio vaccination doses with Comirnaty (2.6 cases per Mio injections), in 269 with Vaxzevria after 12.7 Mio vaccination doses cases (21.2 cases per Mio injections), and in 23 cases with Ad26.COV2.S after 3.4 Mio vaccination doses cases (6.6 cases per Mio injections). Thrombosis-related death cases for these four vaccines were 74, 6, 81, and 12, respectively. This indicates that thromboembolic events associated with case mortality were in the range of 21.4–52% (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Safety data from the German Paul-Ehrlich Institute (PEI), dated from December 23, 2021.</title><p>All data for all four vaccines were directly retrieved from the security report.

These thromboembolic events in combination with thrombocytopenia share similarities with another condition, ‘heparin-induced thrombocytopenia’ (HIT). The term ‘vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia’ (VITT) was coined for this vaccine-induced condition, after finding out that autoantibodies against the platelet factor 4 (PF4) could be causally linked to it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Greinacher et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Greinacher et al., 2021a</xref>). However, despite intensive research activities by many laboratories, the underlying initiating mechanisms for the observed side events were not yet fully understood.</p><p>At the molecular delivery mechanism of the approved vaccines, there are fundamental differences between mRNA- and adenoviral vector-based vaccines. The mRNA vaccines encode, as the naming implies, the Spike sequence as a modified RNA sequence encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles. Upon intramuscular injection, the nanoparticles are taken up by the cells, where the mRNA cargo is released into the cytosol. Since both mRNA vaccines encode a signal peptide, the process of protein translation occurs at the rough endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) and results in membrane-anchored Spike proteins. Further post-translational modifications occur in the ER and Golgi apparatus (glycosylation) from where the Spike protein trimer is transported in vesicles to the outer cell membrane.</p><p>In contrast, adenoviral vector-based vaccines deliver the Spike sequence as a codon-optimized DNA sequence instead of a RNA sequence. Vaxzevria is based on a genetically modified chimpanzee adenovirus type Y25, while the Janssen vaccine is based on a human adenovirus type 26 (HAdV-D26), both of which are replication incompetent. Upon transduction of the host cell and disassembly of the vector particle, the linear double-stranded DNA is released and enters the nucleus. Subsequently, viral DNA-encoded genes become transcribed using the host cell transcription machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Doerfler and Böhm, 2003</xref>). In the nucleus and before the mRNA is exported to the cytosol for translation (see above), the resulting RNA molecule is subject to the same post-transcriptional RNA processing machinery as endogenous primary transcripts, including the possibility of splicing.</p><p>SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded RNA virus of the betacoronavirus family that naturally has a purely cytoplasmic replication cycle. Therefore, coronaviruses have not been exposed to any evolutionary pressure that would have an impact on biological processes taking place in the nucleus. Almost all nuclear-encoded genes contain introns that become eliminated from precursor RNA transcripts by the splice machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lee and Rio, 2015</xref>). Defined RNA consensus sequences are recognized by RNA/protein complexes (spliceosome), which consist of nearly 100 proteins and specific U-RNAs. Noteworthy, splice events are influenced by exonic splice enhancer sequences and exonic splice silencer sequences, which bind splice-activating or -suppressing proteins. During this evolutionary conserved splice process, a so-called ‘branch A’ nucleotide is performing a nucleophilic attack at a G•G-dinucleotide of the 5'-splice consensus sequence G•GUNNGU. The resulting 3'-OH of the final exonic G nucleotide then makes a second nucleophilic attack at the G•G-dinucleotide of the 3'-splice consensus sequence YYYYYCAG•G. To this end, two exons become fused, and the intronic sequence is being eliminated. For each gene, this process guarantees that all introns flanked by SD and SA sites are eliminated in order to produce the final mRNA that encodes a specific protein-coding sequence.</p><p>When using cloned cDNA in molecular biology or biotechnology, no intronic sequences are usually present, because cDNA synthesis is made from already spliced mRNA molecules. However, in case of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the cloned cDNA for the Spike open reading frame was not coming from a nuclear-encoded gene, rather from an RNA virus that replicates solely in the cytosol of infected cells. Therefore, such a cDNA exhibits potential SD and SA sites just by chance (~130 cryptic splice signal sequences in the total SARS-CoV-2 virus sequence), because no negative selection has ever taken place during the evolution of coronavirus to eliminate such sequences. Therefore, we hypothesized that nuclear splicing of DNA-encoded Spike RNA sequences might result in spliced, and thus, truncated Spike protein variants with unknown fate and function. As mentioned above, this type of splicing would be quite artificial, because an RNA virus does per se not contain any intronic sequences in its various open reading frames. Thus, all such splicing events are derived from the so-called cryptic splice sites. This is unrelated to the mechanism of alternative splicing, which could be functionally attributed to certain genes of our genome. Cryptic splicing occurs only if strong splice sites are present, and thus, these cryptic splice sites will be used equally in different cell types or tissues.</p><p>To address this question of cryptic splicing, we analyzed nuclearly transcribed wildtype and codon-optimized Spike genes in a specially designed splice reporter vector system. We also investigated splicing of Spike RNAs following transduction of representative cells with a Spike-expressing human adenovirus type 5 vector and the two approved adenoviral vector-based vaccines ChAdOx1-S and Ad26.COV2.S. Here, we show that splicing of DNA-encoded SARS-CoV-2 Spike RNA molecules takes place at positions as they were predicted by in silico analysis. These splice events resulted in Spike protein variants that lack the transmembrane (TM) anchor, thus may become secreted due to the nature of the secretory pathway. Codon optimization performed to enhance expression levels further augmented the abundance of splicing and was most prominently observed for the ChAdOx1-S vector. In addition, we analyzed the production of Spike protein and its secretion to the outside medium. Implications of our findings for the safety of vector-based vaccines and future consequences for the design of vector-based vaccines for RNA viruses will be discussed.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>In silico analyses reveal potential splice sites in adenoviral vector-encoded Spike sequences</title><p>The Spike open reading frame of the Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 isolate was tested for potential splice sites by using the available SpliceRover online tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Zuallaert et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, we used the online Alternative Splice Site Predictor (ASSP) tool to confirm the predicted splice sites (data not shown). Both servers identified several dozens of potential splice sites in the 3822 nucleotide long open reading frame of the Spike gene. Therefore, we decided to filter these hits by their individual scores to identify those, which were used with a higher likelihood (wildtype Spike gene: six splice donor [SD] sites, five splice acceptor [SA] sites, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Splice site prediction within the Spike open reading frames.</title><p>Splice site prediction was carried out by using SpliceRover.

vector systems. First, these were an experimental and codon-optimized variant of the original Wuhan sequence, cloned into a human adenovirus type five vector backbone (Ad5.S). Second, the Spike sequence of ChAdOx1-S was derived by sequencing of adenoviral DNA isolated from Vaxzevria, while, third, the Spike sequence of Ad26.COV2.S was obtained directly from Janssen (kindly provided by Roland Zahn). Analyses revealed that codon optimization resulted in an increased number of potential splice sites in all three adenoviral-encoded Spike sequences (Ad5.S: 12 SD sites, 10 SA sites; ChAdOx1-S: 13 SD and 5 SA sites, Ad26.COV2.S: 9 SD and 10 SA sites, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2B–D</xref>) compared to the open reading frame of the wildtype Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 Spike sequence.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Significant splicing of codon-optimized Spike sequences</title><p>First, we analyzed potential splice events within the open reading frame of wildtype Spike, which contains, according to our prediction, six potential SD sites. Since these splice signal sequences do not occur like in normal genes where every SD site is located upstream of a SA site, both flanking an intronic sequence such SD sites are ‘unsaturated’ and usually give rise to cryptic splice reactions in <italic>cis</italic> or in <italic>trans</italic> to potential SA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kowarz et al., 2011</xref>). To this end, we generated three splice traps in which the Spike sequence was inserted upstream of a perfect SA site, which again was fused in three different reading frames (0, +1, +2) to a full-length Luciferase gene without start codon. In this system Luciferase activity is only detected if splicing occurs. Respective constructs were cloned into a sleeping beauty transposon vector (pSBbi::Spike-Luc-0/+1/+2 GP) and used for stable transfection of HEK293T cells.</p><p>Analyses of all three splice trap constructs in Luciferase assay revealed that the ‘+2 construct’ exhibited the strongest intracellular Luciferase activity (1291 relative light units), while the ‘0 construct’ resulted in a much lower activity (341 relative light units). The activity determined for the +1 construct was near the values for non-transfected HEK293T cells, which served as negative controls (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, panel I.). We also analyzed the medium of the cultured cells and observed that small amounts of Luciferase activity were present also extracellularly. This amount increased over time and mimicked relative ratios of the three constructs observed intracellularly (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, panels II, III). Due to the design of the three splice traps, Luciferase activity can only be detected when splicing occurs. Thus, these initial Luciferase experiments confirmed that splicing of the Spike sequences was taking place. If splicing occurs between an SD in the Spike open reading frame and the SA in the splice trap, the C-terminally located TM domain of the Spike protein serving as the membrane anchor will get lost. Thus, resulting truncated Spike proteins may become secreted.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Splice trap Luciferase experiments in HEK293T cells.</title><p>The three different splice traps were cloned into the pSBbi-GP vector. This vector encodes two polycistronic transcripts, one encoding GFP and Puromycin resistance (from left to right), while the other encodes the full-length Spike gene connected to an artificial intron and an ATG-deleted Luciferase gene. Splice events to the Luciferase transcript will result in ‘in-frame’ and ‘out-of-frame’ Spike-Luciferase fusion transcripts. HEK293T cells were stably transfected with the constructs and resulting Luciferase activity was measured. RLU: relative light units; RFU: relative fluorescence units.

Here, we only analyzed intracellular Luciferase activity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, panels IV–VI). All three codon-optimized Spike genes derived from the different adenoviral vectors displayed a strong production of Spike-Luciferase fusion proteins that was also enhanced compared to wildtype Spike sequence constructs. Thus, all codon-optimized Spike genes displayed a higher splicing activity than the wildtype Spike gene sequence. The highest activity of 15,840 relative light units was detected with the reading frame +1 of the ChAdOx1-S construct. The lowest level of Luciferase activity was found in the Ad26.COV2.S construct.</p><p>We also performed Western blot experiments to determine steady-state levels of intracellularly produced adenovirus vector-encoded Spike protein variants and Spike-Luciferase fusion proteins. Cell lysates and supernatants of cell lines were used for Spike-immunoprecipitation experiments using protein G beads and anti-FLAG antibodies for capturing. Subsequently, samples were analyzed by Western blot analysis using anti-Spike and anti-Luciferase antibodies. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, for all analyzed Spike splice traps strong signals of proteins with sizes of 95–250 kDa were detected in cell lysates with both antibodies, confirming Spike-Luciferase fusion proteins of different lengths.

Here, the Spike sequence is embedded in the adenoviral DNA genome, directly upstream of the adenoviral pIX. Being part of the viral capsid, pIX has mainly structural functions as a ‘cement’ protein increasing stability of the viral particle, but also has additional functions in the viral life cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Parks, 2005</xref>). The 5’-non-coding sequence of the pIX transcription unit of the three different adenovirus types contains a highly conserved SA site behind the pIX promoter and upstream of the pIX ATG start codon (Ad5.S pIX at nucleotide –14; ChAdOx1-S pIX at nucleotide –4; Ad26.COV2.S pIX at nucleotide –5). In wildtype adenoviruses this site is naturally used as SA during processing of the adenoviral E1B RNA. To investigate potential splicing between the Spike sequence and the adenoviral pIX, HeLa and HepG2 cells were transduced with the adenoviral vectors Ad5.S, ChAdOx1-S, or Ad26.COV2.S. Preceding uptake assays for each cell line had been performed to determine required multiplicities of infection (MOIs) of the different adenoviral vectors to achieve comparable cellular transduction efficiencies with the different adenoviral vector types (Figure 8). Two days post transduction, total RNA was extracted from the cells and analyzed by RT-PCR using universal pIX reverse primer to detect splice events between various locations of the Spike-coding RNA and the pIX transcript. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> all three Spike genes of the different adenoviral vector backbones displayed splice events to the adenoviral pIX transcript. Noteworthy, although all Spike genes contain a poly(A) signal sequence that should initiate the poly-adenylation process, in all cases we observed transcriptional read-through allowing the detected splice events to occur. Only recurrently identified splice events are displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>. The Ad5.S Spike gene displayed the predominant splice events at positions 506, 1821, 3610*, 3,614, and 3641* to the SA within the pIX transcript of the vector backbone (numbers with an asterisk were not predicted by SpliceRover). The ChAdOx1-S Spike gene displayed the predominant splice events at positions 506, 1049*, 1914*, 3610*, 3614 and –298* and –84*. The latter two splice events involved an SD located in the bovine growth hormone (BGH) poly(A) signal 298 and 84 nucleotides upstream of the pIX start codon. Finally, the Ad26.COV2.S Spike gene displayed weak splice events occurring at nucleotide 541*, 959*, 1184, 1221*, 3641*, and –83*. Also here one splice event involved an SD in the simian virus 40 (SV40) poly(A) signal sequence located –83 nucleotides upstream of the pIX start codon.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Splice events after Ad5.S transduction of HeLa cells.</title><p>HeLa or HepG2 cells were transduced with the adenoviral vectors Ad5.S and RNA was isolated 48 hr post transduction.

Using forward primers that bind to the Spike sequence and reverse primers that bind to the pIX sequences revealed for all three vectors read-through events with DNA fragment lengths of 1802, 2037, and 1865 bp for Ad5.S, ChAdOx1-S, and Ad26.COV2.S, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, green arrows). While in Ad26.COV2.S-transduced HeLa cells no truncated cDNA fragments were detected, PCR amplification of Ad5.S- and ChAdOx1-S-transduced HeLa cells samples showed additional DNA bands of shorter lengths, confirming splicing at different positions within the read-through sequences. Interestingly, sequencing of the shortest DNA fragment of Ad5.S-transduced samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, red arrow) revealed that splicing occurred in-frame from the predicted SD site upstream of the TM domain of the Spike protein to the SA site upstream of the pIX start codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, splice site at nt 3610), resulting in a potentially secreted fusion protein. Similar results were obtained from sequencing of the shortest DNA fragment of ChAdOx1-S-transduced samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>: blue arrow): splicing took place between the predicted SD site upstream of the TM of the Spike protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, splice site at nt 3610) to the SA site upstream of the pIX start codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref>). However, this splicing event resulted in the generation of a stop codon, thus no fusion but though secreted, truncated proteins would be translated due to the lacking TM domain.

These data sets were based on nanopore sequencing data, which by nature are rather error-prone and thus analysis is complicated. Therefore, we first filtered the data sets for reads containing the ChAdOx1-S Spike gene. In a second step, we both looked for the presence of pIX sequences and blasted all Spike sequence reads against the human genome. The result of such an exemplary data mining experiment is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, where the analysis of the data set derived from MRC-5 cells at day 72 after transduction with ChAdOx1-S is displayed. Out of millions of reads, 9632 reads could be attributed to the codon-optimized Spike gene. As schematically depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, the Spike open reading frame is flanked at the 5’-end by the CMV promoter with a small intron and at the 3’-end by the BGH poly(A) signal and the pIX gene, respectively. A 93 nucleic acid sequence coding for the signal sequence of the tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) protein replaces the original start codon of the Spike gene. In this analysis, we identified, within the 9632 reads containing Spike nucleotide sequences, a total of 120 trans-spliced mRNAs, containing either host cell gene exons (fusing a total of 1 until 18 exons) fused to either the genuine SA of the CMV promoter (n = 8) or the internal Spike SA sites (n = 47). Similarly, we found Spike sequences fused to exons of host cell genes (between 1 and 28 exons). These trans-splicing events occurred either from the Spike open reading frame (n = 32, 32 different SD sites) or from the identified BGH SD sites (n = 33, 1 SD site). Exemplarily, we have identified the following genes: RSP, MSPG2, GPN2, CCN1, MRPL9, SORT1, UROS, TMEM35B, PRDX, ADAR, IFITM1, MMP1, DUD, PKM, ALDOA, MT2A, DDX42, etc. A total of 50 Spike-pIX fusions were found as well (eight SD sites), while 79 reads were found from the BGH SD to the SA upstream of the pIX-coding sequence as it has been observed with HeLa, HepG2, and C2C12 cells. Although the frequency of these splicing event was rather low compared to normal Spike reads (1.24–1.33% vs. 97.41%), their identification was unexpected. For comparison, we also determined the number of reads for two housekeeping genes, ABL1 and GAPDH, respectively: ABL1 reads were only 44, while GAPDH reads were 4586. Thus, the amount of 249 reads that displayed aberrant forms of Spike should be considered as significant.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Trans-splicing events of Vaxzevria in MRC-5 cells.</title><p>RNA-Seq data were kindly provided by David A Matthews, University of Bristol.

Thus, there has never been an evolutionary selection against presence of SD and SA sites in its gene sequences. While mRNA-based vaccines that are functionally only active in the cytoplasm, transcripts from adenoviral vectors are generated in the cell nucleus, where also post-transcriptional RNA processing steps – including splicing – is taking place. Thus, the findings shown and discussed here have implications for DNA-encoded vaccine development not only against SARS-COV-2 but also against other RNA viruses.</p><p>In this study, we experimentally validated our hypothesis that Spike protein variants lacking the natural membrane anchor – thereby being subjected to secretion – are generated from adenoviral vaccine vectors as a consequence of nuclear RNA splicing events. We showed (1) that in a Spike/splice reporter system use of in silico predicted SD sites within the wildtype Spike gene resulted in Spike-Luciferase protein fusion events, (2) that in this system splice reactions lead to secreted protein variants due to the splicing-dependent loss of the TM membrane domain, (3) that two of the three evaluated adenoviral vectors that encode a Spike gene that is codon-modified for improved expression exhibited more and stronger SD sites than the viral wildtype sequence, and (4) that following transcriptional read-through, splicing occurred to a strong SA in the adenoviral pIX transcript, going also along with loss of the TM anchor of Spike.</p><p>We wish to point out that in our experimental studies we have investigated a distinct spectrum of splice events, since we used primers binding to either Luciferase or the adenoviral pIX-coding sequence for PCR amplification. Alternative splice events, for example, internal splice events (in-frame, out-of-frame) were mostly cloned and sequenced by chance. The analysis of provided RNA-Seq data after cells were infected with the AstraZeneca vaccine gave insight into additional trans-splicing events with host cell genes. Viral RNA genes evolutionary contain splice site consensus sequences due to a missing counter selection. Thus, we conclude that nuclear expression of such RNA virus-derived genes in mammalian cells may result in unwanted splicing events with host cell genes that should be considered when developing new vaccines in the future.</p><p>Our results clearly indicate that Spike splice reactions occur and that secreted soluble Spike protein variants are generated. Western blot analyses from total cells and supernatant thereof revealed a series of Spike protein variants that vary in their molecular weight, indicative for the previously analyzed splicing events. Soluble Spike protein has been described to cause adverse effects, for example, a strong inflammatory response on endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lei et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Nuovo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Patra et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amraei and Rahimi, 2020</xref>). Obviously, severe life-threatening thromboembolic events occur due to infection of recipient cells by wildtype SARS-CoV-2. Even pseudoviruses with Spike protein located at their surface may cause strong inflammatory reactions in tissues and endothelial cells, indicating a potential risk of soluble Spike protein to cause severe side effects when systemically present in the vascular system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lei et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>According to our results, soluble Spike variants could potentially explain the occurrence of rare but severe events observed in particular after vaccination with Vaxzevria. Noteworthy, the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine carries fewer SD sequences, especially SD<sub>506</sub> and SD<sub>3614</sub> are absent (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2B–D</xref>), which are the strongest predicted SD sites in the Ad5.S- and ChAdOx1-S-encoded Spike sequences (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This was further confirmed by the observation that in contrast to Ad5.S and ChAdOx1-S, no significant amounts of spliced RNA molecules upon cell transduction with Ad26.COV2.S were generated. This may explain the ~3-fold lower incidence for thromboembolic side effects with the Janssen vaccine when compared to the Vaxzevria vaccine (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). It may also explain the ~2-fold lower risk for TTS with the Janssen vaccine.</p><p>Based on our data we pose the hypothesis that soluble Spike via its receptor-binding domain will bind to ACE2 and anti-Spike antibodies generated during immunization will recognize Spike variants, bound to the endothelial cell surface. Inflammatory reactions could locally occur through different mechanisms including antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), both of which could serve as starting point for thrombus formation. In ADCC, mainly NK cells are recruited to surface-bound antibodies via Fc-gamma receptors (CD16 or CD32) and cause cell lysis after their activation. In CDC, anti-Spike antibody-coated endothelial cells may recruit and activate complement that may result in platelet activation via binding of C3 and terminal complement complex on the surface of platelets and thrombin/serotonin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Luo et al., 2020</xref>). By this means, thromboses may occur in any site of the human body where endothelial cells express ACE2.</p><p>Why should such events occur in the cerebral dural venous sinus system? It is conceivable that due to the absence of venous valves bi-directional and posture-dependent blood flow in the dural venous sinus, the residence time of soluble Spike protein is increased and the possibility to bind to endothelial cells expressing ACE2 enhanced. This could increase the probability of adverse immune reactions at places of slow blood flow.</p><p>Recently the VITT syndrome has been described, suggesting a complex inflammatory process. Related to HIT it has been reported that the induction of anti-PF4 autoantibodies and platelet activation in a subset of patients may result in the observed combination of thrombocytopenia and thromboses mainly in large vessels including cerebral venous sinus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>, left side). Additionally, it is possible that protein impurities from the vaccine production process may be involved in the generation of a pro-inflammatory status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Krutzke et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we propose a third pathomechanism as it is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, right side. Based on our splicing data, membrane-anchored and secreted soluble Spike protein variants are produced after vaccination. Secreted Spike protein variants are disseminated throughout the vascular system and may concentrate at endothelial cells expressing the ACE2 at their surface. These ACE2-bound Spike will then become a target of anti-Spike antibodies, generated after vaccination with the potential to result in ADCC- and/or CDC-mediated inflammatory reactions. It may also cause the already described NET reaction of neutrophils that has been causally linked to thromboembolic events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Schönrich et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Veras et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Middleton et al., 2020</xref>).

One data set has been created by large-scale sequencing of splice events of all three adenoviral vector systems after transduction in HeLa and HepG2 cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>), where the different splice events of all three vectors have been investigated by simply analyzing a large number of PCR fragments through direct sequencing or subcloning and sequencing. The second data set is based on experiments, where all three adenoviral vectors were analyzed for their splice activity after adjusting the MOIs in the HeLa, HepG2, and C2C12 cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In the latter, read-through transcripts have been investigated for the activity of the different poly(A) signal sequences (BGH vs. SV40), but also for the amount of splice events in that particular transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Transcriptional read-through obviously is a precondition for the generation of splice events between the Spike-coding sequence and the pIX gene encoded by the adenoviral vector genome. Very little transcriptional read-through was observed with ChAdOx1-S that can be linked to the BGH poly(A) signal used in this construct. Apparently, the SV40 poly(A) signal is not as efficient in termination of the transcript as we observed with Ad5.S. In these cases, differences were observed for splice events which may point to the fact that tissue-specific splicing may account as well as for some differences in the creation of soluble Spike protein variants.</p><p>Based on our findings, we suggest that the Spike open reading frames – wildtype or codon-optimized for expression – in DNA-based vaccines should always be analyzed for the presence of strong SD sites. If possible, strong SD should be avoided to prevent unintended splice. We note that the Janssen Ad26.COV2.S vaccine has been modified to reduce the number of strong SDs, while the Ad5.S and ChAdOx1-S vectors still contain strong SDs, which is reflected in a large number of detectable splicing events, while only very few splicing events were detected in the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine.</p><p>Very little is known about fate and tissue distribution of adenovirus-based vaccine in humans. In mice, it has been observed that following intramuscular injection significant amounts of adenovirus vectors end up in hepatocytes, where expression of the transgene occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kron et al., 2011</xref>). It is likely that the chimpanzee ChAdOx1-S is also a hepatotropic adenovirus, since it is based on the chimpanzee adenovirus Y25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Dicks et al., 2012</xref>), which belonged to a group of isolates from chimpanzees associated with outbreaks of viral hepatitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hillis and Goodman, 1969</xref>). If transduction of hepatocytes would occur in (some of the) vaccines after intramuscular injection in a significant amount, it is conceivable that larger amounts of Spike proteins, having lost the transmembrane domain by splicing, will be secreted into the systemic circulation via the hepatic veins.</p><p>Taken together, from our work it appears that for DNA-encoded sequences (especially when derived from RNA viruses), most importantly, strong SDs should be avoided and strong poly(A) signals should be used for RNA termination in expression constructs. This is especially important when adenoviral vectors are used as transport vehicles. Usually, transgenes sequences are embedded in the adenoviral genome in the gap of the deleted <italic>E1</italic>-region, located directly upstream of the adenoviral pIX with a strong SA site. Alternatively, while most transgenes in adenoviral vectors have a ‘left-to-right’ orientation, also an inversion of the expression cassette would avoid splicing events to occur between the transgenic-coding sequence and the viral pIX transcript. Taking this into account, chances of splicing will be strongly reduced or null.</p><p>We strongly emphasize the consideration of these aspects for the rational design of safer future adenoviral vaccine vectors and also for adenoviral vector-based gene transfer approaches in general.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Splice site prediction</title><p>The SARS-CoV-2 Spike nucleic acid sequences of of the Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 strain (NC_045512.2) and codon-optimized Spike sequences encoded by the three investigated adenoviral vectors Ad5.S, ChAdOx1-S, and Ad26.COV2.S were analyzed for the presence of SD and SA sites using the state-of-the-art SpliceRover online tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioit2.irc.ugent.be/rover/splicerover">bioit2.irc.ugent.be/rover/splicerover</ext-link>).

The main finding is that the transcribed hnRNA is processed by the splice machinery of the human cell. This results in truncated constructs of the spike protein, which lose the transmembrane part and can be secreted into circulation. Splicing, however, is highly dependent on the cell type. Production of spliced spike proteins have been shown in the study using HEK cells, but the controls in this experiment a week. No evidence is given that human muscle cells can produce spliced spike protein. The authors show that a murine myoblast cell line can splice spike protein mRNA, but no data are given whether the murine cell line also produces and secretes the spliced protein. The authors speculate that these truncated forms of the spike protein bind to human endothelial cells and induce downstream biological effects. Taken together, the mRNA studies are interesting and hypothesis generating, the protein studies are not very convincing and the conclusions in the discussion far too speculative.</p><p>The experimental work should be either restricted to the mRNA experiments, ideally extended to studies using human skeletal muscle cells. Then the study is an important contribution to theoretical risk of these vaccines. Or the protein studies need to be expanded substantially.

Activation of endothelial cells depends on the amount of secreted spike proteins. In addition it has been shown that after vaccination with mRNA vaccines spike protein is circulating in the vaccinated individuals. Endothelial cells carry the ACE receptor. Large amounts of the spliced spike protein but be needed to reach the cerebral veins and splanchnic veins without being completely diluted. When the blood is drained from the muscle where the majority of the vaccine is located it will first pass the lung before it can reach the splanchnic and cerebral vasculature. Why aren't all spike proteins captured by the receptors in the lung? If spike protein in the circulation is causing such severe cell activation the clinical studies with in activated virus or virus like particles expressing the spike protein should show massive adverse effects.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors addressed a potentially third mechanisms by which vaccines against Sars-CoV2 (responsible for Covid-19), in particular DNA based vaccines could trigger rare forms of thrombosis. Their theory, for which they provide some initial evidence is that the vaccine induced transcript of the important and pathogenic viral &quot;spike&quot; protein would by alternative splicing ( a variant DNA transcription mechanism naturally occurring for many genes) produce spike protein that is not linked to a membrane (hence, localised) but becomes soluble and may circulate in blood to bind receptors that would otherwise recognise virus; the result may be triggering of immune mechanisms not by the virus, but by the spliced DNA products, the spike protein.</p><p>Although the data are reasonably straight forward, the story as such is hard to follow for the non informed reader (or clinician like me) and the data are preliminary as no evidence for pathogenicity of soluble spike proteins is presented.</p><p>The manuscript &quot;Vaccine-Induced Covid-19 Mimicry Syndrome: Splice reactions in adenovirus-based current vaccines result in secretion of truncated Spike variants that may cause adverse side effects&quot; by Kowarz and colleagues describes the potential splicing events and products of viral RNA originating from cloned vector DNA in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. Overall, the description of results in the manuscript are reasonably clear for molecular biologists with an interest in virology, but very complex and difficult to follow for the more general reader of a journal like <italic>eLife</italic>.

The splice trap allows only to produce Luciferase activity when artificial splice events are occuring between the Spike open reading frame and the Luciferase open reading frame; most important: the luciferase gene cassette does not exhibit a start codon, so it is per se unable to produce Luciferase protein. If in-frame splicing occurs between the different reading frames of Spike proteins (Wuhan, Ad5.S, ChAdOX1.S, hAd26.COV2.S) and Luciferase, then Luciferase activity can be measured inside the cells (usually higher activity) and outside the cell (when secreted). Based on the knowledge of cell biology, secretion can only take place when the C-terminal membrane anchor becomes substituted by the Luciferase protein.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Pages 6 and 7: This is a complex part of the manuscript, at least to understand the meaning of the presented data. Initially, it is presented as a validation of the previous observed splicing of the DNA variants supplemented with various cell types. Isn't this a repetition and confirmation of the previous part? The introduction of the pIX and focus thereon, doesn't contribute to the readability of this part of the Results section.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewer’s concern. We have introduced small changes in the text. We believe, that this section is of high interest to researchers with interest in adenovirus vector development and gene therapy, since our observation bear significant relevance for any kind of adenovirus vector-based therapy, whether prophylactic as a vaccine or therapeutic in gene therapy. We resume the issue of read-through into the pIX gene and the consequences also in the discussion. Thus, the details provided in the Results section are also important for the discussion. Therefore, we would prefer to keep this important information in the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
