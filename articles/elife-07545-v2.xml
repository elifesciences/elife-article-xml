Despite its importance the mechanisms regulating proteasome activity are only incompletely understood. Here we use an iterative and tightly integrated experimental and modelling approach to develop, explore and validate mechanistic models of proteasomal peptide-hydrolysis dynamics. The 20S proteasome is a dynamic enzyme and its activity varies over time because of interactions between substrates and products and the proteolytic and regulatory sites; the locations of these sites and the interactions between them are predicted by the model, and experimentally supported. The analysis suggests that the rate-limiting step of hydrolysis is the transport of the substrates into the proteasome. The transport efficiency varies between human standard- and immuno-proteasomes thereby impinging upon total degradation rate and substrate cleavage-site usage.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07545.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07545.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07545.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells have to be able to reliably destroy or remove molecules from their interior that they no longer need. Structures called proteasomes play a central part in this complex process by cutting up and digesting proteins. Mammals have several different types of proteasomes, each made up of several protein ‘subunits’. For example, when a cell experiences inflammation some proteasomes change some of their subunits and form an immuno-proteasome. These immuno-proteasomes tend to break down proteins more quickly than ‘standard’ proteasomes, but it was not clear how they are able to do so.</p><p>Liepe et al. have now combined experiments and mathematical modelling to construct a detailed model of proteasome activity. The model shows that protein transport into and out of the proteasome chamber are the steps that limit how quickly the proteasomes can break down proteins. Furthermore, these transport processes are also to a large extent responsible for the different rates at which standard and immuno-proteasomes process proteins. Liepe et al. were also able to confirm the existence of regulatory sites within the proteasome, and describe how these are arranged.</p><p>Problems that alter the rate at which proteasomes break down proteins have been linked to tumors and neurological and autoimmune diseases. Liepe et al.'s model opens up the ability to study how the proteasome's activity is affected by drugs and therefore makes it easier to investigate ways of interfering with this activity for therapeutic purposes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07545.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07545.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>experimental design</kwd><kwd>functional analysis</kwd><kwd>proteasome regulation</kwd><kwd>proteasome structure</kwd><kwd>Bayesian analysis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/G007934/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stumpf</surname><given-names>Michael PH</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Berlin Institute of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRG1-TP1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kloetzel</surname><given-names>Peter M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006188</institution-id><institution>Einstein Stiftung Berlin</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>A2013-174</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kloetzel</surname><given-names>Peter M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000849</institution-id><institution>National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research (NC3Rs) via a David Sainsbury Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NC/K001949/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liepe</surname><given-names>Juliane</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program (HFSP)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGP0061/2011</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stumpf</surname><given-names>Michael PH</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000275</institution-id><institution>Leverhulme Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F/07058/BP</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stumpf</surname><given-names>Michael PH</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Wolfson Research Merit Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stumpf</surname><given-names>Michael PH</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>AICE FIRE Onlus Emilia Romagna</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mishto</surname><given-names>Michele</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Experimental and computational analyses reveal how proteasomal hydrolysis is regulated and show that peptide transport is the rate-limiting step and the main differentiating factor between human standard- and immuno-proteasomes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cells can be usefully thought of as communities of molecular machines that work in concert to maintain cellular function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nurse, 2003</xref>). Metabolism, gene expression, protein production and degradation, energy production, DNA replication, cell division all have their own repertoire of associated proteins and macromolecular assemblies, and are controlled by complex and highly dynamic signalling and regulatory networks; this picture is complemented by a slew of structural proteins that provide cell walls, nuclear membranes, endoplasmic reticulum and other structures of the eukaryotic cell.</p><p>But while advances in imaging and microscopy technology have allowed us to glean some insights into the structures and even dynamics at the molecular level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liepe et al., 2012</xref>), much of our knowledge about the function of for example, protein production at ribosomes, or degradation at proteasomes, is based on indirect observations, or on data collected at some experimentally convenient equilibrium state. Increasingly time-resolved data can also be collected, and this type of data typically provides more detailed insights into the molecular mechanisms at work. To interpret such data, mathematical modelling coupled to state-of-the-art statistical inference thus becomes a necessity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">May 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buchholz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gerlach et al., 2013</xref>) to make sense of data and design better, more discriminatory experiments.</p><p>Here we apply a modelling approach to a detailed mechanistic analysis of proteasomes, which are at the core of the ubiquitin-proteasome system and responsible for the destruction of the majority of the cytoplasmic proteins. Proteins are usually tagged by E1-E2-E3-E4 enzyme-mediated poly-ubiquitination, carried into the proteasome proteolytic chamber where they are fragmented and, ultimately, expulsed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schwartz and Ciechanover, 2009</xref>). Proteins, and especially oxidised proteins—that is, those that reflect the presence of cellular stress conditions—can also be degraded by 20S proteasomes without prior poly-ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aiken et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pickering and Davies, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ben-Nissan and Sharon, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Höhn and Grune, 2014</xref>). In addition to stress response, the 20S proteasomes present in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fabre et al., 2015</xref>) have been shown to regulate the abundance of a host of signalling molecules involved in cell cycle progression, cellular growth control and oncogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ben-Nissan and Sharon, 2014</xref>). Additionally, 20S proteasomes form the core of the structure of 26S proteasomes and we cannot expect to understand the latter if we do not understand the mechanisms that determine the activity of the former.</p><p>Poly-ubiquitin tagging (when it occurs), transport and peptide-bond hydrolysis regulate protein half-life and thereby affect the majority of metabolic processes in the cell. Despite considerable biochemical and structural efforts, the mechanisms of proteasomal action, in particular the causes and extent of differences in substrate-specific proteolysis between different proteasome isoforms, are only incompletely understood. In this study we combine carefully designed experimental assays with detailed modelling to shed light on these mechanisms.</p><p>There is a dearth of mechanistic analyses of proteasome functions, and the complexity of polypeptide hydrolysis has precluded detailed analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liepe et al., 2014a</xref>). The most direct insights come from carefully chosen short fluorogenic peptides, which have a single proteasome-catalyzed cleavage site, which in turn allows us to follow the kinetics in real time. They have also been used (exclusively) to measure the proteasomal activity in cellulo (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kapeta et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chondrogianni et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Peters et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pickering et al., 2015</xref>), despite the fact that they lack the complexity of ‘real’ proteins and they do not recapitulate proteasome proteolytic activities towards polypeptide chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mishto et al., 2014</xref>). Nevertheless, they provide arguably the most promising class of leads of proteasomal inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bellavista et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kisselev and Groettrup, 2014</xref>). Furthermore, kinetic and structural analyses rely on their structural and biophysical characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gaczynska et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kisselev et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Osmulski et al., 2009</xref>); we, too, use them here for our analysis, which is based on a representative set of such peptides. As we show below the insights gained from the short fluorogenic peptides are borne out by further analysis of polypeptides.</p><p>The mechanistic analyses performed here also incorporate known structural features into a mathematical model of proteasome action. The 20S proteasome consists of four stacked seven membered rings (denoted by α<sub>7</sub>β<sub>7</sub>β<sub>7</sub>α<sub>7</sub>). These rings form three interconnected cavities, including a pair of antechambers through which substrates are passed before reaching the central catalytic chamber. Antechamber walls are not merely structural, but interact actively with the substrates by altering their properties and keeping them accessible for hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ruschak et al., 2010</xref>). These proteasome chambers can also store two or more proteins in order to enable continuous degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hutschenreiter et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sharon et al., 2006</xref>). The central chamber contains six subunits (two β1, β2 and β5 subunits) that catalyse the peptide-bond hydrolysis and peptide splicing after binding of the polypeptide substrates nearby their active N-terminal Thr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vigneron et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borissenko and Groll, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mishto et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>20S proteasomes modify their conformations and thus in turn their activity upon peptide-bond hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Osmulski et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ruschak and Kay, 2012</xref>), binding of regulatory complexes such as 11S or 19S to the proteasome α rings (leading to the formation of PA28-capped proteasomes and 26S proteasomes, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dick et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Emmerich et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Köhler et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ruschak and Kay, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Raule et al., 2014</xref>), and activation of non-catalytic modifier sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schmidtke et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kisselev et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2003</xref>) whose location in the proteasome remain unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liepe et al., 2014a</xref>).</p><p>In mammals different 20S proteasome isoforms exist, which carry different catalytic β subunits. Upon an inflammatory stimulus such as IFN-γ the catalytic standard β1, β2 and β5 subunits peculiar of the standard proteasome (s-proteasome) are replaced by the immuno-subunits β1i, β2i and β5i in the newly synthesized immunoproteasome (i-proteasome). Proteasome isoforms degrade substrates with different rates, but generate the same peptide pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mishto et al., 2014</xref>). And while there exist differences between substrates, the 20S i-proteasome has been shown often to have a higher polypeptide degradation rate than its standard counterpart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bellavista et al., 2013</xref>). Why s- or i-proteasomes should degrade specific substrates more rapidly is a matter of ongoing debate. Different steps of the proteolysis process may be responsible for isoform specific kinetics: transport of the substrate through the gate and the antechambers; binding to substrate binding sites and ensuing peptide-bond hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huber et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arciniega et al., 2014</xref>); and the release from the substrate binding sites and finally from the proteasome gate. The question is also of direct medical relevance: different degradation kinetics of specific substrates by s- and i-proteasomes, or i-proteasome carrying genetic polymorphisms/mutations, have been suggested to be involved in a variety of pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basler et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bellavista et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, i-proteasome deficient mice show altered proteasome-dependent kinetics of pathogen epitope generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basler et al., 2013</xref>). Such different kinetics could, for example, lead to the remodelling of immunodominance of viral epitopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zanker et al., 2013</xref>) or to the lack of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell-mediated response towards specific viral antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deol et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>As we will show below, our framework allows us to start from simple models of proteasome function, and identify which mechanistic shortcomings they exhibit. We focus on the dynamics of the digestion of a set of exemplar peptides, and show that this process is regulated carefully and by three distinct mechanisms, that act in concert to regulate proteasomal activity. Here considering different mechanisms, coupled to state-of-the art statistical model selection techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kirk et al., 2013</xref>), allows us to elucidate steps in the proteasomal dynamics that cannot be probed directly through experiments. Model selection naturally extends the conventional hypothesis testing approach, and by accounting for uncertainty fairly and correctly, can be applied to systems with many unknown kinetic parameters (which are, in any case, inferred together with their respective uncertainties) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liepe et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Babtie et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mechanistic modelling of proteasome proteolysis</title><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>Rate of product formation changes over time</title><p>The majority of mathematical models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schnell and Maini, 2003</xref>) describing enzymatic activity are Michaelis-Menten-type (MM) models, that is, they describe the dependency of the initial reaction speed on the initial substrate concentration. Such models can capture allosteric effects and have for example, been applied to investigate the action and dynamics of specific inhibitors. However, they assume that the initial reaction velocity is constant.</p><p>The in vitro digestion of short fluorogenic peptides by purified mouse 20S proteasomes reveals, however, substrate inhibition at high substrate concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), which is not compatible with the classical MM model. Furthermore, we find that proteasome proteolytic activity, that is, reaction velocity, changes over time as the product accumulates in non-linear fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). For instance, the reaction velocity for the substrate Suc-LLVY-MCA increases over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>); this temporal profile of proteasome activity is not due to its permanency at 37°C since Suc-LLVY-MCA degradation kinetics of the mouse proteasomes prior storing for 18 hr at 37°C or 4°C do not differ significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07545.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Velocity and specific cleavage site usage by mouse proteasomes varies over time.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The amount of products generated after 6 hr was measured for different initial substrate concentrations of the short fluorogenic substrates Suc-LLVY-MCA, Bz-VGR-MCA and Z-LLE-MCA by purified 20S mouse liver proteasome.

This would lead to a decrease of the average length of the peptides products due to further cleavages and thus further shortening of the initial products. However, we observe only a slight reduction in the average length of the peptide products in the polypeptide degradations, only at late time points, and only when less than 50% of the substrate is still intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>).

Because of this the product itself can bind tightly to the active site without being further processed and thereby block the cleavage of further substrates (product inhibition). We employ the two-site-modifier scheme of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schmidtke et al. (2000)</xref>, who have already argued against the use of MM-types model for analysing proteasome function, and we adapt it to allow for product and substrate inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, the substrate inhibition model still fails to reproduce our data, which can be clearly seen in the case of Z-LLE-MCA degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>, blue curves). The intermediate complexes are assumed to be in quasi-steady state (which holds for all proteases studied so far), which allows us to reduce the overall complexity of the mathematical description without loss of information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sanft et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grima et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Because of the observed increase in reaction velocity over time until 90–120 min, we next investigate if a positive feedback loop could cause this. Two distinct mechanisms are possible: either (i) the product enhances binding to the active site; or (ii) the product increases the peptide-bond hydrolysis rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). Even though both mechanisms result in an increased reaction velocity over time, they cannot explain substrate inhibition and fail to reproduce our experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C,D</xref>). Because of this we require and develop a more complex model that accounts for the specific steps of proteasomal peptide hydrolysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-3"><title>Substrate transport is a crucial step in modelling peptide hydrolysis</title><p>The models considered so far do not account for the proteasome structure where active sites are buried inside the proteasome's inner cavity; substrate must enter via the proteasome gate and move along the inner cavity until it reaches the active site. This structural organisation profoundly affects proteasome dynamics.</p><p>Previous in silico studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liepe et al., 2014a</xref>) had assumed that substrate molecules enter and leave the proteasome by diffusion. However, the proteasome gate and the interior surface of the proteasome chambers have strong partial charges, and substrate molecules have been shown to interact at least with the latter, and a transport model based on free diffusion cannot capture the observed data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p>Before substrate enters the 20S core, it needs to be located close to one of the two proteasome gates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Substrate affinity to the gate is described by the parameters <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>on</italic></sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>off</italic></sub>. After entry into the central chamber through the antechamber (<italic>v</italic><sub><italic>in</italic></sub>) the substrate can bind to an active site. The number of substrate molecules that can enter the chambers is determined by the maximum capacity (<italic>C</italic>—number of molecules that can be allocated in the proteasome chamber). This number depends on the volume of the proteasome chamber and the volume of the molecules. Since different substrate molecules differ in volume, the maximal capacity is expected to differ as well. The rate <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>in</italic></sub> is dependent on how many molecules are already located inside the proteasome chamber. If the number of molecules inside the chamber reaches the maximal capacity <italic>C</italic>, the rate by which new molecules enter the chamber is decreased. Since the exact mechanism for this process is unknown we formulate a heuristic expression that decreases the rate as a function of the number of molecules inside the chamber and the maximal capacity (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>, section 2).</p><p>To exit the proteasome products and unprocessed substrates need to move from the central chamber through the antechamber, and then to the gate (<italic>τ</italic>), where they can exit the proteasome (<italic>v</italic><sub><italic>out</italic></sub>). Both unprocessed substrates and products can re-enter the proteasome. Substrates and products can enter and leave the proteasome through the same gate or through different gates. In the model we include both gates, which are described by an outer site (G1) and an inner site (G2). Note, in the schematics of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> we show substrate entry always on the left hand side and substrate release always on the right hand side for simplicity.

There is already evidence for non-catalytic regulatory sites in proteasomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schmidtke et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kisselev et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2003</xref>).

(2003)</xref> identified two enhancers of the degradation rate of Suc-FLF-MNA and Suc-LLVY-MNA molecules, but not of Boc-LRR-MCA. We therefore expect that Suc-LLVY-MCA will enhance its own hydrolysis through a positive feedback loop (self-activation). Indeed, the degradation rate of Suc-LLVY-MCA by mouse proteasome progressively accelerates within 90 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), and the degradation rate of the substrate Bz-VGR-MCA increases in the presence of the peptide LLVY (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>)—this is indirect evidence for the existence of feedback. The resulting time course shows an initially low reaction velocity, which then increases over time. This phenomenon is more pronounced at substrate concentration above 40 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). To test whether the progressive increase of the enhancing effect of LLVY peptide over time is due to slow kinetics of the binding to non-catalytic modifier sites we pre-incubate mouse proteasome with LLVY peptide prior to the start of the degradation of the substrates Suc-LLVY-MCA and Bz-VGR-MCA. The enhancing activity of LLVY is maximal for shorter pre-incubation, but the initial acceleration remains the same (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Thus the progressive acceleration over time of the two substrates' degradations is not due to slow binding of the LLVY peptide to non-catalytic modifier sites. Instead the data suggest that peptide-bond hydrolysis is mandatory for the enhancing effect by LLVY peptide.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07545.015</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Peptide-mediated enhancement of proteasome activity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Product formation over time from degradation of Bz-VGR-MCA by mouse proteasome in presence or absence of LLVY peptide over time.

We can confirm this with the help of Rpt peptides, which are short peptides deriving from subunits of the 19S regulatory complex and known to bind the proteasome α subunit tails and open the gate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gillette et al., 2008</xref>). When mouse 20S proteasome digests the substrates Bz-VGR-MCA in presence of Rpt peptides no further enhancement of the degradation rate is seen when the LLVY peptide is added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>In our model we therefore have to also include regulatory sites to which substrate can bind. Based on the in vitro results we investigate two alternatives: (i) the regulatory site is on the outer surface of the proteasome and therefore accessible to all external peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>); or (ii) the regulatory site is located inside the proteasome chambers and thus only accessible to peptides that are also inside the chambers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). In both cases binding to the regulatory site would lead to an increase of the substrate influx and hence to an increase in the model parameters <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>in</italic></sub> and <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>out</italic></sub> by a factor (parameter <italic>X</italic><sub><italic>enh</italic></sub>).</p><p>We also observe evidence for such a positive feedback loop in the degradation of Z-LLE-MCA, where the speed of the reaction increases more slowly as the substrate concentration increases. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). This substrate inhibition takes place during the first 60 min of the gate opening process. This suggests the existence of a regulatory site, which upon binding of substrate stops the gate from opening. If such a regulatory site were inside the proteasome we should observe the effect only after enough substrate has entered the chambers, that is, only at later time points assuming that the chamber fills only slowly; if, however, the regulatory site were on the proteasome's exterior surface and thus exposed to the initial substrate concentration, inhibition could take place immediately with the initiation of the reaction. Accordingly, we extend the models shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref> by adding a regulator site outside the proteasome with inhibitory effect on the gate conformation. Such inhibition could occur upon specific binding to a specific site, or upon unspecific binding of peptides to the surface of the proteasome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I,J)</xref>.</p><p>The last five models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–J</xref>) all contain the same description of the active site events.

We extend the model in order to describe the hydrolysis of a hypothetical peptide with two cleavage sites. A schematic of the substrate and possible resulting products is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>.

Like we have observed for the mouse proteasome, human 20S proteasome purified from T2 (s-proteasome) and LcL (i-proteasome) cell lines shows degradation dynamics of short fluorogenic peptide that vary over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This is not due to variation of proteasome functionality as pre-incubation of the proteasome without substrate at 37°C for 18 hr does not alter its activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), in agreement with what is observed for mouse proteasome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Similarly, the substrate cleavage preferences within the LLO<sub>291–317</sub> polypeptide by s- and i-proteasomes vary over time, and not because of product re-entry.

Even though experimentally we can only observe the total amount of product produced over time (grey dots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), the kinetic model now provides information about the separate steps involved in the substrate degradation. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> we plot the total product concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>), the amount of substrate and product inside the proteasome chamber over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). For all three substrates we observe that with increasing substrate concentration the proteasome chamber fills up faster with peptides. For Z-LLE-MCA we observe a more rapid filling compared to Suc LLVY-MCA and Bz-VGR-MCA, where the filling lasts approximately 6 hr. When plotting the amount of product inside the chamber relative to the total amount of peptides in the chamber, we find that Suc-LLVY-MCA and Bz-VGR-MCA are cleaved immediately once inside the chamber (90% of peptides are products) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This shows that, for the substrates Suc-LLVY-MCA and Bz-VGR-MCA, the transport inside the chamber, rather than the binding to the catalytic site and the peptide-bond hydrolysis, regulates how fast these substrates are degraded. The posterior parameter distributions show that Z-LLE-MCA substrate is transported faster than Suc-LLVY-MCA and Bz-VGR-MCA (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>, vin and v<sub>out</sub>). This results in the rapid accumulation of Z-LLE-MCA molecules inside the proteasome chamber. Even though the catalysis rates (k<sub>p</sub>) of the three substrates are the same, Z-LLE-MCA hydrolysis is strongly influenced by both product and substrate inhibition (this is indicated by the very small values for the parameter β). Because of that Z-LLE-MCA will be cleaved less efficiently (30–50%) than the other substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Here modeling can elucidate those processes that are only measurable indirectly.</p><p>In summary, in light of our experiments and models the substrate transport appears to be the most important factor for controlling how fast short fluorogenic substrates are degraded by mouse 20S proteasome, and therefore it is the rate-limiting step of their hydrolysis. The hydrolysis of substrates that accumulate easily inside the proteasome chamber can be additionally influenced by strong substrate and product inhibition effects resulting in less efficient substrate degradation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07545.024">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07545.024</ext-link></p></caption></boxed-text></p><p>Since substrate-characteristic peptide transport appears to shape the kinetics of (20S) proteasome-mediated peptide degradation, this process should naturally be the rate limiting-step of the overall reaction; furthermore it seems to vary systematically between s- and i-proteasomes.</p><p>To test the robustness of our posterior parameter distributions we alter specific steps of the proteolytic process. First, we predict in silico the kinetic effect of the Rpt peptides—which open the gate by binding the α subunit tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gillette et al., 2008</xref>)—on the hydrolysis rate of s- and i-proteasomes over time. According to our simulation the enhancing effect of Rpt should be strongest at early time points and decrease over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). We also predict that at early time points the effect of Rpt will be larger in s-proteasome when hydrolysing Suc-LLVY-MCA than in i-proteasomes, although over time the enhancing effects are the same. A similar effect is predicted for proteasomal hydrolysis of the Bz-VGR-MCA substrate in presence of Rpt peptides, although s-proteasome is predicted to remain higher than i-proteasome also at later time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Third, we predict that both proteasome types will initially have the same enhancing effect while digesting Z-LLE-MCA substrate, but that this effect becomes stronger over time for i-proteasomes. The in vitro experiments verify these three nontrivial in silico predictions. The small quantitative deviations can be explained by the use of a simplified model for the functioning of Rpt peptides (multiplication of the parameter <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>in</italic></sub> by a constant factor), which is expected to be more complex in reality. But this comparison validates that transport is indeed the rate limiting step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Using tightly integrated experimental and computational modelling analyses, recent advances in our understanding of proteasome structure and function, and previous attempts at modelling proteasome dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liepe et al., 2014a</xref>), we elaborate the first comprehensive mathematical model that is able to describe the regulatory components of 20S proteasomes; and the complex interactions between substrate/product transport and substrate hydrolysis over time for representative peptides. Modelling helps us to understand how the 20S proteasome catalyzes the degradation of specific proteins in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pickering and Davies, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ben-Nissan and Sharon, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Höhn and Grune, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fabre et al., 2015</xref>); it also forms the basis for future studies of the main active forms of proteasome in cells, for example, when it is bound to the regulatory complexes 19S and PA28 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fabre et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, in 19S or PA28 single-capped proteasomes all steps considered in our model are still present, including the regulation of the gate by non-catalytic modifier site(s) and the gate binding affinity since one of the proteasome gates is not bound to the regulatory complexes and will therefore be regulated as described here.</p><p>We observe similar proteasome dynamics over time when using purified 20S proteasome as well as protein homogenates, where 20S proteasomes are surrounded by several regulatory molecules. It suggests that with the present model we describe a core of proteasome features that could reflect proteasome dynamics also in more complex scenarios such as might exist inside the cellular environment. Our model therefore also provides an interpretative framework for general studies of proteasome action, keeping in mind that substrate-specific effects need to be accounted for (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mishto et al., 2014</xref>). Simple (e.g., MM-type) models, which have been largely used in analysing proteasome functionality so far, are clearly not capable of describing proteasome dynamics; this is becoming apparent since time-course data is much less forgiving and harder to fit to than for example, dose-response curves. The 20S proteasome is a dynamic enzyme and its catalytic activity varies over time in a way that can only be understood if the structural characteristics of the proteasome are taken into account. Kinetics change over longer time scales than the structural dynamics described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Osmulski et al. (2009)</xref> and they are influenced by the interactions of substrates and products with both proteolytic and regulatory sites. Our analysis suggests that the cavity of 20S proteasomes is progressively filled by peptides that can further facilitate other molecules to enter the chambers until the effective cavity volume has been almost completely filled. In fact, the estimated numbers of substrate and product molecules (<italic>C</italic>) that are inside the proteasome cavity are close to the possible maxima (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="B2">Box 2</xref>). Peptide accumulation over time leads to activation of non-catalytic modifier sites, which our analysis shows to be located inside the proteasome cavity.<boxed-text id="B2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07545.025</object-id><label>Box 2.</label><caption><title>Filling kinetics of the proteasome inner cavity over time.</title><p>A key part of the peptide transport dynamics is the maximum capacity (C) of the two proteasome ante-chambers and the main chamber. C describes the maximal number of molecules of a given substrate can be allocated inside the proteasome chamber at the same time. C is dependent on the volume of the proteasome chamber and on the volume of the substrate molecules. For this reason C is expected to be substrate specific. The model estimates of C for the three tested substrates are in agreement with values predicted by computing the maximal number of substrates that could be located inside the proteasome chamber. The estimated volumes for Suc-LLVY-MCA, Z-LLE-MCA and Bz-VGR-MCA are approx. 936 A<sup>3</sup>, 741 A<sup>3</sup> and 606 A<sup>3</sup>, respectively (with an MCA group of 200 A<sup>3</sup>). This results in a ratio of 1.25 for Suc-LLVY-MCA:Z-LLE-MCA (model estimate: 1.24), 1.36 for Suc-LLVY-MCA:Bz-VGR-MCA (model estimate: 1.46) and 1.08 for Z-LLE-MCA:Bz-VGR-MCA (model estimate: 1.12). The exact number of molecules inside the chamber depends on the maximum possible density, but is approximately estimated to be 250, 310 and 337 for Suc-LLVY-MCA, Z-LLE-MCA and Bz- VGR-MCA, respectively, which is in the same order of magnitude as the model estimates (200, 249 and 293). Note, computed values are the maximal possible amount of molecules that could be packed inside the chamber. However, under physiological conditions the actual number of molecules that can be filled in the proteasome cavity has to be smaller, which is reflected in our model estimates.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07545.025">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07545.025</ext-link></p></caption></boxed-text></p><p>Substrate transport through the gate and cavities must therefore be a key factor in the regulation of the proteolytic process, despite the fact that it had been largely neglected so far in the quantitative analysis of proteasome dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liepe et al., 2014a</xref>). The integration of data into our mathematical model clearly shows that peptide transport is the major rate limiting step in the degradation of short fluorogenic substrates: all models/hypotheses that do not account for this are soundly rejected. Hydrolysis is only rate limiting for the degradation of Z-LLE-MCA. We stress that for the short fluorogenic substrates the rate limiting steps are conserved across the different proteasomes (mouse proteasome and human s- and i-proteasomes). This in turn suggests that the interspecies homology of the proteasome structure results in preserving transport characteristics, although subtle structural variations can quantitatively modify the transport, as observed by comparing s- and i-proteasomes.</p><p>Variation of the transport efficiency typically leads to quantitative changes in the degradation rates of short fluorogenic substrates. For more complex substrates, for example, polypeptides, transport variation could change substrate cleavage-site usage and thus result in the generation of specific peptide products. If these peptides are MHC class I-restricted epitopes, substantial variations in their amount could strongly affect the cell-mediated immune response. Indeed, as we have recently shown, significant decreases of antigenic peptide amount produced by proteasome could lead to a presentation onto the MHC class I molecules that is so diminished to be not able to trigger CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mishto et al., 2014</xref>). According to our model, modifications of the proteasome gate upon PA28 binding will for instance affect the substrate cleavage-site usage and lead to the observed alterations of MHC class I-restricted epitope repertoire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cascio, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Differences in gate and inner channel features are in part responsible for the different degradation rates of the short fluorogenic peptides by human s- and i-proteasomes although they diverge also in the activity of the catalytic subunits themselves. Differences in the gate between the two proteasome isoforms are supported also by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fabre et al. (2015)</xref>, who identified preferential binding between the α subunits of s- and i-proteasomes and specific regulatory complexes. Such differences can become dominant driving forces. For instance, the degradation of the substrate Bz-VGR-MCA is not influenced by differences in the active site-related parameters—as is correctly predicted by our model. This also agrees with comparisons of the crystallographic structures of the mouse s- and i-proteasomes, which identify only minor variations between the β2 and β2i catalytic pockets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huber et al., 2012</xref>). By contrast, the catalytic sites of s-proteasome have stronger binding affinity for the substrate Z-LLE-MCA than the i-proteasome, which could be explained by the structural differences between β1 and β1i catalytic pockets described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huber et al. (2012)</xref>. For the degradation of the substrate Suc-LLVY-MCA our model predicts that the i-proteasome has higher substrate-binding affinity, higher hydrolysis rate, and lower cooperativity than the s-proteasome. This prediction is corroborated by the recent study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arciniega et al. (2014)</xref>, who showed that the β5i pocket is more prone to bind and process substrates than the β5 pocket; however, only s-proteasome is able to modify its conformation upon substrate binding to the β5 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arciniega et al., 2014</xref>), which is also correctly captured by our model as increased cooperativity (<italic>n</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>).</p><p>The outcomes of our integrative analysis suggest that the i-proteasome also has a higher affinity for the enhancing non-catalytic modifier site activated by all three substrates; given that our model consistently predicts this site to be located at the inner surface, it should now become possible to determine the precise location of the enhancer site using structural techniques.</p><p>Our model is a necessary and non-trivial step towards understanding protein degradation by proteasomes. A full-length protein is a much more complicated substrate and it can interact with the different regulatory and catalytic sites in a myriad of ways. In any such analysis, however, the model developed here can aid the experimental set-up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liepe et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sunnaker et al., 2013</xref>) and the interpretation of experimental data. What is already clear is that the complex interactions between a suitable complicated substrate and the proteasomal machinery will substantially shape differences in degradation rates between proteins; as the protein degradation rate is known to influence for example, noise in signal transduction, a way to understand and rationally interfere with this process is of obvious importance.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>20S proteasome purification and protein homogenates</title><p>20S proteasomes from LcL and T2 cells and mouse liver are purified as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mishto et al., 2014</xref>).

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by John Kuriyan (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and three reviewers, one of whom, Shinya Kuroda, has agreed to reveal his identity.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The authors analyzed the mechanism of proteasomal protein degradation by taking advantage of integration of both experimental and mathematical modelling approaches. They developed the alternative mechanistic models of proteasome proteolysis by comparison with experimental data. In particular, they sequentially added mechanistic components on the simple model one-by-one based on both literatures and discrepancies with experimental observation. This is quite reasonable and careful way to develop the alternative models. They performed the statistical model selection using ABC-SMC, and found that the compartmentalised model with affinity transport and enhancing (inside) and inhibiting (outside) regulatory sites is the most plausible. Using the selected model, they further analyzed two distinct types of proteasomes; s- and i-proteasomes. They characterized the quantitative difference between the two proteaomes by posterior parameters distributions, and found that the gate size is a rate-limiting step for Suc-LLVY-MCVA and Bz-VGR-MCA, while hydrolysis for Z-LLE-MCA. Such distinct characteristics were also confirmed by experiments.</p><p>This is very elegant study for selecting mechanistic models using both experiments and statistical approaches. The pipeline of model development is clear and well-designed. Furthermore, they gained the new insight of distinct quantitative difference between s- and i-proteasomes, which is intuitively impossible to predict and further validated by experiments. Thus, this study is one of the remarkable and successful examples of analyzing complex biochemical processes using an iterative and tightly integrated experimental and modelling approach.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The manuscript's biological conclusions predominantly rely on the interpretation of dynamic experimental data (which appear to be of good quality) with dynamic mathematical models, including Bayesian model selection for the inference of potential mechanisms. While therefore being central to the work, the modeling component raises the following concerns:</p><p>1) Model descriptions: The presentation in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>, section 2 is partially incomplete and it contains errors that may impact the overall conclusions (for detailed assessment, the authors should provide models and experimental data in appropriate numerical exchange formats). Major missing data are the initial conditions for all models/simulations, e.g. assumptions on numbers of gates (G<sub>i</sub>) cannot be assessed/compared between simulations without this data. Inconsistent mass balances may directly affect the model performance, e.g. it should be ‘-I<sub>off</sub> …’ in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dick et al., 1996</xref>)-(36) and similar Equations, and ‘- h * S<sub>out</sub><sup>h</sup> *I<sub>free</sub> * I<sub>on</sub> + h * [IS] …’ in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gaczynska et al., 1993</xref>) and similar.</p><p>2) Mechanistic assumptions: Clarification is needed with respect to the particular choices of mechanisms and their underlying assumptions because these could bias subsequent analysis results. Examples include (a) quasi steady-state assumptions in MM and SI models, (b) assumptions on distinct gates G1/2 in compartment models, and (c) mathematical description of catalytic events in compartment models. These assumptions differentiate between models not only in the dimensions discussed in the text but, for example, also between compartment and ‘simple’ models (the latter without product inhibition); in this sense the models (and mechanistic implications) are not hierarchical as suggested.</p><p>3) Relations between mechanisms and parameters: The model-based interpretation of data (e.g., s- and i-proteasome comparison), to a large extent, relies on posterior parameter distributions, where for each proteasome substrate these distributions have been inferred independently. However, many parameters such as maximal capacity C, transport enhancement after binding (<italic>X</italic><sub><italic>enh</italic></sub>), and diffusion in the chamber (τ) should be (nearly) identical for all substrates if the assumed physical mechanisms hold. After addressing 1) and 2) such constraints should be incorporated.</p><p>4) Model selection/validation/invalidation against experimental data: Most importantly, the (statistical) evidence for/against individual models is weak in many cases for the following reasons: (a) According to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> Equation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nurse, 2003</xref> ), (estimated) measurement noise is not included in defining the distance between model and data, making all model selection relevant only with respect to fit to the (scaled) average trajectories, where instead the probability P(model|data) under an appropriate measurement model should be computed; (b) Bayesian model selection as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> concerns only the compartment models with similar numbers of parameters, but not the significantly lower-dimensional MM and SI models – a consistent selection framework is missing; (c) for key validation experiments the experimental data is either not shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>), or predictions and experimental data are significantly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), both of which do not lend evidence to the overall claim of a validated quantitative model.</p><p>5) The paper needs to be carefully edited for brevity, and the Introduction should come to point much more quickly than it does at present. In particular, we ask you to remove the more philosophical discussion of the interplay between modeling and experiment in biology, that are currently part of the Introduction, including the associated conceptual schematic diagram. While we do not dispute the points you make, this paper is about a particular topic, that of modeling the reactions mediated by the proteasome, which we find quite interesting in its own right. The more global issues of modeling are not addressed by your work, and belong more appropriately in a review article.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07545.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The manuscript's biological conclusions predominantly rely on the interpretation of dynamic experimental data (which appear to be of good quality) with dynamic mathematical models, including Bayesian model selection for the inference of potential mechanisms.

The incorrect mass balance expressions (and several other typos) were mistakes in typing the model equations in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> and in the main text, but not in the model code itself. Because of that we only had to correct the documentation and did not have to repeat the entire model inference. The model is now provided in SBML format as Source code and will also be submitted to the Biomodels database. We have also uploaded all experimental data used for model selection and parameter inference to the Dryad Digital Repository.

Furthermore, we have included all the underlying assumptions in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>. More specifically:</p><p>(A) We employ the quasi-steady state assumption for the MM and SI models in order to reduce the number of model species to be numerically simulated. This approximation has been shown to be a valid representation the enzymatic models (Grima, 2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grima et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sanft et al., 2011</xref>; Schnell, 2014), that does not loose information under the conditions that we have in our experimental setup. The quasi-steady state assumption holds if the catalytic rates are small compared to the on and off rates of ligand binding. For all proteases studied so far this assumption has been found to be valid; the cleaving action of the active site is complex (reviewed in (Liepe et al., 2014)), and the effective rate low; the on and off binding reactions at room temperature are fast. Of all the model reduction techniques discussed in the literature, the Michaelis-Menten mechanism has been explored and validated most completely(Gómez-Uribe et al., 2008; Schmidt et al., 2008; Smadbeck and Kaznessis, 2012). There are good pragmatic reasons for using suitably simplified models; more complicated models (e.g. those not relying on the quasi-steady-state assumption) tend to be plagued by non-identifiable parameters (Chis et al., 2014; Raue et al., 2011). We found this to be the case, especially for full model descriptions of the SI model. Such non-identifiabilities can (and do) result in numerical errors for certain parameter combinations. The latter is a known problem when exploring the model parameter space (Engl et al., 2009; Erguler et al., 2011; Rué et al., 2010).</p><p>We have also carefully corrected the equations in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> for the SI model. The SI model includes substrate and product inhibition, based on the two-site modifier scheme by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schmidtke et al. ,2000</xref>. The model description is now corrected.</p><p>(B) The same quasi-steady state assumption is, for the reasons outlined above, made use of in the remaining models. The models in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2 C-D</xref> had to be revised. Even though we displayed them correctly in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, we have revised the equations. Initially these two models were based on the MM model with the additional positive feedback loop. However, we agree with the referees that considered in this way these models would not be hierarchical extensions of a simpler model. We have now changed these two models so that they are based on the SI model with an additional positive feedback loop. The equations are corrected and the model selection was repeated based on the corrected model descriptions. In this way the first 4 models are hierarchical, starting from the simplest MM model, via the SI model and finally the most complex models with positive feedback loops.</p><p>We then employ again the SI model in order to describe the catalytic events in the compartmentalized models, i.e. the compartmentalization is a further level of complexity added to the simpler models. Now all discussed models are presented consistently and coherently, making their assumptions and the reasons for their development more explicit.</p><p>The description of the active site behaviour lacked detail for several models. We have therefore included much more detailed descriptions of the active site events for the non-compartmental and especially for the compartmentalized models in the main text.</p><p>(C) In the previous version of manuscript the description of the gate mechanisms lacked detail, in particular about the gate characteristics and the related transport processes. These points are now addressed fully. For example, it is now made clear that the gates are not distinct: each proteasome molecule has two gates, both of which have exactly the same characteristics. They both contain an outer area (G1) accessible for S<sub>out</sub> and P<sub>out</sub>, and an inner area (G2) accessible for S and P. Each peptide molecule can enter and leave the proteasome chamber via the same gate, or enter via one and leave via the other gate. In the schematics of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, for clarity and convenience, we draw the peptide influx always on the left gate and the peptide efflux always on the right gate. A note to this extent is now included in the caption of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p><italic>3) Relations between mechanisms and parameters: The model-based interpretation of data (e.g., s- and i-proteasome comparison), to a large extent, relies on posterior parameter distributions, where for each proteasome substrate these distributions have been inferred independently. However, many parameters such as maximal capacity C, transport enhancement after binding (</italic>X<sub>enh</sub><italic>), and diffusion in the chamber (τ) should be (nearly) identical for all substrates if the assumed physical mechanisms hold. After addressing 1) and 2) such constraints should be incorporated.</italic></p><p>We have inferred all the substrate-related parameters independently in order to introduce as few assumptions as possible. We agree that for a given substrate the maximal capacity could potentially be similar for different proteasome isoforms. Indeed, when inferring the parameters for s- and i-proteasomes we find that the marginal posterior distributions for C are the same. However, incorporation of several other subunits into a multimer may drastically change the kinetic properties of the complex as a whole (see for example Cardozo, J Biol Chem. 1998 Jul 3;273(27):16764-70). Furthermore, the maximal capacity is dependent on the substrate volume, and the electrostatic properties of the different substrates (which differ considerably for the three substrates). Since the short fluorogenic substrates LLVY-MCA, LLE-MCA and VGR-MCA differ in their amino acid composition and therefore in their respective approximate volumes, we expect that the numbers of substrate molecules that fit into the proteasome chamber will also differ. We have expanded <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="B2">Box 2</xref> of section 4 in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> in order to clarify this. In particular, we have added a better definition of the maximal capacity in <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="B2">Box 2</xref> as well as in the main text.</p><p>Regarding the <italic>X</italic><sub><italic>enh</italic></sub>: this describes the enhancement of the gating rate after binding of the substrate to the regulatory site. We agree that if we assume that all three tested substrates bind to exactly the same regulatory site with the same kinetics then <italic>X</italic><sub><italic>enh</italic></sub> should be the same for any given proteasome isoform. However, because we cannot exclude that different substrates might bind with different kinetics to potentially different proteasome isoforms we prefer to infer <italic>X</italic><sub><italic>enh</italic></sub> separately for the three substrates. We furthermore have to allow for the possibility that <italic>X</italic><sub><italic>enh</italic></sub> might differ between proteasome isoforms. By hindsight (and in agreement with the reviewers’ intuition), however, our inference results in identical marginal posterior parameter distributions for <italic>X</italic><sub><italic>enh</italic></sub> when comparing s- and i-proteasomes, suggesting that <italic>X</italic><sub><italic>enh</italic></sub> is indeed conserved between these two isoforms.</p><p>The parameter τ describes how efficient a substrate is transported inside the proteasome chamber. Therefore, τ is determined by the structure and partial charges of the inner proteasome cavity as well as the sizes and partial charges of the substrates. The inner cavity is mainly positively charged. The three investigated substrates differ in their partial charges (LLVY: 0, LLE: -1, VGR: +1). These partial charges can allow the substrates to be transported faster or slower. To test for this we inferred the parameter τ independently for each substrate and isoform. We do not detect any significant differences for τ between s- and i-proteasomes. But we find that LLVY is transported more efficiently than LLE and VGR, likely because of the absence of partial charges on LLVY, and therefore this substrate has fewer interactions with the inner proteasome cavity.</p><p>If we would have included the suggested constraints we would not have been able to detect the latter differences in substrate transport. Furthermore, inferring C and <italic>X</italic><sub><italic>enh</italic></sub> independently allowed us to confirm that they are indeed the same for the different proteasome isoforms.</p><p>Additionally, we have attempted to infer the parameters in a more constrained fashion for all substrates and proteasome isoforms, but we did not obtain sufficiently good model fits.</p><p>In the revised manuscript we have included a statement about the identically inferred maximal capacity for a given substrate and about the <italic>X</italic><sub><italic>enh</italic></sub>.</p><p><italic>4) Model selection/validation/invalidation against experimental data: Most importantly, the (statistical) evidence for/against individual models is weak in many cases for the following reasons: (a) According to</italic> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data"><italic>Supplementary file 1</italic></xref> <italic>Equation (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37"><italic>Nurse, 2003</italic></xref> <italic>), (estimated) measurement noise is not included in defining the distance between model and data, making all model selection relevant only with respect to fit to the (scaled) average trajectories, where instead the probability P(model|data) under an appropriate measurement model should be computed; (b) Bayesian model selection as shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5A</italic></xref> <italic>concerns only the compartment models with similar numbers of parameters, but not the significantly lower-dimensional MM and SI models – a consistent selection framework is missing; (c) for key validation experiments the experimental data is either not shown (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5C,D</italic></xref><italic>), or predictions and experimental data are significantly different (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6D</italic></xref><italic>), both of which do not lend evidence to the overall claim of a validated quantitative model.</italic></p><p>a) We have revised the model selection scheme. First of all, we have repeated the entire model selection procedure by taking into account the variability of repeated experiments. The experimental deviations increase with increasing concentrations. For this reason we have decided to use the following distance function in the ABC-SMC framework:</p><p><inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>d</mml:mtext><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:munder><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true"><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo></mml:mstyle><mml:mtext>i</mml:mtext></mml:munder><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mtext>x</mml:mtext><mml:mtext>i</mml:mtext></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">ϵ</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mtext>x</mml:mtext><mml:mtext>i</mml:mtext></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mtext>x</mml:mtext><mml:mtext>i</mml:mtext><mml:mtext>*</mml:mtext></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mtext>x</mml:mtext><mml:mtext>i</mml:mtext><mml:mtext>*</mml:mtext></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula></p><p>x* denotes the experimental data, x the simulation results and ε is a random variable drawn from a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 0.1 (error term); this approach has previously been proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Toni et al., 2009</xref>. In this way the simulations are perturbed before being compared to the mean of the experimental data. While the details of the model fits and the intermediate model probabilities are changed using this revised distance function, the final winning model remains the same for all pairwise model comparisons.</p><p>b) We have also extended the Bayesian model selection scheme to include all models (therefore the model numbering has changed in the revised manuscript). We start with the first 4 models (lower dimensional non-compartmentalized models) and have performed model selection simultaneously. This is feasible because the number of parameters in these models is small enough in order to efficiently explore the model and parameter sample space simultaneously. The chosen model (M4) is then compared to the simplest compartmentalized model (M5). The winning model M5 is then further tested using the pairwise model comparison scheme as previously.</p><p>All relevant figures and figure supplements were revised for the new schematic and results.</p><p>c) With permission from the authors of Kisselev et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kisselev et al., 2002</xref>) we have reproduced figures showing some of the results of their paper. These figures are now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4 C-D</xref>. Our in silico predictions are based on fits to Suc-LLVY-MCA and Bz-VGR-MCA degradation by mouse proteasome. The experimental data by Kisselev et al. were, however, generated using rabbit muscle and yeast proteasome, respectively. Furthermore they did use the peptide Boc-LLR-MCA instead of Bz-VGR-MCA, and Suc-FLF-MNA instead of Suc-LLVY-MCA as a regulator peptide. There are a host of other potential differences related to the type of proteasome preparation, the used buffer and further experimental conditions. Because of these differences in experimental setup we did never expect an exact quantitative agreement between the results published by Kisselev et al. and our in silico predictions. We were rather hoping for qualitative agreement, confirming the basic model mechanisms, which we did indeed find.</p><p>The newly added figure should allow for easier comparison. We furthermore removed the in silico predictions based on Z-LLE-MCA, because we do not have experimental data that these predictions can be compared to, and this should further clarify our presentation. We have also included a statement in the main text that sets out the expected quantitative differences.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> (which is now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) we have revised the in silico predictions for the proteasomal substrate degradation in the presence of Rpt peptides. In the previous version we simulated the Rpt experiments simply by multiplying the <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>in</italic></sub> rate by a factor. This factor was the same for all three substrates and it was not calibrated in any way against known or measurable Rpt properties. This is a very simple approximation of the functioning of Rpt peptides, which in reality should have a binding kinetic to the alpha-rings, and upon binding, induce a conformational change that results in an increased <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>in</italic></sub> rate for each substrate. Furthermore, since Rpt is changing the gate conformation, the rate <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>out</italic></sub> might also be influenced, i.e. increased by a factor. In the revised version we calibrated these factors for each of the three substrates and now obtain quantitative similar time courses of the in silico predictions and the experimental results. Even though this way we have explored the mechanism of Rpt in more detail, there are still many other characteristics of Rpt peptides that can alter the hydrolysis, but which are ignored in the in silico predictions. For example, Rpt peptides might themselves be transported inside the proteasome chamber and be in competition with the actual substrates for chamber capacity and/or active site binding. But as much of the function of the Rpt peptides remains unknown we have taken a parsimonious description of their action and tried to minimize the</p><p>The resulting in silico predictions are now plotted including the mean and the 5%- and 95%-iles. We have also added standard deviations to the experimental data. We find that the revised in silico predictions are in excellent quantitative agreement with the experimental in vitro data (which is now clearer in the new graphical representation) and therefore validate our mechanistic model and the detected differences between s- and i-proteasomes.</p><p><italic>5) The paper needs to be carefully edited for brevity, and the Introduction should come to point much more quickly than it does at present. In particular, we ask you to remove the more philosophical discussion of the interplay between modeling and experiment in biology, that are currently part of the Introduction, including the associated conceptual schematic diagram. While we do not dispute the points you make, this paper is about a particular topic, that of modeling the reactions mediated by the proteasome, which we find quite interesting in its own right. The more global issues of modeling are not addressed by your work, and belong more appropriately in a review article.</italic></p><p>We have edited the paper in order to shorten it. In particular, we have removed the part that described the interplay between experiments and modeling (including the figure) from the Introduction. Furthermore we have shortened the Discussion, and we have tried to make the presentation of the results more concise without sacrificing clarity.</p><p>References:</p><p>Chis, O.-T., Banga, J.R., and Balsa-Canto, E.
