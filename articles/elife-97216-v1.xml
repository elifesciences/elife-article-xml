An influential hypothesis by Ohno (1970) posits that gene duplication helps genes tolerate new mutations and thus facilitates the evolution of new phenotypes. Competing hypotheses argue that deleterious mutations will usually inactivate gene duplicates too rapidly for Ohno’s hypothesis to work. We experimentally tested Ohno’s hypothesis by evolving one or exactly two copies of a gene encoding a fluorescent protein in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> through several rounds of mutation and selection. We analyzed the genotypic and phenotypic evolutionary dynamics of the evolving populations through high-throughput DNA sequencing, biochemical assays, and engineering of selected variants. In support of Ohno’s hypothesis, populations carrying two gene copies displayed higher mutational robustness than those carrying a single gene copy. Consequently, the double-copy populations experienced relaxed purifying selection, evolved higher phenotypic and genetic diversity, carried more mutations and accumulated combinations of key beneficial mutations earlier. However, their phenotypic evolution was not accelerated, possibly because one gene copy rapidly became inactivated by deleterious mutations. Our work provides an experimental platform to test models of evolution by gene duplication, and it supports alternatives to Ohno’s hypothesis that point to the importance of gene dosage.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Inside all living things, genes carry instructions to make and maintain the body. Individuals carefully maintain their set of genes, known as the genome, to pass their appearance and other traits on to the next generation. Sometimes a particular gene may be duplicated so that cells end up with an extra copy in their genome.</p><p>Typically, around 50% of genes are duplicated in genomes and these duplicates may then accumulate changes (or “mutations”) that enable them to adopt new roles in the body. Some mutations may be harmful to the body and lead to the mutated gene being inactivated.</p><p>In 1970, the researcher Susumu Ohno proposed that when two copies of the same gene are present, they can accumulate more mutations than a single copy would while maintaining function. As a result, duplicated genes may thus evolve new properties and roles in the body more rapidly than single-copy genes. However, it has been difficult to design experiments to test this hypothesis.</p><p>A protein known as GFP emits green light when it absorbs certain colors of light, a phenomenon known as fluorescence. To test Ohno’s hypothesis, Mihajlovic et al. developed an experimental system to place one or two copies of the gene that encodes GFP into bacteria known as <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. The team then introduced mutations into these genes and simulated evolution by selecting bacteria on their ability to emit green, blue or both lights.</p><p>The experiments found that part of Ohno’s hypothesis is correct. Bacteria with two gene copies were more likely to retain their ability to emit green light after mutations than bacteria with one copy. However, gene duplication did not accelerate the evolution of more fluorescent GFPs or of new functions of the protein, such as emitting blue light. Instead, one copy of the gene often became inactivated by harmful mutations. This suggests that there may be other reasons beyond those proposed by Ohno to explain why gene duplications are so common in nature – for instance, by enhancing protein production.</p><p>The experimental system developed in this work serves as a platform for further investigations into Ohno’s hypothesis, which may help us better understand the origins of genetic diversity in bacteria and other forms of life.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>gene duplication</kwd><kwd>mutational robustness</kwd><kwd>experimental evolution</kwd><kwd>directed evolution</kwd><kwd>phenotypic diversity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>310030_200532</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schaerli</surname><given-names>Yolanda</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A_175608</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schaerli</surname><given-names>Yolanda</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A_172887</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wagner</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.3030/739874</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wagner</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fondation Herbette</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schaerli</surname><given-names>Yolanda</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006447</institution-id><institution>University of Zurich</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>URPP Evolution in Action</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schaerli</surname><given-names>Yolanda</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Experimental evolution of a duplicated gene increases mutational robustness relative to a single-copy gene but does not accelerate phenotypic evolution.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Because gene duplication is frequent in genome evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lynch and Conery, 2000a</xref>), it is a main source of material for novel proteins. The gene copies resulting from a gene duplication may have a variety of fates. First, loss-of-function mutations may inactivate one of the gene copies or lead to its loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lynch and Conery, 2000a</xref>). Second, both copies might be conserved by natural selection for increased gene dosage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kondrashov, 2010</xref>). Third, mutations can cause a partial loss-of-function in either duplicate, such that the pre-duplication functions become partitioned among the duplicates in a process called sub-functionalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Force et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hittinger and Carroll, 2007</xref>). Finally, duplicates can gradually diverge and evolve distinct novel functions (neo-functionalization) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ohno, 1970</xref>).</p><p>The factors that determine which of these outcomes occurs are still poorly understood, even though gene duplication has been the subject of many studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Force et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hittinger and Carroll, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dhar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lynch and Force, 2000b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Näsvall et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ogino et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Voordeckers et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pougach et al., 2014</xref>). The last outcome, in which natural selection helps to create functional diversity from complete redundancy, has attracted the most interest, which led to multiple evolutionary models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hittinger and Carroll, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ohno, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Näsvall et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bergthorsson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Des Marais and Rausher, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hughes, 1994</xref>). The earliest and most influential was developed by Susumu Ohno in his book ‘<italic>Evolution by gene duplication’ (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ohno, 1970</xref>). Ohno wrote that the most important role of a new gene copy is to provide redundancy. The redundant copy could escape from ‘the relentless pressure of natural selection’ and accumulate ‘formerly forbidden mutations’ to ‘emerge as a new gene locus with a hitherto unknown function’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ohno, 1970</xref>). Expressed in modern language, gene duplication increases the mutational robustness of the phenotype produced by the gene duplicates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wagner, 2008</xref>), which relaxes the selection pressure on either duplicate, accelerates the accumulation of genetic diversity, and thus facilitates the evolution of new gene functions and phenotypes.</p><p>Ohno’s model faces a fundamental challenge. Beneficial mutations that create new gene functions are much rarer than deleterious mutations that impair or destroy gene functions. Thus, deleterious mutations may usually cause a loss of function of one duplicate long before rare beneficial mutations lead to its functional divergence. This problem is known as Ohno’s dilemma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bergthorsson et al., 2007</xref>). It has led to several alternative hypotheses for the emergence of novel protein functions after gene duplication (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Innan and Kondrashov, 2010</xref>). They include the ‘mutations during non-functionality’ model (MDN) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hughes, 1994</xref>; the ‘Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation’ model (DDC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Force et al., 1999</xref>), the ‘Escape from Adaptive Conflict’ model (EAC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hittinger and Carroll, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Des Marais and Rausher, 2008</xref>), and the ‘Innovation-Amplification-Divergence’ model (IAD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Näsvall et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bergthorsson et al., 2007</xref>). In the last model, a duplicate gene can be temporarily present in more than two copies.</p><p>Most empirical data about the evolution of duplicated genes comes from comparative genomic data analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Conant and Wolfe, 2008</xref>). Typically, pertinent studies compare duplicated genes (paralogs) with their single-copy relatives (orthologs) in related species. Quantities like the number of amino acid changes and the ratio between non-synonymous and synonymous mutations are used as proxies for evolutionary rates and selection pressures, respectively. Such studies usually do not provide a phenotypic characterization of duplicates, especially when conducted on a genome-wide scale. Some individual duplicates and their evolutionary trajectories have been studied in more detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ogino et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Voordeckers et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pougach et al., 2014</xref>). However, the comparative method mainly captures duplicates that are already fixed, functional, and selectively maintained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Force et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hittinger and Carroll, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lynch and Force, 2000b</xref>). In addition, little information is usually available about the environmental conditions under which these duplicated genes have evolved. Moreover, the comparative method cannot easily distinguish the contribution of mutations to the divergence of a gene’s coding region, to its regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hittinger and Carroll, 2007</xref>, and to its interaction with other genes and their products (e.g. in protein complexes or as part of a regulatory network) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pougach et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Teichmann and Babu, 2004</xref>). All of these factors can be important for the evolutionary fate of duplicated genes.</p><p>Experimental evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnold, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Elena and Lenski, 2003</xref>) can mitigate the shortcomings of the comparative method. The DNA of populations evolved in the laboratory can be sequenced during any such experiment to reconstruct their evolutionary dynamics in detail. Any phenotype of interest can be carefully monitored during evolution. Thus, experimental evolution can help study both genotypic and phenotypic evolution. In addition, evolution experiments can be designed to test specific hypotheses, such as Ohno’s hypothesis.</p><p>A type of evolution experiment well-suited to testing Ohno’s hypothesis is directed evolution, which evolves individual genes by repeated rounds of mutagenesis and selection for specific phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnold, 2018</xref>). Directed evolution is not only highly useful for generating commercially important proteins, it can also provide fundamental insights about protein evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Soskine and Tawfik, 2010</xref>). Fluorescent proteins are especially useful for such experiments, because their phenotype can be measured in every individual of large microbial populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Iyengar and Wagner, 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zheng et al., 2020</xref>). However, few studies have used experimental evolution thus far to investigate the evolution of duplicated genes. These studies underline the importance of gene duplication in providing fast adaptation under changing environmental conditions. In some studies one copy was lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dhar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Holloway et al., 2007</xref>), while in others, additional copies were gained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Näsvall et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kugelberg et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tomanek et al., 2020</xref>). Together these studies highlight that gene dosage and selection for dosage can play an important role during the evolution of duplicated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dhar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Näsvall et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Holloway et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kugelberg et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tomanek et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tomanek and Guet, 2022</xref>).</p><p>These studies also raise the question of whether gene duplication can provide an advantage beyond its effects on gene dosage. To find out it is necessary to study the evolution of gene duplicates while keeping the copy number of the duplicated gene exactly at two. This is challenging because gene duplication causes recombinational instability and high variability in copy number. No previous experimental studies were designed to control copy number. Here, we present an experimental system that allowed us to keep the copy number fixed at one or two genes, and to follow the evolution of each gene copy in the absence of any dosage increase.</p><p>Briefly, we expressed a fluorescent protein in one or two copies in <italic>Escherichia coli (E. coli</italic>) and subjected it to multiple rounds of directed evolution under different conditions. We then analyzed the evolving populations at both the genotypic and phenotypic levels. We observed that in the early stages of evolution, populations carrying two gene copies displayed higher mutational robustness compared to those carrying a single gene copy. As a consequence, populations with two copies experienced relaxed purifying selection, evolved higher phenotypic and genetic diversity, carried more mutations, and accumulated combinations of key mutations earlier than the control populations with one copy. However, this did not manifest in accelerated phenotypic evolution in double-copy populations, possibly because one gene copy rapidly becomes inactivated by deleterious mutations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experimental design</title><p>To experimentally study the evolutionary consequences of gene duplication, we performed directed evolution of a fluorescent protein, that is expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> from a single gene (single copy) or two identical genes (double copy).

When excited with light at a wavelength of 388 nm, its emission spectrum has two maxima, the first corresponding to blue color (456 nm) and the second corresponding to green color (507 nm), which may be caused by two different protonation states of the chromophore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ogoh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hanson et al., 2002</xref>). Because the ratio of blue and green emission is pH sensitive, we used buffers to maintain a constant pH during evolution (Methods). Therefore, any changes in fluorescence we observed during evolution are due to genotypic changes caused by mutations. Amino acid substitutions at position 147 of this GFP lead to different ratios of blue and green fluorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ogoh et al., 2013</xref>). The starting point of our evolutionary experiments was a variant with a glycine at residue 147 that fluoresces about equally brightly in green and blue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We call this variant our ancestral protein.</p><p>We mimicked the duplication event by placing two copies of the <italic>cogfp</italic> gene on a plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). To avoid recombinational copy number instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dhar et al., 2014</xref>), we inserted the two copies in opposing (convergently transcribed) directions. We placed the two copies under independent control of the inducible promoters P<sub>tet</sub> (inducible by anhydrotetracycline (aTc)) and P<sub>tac</sub> (inducible by isopropyl-β-D-1-thiogalactopyranosid (IPTG)), which allowed us to express either both copies or only one copy at a time. To compare the evolution of a duplicated gene to the evolution of a single gene, we created an identical control plasmid with two gene copies, but inactivated one of the copies by three amino acids substitutions in the chromophore region (Q74A, Y75S, G76A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barondeau et al., 2005</xref>). The advantage of this control single-copy plasmid is that it is the same size as the double-copy plasmid with two intact copies, and produces the same amount of protein, which allowed us to avoid differences in plasmid size and protein expression as confounding factors for our experiments. When induced with both aTc and IPTG the double-copy plasmid shows ∼1.5-fold higher fluorescence than the single-copy plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental evolution of a duplicated fluorescent protein.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>E. coli</italic> cells carry a plasmid containing a duplicated gene coding for coGFP.

In our study system, robustness refers to the preservation of the fluorescence phenotype after DNA mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). To test this prediction, we determined the fraction of cells that were still able to maintain their fluorescence after mutagenesis (shown for <italic>green</italic> selection regime in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, and for the other regimes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). In the first generation of the <italic>green</italic> selection regime, mutagenesis (before applying any selection) led to loss of fluorescence in 73.7% of variants from single-copy plasmids, but only in 59% of variants from double-copy plasmids. Thus, our gene duplicates are indeed more robust to mutations. This difference can be explained with a simple probability calculation, based on our observation that mutagenesis preserves fluorescence in a single-copy of coGFP with a probability of 0.26. Specifically, this calculation predicts that 100×0.74<sup>2</sup> = 55% of members of the double-copy population have no active copy anymore, which is close to the 60% we observed.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Gene duplication increases mutational robustness.</title><p>The vertical axis shows mutational robustness, measured as the percentage of cells that maintain their fluorescence after mutagenesis, as a function of time (in generations of directed evolution) on the horizontal axis.

In other words, mutations that increase fluorescence are in the minority. Purifying selection is weaker in double-copy than in single-copy populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), a pattern that is again consistent with an increase in mutational robustness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and rapid inactivation of one copy in at least some individuals of double-copy populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).

The mutations G147S and V162D swept to the highest frequency under selection for green fluorescence. While mutations at position 147 have been previously described to influence coGFPS’s fluorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ogoh et al., 2013</xref>), the mutation with the highest frequency V162D, which reaches a median frequency of 99% in both single- and double-copy populations, has not been described as such. Both G147S and V162D lead to a more polar environment around chromophore residue Y75, thus facilitating proton transfer and green light emission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hanson et al., 2002</xref>). One additional mutation (L98M) reached high frequency under selection for green fluorescence, but it also did so in all other selection regimes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Like L98M, the additional mutations S2I, V141I, and V25L also occurred in all selection regimes, but they reached lower frequencies than L98M during the five generations of the experiment. We hypothesized that mutations observed in all selection regimes do not derive their benefit from increasing the intensity of any one fluorescent color. Instead, they may increase protein expression, solubility, or thermal stability.</p><p>To confirm the phenotypic effects of these mutations, we engineered them individually into the ancestral protein sequence and measured the fluorescence of the resulting protein variants both when expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells and as purified proteins in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). This analysis confirmed the green-shifting effect (i.e. an increase in the ratio of green to blue fluorescence) of the mutations G147S and V162D. Interestingly, the purified protein carrying the green-shifting mutation G147S does not fluoresce more intensely than the ancestral protein, but <italic>E. coli</italic> cells expressing this variant do.

Theoretically, the probability that at least one gene copy experiences a specific mutation is two times higher in double-copy populations than in single-copy populations, but subsequently, the frequencies of these mutations are dictated by the strength of selection for them. We found that the double-copy populations have a higher median frequency of mutation G147S in generations 2 and 3, of mutation V162D in generations 1 and 2, and L98M in generations 3 through 5 (Generalized linear model, ANOVA p&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table2">Appendix 1—table 2</xref>) than single-copy populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

To this end, we needed to maintain a constant and stable copy number of duplicated genes during experimental evolution. This is challenging because of the recombinational instability inherent to repetitive DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dhar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dunham et al., 2002</xref>). By drawing on our experience of using synthetic biology to study molecular evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schaerli et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baier et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Santos-Moreno et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baier and Schaerli, 2021</xref>), we designed a plasmid system that meets this challenge. It allowed us to evolve a fluorescent protein encoded by either double-copy or single-copy <italic>cogfp</italic> genes.</p><p>Using this system, we experimentally confirmed the prediction that gene duplication increases mutational robustness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ohno, 1970</xref>) and renders cells more resistant to genetic perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Payne and Wagner, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wagner, 2005</xref>). Specifically, we showed that mutations are less likely to eliminate fluorescence in evolving populations with two gene copies than with one gene copy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) during the first two generations of our evolution experiment. Thereafter, the difference in robustness between single-copy and double-copy populations disappeared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). A likely reason is that in double-copy populations mutations rapidly deactivate one of the two copies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>It is worth noticing that robustness increased throughout the experiment. Specifically, from the third generation onwards, robustness was always higher than in the preceding generation for the single-copy populations and the same was true for double-copy populations starting in the fourth generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This is likely due to the accumulation of stabilizing mutations. Indeed, we observed that such a mutation, L98M, became fixed in all populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This is in agreement with previous work demonstrating that stabilizing mutations increase robustness and tend to accumulate in directed evolution experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bratulic et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Socha and Tokuriki, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tokuriki et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The increased mutational robustness led to the accumulation of more mutations per <italic>cogfp</italic> genes in double-copy populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), and to greater genetic diversity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) during early post-duplication evolution. The increased robustness also caused a relaxation of selection, manifested in the ratio dN/dS of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5CD</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goldman and Yang, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kimura, 1977</xref>). This ratio stayed below one, indicating purifying selection, in both single-copy and double-copy populations, but it was significantly higher in double-copy populations, pointing to relaxed purifying selection in these populations during the first three generations. Our observations are consistent with data from comparative genomics studies, which show relaxed selection shortly after gene duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lynch and Conery, 2003</xref>). They also show that this relaxation is very short-lived, because most duplicates become either deactivated or diverge in function shortly after duplication.</p><p>Despite our directional selection for increased green fluorescence, dN/dS stayed below one throughout the evolution experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5CD</xref>). This can be explained by the observation that there are far fewer beneficial mutations than deleterious mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sarkisyan et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, we identified and characterized only three key mutations that reached high frequencies in all populations selected for green fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>): G147S, V162D, and L98M. While G147S has previously been described to influence the fluorescence of coGFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ogoh et al., 2013</xref>), to the best of our knowledge we are the first to report the green-shifting effect of V162D in coGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Both mutations are predicted to make the environment around chromophore residue Y75 more polar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s6">Figure 6—figure supplement 6</xref>), thus promoting proton transfer and green emission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hanson et al., 2002</xref>). In contrast, L98M does not change the fluorescence directly, but increases the structural stability of the protein (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>) and the fraction of folded protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>Although our ability to regulate the expression of the two <italic>cogfp</italic> copies independently allows us to study which of the two copies remains active in individual clones of a population, our experimental design does not allow us to distinguish active from inactive copies in a whole population from sequencing data alone. The reason is that we do not know which mutations (and combinations thereof) have deleterious effects, with the exception of (rare) premature stop codons and frame-shift mutations. In consequence, we cannot determine with certainty whether increased mutational robustness or rapid deactivation of one of two duplicates is primarily responsible for the increased accumulation of diversity in double-copy populations. In the future, sorting the double-copy population for variants with one active gene copy and for variants with two active gene copies, followed by high-throughput sequencing of these two subpopulations, might help to quantify the relative contributions of mutational robustness and gene inactivation.</p><p>Ohno also predicted that the increased robustness and genetic diversity entailed by gene duplication facilitates phenotypic evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ohno, 1970</xref>). To validate this prediction, we evolved coGFP populations under directional selection for green fluorescence, and asked whether double-copy populations change their phenotype faster. Green fluorescence was higher in double-copy populations throughout directed evolution, but the difference was smaller than the initial difference caused by the duplication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). It is worth noting that we evolved each of our single- and double-copy populations separately and in parallel to follow their individual evolutionary trajectories. In a natural population, individuals with one or two copies might occur in the same population and compete against each other. In this situation any dosage advantage of a duplicate gene would itself entail selective benefit. Our approach allowed us to find out if gene duplication facilitates phenotypic evolution beyond any such gene dosage effect. At least for the specific gene, selection pressures, and mutation rates we used, the data suggest that it does not.</p><p>Our data also suggests two candidate explanations for this finding. The first is that the genetic changes needed to alter fluorescence in coGFP are simple and mediated by single amino acid changes, such as G147S and V162D. Both changes provide a bigger fitness (fluorescence) advantage to their carrier than the increased gene dosage of double-copy populations (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Given our high mutation rates and large population sizes (&gt;10,000 individuals) both mutations occur early during evolution and reach a frequency &gt;0.1% in the first generation and in both single-copy and double-copy populations. If multiple mutations were crucial to increase fluorescence, double-copy populations may have a greater advantage. This possibility is consistent with our observation that combinations of beneficial mutations emerged earlier in double-copy populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). A second, non-exclusive explanation may be the rapid inactivation of one gene copy by deleterious mutations in double-copy populations, which affected 38% of individuals in generation 1, and up to 81% after generation four (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). This means that any beneficial mutations that convey an advantage to double-copy populations must occur very early after duplication.</p><p>It will be important to confirm our findings with other genes and different selection pressures. The reason is that the dynamics of mutation-driven phenotypic evolution after gene duplication may depend on gene-specific details, such as the fraction of mutations that are deleterious, or the number of mutations that are needed for a phenotypic change.</p><p>The challenge that a duplicated gene copy must remain free of frequent deleterious mutations long enough to acquire beneficial mutations that provide a new selectable phenotype is known as Ohno’s dilemma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bergthorsson et al., 2007</xref>). Our experiments confirm that this challenge is highly relevant for post-duplication evolution. Other models such as the innovation-amplification-divergence (IAD) model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Näsvall et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bergthorsson et al., 2007</xref>) postulate that this dilemma can be resolved through an increase in gene dosage that allows latent pre-duplication phenotypes to come under the influence of selection. To distinguish between the effects of gene dosage and other benefits of gene duplication, we prevented recombination and gene amplification to prevent copy number increases beyond two copies. We are aware that our experimental design does not reflect how evolution may occur in the wild. However, this design allowed us to study evolutionary forces separately that are otherwise difficult to disentangle.</p><p>In addition, because evolution experiments need to occur on laboratory time scales, such experiments incorporate design elements that may cause the evolutionary dynamics to differ from that in the wild. Examples include the use of plasmids with copy numbers higher than one, high mutation rates, and intense selection. It is possible that under natural conditions the higher frequency of beneficial mutations in the early evolution of our double-copy populations might lead to a bigger advantage of gene duplication than we observed.</p><p>The coGFP protein can be viewed as a simple model of a promiscuous protein, because of its dual color (green and blue) fluorescence. A proposed resolution to Ohno’s dilemma is that the ‘innovation’ usually associated with neofunctionalization actually precedes gene duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hughes, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Piatigorsky and Wistow, 1991</xref>). This means that the ancestral gene, in addition to its main activity, has one or several minor side activities, i.e., it encodes a promiscuous protein. Promiscuity is a wide-spread property of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Copley, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Copley et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Khersonsky and Tawfik, 2010</xref>). It might thus play a key role in the critical early stages of post-duplication evolution, where selection for a side activity may help maintain a new gene copy until emerging mutations can further improve this activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Näsvall et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kondrashov et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Copley, 2020</xref>). If the two activities show a strong trade-off, improvement of one would entail deterioration of the other. A single gene encoding such a protein suffers from an adaptive conflict between the two activities. Gene duplication may provide an escape from this adaptive conflict, because each duplicate may specialize on one activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Des Marais and Rausher, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hughes, 1994</xref>). For coGFP, a trade-off likely exists for fluorescence in these two colors, because improvement of green fluorescence entails a loss of blue fluorescence during evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). We, therefore, expected that during selection for both green and blue fluorescence, one <italic>cogfp</italic> copy in double-copy populations would ‘specialize’ on green fluorescence whereas the other copy would specialize on blue fluorescence. However, when we analyzed individual population members with two active gene copies we could not find any such specialization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s7">Figure 6—figure supplement 7</xref>). Moreover, the identified key mutations at positions 147 and 162 have a very low frequency (&lt;1%) in these populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Future experiments with different selection strategies might reveal the reasons for this observation and the conditions under which such a specialization can occur.</p><p>In summary, we established an experimental system that allowed us to gain time-resolved phenotypic and genotypic data on the evolution of (exactly) two gene copies to directly test Ohno’s hypothesis. Our experiments support that gene duplication increases the mutational robustness of gene duplicates. They also demonstrate that this leads to increased genetic diversity. However, we did not observe accelerated phenotypic evolution or specialization for different phenotypes. Further experiments will be necessary to clarify if these phenomena could occur under different conditions.</p><p>Importantly, our experimental system could help to answer many further questions about the evolution of duplicated genes. For example, by allowing the expression of duplicates to be controlled independently from each other, it can help answer how differential expression may affect both genotypic and phenotypic evolution after gene duplication. Furthermore, it could be used to study gene duplication under selection pressures that change in time, favoring one or the other color phenotype at different times. It could also be used to study the co-evolution of regulatory regions and gene coding regions. In sum, our system not only allowed us to validate a long-standing and difficult to test hypothesis about evolution by gene duplication, it also provides a platform for further evolutionary studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Cavernularia obesa</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Cogfp</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23468077/">23468077</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">codon-optimised for <italic>E. coli</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>E. coli</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NEB5α</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">New England Biolabs</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pAND (plasmid)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24316737/">24316737</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:Addgene_49377">Addgene_49377</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pAND-MCS (plasmid)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">this paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:Addgene_223514">Addgene_223514</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">sequence and plasmid available via Addgene</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pDUP (plasmid)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">this paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:Addgene_223515">Addgene_223515</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">sequence and l plasmid available via Addgene</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pDUP1 (plasmid)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">this paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:Addgene_223516">Addgene_223516</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">sequence and plasmid available via Addgene</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pDUP2 (plasmid)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">this paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:Addgene_223517">Addgene_223517</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">sequence and plasmid available via Addgene</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Commercial assay or kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Illustra TempliPhi DNA Amplification Kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GE Healthcare</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GE Healthcare #25640010</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Commercial assay or kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SMRTbell Barcoded Adapter Complete Prep Kit 96</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Pacific Biosciences</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PacBio #

As a starting point for this construction, we used the pAND plasmid (Addgene #49377; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stanton et al., 2014</xref>), a kind gift from Christopher Voigt. This plasmid contains a p15A origin of replication, which causes the plasmid to persist at approximately 10 copies/cell. It also encodes the transcriptional repressors LacI and TetR and a kanamycin resistance gene. We removed the NdeI restriction site from TetR, using site-directed mutagenesis with the pair of primers LJM06_f and LJM06_r (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table3">Appendix 1—table 3</xref>). Next, we designed and synthesized (Invitrogen, GeneArt) a multiple cloning site (MCS), a bidirectional terminator BBa_B0014 in the registry of standard biological parts (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_B0014">https://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_B0014</ext-link>), P<sub>tet</sub> and P<sub>tac</sub> operators, as well as restriction sites, to be able to insert the two copies of the <italic>cogfp</italic> gene. To insert the MCS, we first amplified the backbone with the primers LJM07_r and LJM08_f to introduce EcoRI and NotI restriction sites.

We also included the anti-dimerization mutations S129G, C154S, D156G, K204I, and N209Y as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ogoh et al., 2013</xref>) and added an N-terminal His-tag. We then let this sequence synthesize (Invitrogen, GeneArt). We cloned the sequence into pAND-MCS at the position 1 (under P<sub>tet</sub>) using the restriction enzymes NdeI and SacI, followed by ligation to yield pDUP.

We heated the sample to 95 °C for 3 min, then cooled and combined it with 5.3 µl of reaction mix that contains salts and deoxynucleotides. Addition of Phi29 polymerase (0.2 µl) initiated the amplification reaction that we incubated for 20 hr at 30 °C. At the end of the incubation, we inactivated the DNA polymerase by incubation at 65 °C for 10 min.</p><p>We then digested the TempliPhi reaction products (10.8 µl) using NdeI and NcoI, with addition of DpnI (each 20 U) in NEBuffer CutSmart to a final volume of 20 µl.

We confirmed the purity of proteins by SDS-PAGE showing only a single band corresponding to coGFP for all variants (&gt;95% purity).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Fluorescence spectra of purified coGFP variants</title><p>To measure fluorescence spectra of engineered coGFP variants, we used freshly purified protein (0.05 mg/ml in elution buffer). For each engineered coGFP variants, we performed measurements in triplicates with 120 µl of protein solution per well in 96-well plates, with an excitation wavelength of 388 nm and an emission bandpass filter of 430–550 nm (Biotek, Synergy H1).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Western blot of coGFP variants</title><p>To determine changes in expression level and solubility of coGFP variants we performed SDS-PAGE (Sodium dodecyl-sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) followed by immunostaining for His-tagged coGFP of clarified cell lysate. In preparation for gel electrophoresis, we inoculated cell cultures from the glycerol stocks into 2 ml LB-Kan medium and incubated overnight at 37 °C. To induce CoGFP expression, we used 40 µl of the overnight culture, inoculated 2 ml of the fresh LB-Kan medium containing 100 µM IPTG, and incubated at 30 °C for 16 hr. We centrifuged cell cultures at 10,000 g for 8 min to collect the cell pellet. We lysed cell cultures using 100 µl lysis buffer and clarified them by spinning at 10,000 g for 10 min at 4 °C. We transferred 30 µl of the supernatant into 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube and mixed with 4 x SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 0.1 M fresh Dithiothreitol (DTT) and heated for 10 min at 95 °C. We used a precast gel (Biorad, 10% Mini-Protean, 10 wells) to load 15 µl of sample per well and a Biorad PAGE system for 5 min at 50 V, followed by 60 min at 100 V in Laemmli running buffer to separate them. Subsequently, we plotted gels onto a nitrocellulose membrane for 1 h at 100 V at 4 °C in Western Blot buffer (25 mM Tris, pH 8.3, 192 mM glycine, 1% SDS, 20% ethanol). After the transfer, the membrane was washed with milliQ water, and blocked for at least 1 hr with 5% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) in PBS-T buffer (PBS pH 7.5 with 0.1% Tween-20).</p><p>Next, we performed immunostaining to detect His-coGFP on the nitrocellulose membrane. We used Penta-His mouse monoclonal antibody (Qiagen, Qiagen #34660) at a 1:2000 dilution in 5% BSA in PBS-T buffer for 1 hr, followed by three washes with the PBS-T buffer, 15 min each. We added a secondary horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate antibody (goat anti-mouse, Sigma #12–349) at a 1:5000 dilution in 5% BSA in PBS-T, followed by three washes with PBS-T buffer for 10 min each. After washing, we added an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Biorad) solution. We used a Fusion Fx7 imaging system (Peqlab) for the visualization of the membrane.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) analysis</title><p>We performed size-exclusion chromatography of His-tag purified coGFP variants on an Äkta Pure chromatography system (GE Healthcare), with a Superdex 75 10/300 Increase column (GE Healthcare) at a flow rate of 0.5 mg/ml. The running buffer consisted of 20 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5 with 100 mM NaCl. We used the fractions of folded protein, to measure protein fluorescence at 388 nm excitation, 457 nm (blue), and 507 nm (green) emission, using a plate reader (Biotek, Synergy H1). We normalized protein concentrations to 0.01 mg/ml and measured protein fluorescence in triplicates in a 200 µl volume.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Modeling of coGFP mutations</title><p>Computational models of the coGFP wild-type protein were based on the coGFP uniprot sequence (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/T2HNK0">https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/T2HNK0</ext-link>) with the anti-dimerization mutations S129G, C154S, D156G, K204I, and N209Y (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ogoh et al., 2013</xref>) and additionally S147G. The models were built using the following templates:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Green Fluorescent Protein from <italic>Renilla reniformis</italic>, (Protein Data Base [PDB] id: 2RH7), with 51% of sequence identity to coGFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Loening et al., 2007</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p>GFP from Philippine soft coral (PDB id: 4JC2), with 46% of sequence identity to coGFP</p></list-item></list><p>100 models of each variant (single, double, and triple mutants) were calculated with modeler 9.18 v. The chromophore structure was modeled as a rigid body.</p><p>Protein stability changes between mutated and ancestral proteins were calculated for models using the FoldX 4.0 software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schymkowitz et al., 2005</xref>). Each mutation, as well as combinations of 2 and 3 mutations, were reversed to the ancestral sequence for each structure, and the predicted changes in structural stability were assessed. In the case of mutations G147S and V162D, only the structures with rotamers that allow formation of hydrogen bonds between G147S and chromophore residues, as well as between G147S and V162D were taken into account in the calculations (30–40 structures per mutant).</p><p>Structural stability (referred to as ΔG) is the difference in free energy between a protein in the folded and the unfolded state. Values of ΔG were calculated and compared for the ancestral protein and the mutated proteins. Therefore, we refer to the change in protein stability due to mutations as a change in the ΔG - the ΔΔG. A positive value of ΔΔG indicates a destabilizing effect of a mutation or set of mutations, whereas a negative value indicates a stabilizing effect of mutation. Additionally, the sum of impacts of single mutations was estimated to assess potential synergistic effect of the mutations. Figures of modeled structures were prepared with UCSF Chimera software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Processing of the sequencing data</title><p>PacBio SMRT sequencing reads the same circularized DNA molecule several times, i.e., in several ‘passes’ through the DNA. The proprietary software smrtlink (version 9) identifies a pass by the presence of an adapter sequence. Since our target DNA sequence is palindromic (double-copy of <italic>cogfp</italic> in opposite orientation), smrtlink cannot differentiate a single pass through the palindromic DNA from two passes of a single copy of <italic>cogfp</italic>. To identify the passes correctly, we used a recall adapter (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/recalladapters">https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/recalladapters</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pacific Biosciences, 2022</xref>) to manually splice adapter sequences in silico. The resulting data files could then be correctly processed using smrtlink. This processing involves two steps. The first is consensus calling, which generates a consensus sequence from multiple sequencing passes. This step reduces sequencing errors. The second step is demultiplexing, where different reads are assigned to different experimental samples based on barcode sequences. This step also converts the data from bam format to fasta format.</p><p>We aligned the resultant fasta files to the reference sequence using the program minimap2 (SMRT tools, PacBio). For subsequent analyses, we only used the reads that aligned completely with the reference sequence (full query coverage). We note that unaligned reads may result from contamination by <italic>E. coli</italic> genomic DNA. Furthermore, we reverse-complemented the reads that aligned with the reference sequence in the plus-minus orientation (i.e. reads that are the reverse complement of the reference sequence before alignment), so that all reads have the same orientation relative to the reference sequence. Such reads arise because SMRT sequencing reads DNA from a circularized template in both directions.</p><p>We used the reads thus filtered for a second round of alignment. Specifically, we performed a global alignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Needleman and Wunsch, 1970</xref>) to map the reads to the reference sequence, using the program needle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rice et al., 2000</xref>) to produce an alignment file in <italic>srspair</italic> format. A global alignment is necessary for an end-to-end alignment to the reference sequence, which cannot be achieved through a local alignment algorithm such as minimap2.</p><p>An inactive copy should contain the three specific mutations that we had engineered in place of the amino acids that form the fluorophore (Q74A, Y75S, G76A). However, we reasoned that absence of purifying selection on the inactive copy can cause the engineered mutations to be replaced by other mutations. Therefore, we designated a <italic>cogfp</italic> copy as inactive if it met any one of the following three criteria: First, the 75<sup>th</sup> amino acid in the protein sequence is not tryptophan, phenylalanine, or tyrosine. Second, the 76<sup>th</sup> amino acid is not glycine. Third, a premature stop codon exists anywhere between codon positions 1 and 220.</p><p>Next, we computed the frequencies of single amino-acid mutations and of multi-mutant genotypes in each copy of the <italic>cogfp</italic> gene using custom scripts written in the awk programming language. We did so for <italic>cogfp</italic> variants isolated after each round of evolution, for each replicate experiment, and for each of our six selection strategies. Our subsequent analyses focused on non-synonymous mutations, because they are more likely to alter the spectral properties of coGFP.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Analysis of sequence divergence</title><p>We used three metrics to understand the sequence evolution of our coGFP variants. The first is the number of amino-acid mutations relative to ancestral coGFP, which indicates how much the variants have diverged from the ancestor. The second metric is the average pairwise distance, which is the average number of amino acid differences between any two coGFP variant sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Iyengar and Wagner, 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Iyengar and Wagner, 2022b</xref>).

For example, mutations with significantly higher frequency in <italic>blue-only</italic> populations relative to <italic>green-only</italic> populations may be responsible for a color shift towards blue fluorescence. In a first step, we performed this analysis for single-copy libraries selected only for <italic>blue</italic> or <italic>green</italic> fluorescence. The reason is that the fluorescence of populations with two intact gene copies can result from the fluorescence of two different <italic>cogfp</italic> variants expressed in the same cell, which makes it difficult to establish which mutations are responsible for the phenotype.</p><p>To focus on mutations with the strongest influence on fluorescence, we restricted this analysis to mutations that reached the frequency of at least 5% after five rounds of evolution, in at least one replicate population selected for <italic>blue-only</italic> or <italic>green-only</italic>. We then used generalized linear models (GLM) to identify mutations that are significantly more frequent at the end of evolution in populations selected only for blue fluorescence than in populations selected only for green fluorescence, and vice versa. Specifically, we fitted a GLM with a binomial model (logit link function), using mutation counts as a response variable, and selection strategy (<italic>blue-only</italic> and <italic>green-only</italic>) as the predictor variable. Next, we performed an analysis of deviance with a likelihood ratio test using the function ANOVA (R stats package v3.4.4). This function analyses if the fitted GLM is significantly better than a null model where mutation frequencies are not affected by the selection strategy. We adjusted the resulting p-values using a Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. We identified mutations as differentially enriched if their Bonferroni-corrected p-values are lower than 0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Software, Formal analysis, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-97216-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="sdata1"><label>Source data 1.</label><caption><title>Summary of single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing results.</title><p>Number of reads sequenced by SMRT sequencing and mean number of amino-acid changes per <italic>cogfp</italic> gene.

The G147S mutation alone is stabilizing the structure because of the hydrogen bond that it is forming with the chromophore Y75 residue (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>). The mutation of L98M is also changing favorably the structural stability due to longer Met side chain, that is able to form stabilizing hydrophobic interactions with V64 residue of the central helix of coGFP (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s6">Figure 6—figure supplement 6B</xref>). The L98 residue’s side chain is too short to contact the hydrophobic residues of the central helix of coGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s6">Figure 6—figure supplement 6A</xref>).</p><p>The V162D is destabilizing the structures, probably due to the presence of residue E194 in a close proximity of it and a potential electrostatic repulsion between these two equally charged side chains (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>). It is however possible, that pronounced destabilizing character of V162D mutation might be to some extent an artefact of the method, as the coGFP protein is negatively charged and every mutation increasing the negative charge, like V162D, is estimated as very unfavorable to the stability, whereas in reality, its local effects might not be that substantial. As a result, the potentially slightly destabilizing mutation of V162D is overestimated.</p><p>These results are in agreement with enrichments analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) as the V162D mutation is observed frequently only under green fluorescence selection, otherwise this mutation is not frequent. On the other hand, the L98M mutation is being observed frequently in all populations under all selection regimes, thanks to its structurally stabilizing role.</p><p>When paired with V162D, the otherwise stabilizing G147S mutation has, surprisingly, destabilizing effect, despite the possibility of hydrogen bond formation with the aspartate residue 162. It is in agreement with the fraction of folded protein measured for V162D_G147S that was lowest from all of the measured proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>). However, in case of the triple mutant, V162D, G147S, L98M, the protein has a higher structural stability than the sum of the single mutations’ ΔΔG values, pointing to synergistic effect of these mutations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>) that is in agreement with the triple mutant’s improved folding ability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="app1table2" position="float"><label>Appendix 1—table 2.</label><caption><title>Detailed statistics for data reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.</title><p>The test is based on a generalized linear model (binomial model, mutation counts vs library type, likelihood ratio test).

To directly test this, the authors make use of a fluorescent protein with two emission maxima, which allows to apply different selection regimes (e.g. selection for green AND blue, or, for green NOT blue). To achieve this feat without being distracted by more complex evolutionary dynamics caused by the frequent recombination between duplicates, the authors employ a well-controlled synthetic system to prevent recombination: Duplicates are placed on a plasmid as indirect repeats in a recombination-deficient strain of <italic>E. coli</italic>. The authors implement their directed evolution approach through in vitro mutagenesis and selection using fluorescent-activated cell sorting. Their in-depth analysis of evolved mutants in single-copy versus double-copy genotypes provides clear evidence for Ohno's postulate that redundant copies experience relaxed purifying selection. In contrast to Ohno's original postulate, however, the authors go on to show that this does not in fact lead to more rapid phenotypic evolution, but rather, the rapid inactivation of one of the copies.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This paper contributes with great experimental detail to an area where the literature predominantly leans on genomics data. Through the use of a carefully-designed, well-controlled synthetic system the authors are able to directly determine the phenotype &amp; genotype of all individuals in their evolving populations and compare differences between genotypes with a single or double copy of coGFP. With it they find clear evidence for what critics of Ohno's original model have termed &quot;Ohno's dilemma&quot;, the rapid non-functionalization by predominantly deleterious mutations.</p><p>Including an expressed but non-functional coGFP in (phenotypically) single copy genotypes provides an especially thoughtful control that allows determining a baseline dN/dS ratio in the absence of selection. All in all the study is an exciting example of how the clever use of synthetic biology can lead to new insights.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>In the revised version of the paper, the authors now discuss one potential weakness of their study, which is tied to its biggest strength (as often in experimental biology there is a trade-off between 'resolution' and 'realism').</p><p>The experimental set-up leaves out an important component of the evolutionary process in order to disentangle dosage effects from other effects that carrying two copies might have on their evolution. Specifically, by employing a recombination-deficient strain and constructing their duplicates as inverted repeats their experimental design completely abolishes recombination between the two copies. This was pointed out in my first review to be problematic for two reasons:</p><p>(i) In nature, new duplicates do not arise as inverted, but rather as direct (tandem) repeats and - as the authors correctly point out - these are very unstable, due to the fact that repeated DNA is prone to recA-dependent homologous recombination (which arise orders of magnitude more frequently than point mutations).</p><p>(ii) This instability often leads to further amplification of the duplicates under dosage selection both in the lab and in the wild (e.g. Andersson &amp; Hughes, Annu. Rev. Genet. 2009), and would presumably also be an outcome under the current experimental set-up if it was not prevented from happening?</p><p>In their revised version, the authors now address this point and with much clarity explain why their experimental system is so powerful to study the fate of a gene duplicate, not despite lacking recombination, but *because* it lacks recombination.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.97216.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Mihajlovic</surname><given-names>Ljiljana</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Lausanne</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Lausanne</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Iyengar</surname><given-names>Bharat Ravi</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Zurich</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Zurich</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Baier</surname><given-names>Florian</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of British Columbia</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Vancouver</named-content></addr-line><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Barbier</surname><given-names>Içvara</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Lausanne</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Lausanne</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Iwaszkiewicz</surname><given-names>Justyna</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Molecular Modeling Group, Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, 1015, Lausanne, Switzerland</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Lausanne</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zoete</surname><given-names>Vincent</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Lausanne</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Lausanne</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wagner</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Zurich</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Zurich</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Schaerli</surname><given-names>Yolanda</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Lausanne</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Lausanne</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p><p>This fundamental study uses a creative experimental system to directly test Ohno's hypothesis, which describes how and why new genes might evolve by duplication of existing ones.

We have now addressed the reviewer’s comments in a revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Overview:</p><p>The authors construct a pair of <italic>E. coli</italic> populations that differ by a single gene duplication in a selectable fluorescent protein. They then evolve the two populations under differing selective regimes to assess whether the end result of the selective process is a &quot;better&quot; phenotype when starting with duplicated copies. Importantly, their starting duplicated population is structured to avoid the duplication- amplification process often seen in bacterial artificial evolution experiments. They find that while duplication increases robustness and speed of adaptation, it does not result in more highly adapted final states, in contrast to Ohno's hypothesis.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>This is an excellent study with a very elegant experimental setup that allows a precise examination of the role of duplication in functional evolution, exclusive of other potential mechanisms. My main concern is to clarify some of the arguments relating to Ohno's hypothesis.</p><p>I think my main confusion on first reading the manuscript was in the precise definition of Ohno's hypothesis. I think this confusion was mine and not the authors, but it is likely common and could be addressed.</p><p>Most evolutionary biologists think of gene duplication as making neofunctionalization &quot;easier&quot; by providing functional redundancy and a larger mutational target, such that the evolutionary process of neofunctionalization is faster (as the authors observed). In this framework, the final evolved state might not differ when selection is applied to duplicated copies or a single-copy gene. Ohno's hypothesis, by contrast, argues that there generally exist adaptive conflicts between the ancestral function and the &quot;desired&quot; novel function, such that strong selection on a single-copy gene cannot produce the evolutionary optima that selection on two copies would. This idea is hinted at in the quotation from Ohno in paragraph 2 of the introduction. However, the sentences that follow I don't think reinforce this concept well enough and lead to some confusion.</p><p>With that definition in mind, I agree with the authors' conclusion that these data do not support Ohno's hypothesis. My quibble would be that what is actually shown here is that adaptive conflict in function is not universal: there are cases where a single gene can be optimized for multiple functions just as well as duplicated copies. I do not think the authors have, however, refuted the possibility that such adaptive conflicts are nonetheless a significant barrier to evolutionary innovation in the absence of gene duplication generally. Perhaps just a sentence or two to this effect might be appropriate.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the reviewer that trade-offs might play an important role in the evolution of single copy and of duplicated genes, depending on the gene and on the selection regime. And while trade-offs are not likely to play a big role in the selection regime we discuss in detail in the main text (evolution towards more green), they probably are important for at least one our selection regimes. In fact, we so state in the following passage of the discussion. In addition, we have now added a sentence that acknowledges the importance of trade-offs for evolution in the absence of gene duplication:</p><p>“A single gene encoding such a protein suffers from an adaptive conflict between the two activities. Gene duplication may provide an escape from this adaptive conflict, because each duplicate may specialize on one activity14, 15. For coGFP, a trade-off likely exists for fluorescence in these two colors, because improvement of green fluorescence entails a loss of blue fluorescence during evolution (Figure S8 and Figure S16). We therefore expected that during selection for both green and blue fluorescence, one <italic>cogfp</italic> copy in double-copy populations would “specialize” on green fluorescence whereas the other copy would specialize on blue fluorescence. However, when we analyzed individual population members with two active gene copies we could not find any such specialization (Figure S21). Moreover, the identified key mutations at positions 147 and 162 have a very low frequency (&lt;1%) in these populations (Figure S15). Future experiments with different selection strategies might reveal the reasons for this observation and the conditions under which such a specialization can occur.“</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I also think the authors need to clarify their approach to normalizing fluorescence between the two populations to control for the higher relative protein expression of the population with a duplicated gene. Since each population was independently selected with the highest fluorescing 60% (or less) of the cells selected, I think this normalization is appropriate. Of course, if the two populations were to compete against each other, this dosage advantage of the duplicates would itself be a selective benefit. Even as it is, the dosage advantage should be a source of purifying selection on the duplication, and perhaps this should be noted.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct. To be able to follow the evolutionary trajectories of the different constructs, the populations were treated separately. The gates were adjusted for each library separately to select for the top 60, 1 or 0.01% of cells and the gates for the double-copy populations were set to slightly higher fluorescence, reflected in the higher fluorescence of these populations in Figure 3A. Indeed, if individuals in these populations were to compete against each other, the double-copy populations would have a benefit due to the dosage advantage. However, as we already pointed out in the manuscript, we did not see any additional advantage beyond the increased gene dosage provided by the second copy (Figure 3B). To discuss this issue in more detail, we have now added the following text to the discussion:</p><p>“It is worth noting that we evolved each of our single- and double-copy populations separately and in parallel to follow their individual evolutionary trajectories. In a natural population, individuals with one or two copies might occur in the same population and compete against each other. In this situation any dosage advantage of a duplicate gene would itself entail selective benefit. Our approach allowed us to find out if gene duplication facilitates phenotypic evolution beyond any such gene dosage effect. At least for the specific genes, selection pressures, and mutation rates we used, the data suggest that it does not.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, I am slightly curious about the nature of the adaptations that are evolving. The authors primarily discuss a few amino-acid changing mutations that seem to fix early in the experiment. Looking at Figure 3, it however, appears that the populations are still evolving late in the experiment, and so presumably other changes are occurring later on. Do the authors believe that perhaps expression changes to increase protein levels are driving these later changes?</p></disp-quote><p>Figure S15 shows that some mutations are indeed still increasing in frequency during late evolutionary rounds, in particular S2L, V141L and V205L. We have measured the emission spectra of these mutants (Figure S16), and these mutations increase fluorescence both in green and blue. It is therefore likely that these mutations, similar to L98M, increase protein expression, solubility, or thermal stability, as suggested by the reviewer. We now clarify this matter in a new passage of the results:</p><p>“Like L98M, the additional mutations S2I, V141I and V25L also occurred in all selection regimes, but they reached lower frequencies than L98M during the 5 generations of the experiment. We hypothesized that mutations observed in all selection regimes do not derive their benefit from increasing the intensity of any one fluorescent color. Instead, they may increase protein expression, solubility, or thermal stability.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Drawing from tools of synthetic biology, Mihajlovic et al. use a cleverly designed experimental system to dissect Ohno's hypothesis, which describes the evolution of functional novelty on the gene-level through the process of duplication &amp; divergence.</p><p>Ohno's original idea posits that the redundancy gained from having two copies of the same gene allows one of them to freely evolve a new function. To directly test this, the authors make use of a fluorescent protein with two emission maxima, which allows them to apply different selection regimes (e.g. selection for green AND blue, or, for green NOT blue). To achieve this feat without being distracted by more complex evolutionary dynamics caused by the frequent recombination between duplicates, the authors employ a well-controlled synthetic system to prevent recombination: Duplicates are placed on a plasmid as indirect repeats in a recombination-deficient strain of <italic>E. coli</italic>. The authors implement their directed evolution approach through in vitro mutagenesis and selection using fluorescent-activated cell sorting. Their in-depth analysis of evolved mutants in single-copy versus double-copy genotypes provides clear evidence for Ohno's postulate that redundant copies experience relaxed purifying selection. In contrast to Ohno's original postulate, however, the authors go on to show that this does not in fact lead to more rapid phenotypic evolution, but rather, the rapid inactivation of one of the copies.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This paper contributes with great experimental detail to an area where the literature predominantly leans on genomics data. Through the use of a carefully designed, well-controlled synthetic system the authors are able to directly determine the phenotype &amp; genotype of all individuals in their evolving populations and compare differences between genotypes with a single or double copy of coGFP. With it they find clear evidence for what critics of Ohno's original model have termed &quot;Ohno's dilemma&quot;, the rapid non- functionalization by predominantly deleterious mutations.</p><p>Including an expressed but non-functional coGFP in (phenotypically) single copy genotypes provides an especially thoughtful control that allows determining a baseline dN/dS ratio in the absence of selection. All in all the study is an exciting example of how the clever use of synthetic biology can lead to new insights.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The major weakness of the study is tied to its biggest strength (as often in experimental biology there is a trade-off between 'resolution' and 'realism').</p><p>The paper ignores an important component of the evolutionary process in favour of an in-depth characterization of how two vs one copy evolve. Specifically, by employing a recombination-deficient strain and constructing their duplicates as inverted repeats their experimental design completely abolishes recombination between the two copies.</p><p>This is problematic for two reasons:</p><p>i) In nature, new duplicates do not arise as inverted, but rather as direct (tandem) repeats and - as the authors correctly point out - these are very unstable, due to the fact that repeated DNA is prone to recA- dependent homologous recombination (which arise orders of magnitude more frequently than point mutations).</p><p>ii) This instability often leads to further amplification of the duplicates under dosage selection both in the lab and in the wild (e.g. Andersson &amp; Hughes, Annu. Rev. Genet. 2009), and would presumably also be an outcome under the current experimental set-up if it was not prevented from happening?</p><p>So in sum, recombination between duplicate genes is not merely a nuisance in experiments, but occurring at extremely high frequencies in nature (such that the authors needed to devise a clever engineering solution to abolish it), and is often observed in evolving populations, be it in the laboratory or the wild.</p><p>The manuscript sells controlling of copy number as a strength. And clearly, without it, the same insights could not be gained. However, if the basis for the very process of what Ohno's model describes is prevented from happening for the process to be studied, then, for reasons of clarity and context this needs pointing out, especially, to readers less familiar with the principles of molecular evolution.</p><p>Connected to this, there are several places in the introduction and the discussion where I feel that the existing literature, in particular models put forward since Ohno that invoke dosage selection (such as IAD) end up being slightly misrepresented.</p><p>My point is best exemplified in line 1 of Discussion: &quot;To test Ohno's hypothesis and to distinguish its predictions from those of competing hypotheses, it is necessary to maintain a constant and stable copy number of duplicated genes during experimental evolution.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewer’s position and fully agree that we needed to clarify better what our experiments aimed to achieve. To this end, we rewrote the beginning of the discussion to read:</p><p>“Our aim was to study whether gene duplication can affect mutational robustness and phenotypic evolution beyond any effect of increased gene dosage provided by multiple gene copies. To this end, we needed to maintain a constant and stable copy number of duplicated genes during experimental evolution.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I think this statement is simply not true and might be misleading. To take the exaggerated position of a devil's advocate, the goal of evolutionary biology should be to find out how evolution actually proceeds in nature most of the time, rather than creating laboratory systems that manage to recapitulate influential ideas.</p></disp-quote><p>On this point, we respectfully disagree. To ask questions like ours, laboratory experiments that are highly controlled albeit possibly “unnatural” can be essential. And we would argue that our experiments do not merely aim to “recapitulate” an influential idea but to validate it and potentially refute it, as we did for our study system. Validating theory is an essential aspect of experimental science. Textbooks in biology and beyond are rife with examples.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While fixing copy number may be a necessary step to understand how one copy evolves if a second one is present, it seems that if Ohno's hypothesis only works out in recA-deficient bacterial strains and on engineered inverted repeats, that Ohno might have missed one crucial aspect of how paralogs evolve. The mentioned competing hypotheses have been put forward to (a) address Ohno's dilemma (which the present study beautifully demonstrates exists under their experimental conditions) and (b) to reflect a commonly observed evolutionary process in bacteria (dosage gain in response to selection, e.g. a classic way of gaining antibiotic resistance). Fixing the copy number allowed the authors to show which predictions of Ohno's model hold up and which don't (under these specific conditions). But they do so without even preventing the processes described by alternative models from happening, so the experimental system is hardly appropriate to distinguish between Ohno &amp; alternatives. Therefore, I think it could be made clearer that the experimental system is great to look at certain aspects Ohno's hypothesis in detail, but it can only inform us about a universe without recombination.</p><p>(1) Citing the works by ref 8, 26, 27 to merely state that &quot;in some copies were gained and some were lost (ref 6, ref 25)&quot; makes it seem as if fixing at 2 copies is some sort of sensible average. Yet ref 6 (Dhar et al.) specifically states that dosage is the most important response. Moreover, in this study gene copies are lost, but plasmid copies are gained instead. In Holloway et al. 2007 (ref 25), the 2 copies resided on different plasmids, so entirely different underlying molecular genetics might be at work (high cost of plasmid maintenance, and competitive binding on both proteins onto the respective (off)-target, where either way selection favored a single copy, so a different situation altogether). In both cited studies, fixing the copy would have prohibited learning something about the process of duplication &amp; divergence.</p><p>Hence this statement seems to distract the readers from the main message, which seems that preventing recombination experimentally allows to follow the divergence of each copy and studying a response that does not involve dosage-increase.</p><p>(2) &quot;These studies highlighted the importance of gene duplication in providing fast adaptation under changing environmental conditions but they focused on the importance of gene dosage.&quot; I think this constructs a false dichotomy. Instead, these studies pointed out that dosage (and with it, selection for dosage) is an important part of the equation that might have been missed by Ohno.</p></disp-quote><p>Your points are well taken. To clarify the insights from previous experiments and the aims of our experiments we rewrote this passage in question as follows.</p><p>“These studies underline the importance of gene duplication in providing fast adaptation under changing environmental conditions. In some studies one copy was lost6, 25, while in others, additional copies were gained8, 26, 27. Together these studies highlight that gene dosage and selection for dosage can play an important role during the evolution of duplicated genes6, 8, 25-28.</p><p>These studies also raise the question whether gene duplication can provide an advantage beyond its effects on gene dosage. To find out it is necessary to study the evolution of gene duplicates while keeping the copy number of the duplicated gene exactly at two. This is challenging because gene duplication causes recombinational instability and high variability in copy number. No previous experimental studies were designed to control copy number. Here, we present an experimental system that allowed us to keep the copy number fixed at one or two genes, and to follow the evolution of each gene copy in the absence of any dosage increase.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) &quot;Such models are also easier to test experimentally, because they do not require precise control of gene copy number. The necessary tests can even benefit from massive gene amplifications8. Although Ohno's hypothesis is more difficult to test experimentally (...)&quot; - again, I feel the wording is slightly misleading. The point is not that IAD is easier to test and Ohno's model is harder to test in laboratory experiments, rather, experiments (and some more limited observations of naturally evolving populations) seem to suggest that in reality evolution proceeds (more often?) according to IAD rather than Ohno's neofunctionalization hypothesis. However, as the authors point out, it will be exciting to see their clever experimental system used to test other genes and conditions to get a more comprehensive understanding of what gene- and selection- parameter values would overcome Ohno's dilemma.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and in response rewrote the paragraph in question to read:</p><p>“The challenge that a duplicated gene copy must remain free of frequent deleterious mutations long enough to acquire beneficial mutations that provide a new selectable phenotype is known as Ohno’s dilemma13. Our experiments confirm that this challenge is highly relevant for post-duplication evolution. Other models such as the innovation-amplification-divergence (IAD) model8, 13 postulate that this dilemma can be resolved through an increase in gene dosage that allows latent pre-duplication phenotypes to come under the influence of selection. To distinguish between the effects of gene dosage and other benefits of gene duplication, we prevented recombination and gene amplification to prevent copy number increases beyond two copies. We are aware that our experimental design does not reflect how evolution may occur in the wild. However, this design allowed us to study evolutionary forces separately that are otherwise difficult to disentangle. “</p><p>Finally, we also made two changes in the abstract (highlighted in red) to take your feedback into account.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>The paper is very well written, with a lot of emphasis put on explaining every step and every finding.
