they mature. This loss of regenerative capacity coincides with reduced damage-responsive expression of multiple genes needed for regeneration. We previously showed that two such genes, <italic>wg</italic> and <italic>Wnt6</italic>, are regulated by a single damage-responsive enhancer that becomes progressively inactivated via Polycomb-mediated silencing as discs mature (Harris et al., 2016). Here we explore the generality of this mechanism and identify additional damage-responsive, maturity-silenced (DRMS) enhancers, some near genes known to be required for regeneration such as <italic>Mmp1</italic>, and others near genes that we now show function in regeneration. Using a novel GAL4-independent ablation system we characterize two DRMS-associated genes, <italic>apontic</italic> (<italic>apt</italic>), which curtails regeneration and CG9752/<italic>asperous (aspr)</italic>, which promotes it. This mechanism of suppressing regeneration by silencing damage-responsive enhancers at multiple loci can be partially overcome by reducing activity of the chromatin regulator <italic>extra sex combs</italic> (<italic>esc</italic>).</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>regeneration</kwd><kwd>enhancers</kwd><kwd>epigenetic</kwd><kwd>silencing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM122490</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hariharan</surname><given-names>Iswar K</given-names></name><name><surname>Hariharan</surname><given-names>Iswar K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RP-16238-06-COUN</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hariharan</surname><given-names>Iswar K</given-names></name><name><surname>Hariharan</surname><given-names>Iswar K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM128851</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McKay</surname><given-names>Daniel J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RSG-17-164-01-DDC</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McKay</surname><given-names>Daniel J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The reduced ability of <italic>Drosophila</italic> imaginal discs to regenerate as they mature can be explained by the silencing of damage-responsive enhancers that regulate expression of genes required for regeneration.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tissue regeneration is a complex phenomenon that occurs in diverse taxa, and can result from a variety of mechanisms, including amplification of stem cells, changes in mature tissue identity, and de-differentiation and remodeling of established tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tanaka and Reddien, 2011</xref>). Following tissue damage or loss, these processes promote the restoration of tissue size, structure and patterning, and are governed by coordinated programs of gene expression. However, in many organisms, regenerative capacity declines as an organism matures through development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yun, 2015</xref>). The hind limbs of the anuran amphibian <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> progressively lose the ability to recover from amputation as the tadpole develops through juvenile stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dent, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Overton, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Muneoka et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wolfe et al., 2000</xref>). Damaged cardiac tissue can completely regenerate in newborn mice, while the same injury inflicted just 7 days later results in fibrosis and scarring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Porrello et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Porrello et al., 2013</xref>). This striking loss of regenerative capacity with increasing maturity is observed in diverse tissues of mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Reginelli et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Porrello et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cox et al., 2014</xref>) including humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Illingworth, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">King, 1979</xref>), and also in amphibians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dent, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Freeman, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beck et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Slack et al., 2004</xref>) and invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Smith-Bolton et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Halme et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harris et al., 2016</xref>). Remarkably, many of these same tissues continue their program of developmental growth even after they lose the ability to regenerate. As such, how a regeneration program becomes curtailed, and how this occurs independently of developmental growth, has yet to be elucidated.</p><p>The ability of <italic>Drosophila</italic> imaginal discs – the larval primordia of adult structures such as the wing and eye – to regenerate was originally explored via classic transplantation studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ursprung and Hadorn, 1962</xref>). More recently, genetic methods in which the discs are damaged <italic>in situ</italic> by the temporally and spatially limited expression of pro-apoptotic genes have enabled larger-scale experiments in which the domain of tissue ablation can be regulated more precisely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Smith-Bolton et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bergantiños et al., 2010</xref>). Using these and other approaches, it was shown that imaginal discs readily regenerate at the beginning of the third larval instar (L3), but lose this ability over the course of L3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Smith-Bolton et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Halme et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harris et al., 2016</xref>). Multiple genes known to be upregulated in response to damage show less robust expression in more mature discs, which correlates with the loss of regenerative capacity. Recently it was shown that genome-wide changes in chromatin accessibility are associated with regeneration following genetically-induced cell death in wing discs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vizcaya-Molina et al., 2018</xref>). However, these investigations were performed on discs at a single developmental stage when they still possessed high regenerative capacity, and therefore it remains to be seen how damage-induced changes to the epigenetic landscape might be altered in mature discs that have lost the ability to regenerate.</p><p>Wnt proteins play an important role in orchestrating regeneration in many organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Stoick-Cooper et al., 2007</xref>). Using a genetic ablation system, we previously investigated the progressive decrease in damage-responsive <italic>wingless</italic> (<italic>wg</italic>) expression in wing-imaginal discs as they mature. Following damage, <italic>wg</italic> expression requires a damage-responsive enhancer, BRV118, located between <italic>wg</italic> and <italic>Wnt6</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schubiger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harris et al., 2016</xref>). We showed that this enhancer contains a damage-responsive module (BRV-B) containing multiple binding sites for the JNK-responsive transcription factor AP-1 and that these sites are essential for its damage-responsive activity. An adjacent and separate element, BRV-C, has no enhancer activity on its own, but can silence the damage-responsive expression mediated by BRV-B in cis in a maturity-dependent manner by promoting Polycomb-mediated silencing of the enhancer, characterized by highly localized H3K27 trimethylation. This localized epigenetic change, which spares more distant developmentally-regulated enhancers at the <italic>wg</italic>/<italic>Wnt6</italic> locus, provides a mechanism for selectively shutting off damage-responsive expression while preserving the ability of those genes to be expressed for normal development. Importantly, restoring <italic>wg</italic> expression in late L3 either by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated excision of the silencing element, BRV-C, or by expression of <italic>wg</italic> did not restore regeneration. This raises the possibility that multiple genes necessary for regeneration could be regulated similarly by damage-responsive enhancers that are also silenced in maturing tissues.</p><p>Using a genome-wide ATAC-seq approach as a guide, we have now identified additional damage-responsive enhancers that are silenced as larvae mature. Using a GAL4-independent tissue ablation system that we have developed, we show that genes associated with these elements are necessary for robust regeneration, thus demonstrating that the silencing of multiple such enhancers could account for the decrease in regenerative capacity as tissues mature. Proximity to such enhancers has also allowed us to identify novel regulators of regeneration. Finally, we show that modulating the activity of a specific chromatin regulator that alleviates silencing at such enhancers can promote regeneration in mature discs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A damage-responsive and maturity-silenced enhancer is also present at the <italic>Mmp1</italic> locus</title><p>To investigate the possibility that genes other than <italic>wg</italic> and <italic>Wnt6</italic> might be regulated by damage-responsive and maturity-silenced (DRMS) enhancers, we searched for modules with a similar bipartite organization to BRV118, the enhancer identified at the <italic>wg/Wnt6</italic> locus. The damage-responsive module of BRV118, BRV-B, contains multiple AP-1 binding sites that are essential for its ability to respond to tissue damage, and which are also found in the corresponding enhancer regions of other <italic>Drosophila</italic> species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We have previously shown that multiple elements in the module required for silencing the enhancer in mature discs (BRV-C) are necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harris et al., 2016</xref>) and that Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are necessary for the silencing activity of BRV-C. Indeed, a binding site of the PcG DNA binding factor Pleiohomeotic (Pho) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mohd-Sarip et al., 2002</xref>) is present in BRV-C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To identify other functional motifs, we compared the sequences from four highly related <italic>Drosophila</italic> species and found several conserved regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Screening for stretches of identical DNA sequence 50 bp or larger, we identified a single region (region 1) within BRV-B that is close to the three AP-1 binding sites that we previously showed are required for damage-responsive expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harris et al., 2016</xref>). By comparison, the BRV-C module has multiple completely-conserved regions, including two regions over 100 bp in length (regions 6/7 and 8), one of which (region 8) contains the conserved Pho binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>). By conducting BLAST searches of the genome using sequences from these highly conserved regions, we found an exact copy of a 17 bp sequence from region 6/7 present within an enhancer previously identified in the <italic>Matrix metalloproteinase 1</italic> (<italic>Mmp1</italic>) locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Uhlirova and Bohmann, 2006</xref>). We compared this 17 bp sequence with a library of known <italic>Drosophila</italic> transcription factor binding sites using a motif comparison tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gupta et al., 2007</xref>) and found that part of this sequence matches an Sp1 binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Sp1 binding sites are known to be required for the activity of Polycomb Response Elements (PREs) and have been identified in most molecularly-characterized PREs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2005</xref>), while an Sp1 family member, Ssps, has been shown to bind different PREs and contribute to silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown and Kassis, 2010</xref>).

Ablation in the absence of JNK activity using a <italic>hep</italic> mutant background (<italic>hep</italic>/Y) fails to induce the reporter or <italic>Mmp1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Thus, JNK signaling is a necessary input into the enhancer, as it is for damage-induced <italic>Mmp1</italic> expression. Conversely, ectopic activation of JNK signaling through expression of <italic>hep<sup>CA</sup></italic> leads to strong reporter activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Physical wounding of these discs followed by <italic>ex vivo</italic> culture also results in activation of the <italic>Mmp1</italic> reporter at the wound edge, coincident with <italic>Mmp1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Consistently, the <italic>Mmp1-GFP</italic> reporter also recapitulates the weaker expression of <italic>Mmp1</italic> in response to genetic ablation with either <italic>egr</italic> or <italic>rpr</italic> in late L3 discs (day 9, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–G</xref>), despite a robust level of JNK activity, as indicated by the AP-1 reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Together these data indicate that this region of the <italic>Mmp1</italic> locus contains an enhancer that is both damage-responsive and maturity-silenced (DRMS).</p><p>To directly test whether this DRMS enhancer has separable damage-activated and maturity-silencing elements, two reporter lines, <italic>Mmp1-A-GFP</italic> and <italic>Mmp1-B-GFP</italic>, were generated using enhancer fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and inserted into the same transgene landing site as the original <italic>Mmp1-GFP</italic> to make their activity directly comparable. <italic>Mmp1-A</italic> was strongly activated specifically in response to damage, more so than the full-length enhancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I–J</xref>). Moreover, in the absence of the <italic>Mmp1-B</italic> sequences it can be activated equally as strongly in both early and late L3 discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I–J</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Mmp1-B</italic>, which contains the 17 bp motif and conserved Pho binding site yielded no enhancer activity in ablated young or old discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K–L</xref>), despite containing two predicted AP-1 binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Further subdivision of the <italic>Mmp1-A</italic> region showed that the majority of damage-responsive expression is driven by a ~ 1 kb section of DNA bearing three high consensus AP-1 binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). None of the generated reporters showed significant expression in the absence of ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E–I</xref>). We also examined the activity of the <italic>Mmp1-GFP</italic> reporter in a PcG mutant background, which we previously showed de-repressed the BRV118 enhancer in the <italic>wg</italic>/<italic>Wnt6</italic> locus (hereafter DRMS<sup>Wnt</sup>) in older damaged discs compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harris et al., 2016</xref>). Expression of <italic>Mmp1-GFP</italic> and Mmp1 protein in a <italic>pc<sup>15</sup></italic>/+ ablated late L3 disc was significantly stronger compared to the wild type control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M–N</xref>), indicating that Polycomb-mediated epigenetic silencing is necessary to limit <italic>Mmp1-GFP</italic> activation in mature tissues. Thus, the functional organization of this enhancer is very similar to the one we have characterized at the <italic>wg</italic>/<italic>Wnt6</italic> locus, with clearly separable damage-responsive modules and silencing modules. Also, like DRMS<sup>Wnt</sup>, its age-dependent silencing is dependent upon PcG function. Due to the similarity of organization with DRMS<sup>Wnt</sup>, we will henceforth refer to this region as DRMS<sup>Mmp1</sup>. Thus, we have shown that another gene that has been demonstrated to function in both growth and tissue remodeling is regulated by a DRMS enhancer.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Genome-wide identification of DRMS enhancers using ATAC-seq</title><p>While DRMS<sup>Mmp1</sup> and DRMS<sup>Wnt</sup> share sequence motifs, it is possible and even likely that other such enhancers rely on different mechanisms to be activated or silenced, and thus potentially lack these motifs. To search for such enhancers without sequence bias, we employed ATAC-seq, a genome-wide assay of chromatin accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buenrostro et al., 2015</xref>). We compared chromatin profiles of <italic>rn<sup>ts</sup>&gt;egr</italic> ablated wing discs from both early and late L3 larvae (reflecting times of high and low regenerative capacity, respectively), as well as from identically staged unablated discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We performed three full biological repeats for each condition yielding a total of 14,142 open chromatin peaks after merging overlapping peaks from each condition (see Materials and methods for full details of quality control and data analysis parameters). A Pearson correlation analysis on CPM-normalized counts from DEseq2 shows high correlation between replicates (r &gt;0.9) and demonstrates that the data cluster first by developmental stage and then by whether or not the tissue had been damaged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). When analyzing the chromatin accessibility data, we were surprised to find that only a small number of peaks in each pairwise comparison met with a standard statistical cutoff (padj &lt;0.05), particularly when comparing chromatin profiles of damaged and undamaged discs (151 altered in early L3 with 90 becoming more accessible, 27 altered in late L3 with 16 becoming more accessible, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We speculate that this is likely due to the use of whole discs in our protocol, as signals from regenerating cells only comprise a small portion of the disc and are potentially diluted by the chromatin profile of cells of undamaged tissue. To overcome this limitation, we used less stringent statistical limits, analyzing peaks with a padj &lt;0.1 and log2FC &gt;0.5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Using these cutoffs, we observe the same trend but now identify 222 regions that become more open upon damage in early L3 compared to undamaged controls, and 33 that become more accessible in late L3 discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Of these, 12 regions consistently open upon damage at both time points. Thus, the chromatin landscape, at least as assessed by this criterion, is more responsive to damage in immature than mature discs, which in principle could contribute to the reduction in regenerative capacity. When comparing damaged discs at the different developmental timepoints, there are 729 regions that are significantly less accessible in damaged late L3 discs versus damaged early L3, and therefore become silenced with maturity in the context of damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). We find that 28 (13.3%) of the 222 early L3 damage-responsive are included in this category, thus identifying them as putative damage-responsive and maturity-silenced (DRMS) regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Assaying the position of the 28 DRMS peaks relative to the total open chromatin detected by ATAC-seq shows they are enriched at genomic locations categorized as actively transcribed introns and other open chromatin, while being relatively reduced at actively transcribed promoters and exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kharchenko et al., 2011</xref>), consistent with these peaks localizing to enhancers.</p><p>Visualizing the chromatin accessibility at the experimentally validated <italic>wg/Wnt6</italic> and <italic>Mmp1</italic> enhancer loci shows that both regions become more accessible upon damage in early L3 discs, but not in late L3, consistent with DRMS behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>). However, despite the less stringent statistical cutoffs, the peaks representing these enhancers are not detected as damage-responsive, while only the Wnt enhancer is designated as maturity-silenced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). This is likely because damage-specific changes in chromatin accessibility at these enhancers within regenerating cells are diluted by surrounding cells that comprise the rest of the disc. This is particularly evident at the DRMS<sup>Mmp1</sup> enhancer, which maintains significant accessibility regardless of damage or age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

The ablation system that we have been using thus far induces cell death by rendering GAL4 active for 40 hr at 30°C during L3, driving expression of a pro-apoptotic gene under UAS control. As such, other genes expressed under the control of UAS elements are also only active during the time of ablation and are restricted to the cells targeted for death. To overcome these limitations and take advantage of the extensive collections of UAS-driven RNAi lines and similar UAS-based tools, we developed a novel genetic ablation system that is independent of GAL4/UAS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This system uses the bacterial transcriptional regulator LexA and its binding motif LexAOp, which have been used in <italic>Drosophila</italic> as an independent alternative to GAL4/UAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lai and Lee, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pfeiffer et al., 2010</xref>). Previous approaches have taken advantage of this alternative regulator to explore regeneration by using LexA fused to the GAL4 activator domain (LexA::GAD) to ablate the wing disc, while driving UAS-transgene expression using regular GAL4 in a spatially distinct domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yagi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Santabárbara-Ruiz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vizcaya-Molina et al., 2018</xref>).

First, to permit both temporal and spatial control of ablation in a GAL4-independent way, we generated a LexAOp-binding transcriptional activator that can be briefly and specifically activated in the wing disc by a heat shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Two transgenes were generated: the DNA binding domain (DBD) of LexA under the control of a <italic>spalt</italic> (<italic>salm</italic>) enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jory et al., 2012</xref>) and the transcriptional activator p65 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schmitz and Baeuerle, 1991</xref>) under the control of the <italic>hsp70</italic> heat shock promoter. Each domain bears a complementary leucine zipper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ting et al., 2011</xref>), which allows formation of the full chimeric LexA::p65 only in the cells that express both components. We combined these two transgenes with either <italic>lexAOp-rpr</italic> or <italic>lexAOp-egr</italic>, resulting in a system that permits tissue-specific ablation of the medial wing pouch in response to a heat shock, and which is entirely independent of GAL4/UAS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Second, we developed a way of expressing GAL4 in the tissue surrounding the ablated region that is activated concurrently with the ablation. Since this system permits the simultaneous and independent use of both LexA and GAL4, each with separate spatial and temporal control, we named this system <underline>Du</underline>ration <underline>A</underline>nd <underline>L</underline>ocation Control, or DUAL Control.</p><p>To drive UAS-transgene expression we established a DUAL Control stock that also includes a pouch-specific GAL4 under the control of either a <italic>PDM2</italic> or <italic>DVE</italic> enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jory et al., 2012</xref>), both of which target expression to regions of the wing pouch surrounding the region that would be ablated, i.e. the region that will include the regeneration blastema (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–D</xref>). Although both enhancers drive in similar spatial patterns within the pouch, our experiments show that <italic>DVE</italic> has consistently stronger expression (data not shown). These GAL4 lines were generated with a flip-out cassette to permit heat shock-induced FLP-mediated activation (<italic>PDM2&gt;&gt;GAL4</italic> or <italic>DVE&gt;&gt;GAL4,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Thus, a single heat shock can simultaneously induce a pulse of LexA-driven ablation of the medial pouch and activate sustained GAL4 expression in the surrounding cells that contribute to the regenerated pouch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Herrera et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Verghese and Su, 2016</xref>). Since ablation occurs as a discrete pulse resulting from a heat shock rather than from the prolonged expression of GAL4 induced by a temperature change, this system has the advantage of clearly separating ablation from the period of regeneration. Similarly, as this system does not rely on temperature-sensitive GAL80 to regulate either ablation or GAL4 expression, these experiments can be performed at higher temperatures to significantly reduce experimental duration.</p><p>To concurrently examine the temporal expression of lexAOp- and UAS-regulated transgenes in the absence of ablation, we crossed a non-ablating DUAL Control <italic>DVE&gt;&gt;GAL4</italic> stock to <italic>lexAOp-dGFP; UAS-RFP</italic> and heat shocked early L3 larvae (day 3.5 at 25°C). We found that both the LexA and the GAL4 components of the system can be activated with a single 37°C heat shock of duration as short as 10 min, but that a single 45 min heat shock was optimal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). We then examined a time course of ablation using <italic>rpr</italic> with DUAL Control <italic>DVE&gt;&gt;GAL4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G–K</xref>) and found that cells expressing <italic>rpr</italic> (dGFP positive) can be detected within 6 hr post-heat shock (PHS, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). At this time point the majority of the <italic>salm</italic> domain stains positively for activated caspase, which is mostly observed within the disc proper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). At 18 hr PHS the majority of cell corpses had been extruded basally from the disc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and J</xref>). At 24 hr the epithelium had mostly regained a normal appearance and by 48 hr PHS the associated debris was minimal, while regeneration was complete (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>). Despite using a fast-degrading GFP reporter (dGFP) with a half-life of only a few hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lieber et al., 2011</xref>), we found that fluorescence induced by LexA::p65 persisted in the disc after the initial heat shock, including in cells within the ablated <italic>salm</italic> domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I–J</xref>). This is likely due to these cells activating the <italic>LexA-DBD</italic> transgene as they take on distal pouch identity, which functions together with residual p65 to express <italic>lexAOp-GFP</italic>. These cells lack DCP1 staining however, suggesting that this level of LexA::p65 activity is enough to drive GFP expression but not ablation. By comparison, <italic>UAS-RFP</italic> expression resulting from heat shock induced <italic>DVE&gt;&gt;GAL4</italic> was observed at 6 hr PHS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>) in the cells surrounding the ablated <italic>salm</italic> domain, and persisted throughout the recovery period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H–K</xref>), demonstrating that cells that drive the regenerative growth can be targeted for manipulation using DUAL Control, and that ablation and UAS-driven gene expression can be temporally and spatially separated.</p><p>Using DUAL Control we examined the effect of inducing ablation at different developmental time-points. Larvae were heat shocked at early and late L3 stages (days 3.5 and 4.5 at 25°C) and the extent of regeneration was measured by assaying the size of the resulting adult wings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L–M</xref>). The adult wings that develop from <italic>rpr</italic>-ablated discs display a series of phenotypes, which we categorized into discrete groups: ‘wild type’ for those indistinguishable from unablated wings (and therefore likely to be fully regenerated), ‘nicked’ for those with some margin loss, ‘partial notch’ or ‘full notch’ for those with significant loss of both margin and wing blade tissue, and ‘ablated’, describing those that had lost the entire distal wing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L</xref>). When ablated in early L3, around 95% of wings produced were in the ‘wild type’ or ‘nicked’ category, indicating that regeneration was mostly complete (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M</xref>). By comparison, ablation in late L3 yielded many more ‘full notch’ or ‘ablated’ wings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M</xref>), demonstrating the loss of regenerative capacity in wing discs during development. Ablation with <italic>egr</italic> resulted in weaker adult phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>) and lower levels of activated caspase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B–E</xref>). We therefore used ablation with <italic>rpr</italic> for subsequent wing scoring assays. RNAi targeting the <italic>white</italic> gene (<italic>UAS-w<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>) was used as a control for the other RNAi lines used in this work because of their similar genetic background and the lack of observable influence on disc regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Manipulating the activity of characterized growth regulators using DUAL Control alters regeneration</title><p>To test our ability to interrogate factors that potentially influence regeneration we manipulated several previously identified regulators of regeneration using DUAL Control. Both Wg and Mmp1 protein are detected following ablation with <italic>rpr</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>), and more so with <italic>egr</italic> due to its stronger activation of the JNK pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>). Both genes have experimentally validated DRMS enhancers, which are activated by DUAL Control ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>). Targeting either <italic>wg</italic> or <italic>Mmp1</italic> for knockdown with RNAi using this system strongly decreases the damage-induced expression of both proteins, while the amount of cell death appears unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–D</xref>). The extent of regeneration, as assessed by the change in adult wing phenotypes in response to ablation with <italic>rpr</italic>, is reduced in each case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Knockdown of <italic>Mmp1</italic> for the same duration in the absence of ablation yields little to no effect on adult wings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>), while knockdown of <italic>wg</italic> without ablation produces patterning defects localized to the distal wing edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>) that are clearly distinguishable from the wing tissue loss that follows ablation. Thus, <italic>wg</italic> is required for both regrowth following damage and repatterning. We also tested manipulation of <italic>Myc</italic>, a potent growth regulator shown to be sufficient to improve regeneration of late L3 discs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Smith-Bolton et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harris et al., 2016</xref>). Knockdown of <italic>Myc</italic> using RNAi directed to regenerating tissue with either DUAL Control <italic>PDM&gt;&gt;GAL4</italic> or <italic>DVE&gt;&gt;GAL4</italic> following ablation with <italic>rpr</italic> showed a dramatic reduction in regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Consistently, overexpression of <italic>Myc</italic> improves adult wing size and morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). An E2F reporter (<italic>PCNA-GFP</italic>) shows that these phenotypes likely result from changes in damage-induced proliferation in response to altered levels of <italic>Myc</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–J</xref>). JAK/STAT signaling is also an important regulator of regenerative growth, and we have identified damage-responsive peaks associated with <italic>upd1</italic> and <italic>upd2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Knockdown of the JAK/STAT <italic>upd1</italic> or <italic>upd2</italic> appears to strongly reduce regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>), while knockdown of <italic>upd3</italic>, which does not have a damage-responsive peak, also mildly reduces regeneration but the effect is less significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Since the effects of the three <italic>upd</italic> genes could be additive on pathway function, we disrupted pathway components that are thought to function downstream of all three genes. Knockdown of the transcription factor <italic>Stat92E</italic> or receptor <italic>domeless</italic> (<italic>dome</italic>) also results in less-complete wings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>), confirming the requirement for JAK/STAT signaling in regenerating tissue surrounding the ablation domain. Together, these data show that several genes either associated with experimentally validated DRMS enhancers or with damage-responsive peaks identified in this study are functionally necessary for regeneration, and demonstrate that DUAL Control is a powerful tool to manipulate gene function in regenerating tissue, circumventing the limitations of previous ablation systems.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Manipulation of genes previously known to function during regeneration using DUAL Control.</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) Early L3 discs bearing the DRMS<sup>Wnt</sup>-GFP reporter (<bold>A</bold>) or the DRMS<sup>Mmp1</sup>-GFP reporter (<bold>B</bold>), ablated with <italic>egr</italic> using DUAL Control expressing a control RNAi (<italic>UAS-wRNAi</italic>) and imaged after 24 hr. Ablation activates expression of both <italic>wg</italic> and <italic>Mmp1</italic> (red, arrowheads), and both DRMS reporters (green), (<bold>C-D</bold>) RNAi knockdown of damage-induced <italic>wg</italic> (<bold>C</bold>) and <italic>Mmp1</italic> (<bold>D</bold>) expression (red) with <italic>DVE&gt;&gt;GAL4</italic> in DUAL Control <italic>egr</italic> ablated discs.

We chose to investigate the uncharacterized gene <italic>CG9572</italic> because we have experimentally validated a DRMS enhancer in its vicinity and because its expression was one of the most strongly upregulated by damage in regenerating cells according to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Khan et al., 2017</xref> data set. <italic>CG9572</italic> is predicted to encode a 441 amino acid protein of unknown function. In order to better characterize CG9572, we performed protein blast (blastp) and alignment scoring, which revealed strong sequence similarity to the EGF domain repeats of the Jagged protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>), a membrane-bound ligand for Notch in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lindsell et al., 1995</xref>). A Jagged ortholog in <italic>Drosophila</italic> has not been described. The peptide sequence is predicted to contain seven EGF-type repeats that each displays a characteristic spacing of cysteine residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>). EGF-like repeats are found in all Notch ligands that have been described to date (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kovall et al., 2017</xref>). Similar to Jagged, CG9572 also has a 14-amino acid hydrophobic stretch close to its N-terminus that is likely to function as a signal peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). However, unlike Jagged or other Notch ligands it lacks a second hydrophobic stretch that would serve as a transmembrane domain, or a Delta/Serrate/LAG-2 (DSL) domain characteristic of Notch ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Thus, the predicted CG9572 protein has sequence similarity to Jagged, but unlike Jagged or other known Notch ligands, it is likely to be secreted. Due its similarity to mammalian Jagged, we have called this protein Asperous (Aspr). When a tagged version, <italic>UAS-aspr::HA</italic>, was expressed in the posterior compartment using <italic>en-GAL4</italic>, HA staining appeared to be cytoplasmic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), localizing towards the apical surface of the disc proper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) and with punctae observed in the anterior compartment. When the stronger <italic>hh-GAL4</italic> driver was used, punctae were observed throughout the anterior compartment consistent with the Aspr protein being secreted from cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Overexpression of <italic>aspr</italic> in the whole wing pouch using <italic>rn-GAL4</italic> does not result in an observable phenotype in the adult wing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>), but expression in the posterior compartment infrequently causes abnormal folding in the pouch at the boundary with wild type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>).

In undamaged L3 wing discs, <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization shows <italic>aspr</italic> is expressed at low levels in the ventral and lateral areas of the disc at low levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–F</xref>). Similarly, the gene trap shows little to no expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K–L</xref>). Upon damage in early L3 discs, <italic>aspr</italic> is upregulated strongly in the region of the blastema, as shown in discs ablated by both <italic>rn<sup>ts</sup>&gt;egr</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G,M</xref>) and DUAL Control ablation with <italic>egr</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). In damaged discs from late L3 larvae, <italic>aspr</italic> has much weaker damage-induced expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H,J,N</xref>). Knockdown of <italic>aspr</italic> with two different RNAi lines in the developing wing pouch using <italic>rn-GAL4</italic> in undamaged discs has little effect on adult wing size or patterning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref> and data not shown). However, we found that knockdown of <italic>aspr</italic> in mid L3 discs using <italic>en-GAL4</italic> delays the onset of expression of the Notch target <italic>cut</italic> at the prospective wing margin in the posterior compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5O–Q</xref>), suggesting <italic>aspr</italic> might promote Notch signaling during normal development. This is also shown by the weak reduction in fluorescence of a Notch reporter, <italic>NRE-GFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zacharioudaki and Bray, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5R–S</xref>). These data suggest that Aspr is a secreted regulator of Notch signaling in the wing, which is strongly activated in regenerating tissue upon damage. To address whether <italic>aspr</italic> is necessary for regeneration, we used DUAL Control to reduce its expression in regenerating cells in mid-L3 discs using the two different RNAi lines following <italic>rpr</italic> ablation of the wing pouch. At this stage Cut expression at the margin is beginning to be established (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5R</xref>), while ablation at an earlier stage leads to a delay in development and hinders Cut expression. Upon <italic>aspr</italic> knockdown the presence of Cut in these discs is markedly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5T–U</xref>), suggesting that ablation combined with the loss of <italic>aspr</italic> may limit Cut expression that has already been initiated. The extent of regeneration is also decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5V</xref>). This effect on regeneration was also observed with <italic>rn<sup>ts</sup>&gt;egr</italic> ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2D</xref>). These experiments suggest that <italic>aspr</italic> promotes specification of the wing margin during development. We also tested the MiMIC line that we used as a GFP reporter for <italic>aspr</italic> expression, which is likely to also be an <italic>aspr</italic> mutant due to the mutagenic cassette in the insertion that is designed to disrupt gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Venken et al., 2011</xref>). The insertion is in the first intron of the coding region, downstream of the transcriptional start site of all three <italic>aspr</italic> transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Semi-quantititive PCR of <italic>rn<sup>ts</sup>&gt;egr</italic> ablated discs from MiMIC hemizygous animals (<italic>Mi[MIC]CG9572<sup>[MI02471]</sup></italic>/Y) showed strongly reduced levels of <italic>aspr</italic> mRNA compared to ablated wild type discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2F</xref>), consistent with this line being a transcriptional mutant. <italic>aspr</italic> hemizygous animals have no obvious developmental defects but show a strongly decreased ability to regenerate when ablated with DUAL Control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5V</xref>) and <italic>rn<sup>ts</sup>&gt;egr</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2G</xref>). Expression of Aspr::HA does not strongly affect regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2H</xref>), indicating that while it is necessary for regeneration, ectopic expression alone it is not sufficient to improve it, as we have demonstrated with other pro-regeneration genes such as <italic>wg</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harris et al., 2016</xref>).

In view of the demonstration that <italic>apt</italic> can promote wing growth by promoting Hedgehog expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wang et al., 2017</xref>), we were surprised to find that the adult wings were more complete than in ablated controls not expressing the <italic>apt</italic> RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). We then examined the effect of <italic>apt</italic> knockdown in late L3 discs and found that, once again, adult wings were more complete than in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). These observations indicate that <italic>apt</italic> knockdown either protects discs from damage during the ablation phase or promotes regeneration. Since the levels of cleaved caspase DCP1 appeared similar in the presence and absence of <italic>apt</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–F</xref>), this suggests that <italic>apt</italic> normally acts to limit regeneration following damage. This is corroborated by a hypomorphic <italic>apt</italic> mutant (<italic>apt<sup>K15608</sup>/+,</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eulenberg and Schuh, 1997</xref>]), which also shows a mild increase in regenerative ability compared to wild type at both time points when ablated with DUAL Control and <italic>rn<sup>ts</sup>&gt;egr</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>). As <italic>apt</italic> is known to act in the germline to limit JAK/STAT signaling, we examined whether it might affect regeneration by influencing JAK/STAT activity. We observed the expression of a fluorescent Stat92E reporter (<italic>STAT-GFP</italic>) in late L3 discs ablated with DUAL Control in the presence of <italic>apt</italic> knockdown. Normally at this stage, STAT activity is minimal in regenerating cells of ablated discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). However, with <italic>apt</italic> knockdown, we found an increase in the activity of this reporter specifically in blastema cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). This is more clearly visible with <italic>rn<sup>ts</sup>&gt;egr</italic> ablation, which damages a larger area of the disc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G–H</xref>). These data suggest that rather than being necessary for regeneration, activation of <italic>apt</italic> expression in young, but not old discs, might be a mechanism of tempering the extent of regeneration when it occurs.</p><p>The ability to augment regeneration by manipulating a single gene is striking, but could be explained if this manipulation has pleiotropic effects on key aspects of the regeneration process. Indeed, JAK/STAT signaling, which our data suggest can be regulated by <italic>apt</italic> in this context, has been described as a central regulator of regeneration via its influence on both local blastema formation and systemic physiological responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Katsuyama et al., 2015</xref>). As DRMS enhancers are associated with multiple genes, we hypothesized that manipulating levels of chromatin silencing factors that are involved in inactivating these enhancers could restore the damage-responsive expression of their target genes in mature discs, increasing regenerative capacity. To this end, we used DUAL Control to knock down a panel of epigenetic silencing factors in regenerating tissue of late L3 discs. Most of those tested did not have an obvious effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>). However, inhibition of the Polycomb group gene <italic>extra sex combs</italic> (<italic>esc</italic>), which encodes a component of the PRC2 complex (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kassis et al., 2017</xref>), specifically during the regeneration period consistently improved regeneration, even in discs ablated in early L3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). We used the weaker <italic>PDM2</italic>-driven version of DUAL Control for these experiments to avoid the negative effects associated with strong or widespread knockdown of these epigenetic regulators. Under these conditions, we observed no adult wing defects when <italic>esc</italic> was knocked down in unablated wings for this short duration (data not shown). Thus, even a small reduction in <italic>esc</italic> levels is likely to improve regeneration. Ablation in a heterozygous <italic>esc</italic> background (<italic>esc<sup>5</sup></italic>/<italic>+</italic>) similarly leads to improved regeneration when ablated with <italic>rn<sup>ts</sup>&gt;egr</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>), although this effect was not significant when ablated using DUAL Control, unlike targeted knockdown with RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>To test whether the improved regenerative capacity of <italic>esc</italic> knockdown was due to alteration of DRMS activity, we examined the activity of three different DRMS reporters, DRMS<sup>Wnt</sup>, DRMS<sup>Mmp1</sup>, and DRMS<sup>aspr</sup>, in late L3 discs expressing <italic>esc<sup>RNA</sup></italic><sup>i</sup>. The level of GFP expression from all of the reporters was increased in ablated discs with <italic>esc</italic> knockdown compared to controls, as was <italic>wg</italic> and <italic>Mmp1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J–K</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2D–G</xref>), indicating that the loss of <italic>esc</italic> leads to improved regeneration in part via reactivation of multiple DRMS enhancers. Thus, reducing Polycomb-mediated silencing appears capable of overcoming the suppression of a regeneration program that operates simultaneously at multiple loci in the genome.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We previously showed that the reduced expression of <italic>wg</italic> and <italic>Wnt6</italic> elicited by damage as discs mature can be explained by the properties of a damage-responsive and maturity-silenced (DRMS) enhancer that lies between the two genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harris et al., 2016</xref>). Manipulating this enhancer by deleting the maturity silencing module restores damage-responsive <italic>wg</italic> expression in mature discs, but this alone is insufficient to preserve regenerative capacity at this stage of development. These observations suggest that genes other than <italic>wg</italic> are required for regeneration, and might be regulated by in a similar way. Now, we have identified three additional genes, <italic>Mmp1</italic>, <italic>apt</italic> and <italic>aspr,</italic> which function in regeneration and are regulated by DRMS enhancers. The damage-responsive expression of each of these genes is reduced in late L3 discs compared to early L3 discs, while DUAL-Control ablation experiments showed that the function of two of these genes, <italic>Mmp1</italic> and <italic>aspr</italic>, in the blastema contributes to regeneration. Additionally, a negative regulator of regeneration, <italic>apt</italic>, seems to be regulated in a similar way. Moreover, our ATAC-seq data reveal a number of other regions within the genome with chromatin accessibility signatures that are suggestive of being DRMS enhancers that could potentially regulate multiple other genes that function during regeneration. Since the manipulation of a chromatin silencing factor, <italic>esc</italic>, can de-repress at least three DRMS enhancers, and also promote regeneration, it is likely that the overall effect of the expression of multiple genes regulated by DRMS enhancers is to promote regeneration. However, it is important to note that the number of regions we identified using ATAC-seq are likely to be an underestimate since our assay examined chromatin changes using whole discs, in which only a small proportion of cells are undergoing regeneration. In the future it will be important to test whether additional regions of interest, and potential target genes, might be uncovered through the use of single-cell ATAC-seq or similar approaches. This information will also be key to understanding the degree to which DRMS enhancers contribute to the overall regulation of regeneration in imaginal discs.</p><p>As our approach likely identified only the regions that changed most significantly in response to damage, it is striking that we identified an uncharacterized gene (<italic>CG9572</italic>/<italic>aspr</italic>) and a gene previously not described in regeneration (<italic>apt</italic>) as among the top hits. Knockdown of <italic>aspr</italic> adversely impacted regenerative growth but produced no obvious effect on the normal development of the wing except perhaps a delay in the development of the wing margin. We have shown that following <italic>aspr</italic> knockdown, expression of the markers at the margin such as Cut and the Notch reporter was delayed both in normal and regenerating discs, suggesting that <italic>aspr</italic> could potentially promote Notch signaling. Our analysis reveals that Aspr has sequence similarity to the vertebrate Notch ligand Jagged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lindsell et al., 1995</xref>), raising the possibility that its influence on Notch signaling could be as a ligand. However, unlike most Notch ligands characterized to date, Aspr lacks a DSL domain or a predicted transmembrane domain. Non-canonical Notch ligands that lack a DSL domain have been identified in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baladrón et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Falix et al., 2012</xref>) and have been shown to regulate Notch signaling when engineered into <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bray et al., 2008</xref>), while several Notch ligands have been characterized in <italic>C. elegans</italic> that lack transmembrane domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen and Greenwald, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Komatsu et al., 2008</xref>). The lack of a transmembrane domain suggests that Aspr is likely secreted. Consistent with this notion, we observed punctate staining outside the region of expression when <italic>aspr::HA</italic> was overexpressed. Being anchored to the membrane is thought to be crucial for the mechanism by which Notch ligands function in <italic>Drosophila</italic>; endocytosis of the ligand engaged to Notch is presumed to generate the mechanical force that alters Notch conformation and renders it susceptible to proteolytic cleavage, which eventually results in nuclear translocation of the intracellular domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Parks et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Langridge and Struhl, 2017</xref>). Thus, at least based on this view of Notch signaling, it is unlikely that Aspr could function as a canonical Notch ligand. Moreover, Notch signaling is thought to function as part of double repressive mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Herranz et al., 2008</xref>) that controls regenerative growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Smith-Bolton et al., 2009</xref>), and is reduced in blastema cells to permit <italic>Myc</italic>-dependent growth. As such, it is unclear how Aspr might promote Notch signaling, and yet also be required for regeneration. Importantly, overexpression of <italic>aspr</italic> did not appear to increase Notch signaling, at least as assessed by activation of the Notch reporter. Therefore, the role of Aspr in promoting regeneration could be independent of a direct influence on Notch signaling and remains to be explored further.</p><p>In addition to <italic>aspr</italic>, we also found that the transcriptional regulator <italic>apt</italic> functions in regeneration, although in contrast to <italic>aspr</italic>, knockdown of <italic>apt</italic> appears to improve regeneration in discs ablated in either early or late L3. Knockdown of <italic>apt</italic> increased expression of a STAT reporter, suggesting this improvement might be via increased JAK/STAT signaling. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that other mechanisms might be more important. A previous study has shown that reducing JAK/STAT signaling reduced tissue loss following <italic>egr</italic>-induced ablation, but did not seem to compromise the extent of compensatory proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">La Fortezza et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, the overexpression of <italic>upd1</italic> or <italic>upd2</italic> concurrently with ablation did not improve regeneration. However, increasing Stat92E activity in the blastema during the regeneration phase was not tested in that study, as appears to occur when <italic>apt</italic> is knocked down using DUAL Control.</p><p>We also found that reducing PcG-mediated repression via knockdown of <italic>esc</italic> improved overall regeneration. Reducing <italic>esc</italic> activity derepressed at least three DRMS enhancers that were tested using reporter gene constructs. Since a reduction in <italic>esc</italic> levels alleviates silencing at multiple DRMS enhancers, it is likely that many of these other enhancers are also regulated by Polycomb-mediated silencing, as for DRMS<sup>Wnt</sup>. These findings parallel those of other groups who have used chromatin profiling in imaginal discs to show that enhancer accessibility is an important mechanism that regulates various properties of imaginal discs, including specification of their identity during development and cellular proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McKay and Lieb, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ma et al., 2019</xref>). In a recent study that investigated the basis of terminal exit from the cell cycle in cells of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing disc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ma et al., 2019</xref>) it was found that distal enhancers for key cell cycle regulators such as <italic>cyclin E</italic> and <italic>string</italic> become less accessible as development proceeds. This occurs independently of cell-cycle status but instead seems to be governed by a temporal program. The robust exit from the cell-cycle could potentially be explained by reduced levels of many cell-cycle regulators caused by the silencing of enhancers at multiple loci. Similarly, an enhancer-mediated mechanism that reduces the expression of multiple genes necessary for regeneration in mature discs might be more robust than one that relies on reduced expression of a single key regulator.</p><p>If regeneration in maturing discs is indeed suppressed by the silencing of multiple DRMS enhancers that regulate genes promoting regeneration, it could be restored, at least in principle, in two different ways. One would be by alleviating the silencing at multiple DRMS enhancers; knockdown of <italic>esc</italic> likely functions in this way. Another way would be by activating pathways that function downstream of genes that promote regeneration (bypass suppression). Our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Worley et al., 2018</xref>) has shown that the JAK/STAT pathway can promote plasticity during regeneration. Knockdown of <italic>apt</italic> increases expression of the STAT reporter. Perhaps this still poorly-understood mechanism acts in parallel to the alleviation of PcG-mediated silencing.</p><p>Damage-responsive enhancers have been identified in multiple species and found to share common regulators, including JNK signaling. The <italic>lepb</italic> gene in zebrafish appears to be regulated by such an enhancer, which is altered epigenetically following injury to fins or the heart, and requires AP-1 binding sites for activation of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kang et al., 2016</xref>). In mice, discrete regulatory elements that regulate muscle regeneration, bone fracture and soft-tissue injury have also been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guenther et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguilar et al., 2016</xref>). However, it is not known whether these enhancers become less active with maturity since zebrafish preserve their regenerative capacity and adult mice continue to heal muscle and fractured bones. In contrast, the murine neonatal heart is known to lose regenerative ability within the first week of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Porrello et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, it will be interesting to see whether genes implicated in cardiac regeneration in neonatal mice are regulated by similar enhancers that become silenced with maturity. Finally, there is evidence that damage-responsive regulatory elements are conserved in the human genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Suzuki et al., 2019</xref>) and function in models of human epithelial injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lander et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, the study of these enhancers and the mechanism by which they regulate the response to injury could provide important insights in human regenerative medicine in future.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stocks and genotypes</title><p>Stocks and crosses were maintained on yeast food at 25°C, except those for GAL4/UAS based ablation experiments, which were maintained at 18°C.

decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for choosing to send your work, “Regenerative capacity in <italic>Drosophila</italic> imaginal discs is controlled by damage-responsive, maturity-silenced enhancers”, for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your initial submission has been reviewed by three peer reviewers and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor in consultation with Hugo J. Bellen as the Reviewing Editor. Although there is a clear interest in the work, the reviewers have raised important issues. For the following reasons, we are unable to consider the manuscript for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The consensus is that the data provide little support for enhancers of changing accessibility as a genome-wide mechanism regulating regeneration. The question then becomes, is the identification of several new enhancers and of two new genes relevant to regeneration sufficient for publication by itself in <italic>eLife</italic>? The genome-wide data are clearly presented and explain how the genes and enhancers were identified, but they make for a long and distracting story. The reviewers suggest (and we agree) that you could make the manuscript smaller by accepting the pitfalls of whole disc ATAC-seq and provide the data in supplementary sections while the majority of the paper would focus on the experimentally confirmed regenerative genes as a more compact “Research Advance” to your 2016 paper in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Here is a summary of the reviews and concerns:</p><p>The paper by Harris et al. investigates how regenerative capacity decreases with time in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing disc. The Hariharan group has previously identified wingless as a gene that is induced following damage to wing discs in the early third instar but less responsive in the late third instar, when there is less capacity to regenerate, and mapped an enhancer that mediates this aspect of wingless gene expression. Because restoring <italic>wg</italic> expression does not restore regenerative capacity to older discs, they hypothesize that <italic>wg</italic> may be only one of multiple genes that are required. Here they searched genome-wide for other regulatory regions that contain adjacent damage response elements and maturity silencing elements that might identify such genes.</p><p>In the first part of the paper, Harris et al. identify and characterize an enhancer from the MMP1 gene that resembles that found at <italic>wg</italic>, and show that it also confers damage-responsive gene expression that loses activity with time. Based on commonalities between the MMP1 and <italic>wg</italic> enhancers, Harris et al. then set out to identify other such enhancers on a genome wide basis. The approach taken is to use ATAC-seq to search for chromatin that is opened in response to tissue damage in early L3 but not late L3. The approach taken is to use ATAC-seq to search for chromatin that is opened in response to tissue damage in early L3 but not late L3. This approach identified the known <italic>wg</italic> enhancer as maturity-silenced (MS), but was not able to detect its damage regulation (DR) in early L3. The approach did not detect the known MMP1 region at all, but did detect two other maturity-silenced MMP1 regulatory regions, one of which was validated experimentally. Given that damage-reactive chromatin accessibility does not seem as useful a criterion as expected, the authors supplement their results with published data on regenerative gene expression from another group. Combining all these data, they develop a shortlist of several genes that might be associated with DRMS regulatory elements, and test and verify 5 enhancers in transgenic flies.</p><p>To test whether any genes with DRMS enhancers are indeed required for regeneration, the authors first develop a neat assay system, called DUAL, which depends on LexA regulation for cell ablation so that Gal4/UAS can be used to knock-down candidate genes. Using DUAL, they show that CG9752, a previously uncharacterized gene encoding a secreted protein they now name <italic>asperous</italic>, is required for full regeneration, but surprisingly <italic>apontic</italic> is a negative regulator of regeneration.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The biggest difference in the data set results from developmental changes in gene expression. The regions that become less accessible are more numerous in undamaged early discs versus late discs (944 vs. 729). Automatically implicating Maturity silenced genes in regeneration is therefore misleading. Additionally, the enhancer regions that get more or less accessible in response to damage is very low in number. This may suggest a technical issue (in early discs, when rn&gt;GAL4 expressing genes are ablated the effect is more pronounced vs. later discs. This may be due to the relative abundance of rn&gt;GAL4 expressing genes compared to non-expressing cells.).</p><p>The underlying assumption that many enhancers in genes that play role in regeneration will only become accessible in response to damage is not supported. The opposite assumption that the genes for which the enhancer accessibility changed in response to damage are directly implicated in regeneration is unfounded too. The positive controls <italic>wg</italic> and <italic>mmp1</italic> themselves do not fit these criteria and do not meet the statistical significance cut off.</p><p>The modest agreement between the genes expressed in response to damage from Khan et al., 2017 data set and genes with enhancers containing DR and MS modules again suggest that the underlying assumption in enhancer dynamics in unsound. Only 5% of genes upregulated in damaged genes contain a DR enhancer module. If DR regions had a significant role in regulating damage response one would expect a higher overlap.</p><p>The authors then go on to analyze the other peaks that they identified with DR and MS modules. The authors suggest the presence of MS or DR motifs near genes implicated in diverse signaling pathways may indicate their expression may change in damage responsive manner (for genes in hippo pathway). They suggest that the genes in Toll pathway having MS modules may indicate that they have a new role in regeneration. The authors then suggest zelda that has MS peaks that do not meet the statistically significance cut off for DR may implicate this gene in regeneration. This part of the manuscript becomes highly speculative and should be removed in the absence of experimental evidence.</p><p>The authors tested 5 DRMS enhancers by cloning reporter genes and showed that these 5 reporters do indeed get activated to varying degrees in response to damage in early discs and get tuned down in late discs (the data is compelling for 4/5 genes, meg2 is not induced noticeably in response to damage).</p><p>The authors generated a genetic means using LexA/LexO orthogonal binary system to induce tissue damage independent of GAL4/UAS binary system (DUAL). This complicated system uses a flip-out controlled GAL4 and split LexA controlled expression of rpr or egr. What is puzzling is that by using LexA that are suppressible by Gal80ts drivers (Yagi et al., 2010) the authors could reach the same outcome in a genetically easier manner. The high number of transgenic constructs that are required for using this method will limit its usage.</p><p>The authors demonstrate the use of DUAL to knock down or overexpress genes that are implicated in regeneration (<italic>wg</italic>, <italic>mmp1</italic>, <italic>myc</italic>, <italic>upd1, 2, 3</italic> and <italic>dome</italic>). The regenerative potential of discs can be affected by overexpressing or knocking down these factors.</p><p>Finally, the authors tested 2 of the 5 genes for which they generated reporters and showed DRMS modules. Whereas <italic>apt</italic> knock down increases regenerative potential aspr knock-down decreases rate of regeneration. These data are compelling and suggest DUAL to be useful for screening for effectors in regeneration.</p><p>In summary:</p><p>1) Damage-induced changes in chromatin accessibility are less frequent than the authors expected/hoped. Please can the authors draw a clear and justified conclusion about whether they still consider this mechanism significant, or whether their data rule it out. At a minimum this would include what degrees of overlap between the ATAC-seq data and the gene expression data would have been expected by chance, and whether the 5% overlap observed is significant or suggests that accessibility is not a strong criterion for DR activity. The authors should also justify p[adj]&lt;0.1 as the cutoff for changes in chromatin accessibility, and address whether false positives from this relaxed cutoff contribute to the limited overlap with the gene expression data. Does overlap increase with more stringent cutoffs?</p><p>2) If chromatin accessibility is still considered an important indicator of damage responsiveness, please explain why the 5% of genes overlapping with gene expression data are not followed up as a set of interesting genes, and also why they do not follow up with the 28 potential DRMS enhancers defined by chromatin accessibility criteria? If damage-induced chromatin accessibility is not a significant feature of regeneration genes, then should the focus of the analysis be the 85 genes identified as DR from gene expression analysis and MS from chromatin accessibility? With neither of these gene sets is analyzed in depth, the logic of the study as a whole is unclear.</p><p>3) It is already known that chromatin accessibility of many genes reduces over time. The authors should make clear why it should be of special significance that this is also the case for genes involved in regeneration.</p><p>4) If a mutation in a single gene (<italic>apt</italic>) can improve regeneration, does this contradict the overall concept that multiple genes must be affected to improve or restore regeneration at late stages? Does <italic>esc</italic> affect <italic>apt</italic> expression, and if so how is this to be interpreted? Does <italic>apt</italic> affect gene silencing?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58305.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

The ATAC-seq experiment in this work was performed using whole discs, and as such the cells exhibiting damage-responsive changes (the blastema) only comprise a small number of the total cells analyzed. Therefore, the largest number of differences captured by this method are developmental changes arising from the surrounding undamaged tissue. Moreover, the blastema could represent a larger percentage of cells in younger discs, which could prevent some of the damage-responsive changes being detected in older discs. In the revised manuscript, we have explained the limitations of our experimental system in more explicit terms. Furthermore, as advised by the reviewers, we have moved most of the ATAC-seq data to figure supplements and indicated that we have used these data only as a guide to identify regions that could contain putative damage-responsive enhancers that are also silenced in mature discs and focused on those that we have validated experimentally.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The underlying assumption that many enhancers in genes that play role in regeneration will only become accessible in response to damage is not supported.

In those studies, the Lex::GAD transcriptional regulator was used in parallel with GAL4, with the expression of both genes being regulated by GAL80. Thus, both the lexAOp-regulated and UAS-regulated transgenes are expressed simultaneously (during the ablation phase), albeit in different spatial domains. We have developed DUAL Control to specifically manipulate gene expression in the blastema and surrounding region during the regeneration phase. The heat shock that triggers ablation also activates expression of GAL4 in the surrounding tissue (by a FLP-out) which results in sustained expression in these cells during the regeneration phase.

The authors should also justify padj&lt;0.1 as the cutoff for changes in chromatin accessibility, and address whether false positives from this relaxed cutoff contribute to the limited overlap with the gene expression data. Does overlap increase with more stringent cutoffs?</p></disp-quote><p>We have acknowledged the limitations of the genome-wide approach, and that using whole discs potentially masks signals from regenerating cells. Thus, the targets we identify are likely an underestimate, and as such we cannot evaluate the degree to which this mechanism might contribute to the regulation of the regeneration program as a whole. We have clarified that the whole genome-data is not a comprehensive list of potential enhancer regions, but using the data as a guide has allowed us to identify bona fide enhancers (damage-responsive and maturity silenced) that indeed regulate genes that function in regeneration. Thus, at least some of these enhancers display chromatin accessibility changes that correlate with their activity. This mechanism is likely to be significant for some genes, but it is difficult to make clear statements regarding the number of genes that might be regulated in this way.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) If chromatin accessibility is still considered an important indicator of damage responsiveness, please explain why the 5% of genes overlapping with gene expression data are not followed up as a set of interesting genes, and also why they do not follow up with the 28 potential DRMS enhancers defined by chromatin accessibility criteria? If damage-induced chromatin accessibility is not a significant feature of regeneration genes, then should the focus of the analysis be the 85 genes identified as DR from gene expression analysis and MS from chromatin accessibility? With neither of these gene sets is analyzed in depth, the logic of the study as a whole is unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>The manuscript has been reworked to no longer rely on the ATAC-seq data as a comprehensive list of damage-responsive regions. We have removed the characterization and interpretation of the data set as a whole, and instead include it only as a means to identify four new DRMS enhancers and to characterize two of the relevant genes in greater detail.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is already known that chromatin accessibility of many genes reduces over time. The authors should make clear why it should be of special significance that this is also the case for genes involved in regeneration.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now focused on the paper on specific genes involved in regeneration that are adjacent to experimentally-validated DRMS enhancers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) If a mutation in a single gene (apt) can improve regeneration, does this contradict the overall concept that multiple genes must be affected to improve or restore regeneration at late stages? Does esc affect apt expression, and if so how is this to be interpreted? Does apt affect gene silencing?</p></disp-quote><p>If regeneration in maturing discs is indeed suppressed by the silencing of multiple DRMS enhancers that regulate genes promoting regeneration, it could be restored, at least in principle, in two different ways: (1) By alleviating the silencing at multiple DRMS enhancers – knockdown of <italic>esc</italic> likely functions in this way, and (2) by activating pathways that function downstream of genes that promote regeneration (bypass suppression). Our previous work (Worley et al., 2018, <italic>eLife</italic>) has shown that the JAK/STAT pathway can promote plasticity during regeneration. Knockdown of <italic>apt</italic> increases expression of the STAT reporter. Perhaps this still poorly-understood mechanism acts in parallel to the alleviation of PcG-mediated silencing.</p><p>We have shown that <italic>esc</italic> knockdown does de-repress the <italic>apt</italic> enhancer. However, the antibody staining was not sufficiently robust to determine whether Apt protein levels were also affected.</p><p><italic>esc</italic> knockdown likely depresses many maturity-silenced enhancers and those that we have studied are probably a small subset. Since the effect of <italic>esc</italic> knockdown is to improve regeneration, it is likely that it the effect of derepressing genes that promote regeneration must outweigh the effect of derepressing those that restrict regeneration. The genes that we have characterized that are regulated by DRMS enhancers (<italic>wg</italic>, <italic>Wnt6</italic>, <italic>Mmp1</italic>, <italic>asperous/CG9572</italic> and <italic>apontic</italic>) represent four positive regulators of regeneration and one negative regulator of regeneration. It is often the case that the induction of specific cellular programs include the induction of inhibitors of that same program. We think that <italic>apt</italic> falls into that category.</p><p>We have modified the Discussion to address these points.</p></body></sub-article></article>
