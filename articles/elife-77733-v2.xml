Moreover, for genes that are expressed in multiple tissues or at multiple stages of development, the use of tissue-specific expression of the Cre recombinase allows gene function to be perturbed in specific cell types and/or at specific times. However, it is well known that putative tissue-specific promoters often drive unanticipated ‘off-target’ expression. In our efforts to explore the biology of the male reproductive tract, we unexpectedly found that expression of Cre in the central nervous system resulted in recombination in the epididymis, a tissue where sperm mature for ~1–2 weeks following the completion of testicular development. Remarkably, we not only observed reporter expression in the epididymis when Cre expression was driven from neuron-specific transgenes, but also when Cre expression in the brain was induced from an AAV vector carrying a Cre expression construct. A surprisingly wide range of Cre drivers – including six different neuronal promoters as well as the adipose-specific <italic>Adipoq</italic> Cre promoter – exhibited off-target recombination in the epididymis, with a subset of drivers also exhibiting unexpected activity in other tissues such as the reproductive accessory glands. Using a combination of parabiosis and serum transfer experiments, we find evidence supporting the hypothesis that Cre may be trafficked from its cell of origin to the epididymis through the circulatory system. Together, our findings should motivate caution when interpreting conditional alleles, and suggest the exciting possibility of inter-tissue RNA or protein trafficking in modulation of reproductive biology.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>reproduction</kwd><kwd>germline</kwd><kwd>conditional genetics</kwd><kwd>circulating RNA</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100011730</institution-id><institution>Templeton World Charity Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>61350</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rinaldi</surname><given-names>Vera</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HD080224</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Desevin</surname><given-names>Kathleen</given-names></name><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Fengyun</given-names></name><name><surname>Rando</surname><given-names>Oliver J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DA047678</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tapper</surname><given-names>Andrew R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP1AG063419</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Messemer</surname><given-names>Kathleen</given-names></name><name><surname>Wagers</surname><given-names>Amy J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Tissue-specific Cre recombinase often drives 'off-target' reporter activity in the male reproductive tract, suggesting the potential for inter-tissue RNA or protein trafficking in control of sperm maturation or other aspects of reproductive physiology.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The transition from unicellular life to multicellular life allowed organisms to delegate tasks to cells which could then specialize rather than being required to carry out all the functions of the organism. The disparate functions of different cell types are coordinated by a wide array of mechanisms, including direct cell-cell contacts within a tissue, shared access to nutrient pools, and both local (paracrine) and longer-range trafficking of small molecule and peptide signals. These signals often carry information about global organismal states such as hunger/satiety (insulin, leptin, etc.), reproductive status (testosterone, estrogen, etc.), stress (cortisol, adrenaline, etc.), and a multitude of other relatively blunt summaries of organismal status.</p><p>In addition to such coarse-grained signals of organismal physiology, it is increasingly understood that more detailed molecular signals can be communicated between distant tissues. This is particularly clear in the well-documented cases of systemic RNA trafficking seen in worms and plants. For instance, in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, introduction of double stranded RNA either by injection or by feeding with dsRNA-expressing bacteria leads to organism-wide silencing of homologous genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fire et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Timmons and Fire, 1998</xref>), demonstrating that RNAs can traffic from the gut or hypodermis throughout the body, with sequence-specific regulatory consequences in the recipient tissue. Moreover, expression of RNAi triggers in neurons has been shown to silence target genes in the germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Devanapally et al., 2015</xref>), again demonstrating trafficking of relatively precise RNA signals between tissues. Systemic RNA trafficking is also well described in plants, as various means of introducing dsRNA into aerial tissues can drive sequence-specific silencing in roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Palauqui et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Voinnet et al., 1998</xref>). These examples of systemic RNA trafficking highlight the potential for more precise molecular signaling between tissues than achievable via the relatively blunt information content available with hormonal signals.</p><p>In mammals, many studies have reported RNA or protein trafficking between different cell types within the same tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">van Niel et al., 2018</xref>), or between distant tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Thomou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Poggio et al., 2019</xref>). Although this is well documented for several somatic tissues, in the unique case of the germline there are only sporadic reports of RNA trafficking from distant tissues to germ cells themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cossetti et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">O’Brien et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Conine and Rando, 2022</xref>). That said, it is worth noting that gametogenesis is supported by a wide variety of somatic cells and accessory tissues, and these could serve as intermediaries between distal tissues and developing gametes. These reproductive support cells/tissues include testicular cell populations such as the Sertoli cells that act as the spermatogonial stem cell niche and broadly support testicular spermatogenesis, as well as other tissues such as the epididymis, seminal vesicle, and prostate that contribute to sperm maturation and delivery to the female reproductive tract. Given the key roles of these tissues in sperm development and maturation, we were motivated to explore the potential for inter-tissue signaling to play a role in modulating reproductive tract physiology.</p><p>Here, we leverage the exquisite sensitivity of Cre-dependent recombination to identify inter-tissue communication pathways in the adult mouse, focusing on the male reproductive tract. We find that expression of Cre in multiple distant tissues, most notably including the central nervous system (CNS), results in expression of a Cre-dependent reporter gene in the epididymis. Reporter activity is observed following Cre expression in the CNS induced via adeno-associated viral (AAV) transduction, as well as in animals carrying Cre under the control of a variety of tissue-specific promoters. Parabiosis (in which two animals share a conjoined circulatory system) and serum transfer studies suggest that this ‘off-target’ reporter activity likely results from Cre trafficking from distant tissues to the epididymis via the circulatory system. Together, our findings highlight the epididymis as a surprisingly common site for unanticipated off-target effects in conditional knockout studies, and establish a novel model for inter-tissue communication in mammals.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Throughout this study, we utilize the Ai14D reporter mouse strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Madisen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kauffman et al., 2018</xref>) to assay Cre activity throughout the body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This reporter carries a transgene at the ‘safe harbor’ <italic>Rosa26</italic> locus, with a ubiquitously expressed <italic>CAG</italic> promoter driving expression of a transgene with a 3× STOP cassette flanked by two <italic>LoxP</italic> sites, followed by a fluorescent reporter gene encoding tdTomato. Cre recombinase excises the STOP cassette, resulting in robust tdTomato (hereafter, Tomato) expression in Cre-expressing cells. For the majority of the experiments described below, Tomato expression is assayed in tissues cleared using a modified CLARITY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chung and Deisseroth, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cronan et al., 2015</xref>) protocol, and visualized using lightsheet microscopy to survey entire tissues. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> shows a typical negative control image of an epididymis taken from an Ai14D animal lacking any Cre expression.

This segment-delimited expression is readily apparent in images of the whole epididymis, while cross sections show that Tomato expression is confined to the principal cells (but not basal or other interstitial cells) of the epididymal epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Tomato expression is notably absent from the sperm-filled lumen.

In two series of experiments, Cre expression was induced in the mouse brain via stereotaxic delivery of AAV constructs engineered to drive Cre expression in transduced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In an initial series of experiments, we utilized an AAV2-retro-Ef1a-Cre construct introduced into the prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), while follow-up studies targeted the lateral somatosensory cortex, caudate putamen, and nucleus accumbens using an AAV9-pCMV-Cre construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

These findings strongly support the hypothesis that Cre activity (RNA or protein) is the relevant molecular signal trafficked from the CNS to the epididymis.</p><p>Together, our findings suggest the possibility that Cre RNA or protein synthesized in the CNS is transported to the male reproductive tract, presumably through the circulation (see below). Importantly, the two experimental schemes used to drive Cre expression in the CNS have distinct and unrelated potential artifacts. In the case of AAV transduction, the injected virus could conceivably enter the circulation and might have an unknown tropism for the epididymis. However, this concern does not apply to the use of transgenic constructs to drive Cre expression. Conversely, it is well known that purportedly tissue-specific Cre drivers are often less cell type-specific than expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Song and Palmiter, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Stifter and Greter, 2020</xref>), and the male reproductive tract – the testis in particular – is well known to express an unusually high fraction of the genome. However, this cannot explain our results using viral transduction to drive Cre expression in the CNS. We further test the hypothesis that Cre is trafficked via the circulation to the male reproductive tract below.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Many-to-many mapping between Cre drivers and recipient tissues</title><p>Our findings thus far suggest the intriguing possibility that the epididymis might be a privileged recipient of neuronally derived molecular cargo.

That said, in contrast to the Ai14D; <italic>Syn<sup>Cre</sup></italic> animals we found no detectable labeling of sperm in Ai14D; <italic>Nes<sup>Cre</sup></italic> animals, with Tomato expression in the epididymis largely confined to the epididymal epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). This suggests that <italic>Nes<sup>Cre</sup></italic>-mediated recombination occurs relatively late during spermatogenesis in germ cells, with recombination in the epididymal epithelium occurring independently – probably induced by the same CNS→epididymis trafficking seen for several other neuronal Cre drivers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and below).</p><p>Turning from pan-neuronal promoters to more cell type-specific CNS Cre drivers, we consistently observed Tomato expression in the epididymis when Cre was expressed from <italic>Slc32a1</italic>, <italic>Fev</italic>, <italic>Gad2</italic>, and <italic>Drd1a</italic> promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). For two of these Cre drivers – <italic>Fev</italic> and <italic>Slc32a1</italic> – we find that Tomato expression was strongest in the cauda epididymis and vas deferens, similar to our findings obtained using AAV to drive Cre expression in the CNS. In contrast, both Ai14D; <italic>Gad2<sup>Cre</sup></italic> and Ai14D; <italic>Drd1a<sup>Cre</sup></italic> double transgenic animals exhibited patchy epithelial staining throughout the epididymis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Intriguingly, off-target epididymal recombination was not unique to neuronal Cre drivers, as we also observed robust Tomato expression and reporter locus recombination in animals carrying the adipose-specific <italic>Adipoq<sup>Cre</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In contrast, reporter animals carrying the liver-specific <italic>Alb<sup>Cre</sup></italic> transgene exhibited barely detectable Tomato expression in the epididymis with few Tomato-positive cells detected throughout the entire tissue – at most one or two cells per longitudinal section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) – indicating that not all Cre transgenes drive extensive recombination in the epididymis.</p><p>Thus, although our initial studies suggested a privileged molecular trafficking pathway from the CNS to the male reproductive tract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>), the robust Tomato expression driven by the adipose-specific <italic>Adipoq</italic> Cre driver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) suggested the possibility of additional avenues for unanticipated inter-tissue Cre trafficking. Not only did non-neuronal Cre drivers direct recombination in the epididymis, but multiple neuronal Cre drivers exhibited off-target activities in tissues beyond the epididymis.

Given the extraordinary nature of this finding, we were concerned that our results might reflect some idiosyncracy of the LoxP-flanked Tomato reporter locus in the Ai14D strain. We first explored publicly available annotations for Cre drivers from MGI (Mouse Genome Informatics: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.informatics.jax.org">https://www.informatics.jax.org</ext-link>, data retrieved repeatedly from ~2018 through October 2022), which includes images from a variety of Cre drivers crossed to a LacZ reporter line. Of the lines that drive recombination in Ai14D in our study, there is also clear evidence for recombination in the epididymis epithelium for <italic>Syn1<sup>Cre</sup></italic>, along with ‘ambiguous’ expression annotated for <italic>Nes<sup>Cre</sup></italic> and <italic>Gad2<sup>Cre</sup></italic>. However, closer examination of the image provided for <italic>Nes<sup>Cre</sup></italic> also revealed clear evidence for reporter expression in the epididymis epithelium; no image was available for <italic>Gad2<sup>Cre</sup></italic>. These reporter assays thus are consistent with our findings using the Ai14D reporter animal.

However, given that epididymal activity was annotated as ‘ambiguous’ for <italic>Nes<sup>Cre</sup></italic> despite clear microscopic evidence for reporter expression, we were concerned about false negative annotations for these other Cre drivers, for which either no images were available for scrutiny, or the available image was limited to a very narrow region of the epididymis. Nonetheless, the lack of annotated recombination in this dataset, for Cre drivers which exhibit robust activity in our system, suggested the possibility that some reporter loci could be relatively resistant to Cre activity – by virtue of the target locus being packaged in relatively inaccessible chromatin in the epididymis, for instance – compared to the Tomato reporter locus present in the Ai14D animal.</p><p>To extend our findings to other target loci, we therefore obtained double transgenic animals carrying the <italic>Adipoq</italic> Cre driver along with a conditional allele of <italic>Dicer1</italic> with LoxP sites flanking exons 21 and 22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). PCR genotyping confirmed the expected robust recombination in adipose tissue, while tail tip DNA was used as a negative control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Using this assay, we document recombination of this locus specifically in the cauda epididymis, but not in the testis or other parts of the epididymis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These data thus extend our results to a second target locus, demonstrating that off-target recombination in the epididymis is not unique to the Ai14D reporter.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Cre activity likely traffics through the circulation to target the epididymis</title><p>Together, our findings reveal that the epididymis is a surprisingly common target of a variety of Cre drivers that are not generally thought to be expressed in the male reproductive tract. While the observations made using double transgenic lines could result from leaky expression of the promoters in question – whether in adulthood or during early development of the epididymis – this hypothesis would not explain the results observed following AAV-mediated Cre expression in the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

We find a many-to-many mapping, with ‘sender’ tissues including multiple neuronal subpopulations along with adipose tissue, and recipient tissues including the epididymis, seminal vesicle, prostate, and intestine. Importantly, different Cre lines drive recombination in different sets of tissues, arguing against the possibility that a generic ‘sink’ tissue nonspecifically receives any RNAs or proteins present in the circulation.</p><p>These findings are most generally of interest to the mouse genetics community. It has long been clear that transgenes carrying Cre under the control of a putatively cell type-specific promoter are often expressed in unexpected tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Song and Palmiter, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Stifter and Greter, 2020</xref>), and here for example our data confirm prior reports of germline activity of <italic>Nes</italic><sup>Cre</sup> and <italic>Syn1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> drivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Luo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Betz et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">McLeod et al., 2020</xref>). Our findings also identify many new examples of off-target Cre activity for a variety of Cre lines, many of which may have been missed before given the relatively small size of the scientific community focused on the epididymis. In this context our data simply further emphasize the importance of characterizing recombination in conditional knockout studies, as recombination in unanticipated tissues has the potential to confound interpretations of tissue-specific functions of genes of interest. Given the common off-target recombination in the epididymis, seminal vesicle and prostate documented here, this is most obviously true for any studies focused on male reproductive biology, but as we also find unexpected Cre activity in intestine driven by neuronal Cre drivers we emphasize more general caution when using Cre-Lox genetics in mouse.</p><p>The impact of these off-target effects will of course depend on the nature of the conditional allele used in a given study. It is worth noting that even in the cases of double transgenics exhibiting robust recombination in the epididymis (<italic>Slc32a1</italic>, <italic>Adipoq</italic>, etc. – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>), we find fairly patchy recombination in the epididymal epithelium. This mosaic recombination behavior has different implications for conditional knockouts, where a large number of epididymis (or seminal vesicle, etc.) cells will escape deletion, vs. gain of function studies where even patchy Cre-dependent induction of gene expression (such as the tdTomato reporter used here) in the target tissue has the potential to exhibit artifactual gain of function.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>What is the mechanistic basis for off-target activity of neuronal Cre drivers?</title><p>The fact that putatively tissue-specific Cre drivers can often drive recombination in unanticipated tissues has long been known. This is commonly thought to reflect ‘leaky’ expression of a given Cre transgene, potentially owing to the removal of a given promoter from its genomic context (and thus from long-range regulatory elements) in many Cre drivers. In addition, while many promoters chosen as cell type-specific Cre drivers are highly expressed in the cell type of interest, they are often also expressed at lower levels in other cell types throughout the body where the Cre transgene therefore has the potential to drive recombination.</p><p>That said, our data showing off-target Cre activity in the epididymis are unlikely to result from leaky expression of the Cre drivers studied here, for multiple reasons. First of all, we find a wide range of Cre transgenes drive recombination in the epididymis, and most of the neuron-specific genes in question are not detectably expressed in the adult epididymis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Johnston et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Rinaldi et al., 2020</xref>). It remains plausible that these genes could be expressed in the epididymis only during early development, before becoming undetectable in the adult epididymis. However, our observation that induction of Cre expression in the brain via AAV-mediated transduction leads to reporter activity in the epididymis epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>) cannot be explained by leaky transgene expression. Conversely, the possibility that unanticipated tropism of the AAV constructs used here might result in viral transduction of the epididymis would not explain any of the results obtained using double transgenics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Together, these findings strongly suggest that Cre activity synthesized in neurons is transported to the epididymis.</p><p>The delivery of Cre from neurons to the epididymis could occur via a number of routes, including release of Cre-containing vesicles by peripheral neurons that innervate the cauda epididymis. We consider this to be unlikely for several reasons. First, we show that adipose-specific Cre expression reliably drives recombination in the epididymis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), arguing against Cre transfer requiring neuronal termini. Second, induction of Cre expression specifically in one hemisphere of the brain via stereotactic AAV injections was shown to lead to Tomato expression in both the ipsilateral and contralateral epididymis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), arguing against short-range neuronal delivery (not to mention the challenges in considering how Cre might move from the CNS to peripheral nerves).</p><p>Indeed, our follow-up studies using parabioses and serum transfers support the hypothesis that Cre activity synthesized in a variety of tissues can access the circulation and subsequently be trafficked to the male reproductive tract. Although these efforts to transfer Cre activity from a Cre-expressing animal to a reporter animal were inefficient, the fact that recombination was <italic>ever</italic> observed in these studies is best explained by the trafficking hypothesis. We speculate that the circulating Cre activity consists of <italic>Cre</italic> mRNA, rather than protein, and we anticipate that the RNA is present either in exosomes or in ribonucleoprotein complexes protected from serum nucleases. Indeed, we can document <italic>Cre</italic> mRNA by PCR in the circulation of multiple Cre lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), and there is abundant precedent for RNA transmission between different tissues. We cannot presently determine whether the transferred Cre activity is contained in exosomes, microvesicles, ribonucleoprotein complexes, or other forms. Again, precedent argues for exosomes as the carriers of inter-tissue molecular information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Valadi et al., 2007</xref>), but given the inefficiency of Cre transfer in serum and exosome injections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), a detailed fractionation effort would require an inordinate number of animals to be used, and must be reserved for future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Potential biological implications</title><p>Discovery of a pathway by which neurons (and some other tissues) potentially traffic RNAs (or proteins) to the male reproductive tract would have exciting implications. Most intriguingly, we speculate that environmental conditions experienced by a male could be interpreted by the CNS, with salient features of the environment then communicated to the male reproductive tract via this trafficking system. Given the emerging role for the epididymis in remodeling multiple aspects of maturing sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gervasi and Visconti, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Tamessar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>), an appealing hypothesis would be that receipt of CNS-derived information – whether RNAs (mRNAs, lincRNAs, sncRNAs, etc.), proteins, etc. – could then influence epididymal physiology and thus alter the post-testicular maturation of germ cells in the male reproductive tract.</p><p>Interestingly, at least two prior studies in the paternal effects literature have suggested the possibility that circulating information may play a role in reprogramming the sperm epigenome. First, in their studies of intergenerational effects of carbon tetrachloride, Zeybel et al. reported that repeated serum transfers from CCl<sub>4</sub>-treated animals to a recipient were sufficient to reproduce H3K27me3 changes in the sperm of the recipient animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Zeybel et al., 2012</xref>). More recently, Mansuy and colleagues reported that transferring serum from males subject to early life stress to a recipient male was sufficient to drive altered glucose responses in the F1 offspring of the recipient animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">van Steenwyk et al., 2020</xref>), again suggesting that circulating factors may play a role in reprogramming the sperm epigenome. Although neither of these studies implicated circulating RNAs in modulating sperm biology – Zeybel et al. did not speculate about the nature of the soluble factor(s), while van Steenwyk et al. focused on lipids with the potential to activate various nuclear hormone receptors – they highlight the potential for circulating factors to mediate communication between distant tissues and the germline.</p><p>This possibility of inter-tissue RNA shipments between distant tissues and the germline is particularly intriguing considering the role of systemic RNA trafficking in worms and plants. Most relevant to our study, small RNAs produced in <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurons have been documented to silence genes in the germline and induce transgenerational silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Devanapally et al., 2015</xref>). Intriguingly, a prior report in mouse suggested that microRNAs expressed in the brain could be delivered to sperm, and subsequently to the next generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">O’Brien et al., 2020</xref>). However, with the exception of <italic>Syn1</italic> and <italic>Nestin</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), we do not find any evidence for neuronal Cre trafficking directly to sperm cells, arguing against the idea that the circulating Cre activity is stably delivered to sperm. Even in the case of <italic>Syn1</italic> and <italic>Nestin</italic> Cre drivers, recombination in the germline likely occurs prior to the last stages of spermatogenesis in the testis – potentially in spermatogonial stem cells or even earlier in development – and not during epididymal transit. Our data instead would place the epididymis as a mediator between neuronal information processing and programming of the sperm epigenome, with CNS-derived information potentially driving altered epididymal physiology and consequent remodeling of sperm small RNAs, proteins, or surface lipids.</p><p>An alternative explanation of our findings would be that neuronally derived molecular information does not have any physiological consequences upon uptake by the epididymis. In such a ‘trash can’ model, the epididymis could simply be unusually receptive to circulating exosomes or RNPs, with the unique sensitivity of Cre-Lox systems revealing the delivery of Cre molecules at abundances that would likely be meaningless for a typical cellular sncRNA, mRNA, or protein. We disfavor this model, in part because different Cre drivers result in recombination in different parts of the epididymis, arguing for some level of specificity between different tissue-derived exosomes (for instance) and target cell populations in the epididymis.</p><p>Nonetheless, without any evidence for physiological functions for this trafficking system we cannot formally rule out the trash can hypothesis at present; we envision two potential approaches to this question in the future. One possibility would be to subject male mice to some stress paradigm or other exposure, then identify changes in transcription or small RNA production in the epididymis. Subsequently, males could be subject to the exposure in question, with circulating serum/exosomes then isolated and injected into an unexposed recipient. In this scenario, if circulating material is responsible for programming epididymal gene expression, the recipient animal would be expected to exhibit the molecular changes seen in directly exposed animals. While this approach could be very powerful, our experience with serum/exosome transfers has been that exosome transfer results in very inefficient transfer of Cre activity between animals, with exosomes from at least nine donor animals required for patchy and low-penetrance reporter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). This suggests that serum from scores of animals might be required for a single recipient to recapitulate the epididymal changes driven by direct exposures.</p><p>An alternative approach would be to identify the molecular basis for epididymal receptivity to neuronal information. For instance, if the circulating carrier of neuronal information is indeed present in exosomes, tetraspanins or other cell surface molecules are presumably responsible for tissue-specific targeting of exosomes to the epididymis. Identification of the relevant exosome receptor could then be used in knockout studies to prevent receipt of neuronal shipments, and changes in epididymal responses to various organismal stressors in wild type vs. knockout animals could then be used to identify potential effects of neuronal RNA/protein shipments on epididymal physiology.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Here, we have demonstrated that Cre activity synthesized in neurons and in adipose tissue consistently directs recombination in the epididymis – with some lines also having other off-target tissues. These findings add to the literature on the dangers of Cre-Lox genetics in conditional knockout studies, identifying additional off-target tissues for a number of Cre drivers. In addition, our data suggest that this poor tissue specificity could be caused in part by mobilization of Cre activity through the circulation, implying a surprising mechanism behind some of these off-target effects. Finally, the possibility that this pathway plays a role in sensing of environmental conditions in modulation of the sperm epigenome represents an exciting hypothesis for future studies in paternal effect epigenetics.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse husbandry</title><p>All animal use was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of UMass Chan Medical School and Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences, under protocol PROTO202100029 to Dr Oliver Rando and protocol 29014 awarded to Dr Amy Wagers.

It is interesting that the Cre does not appear to transfer between cells in the epididymis, that the edited areas are patchy in some cases. Similarly not all Cre lines seemed to send Cre to the same epididymal cells. How does that fit mechanisms like &quot;trash can&quot;?</p><p>2. Considering the authors' hypothesis and their test using serum or exosome injection, why not test the model by injecting Cre, or Cre-encoding RNA in liposomes or artificial exosomes into the tail of the mice, and test for epididymal editing?</p><p>3. In addition to having clear and convincing figures, the paper is well written, with the authors anticipating questions that could arise, and providing experiments or arguments to address them. An example is their compelling argument against the idea that Cre is transmitted directly by neurons.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>If off-target expression is noted in the male reproductive tract, is it also detected in the female reproductive tract? Addressing this might reveal clues to the specificity of this present observation, perhaps tracing back to the primordial divergence in male/female reproductive organs The epididymis develops from the mesonephric duct and while development is regressed in females, there may be remnant tissue/cells which also express Cre.</p><p>The other commonality to all the experiments is the use of tdTOMATO. An alternative Cre-dependent system should be explored e.g. using a Cre-DREDD?</p><p>The age of the animals used in the initial experiments (Figure 1) is not clearly stated in the Methods, or figure legends. I can only assume these are 8-12 week old mice as that is the age then the subsequent AAV injection study was conducted. Is Cre activity similarly expressed in young juvenile animals? If not, perhaps there is some level of regulation by sex steroids?</p><p>What is the basis for the differential expression of Cre within the caput epididymis itself? This is quite the outstanding visual difference in expression and should be considered further. Could this be related to its pattern of venous perfusion? Or is it a more complex interaction between the CLARITY process and the cellular/structural composition of this region?</p><p>Was confirmatory profiling of neuron-specific genes and adipose performed on the caput vs corpus/cauda to confirm their presence/expression? The diffuse pattern of expression is perhaps suggestive of some level of structural specificity. Does this align with the authors' previous work on the epididymal cell atlas?</p><p>With regards to the AAV study, is it possible to perform PCR quantification to detect viral particles in the caput? Also, in this case, it would be interesting to know how long is Cre expression maintained for?</p><p>It is not clear why a limited exposure of three transfers over 5 days was selected. Was this protocol based on published methodology, including administration through the tail vein? Perhaps the inconsistent outcomes were due to a larger exposure being required.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I suggest the authors to spend more time to make their data more complete and thus conclusive, as to make the result stand the test of time.</p><p>1. First and foremost, the author should check the expression of the &quot;brain tissue-specific&quot; Cre driver gene in the epididymis (e.g., mRNA level) in wildtype mice and the Cre lines, because the tissue specificity of these genes may not be so specific. For example, the pan-neuronal maker Syn1 are also identified expressed in the human sperm [PMID: 26566474]. A stochastic expression of the Cre driver gene can result in the expression of Cre protein that are sufficient to induce cleavage in the expressed few cells, this is consistent with authors observation that the Cre-loxp recombination effect are shown in cell scattered in the epididymal/vas deferens tissue. My point is, this possibility of transcriptional leakage should be stringently tested, which could be a main reason of the Cre leakage, or exist in paradelle to the other proposed reason (Cre mRNA/protein transported from another tissue).</p><p>2. Figure 3: In the E panel, there is no PCR product of Vas def under the No Cre condition both for the Rec 7 and Rec 11. This is not correct. Without Cre, there should be a larger intact band as observed in other samples. Similar problems have been observed in Figure 5c, where serval samples were failed to detect a PCR product including Sem Ves, Kidney. The author should re-check their PCR condition or the DNA quality of these tissues. This type of data, in my opinion, is not suitable for publication because this lead to doubts on the reliability of the PCR result, and decrease the credibility of the conclusion.</p><p>3. Also, in Figure 3B panel, the author shows the image of liver, kidney, intestine, and testis, it is better to including the PCR results of these tissues in the E panel, which will make the data more consistent (gross image showing on red fluorescence signal is a weak demonstration, because the tissue are pretty large and there could be scattered red signal in a few cells can could only be observed under tissue section).</p><p>4. Moreover, in Fig3E, the author should clarify the PCR product length of the original DNA and recombined DNA by the Rec7 and Rec11 primers in their Figure legends, some reader may neglect the primer details in the method section. Did the author wrongly label the Rec11 and Rec7? since the Rec11 should have a larger length for the recombined PCR product, but in the figure it shows a smaller product. Also, there is faint band in the H2O Lane for the Rec11 primer which may cause false positive in this assay in other experiments, the author should be more careful to interpretate the results with faint band observed.</p><p>5.

Basically, every animal assayed in this study was taken relatively soon after male mice become sexually mature – double transgenic and AAV recipient animals were typically sacrificed for assays ~10-12 weeks after birth.

However, our initial experiments – which lead to successful reporter activity in the recipient – and indeed most of those reported in Figures 6 and S9 (now Figure 6-supplement 1), used this transfer scheme. In other words, we chose this regimen because it worked initially. However, the variable success in subsequent trials led us to add more transfer days, or increase the amount of material transferred, but as detailed in the manuscript we were never able to find an exposure regime that reliably leads to recombination in the recipient animal.

We have extensive RNA-Seq data from the epididymis, with bulk RNA-Seq of the caput, corpus, cauda, and vas, as well as a single-cell RNA-Seq atlas (Rinaldi et al. 2020). We did interrogate this dataset for expression of the genes associated with our various Cre drivers: “We note that the majority of these genes are either undetectable or expressed at extremely low levels (~1 ppm) in the epididymis as assayed either by bulk or single cell RNA-Seq”.

Addressing this might reveal clues to the specificity of this present observation, perhaps tracing back to the primordial divergence in male/female reproductive organs The epididymis develops from the mesonephric duct and while development is regressed in females, there may be remnant tissue/cells which also express Cre.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question, and one we did look into, albeit shallowly. We have found little evidence for Tomato expression – one fleck of fluorescence in lightsheet images, or a single cell across multiple histology sections – in the ovary, uterus or oviducts in AAV recipients, or in double transgenics carrying Vgat, Alb, Fev, ChAT Cre drivers. We did observe some Tomato signal in the uterus and oviducts of Ai14D;<italic>Nest<sup>Cre</sup></italic> double transgenics, but did not characterize this signal in any detail. So overall we find much less evidence for this type of trafficking in the female reproductive tract, but we did not survey enough animals to make this claim with any confidence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The other commonality to all the experiments is the use of tdTOMATO.

I can only assume these are 8-12 week old mice as that is the age then the subsequent AAV injection study was conducted. Is Cre activity similarly expressed in young juvenile animals? If not, perhaps there is some level of regulation by sex steroids?</p></disp-quote><p>Apologies, this should have been detailed, thanks for pointing this out. We have now clarified the ages of the animals used in the Methods section. As the reviewer speculates, we typically use 8-12 week old males for AAV experiments and double transgenics. The only exceptions were serum/exosome transfers, where recipients were typically ~10-15 weeks of age, but donors were usually 15-25 weeks of age as this allowed for more serum to be obtained.</p><p>We have not done any systematic analysis of Cre activity over an animal’s lifetime, although nothing in our experience suggested more reporter activity in older animals than in younger ones. It is an interesting possibility but we did not explore this systematically.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What is the basis for the differential expression of Cre within the caput epididymis itself? This is quite the outstanding visual difference in expression and should be considered further. Could this be related to its pattern of venous perfusion? Or is it a more complex interaction between the CLARITY process and the cellular/structural composition of this region?</p></disp-quote><p>I am not 100% sure about the meaning of this question. Is the question why some parts of the overall epididymis tend to light up? Most Cre drivers light up the cauda – distal – epididymis, with less activity in the caput. Or if the question is read literally, the question is why, within one section of the epididymis, Tomato expression is patchy/heterogeneous. To some extent we suspect the answer to both questions could be variability in the distribution of, say, an exosome receptor on cell surfaces – some tetraspanin most likely. So we might see better targeting of the cauda over the caput thanks to <italic>Tspan8</italic> expression in the cauda epithelium but little expression in the caput. Similarly, cell to cell variability within a segment in <italic>Tspan8</italic> (etc.) expression could be the reason for the patchy reporter activity. Beyond that, the two questions could also have distinct answers. Targeting of the cauda but not the caput for <italic>Vgat<sup>Cre</sup></italic> for example could conceivably be driven by differences in the structure and/or penetration of vasculature into this tissue. The caput epididymis, for instance, is characterized by fenestrated endothelium and as such would be more likely to be targeted nonspecifically by trafficked vesicles – comfortingly, we tend to see better targeting of the cauda than the caput, so we are not particularly concerned that the location of fenestrated endothelium explains our findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Was confirmatory profiling of neuron-specific genes and adipose performed on the caput vs corpus/cauda to confirm their presence/expression? The diffuse pattern of expression is perhaps suggestive of some level of structural specificity. Does this align with the authors' previous work on the epididymal cell atlas?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good question. The answer is that by and large we do not see expression of adipose and neuron-specific genes in the epididymis, either in bulk tissue RNA-Seq or in our single cell atlas. There are of course overlapping genes – <italic>Npy</italic> (encoding neuropeptide Y) is an unexpected marker of Segment 7 Principal Cells – but none of the promoters we explored in this study (eg <italic>Vgat</italic>, <italic>AdipoQ</italic>, etc.) is associated with anything beyond minimal (~1 ppm or less) mRNA levels in the epididymis. There are two likely explanations here. One would be that exosomal RNA packaging has some specificity for a subset of mRNAs in the originating cell, and <italic>Cre</italic> turns out to be a good candidate for inter-tissue trafficking while <italic>Vgat</italic> and other genes are not as enriched or are depleted from circulating information. Whether or not this is true, the other key point is that Cre-Lox genetics has a very high gain – one molecule of Cre could in principle be sufficient to drive LoxP recombination, leading to permanent Tomato expression well after the degradation of the instigating Cre molecule. So we believe the incredibly high signal amplification possible with Cre-Lox allows us to observe evidence for Cre activity, while rare molecules of <italic>Vgat</italic> mRNA (etc.) will not appreciably affect the RNA landscape of epididymal tissue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>With regards to the AAV study, is it possible to perform PCR quantification to detect viral particles in the caput? Also, in this case, it would be interesting to know how long is Cre expression maintained for?</p></disp-quote><p>This would have been possible but we do not have any material remaining from the AAV-injected animals. Also, the facts that recombination occurs in double transgenic animals, and in parabiosis and exosome transfer recipients, both make this control somewhat superfluous in our view.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is not clear why a limited exposure of three transfers over 5 days was selected.

First and foremost, the author should check the expression of the &quot;brain tissue-specific&quot; Cre driver gene in the epididymis (e.g., mRNA level) in wildtype mice and the Cre lines, because the tissue specificity of these genes may not be so specific. For example, the pan-neuronal maker Syn1 are also identified expressed in the human sperm [PMID: 26566474]. A stochastic expression of the Cre driver gene can result in the expression of Cre protein that are sufficient to induce cleavage in the expressed few cells, this is consistent with authors observation that the Cre-loxp recombination effect are shown in cell scattered in the epididymal/vas deferens tissue. My point is, this possibility of transcriptional leakage should be stringently tested, which could be a main reason of the Cre leakage, or exist in paradelle to the other proposed reason (Cre mRNA/protein transported from another tissue).</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer 2 also asked this question, which is a good one. As detailed in our response above, the majority of the genes used as Cre drivers here are not detectably expressed in either bulk RNA-Seq or in single cell RNA-Seq atlases. If our data result from leaky expression it must be of extraordinarily low level. Of course with the huge signal amplification afforded by Cre-Lox recombination this could still drive Tomato expression. Therefore our strongest argument against leaky Cre expression directly in the cells of interest can only be the AAV results, and the parabiosis and exosome transfer data (as inefficient as they may be). But to address the specific request here: Vgat, AdipoQ, and several of the other drivers are not associated with detectable mRNAs in the epididymis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Figure 3: In the E panel, there is no PCR product of Vas def under the No Cre condition both for the Rec 7 and Rec 11. This is not correct. Without Cre, there should be a larger intact band as observed in other samples. Similar problems have been observed in Figure 5c, where serval samples were failed to detect a PCR product including Sem Ves, Kidney. The author should re-check their PCR condition or the DNA quality of these tissues. This type of data, in my opinion, is not suitable for publication because this lead to doubts on the reliability of the PCR result, and decrease the credibility of the conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we have isolated fresh genomic DNA and repeated these genotyping PCRs in the revised Figure 3E.

Moreover, in Fig3E, the author should clarify the PCR product length of the original DNA and recombined DNA by the Rec7 and Rec11 primers in their Figure legends, some reader may neglect the primer details in the method section. Did the author wrongly label the Rec11 and Rec7? since the Rec11 should have a larger length for the recombined PCR product, but in the figure it shows a smaller product. Also, there is faint band in the H2O Lane for the Rec11 primer which may cause false positive in this assay in other experiments, the author should be more careful to interpretate the results with faint band observed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the PCR product lengths in the Figure legends as requested. As far as switching the labels, the reviewer may be correct about the original figure – in any case, in the revised PCR it is clear from the markers in Figure 3E that the Rec7 band lies between the 200 and 300 bp marker bands, while the Rec11 band lies between the 300 and 400 bp markers, as expected. In addition, in the repeated PCRs we do not see the band noted in the H2O lane.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.
