vesicles. In the brain, tomosyn inhibits the fusion of synaptic vesicles (SVs), whereas its role in the fusion of neuropeptide-containing dense core vesicles (DCVs) is unknown. Here, we addressed this question using a new mouse model with a conditional deletion of tomosyn (<italic>Stxbp5</italic>) and its paralogue tomosyn-2 (<italic>Stxbp5l</italic>). We monitored DCV exocytosis at single vesicle resolution in tomosyn-deficient primary neurons using a validated pHluorin-based assay. Surprisingly, loss of tomosyns did not affect the number of DCV fusion events but resulted in a strong reduction of intracellular levels of DCV cargos, such as neuropeptide Y (NPY) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). BDNF levels were largely restored by re-expression of tomosyn but not by inhibition of lysosomal proteolysis. Tomosyn’s SNARE domain was dispensable for the rescue. The size of the trans-Golgi network and DCVs was decreased, and the speed of DCV cargo flux through Golgi was increased in tomosyn-deficient neurons, suggesting a role for tomosyns in DCV biogenesis. Additionally, tomosyn-deficient neurons showed impaired mRNA expression of some DCV cargos, which was not restored by re-expression of tomosyn and was also observed in Cre-expressing wild-type neurons not carrying lox<italic>P</italic> sites, suggesting a direct effect of Cre recombinase on neuronal transcription. Taken together, our findings argue against an inhibitory role of tomosyns in neuronal DCV exocytosis and suggests an evolutionary conserved function of tomosyns in the packaging of secretory cargo at the Golgi.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>tomosyn</kwd><kwd>SNARE</kwd><kwd>secretion</kwd><kwd>neuropeptides</kwd><kwd>dense core vesicle</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SU 1131/1-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Subkhangulova</surname><given-names>Aygul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>SNARE protein tomosyn differentially affects two main secretory pathways in mammalian neurons.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Brain activity relies on the precisely regulated secretion of different chemical messengers, and most neurons co-release multiple neurotransmitters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nusbaum et al., 2017</xref>). Classical small-molecule neurotransmitters (e.g. glutamate, γ-aminobutyric acid) are released from SVs, whereas neuropeptides and neurotrophic factors are packaged in and secreted from DCVs. SV and DCV substantially differ in their morphology and mechanisms of formation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Camilli and Jahn, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gondré-Lewis et al., 2012</xref>). While SVs are loaded with their content directly at synapses, where they subsequently fuse with the presynaptic membrane, DCVs are formed in neuronal somas at the trans-Golgi network (TGN), from where they travel to the release sites that are not confined to synapses. Despite these and many other differences between the two main types of neuronal secretory vesicles, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered exocytosis of both SV and DCV in most neurons requires an identical basic machinery consisting of SNARE proteins: syntaxin-1 and SNAP25 at the plasma membrane, and VAMP2 on the vesicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Südhof, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shimojo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arora et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hoogstraaten et al., 2020</xref>). The SNARE domains of these proteins form a tight complex that brings the two membranes together and drives vesicle fusion. In addition to the basic SNARE machinery, many other proteins participate in the fusion process (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Südhof, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rizo and Xu, 2015</xref>), of which some are differentially required for SV and DCV exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Persoon et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Moro et al., 2021</xref>). The differences in molecular machinery may explain why SV and DCV exocytosis are triggered upon different stimulation paradigms and at different locations within neurons.</p><p>Tomosyn (STXBP5) is a large, evolutionary conserved SNARE protein discovered as an interactor of syntaxin-1 in rat brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fujita et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Masuda et al., 1998</xref>). Tomosyn is expressed in a wide range of specialized secretory cell types, such as neurons, platelets, and neuroendocrine cells, suggesting a fundamental role of tomosyn in regulated secretion. Mammals express a second tomosyn gene, <italic>STXBP5L</italic>, which encodes tomosyn-2 with a nearly 80% amino acid similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Groffen et al., 2005</xref>). The two genes have a partially overlapping expression pattern in the mouse brain suggesting functional redundancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Groffen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barak et al., 2010</xref>). Mutations in both genes were found in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders, suggesting a role of tomosyns in human brain function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Matsunami et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cukier et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Rubeis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kumar et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Tomosyn is comprised of a C-terminal SNARE domain and N-terminal WD40 repeats folded into two seven-bladed β-propellers. The SNARE-domain of tomosyn is homologous to the SNARE domain of VAMP2 and mediates binding to syntaxin-1 and SNAP25. The resulting complex is remarkably similar in structure and stability to the fusogenic complex of syntaxin-1/SNAP25 with VAMP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pobbati et al., 2004</xref>). However, in contrast to VAMP2 and most other SNARE proteins, tomosyn does not contain a transmembrane anchor and, therefore, cannot drive membrane fusion. This feature led to a hypothesis that tomosyn functions as an inhibitor of fusion by competing with VAMP2 for binding to syntaxin-1/SNAP25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hatsuzawa et al., 2003</xref>). In support of this hypothesis, overexpression of tomosyn in neuroendocrine PC12 cells and adrenal chromaffin cells inhibits the fusion of secretory vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fujita et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hatsuzawa et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yizhar et al., 2004</xref>), and, conversely, loss of tomosyn in the nematode, fruit fly and mouse brain increases SV release probability and enhances synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gracheva et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McEwen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sauvola et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sakisaka et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ben-Simon et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, loss of tomosyn in <italic>C. elegans</italic> augments neuropeptide secretion, as evidenced by decreased DCV abundance at synapses and increased accumulation of a DCV cargo in scavenger cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gracheva et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ch’ng et al., 2008</xref>). Together, these studies suggest an evolutionary conserved role of tomosyn as an inhibitor of secretory vesicle exocytosis.</p><p>However, several lines of evidence argue against this conclusion. First, rat sympathetic neurons show a decrease in neurotransmitter release from SV upon depletion of tomosyn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baba et al., 2005</xref>). Second, platelets from <italic>Stxbp5</italic>-null mice show severely reduced exocytosis of all types of secretory granules, which results in excessive bleeding and impaired thrombus formation in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Ye et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, the loss of SRO7 and SRO77, two yeast orthologs of mammalian tomosyns, causes a strong defect in the exocytosis of post-Golgi vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lehman et al., 1999</xref>). Collectively, these studies suggest a positive role of tomosyn and its yeast orthologs in exocytosis. Thus, despite the clear importance of tomosyn in regulated secretion, its role in this process remains controversial.</p><p>In the brain, the role of mammalian tomosyn has been studied with a focus on SV exocytosis, whereas its effect on DCV exocytosis is unknown. In this study, we addressed this question using a mouse model with the inducible loss of all tomosyn and tomosyn-2 isoforms and show that tomosyns do not affect neuronal DCV exocytosis but, paradoxically, regulate intracellular levels of overexpressed and endogenous secretory cargos. Thus, tomosyns differentially modulate two regulated secretory pathways in neurons (secretion from SVs and DCVs) and have an additional role in the regulation of DCV composition.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To explore the role of tomosyn in neuronal secretion, we generated a new mouse model with a conditional deletion of tomosyn (<italic>Stxbp5</italic>) and tomosyn-2 (<italic>Stxbp5l</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Primary hippocampal neurons isolated from these mice showed a complete loss of tomosyns expression when transduced with a lentivirus encoding <italic>Cre</italic>-recombinase, as shown by Western blot (WB) and immunocytochemistry (ICC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>). As a control, we used neurons isolated from the same litter but expressing a defective <italic>Cre</italic>-recombinase that lacks the catalytic domain (ΔCre). Double knockout (DKO) neurons developed normally in culture and did not show any defects in neurite outgrowth and synapse formation as evidenced by normal dendrite length and density of synaptophysin puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–G</xref>).</p><p>To examine DCV fusion, we used a modification of a validated reporter consisting of NPY fused to super-ecliptic pHluorin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Persoon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nassal et al., 2022</xref>). When expressed in primary neurons, this reporter localized almost exclusively to DCVs, as indicated by its co-localization with endogenous DCV markers IA-2 and chromogranins (CHGA, CHGB) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Fusion of labeled DCVs with the plasma membrane was stimulated by repetitive bursts of action potentials delivered at 50 Hz to single neurons grown on glial micro-islands. Individual fusion events were detected as transient increases in fluorescence intensity along neurites, as exemplified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. Our stimulation paradigm resulted in a steep accumulation of fusion events that plateaued shortly before the end of the stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Most of these events (∼80%) were previously shown to be of axonal origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Persoon et al., 2018</xref>). Virtually no fusion events were detected in neurons of both genotypes in the absence of electric stimulation (first 30 s of recordings or in the period after stimulation). Surprisingly, the total number of evoked fusion events was similar between control and DKO neurons, with a tendency (p=0.09) towards a decrease in DKO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The intracellular pool of the DCV reporter, visualized by a short application of 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl to neurons to dequench intravesicular NPY-pHluorin, was decreased by 28% in DKO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The released fraction, i.e., the number of fusion events normalized to the intracellular pool of vesicles, was nearly identical between the genotypes and comprised approximately 8% of the intracellular content, consistent with the results of our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Persoon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moro et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Also, the averaged fluorescence peak of individual fusion events, an estimate of NPY loading per vesicle, was not affected by the loss of tomosyns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Thus, tomosyns are dispensable for the evoked fusion of neuronal DCVs in hippocampal neurons.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Loss of tomosyns does not affect the fusion of dense core vesicles (DCVs) in mouse hippocampal neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental strategy for measuring DCV fusion in single isolated neurons.

Hence, loss of tomosyns may result in the increased formation of ternary synaptic SNARE complexes consisting of syntaxin-1, SNAP25, and VAMP2. These complexes can be detected based on their resistance to SDS, as was shown for tomosyn-deficient fly brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sauvola et al., 2021</xref>). We examined levels of the assembled complexes in DKO neurons by SDS-PAGE on non-boiled neuronal lysates, since SDS-resistant complexes disassemble at temperatures higher than 60 °C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hayashi et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Otto et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). As expected, a band of approximately 80 kDa that corresponds to the ternary complexes was readily detected with a syntaxin-1 antibody in non-boiled lysates and absent in lysates heated at 95 °C. This band shifted in size upon expression of tetanus toxin light chain (TeNT), which results in cleavage of VAMP2, thus confirming that the detected complexes contain VAMP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>). No difference in the intensity of the 80 kDa band was observed between control and DKO cultures. The same results were obtained when non-boiled lysates were probed with antibodies against SNAP25 and VAMP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A–B</xref>). These data suggest that tomosyns do not interfere with the bulk formation of syntaxin-1 containing synaptic SNARE complexes in cultured neurons. Interestingly, in addition to the 80 kDa band, non-boiled WT lysates showed a band of approximately 200 kDa, detected with antibodies against syntaxin-1 and SNAP25. This band was absent in DKO lysates and, therefore, likely represents a complex of tomosyn with syntaxin-1 and SNAP25, suggesting that this complex is resistant to SDS in vivo. This 200 kDa complex was also detected in control neurons with an antibody against tomosyn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).</p><p>Despite normal DCV exocytosis, intracellular levels of the DCV reporter were decreased in DKO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

Levels of BDNF, one of the most common DCV cargos in excitatory hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dieni et al., 2012</xref>), were decreased by more than half in DKO neurons as shown by ICC and WB analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–F</xref>). Levels of IA-2 (PTPRN), a transmembrane DCV-resident protein commonly used as a DCV marker, were also lower, by 25%, in DKO neurons as indicated by ICC, and by approximately 50% as evidenced by WB analysis, which allows to distinguish a proteolytically processed (mature) form of IA-2 that runs at approximately 65 kDa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hermel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The cellular distribution of the two DCV markers was similar between the genotypes, with a comparable reduction in somas and neurites of DKO neurons and no re-distribution between the two compartments as detected by ICC. Markers of lysosomes/late endosomes, LAMP1, and LIMP2, were not affected by the loss of tomosyns, as shown by ICC and WB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Re-expression of tomosyn (isoform 1 m, NM_001081344) largely restored BDNF levels in DKO neurons (to approximately 80% of WT levels), as shown by ICC and WB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D and G–H</xref>). The SNARE-domain of tomosyn was dispensable for the partial rescue of BDNF levels, since expression of a truncated tomosyn mutant lacking the SNARE-domain (ΔSN) rescued BDNF levels in DKO to the same extent as re-expression of the full-length (FL) tomosyn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G–H</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that tomosyns affect intracellular levels of some endogenous DCV cargos in a SNARE-domain independent manner.</p><p>Levels of BDNF and other secretory cargos are known to be regulated by lysosomal degradation. We, therefore, tested if an increase in BDNF degradation could account for its decreased levels in the absence of tomosyns. Inhibition of lysosomal proteases by leupeptin for 24 hr resulted in a twofold increase of BDNF levels in neurons of both genotypes but failed to raise BDNF expression in DKO to WT levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and I</xref>), indicating that increased cargo degradation does not explain the decreased BDNF levels in DKO neurons.</p><p>We next asked whether levels of any other (secretory) proteins are affected by the loss of tomosyns. To address this question in an unbiased manner, we compared the proteome of cultured control and DKO neurons by mass spectrometry. We detected approximately 8500 proteins, of which around 3% were differentially expressed (log<sub>2</sub> fold change threshold 0.3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Gene ontology (GO) analysis of proteins decreased in DKO neurons indicating a strong enrichment of proteins related to the cytoskeleton and secretory granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). As expected, both tomosyns were not detected in DKO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Interestingly, BDNF was also barely detected in DKO (only in one out of six biological replicates), while readily detected across all replicates in control conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), confirming a strong decrease in BDNF levels in DKO neurons. Many common DCV cargos, such as granins VGF and SCG2, cargo processing enzymes PCSK1 and CPE, and transmembrane DCV proteins IA-2 (PTPRN) and PAM were also decreased, albeit to a different extent, in DKO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Most of the up-regulated proteins were components of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, suggesting that an increase in oxidative phosphorylation is a metabolic feature of DKO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). In contrast to the proteins regulating oxidative phosphorylation, most other mitochondrial proteins, for example, proteins responsible for mitochondrial DNA replication and transcription, were unchanged in DKO. A selected number of synaptic proteins were affected in DKO neurons but, in contrast to the DCV-resident proteins, SV proteins did not follow any general trend in DKO neurons: while some proteins (glutamate transporter VGLUT2, glutamate decarboxylase GAD67) were strongly increased in DKO, others (e.g. SYT12 and SV2B) were reduced to a similar extent, and many (e.g. main glutamate transporter VGLUT1, vesicular GABA transporter VGAT) were not significantly altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

Percent of synaptic sections containing one or several DCVs was decreased in DKO by 30% (12% of all synaptic sections in DKO versus 17% in control), indicating lowered DCV abundancy in DKO. In addition, DCVs in DKO neurons were slightly reduced in diameter (average 65.01±2.08 nm in DKO versus 71.52±1.62 nm in control), with a high proportion of DKO DCVs being only 40–50 nm in diameter (16% of all DCVs in DKO versus 4% in control) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>). Such a reduction in diameter translates to an approximately 25% decrease in volume. In contrast, the diameter of SV was not affected by the loss of tomosyns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–E</xref>). Other parameters of synaptic ultrastructure, such as SV number per synapse, length of the active zone, and length of postsynaptic density, were also unchanged in DKO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and F–H</xref>) and DKO somata showed no obvious abnormalities in organelle morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

In this method, streptavidin-binding peptide (SBP)-tagged secretory cargo is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) until the addition of biotin due to the expression of the ER-localized streptavidin. Biotin disrupts SBP/streptavidin interaction and induces a synchronized transport of the cargo from the ER along the secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–D</xref>). As a neuropeptide cargo, we used NPY fused to SBP and EGFP, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Emperador-Melero et al., 2018</xref>). In the absence of biotin, NPY-EGFP-SBP was diffusely distributed along cell soma and processes, in agreement with its localization to the ER. Addition of biotin induced a wave of NPY-EGFP-SBP accumulating in the Golgi first, and then leaving the Golgi as discrete puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video1">Figure 5—video 1</xref>). These puncta co-localized with an endogenous DCV marker, CHGA, indicating correct packaging of the NPY fusion protein into DCVs during the RUSH assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Formation of such puncta and clearance of NPY-EGFP-SBP from the Golgi was observed in neurons of both genotypes. We next compared the speed of NPY-EGFP-SBP flux through the Golgi by plotting EGFP intensity within the Golgi area over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). The peak of fluorescence intensity in the Golgi was reached 5.6 min faster in DKO than in control, indicating that the speed of Golgi filling is increased in DKO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). The speed of Golgi clearance – determined by fitting a first order exponential decay curve to the data after the peak – was also increased (by 20%) in DKO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). Thus, loss of tomosyns does not impede export of the overexpressed neuropeptide cargo from Golgi but, conversely, accelerates it.</p><p>We also traced the fate of newly made RUSH vesicles 90 min after the addition of biotin. After the exit from Golgi, these vesicles traveled predominantly in one neurite, morphologically identified as the axon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). Most axonal vesicles (67%) traveled in the anterograde direction with a similar speed in neurons of both genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J–K</xref>), indicating that the transport of newly made DCVs is not affected by the loss of tomosyns.</p><p>We then asked if the loss of tomosyns affected mRNA expression of secretory cargos that were significantly decreased in DKO as evidenced by mass spectrometry and WB analysis. We detected a decrease in the expression of various transcript variants of <italic>Bdnf</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) and other common DCV cargos, most prominently <italic>Vgf</italic> and <italic>Pcsk1</italic>, encoding a prohormone convertase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Interestingly, the decrease in mRNA was less pronounced than the decrease at the protein level, as detected by WB (for BDNF) or mass spectrometry (for VGF and PCSK1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). The number of neuropeptides was decreased at the mRNA level in DKO as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). <italic>Grp</italic> (gastrin related peptide) and <italic>Pnoc</italic> (nociceptin, nocistatin) showed the strongest reduction (by 50% and 35%, respectively), while mRNA of genes encoding cholecystokinin, NPY, and tachykinins displayed a reduction by around 30%. It is not clear whether any of these peptides were also decreased at the protein level, since most processed neuropeptides could not be detected in our mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis due to their small size. Based on single-cell transcriptomics data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Saunders et al., 2018</xref>), expression of the affected genes was not confined to a specific neuronal population (e.g. glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons). Strikingly, re-expression of tomosyn (isoform 1 m) from DIV2 onwards did not restore altered transcription of the affected genes, suggesting that tomosyn does not mediate these changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

Lentivirus-mediated expression of Cre in wild-type neurons resulted in a decrease of BDNF levels by 26% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F–G</xref>), as compared to &gt;50% reduction in BDNF documented in DKO (Cre-expressing <italic>Stxbp5/5l</italic><sup>lox</sup>) neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–F</xref>). Expression of ΔCre that lacks the catalytic domain did not affect BDNF levels when compared to wild-type neurons expressing mCherry under the same promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F–G</xref>), suggesting that recombinase activity is necessary for the effect of Cre on BDNF levels. Cre expression in wild-type neurons did not affect tomosyn levels. These data indicate that unspecific Cre recombinase activity contributes to the reduction in BDNF protein levels in DKO neurons, but to a lesser extent than the loss of tomosyns. In line with this conclusion, BDNF protein levels in DKO were largely rescued by the re-expression of tomosyn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D and G–H</xref>).</p><p>To test if the latter conclusion also applies to a DCV reporter overexpressed under the control of a synapsin promoter, we tested the effects of Cre on the levels of NPY-pHluorin.

Thus, while Cre expression impairs transcription of endogenous DCV cargos in both wild-type and <italic>Stxbp5/5l</italic><sup>lox</sup> neurons, it affects protein levels of the overexpressed DCV reporter only in <italic>Stxbp5/5l</italic><sup>lox</sup> but not in wild-type neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we examined the role of tomosyns in the exocytosis of neuropeptide-containing DCVs in mammalian neurons. Using a pHluorin-based DCV fusion reporter, we found that the conditional loss of tomosyns does not alter the number of DCV exocytosis events but lowers intracellular levels of the DCV reporter. We corroborated the latter finding by showing that levels of endogenous DCV cargos, such as BDNF, are decreased in tomosyn DKO neurons by three independent approaches (ICC, WB, and mass spectrometry). The effect on the DCV pool and/or composition was accompanied by a smaller DCV size and increased speed of the DCV reporter flux through the TGN. Taken together, these data suggest that tomosyn is dispensable for control of DCV fusion, but, paradoxically, has an impact on the intracellular levels of DCV cargos.</p><p>The lack of the effect on neuronal DCV fusion is surprising, given that tomosyn regulates SV release in neurons and secretory granule exocytosis in neuroendocrine cells and platelets. However, phenotypes caused by the loss of tomosyn expression in different cell types are discrepant. While the loss of tomosyn resulted in enhanced SV fusion in the mouse brain and invertebrate nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sakisaka et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ben-Simon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gracheva et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McEwen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sauvola et al., 2021</xref>), tomosyn deficiency in platelets, INS-1E cells and rat superior cervical ganglion neurons led to an opposite phenotype – a strong reduction in secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Ye et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheviet et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baba et al., 2005</xref>). No unifying model explains the discrepant effects of tomosyn on secretory vesicle fusion. Altogether, the discrepant effects of tomosyn on fusion in different cell types suggest that tomosyn does not act solely as an inhibitor of fusogenic SNARE complex formation.</p><p>DCVs and SVs differ in release properties, and recent studies shed light on some components of the molecular machinery contributing to these differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Persoon et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Moro et al., 2021</xref>). In contrast to SVs, which are released in response to a single electric pulse, neuronal DCVs require prolonged high-frequency stimulation for induction of exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hartmann et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Xia et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Persoon et al., 2018</xref>). Several factors can explain the reluctance of DCVs to fuse, among them the loose coupling of DCVs to the sites of calcium entry, requiring an increase in calcium levels reaching beyond an immediate radius of a calcium channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mansvelder and Kits, 2000</xref>). The difference in calcium sensitivity between SVs and DCVs may facilitate frequency-dependent release of different types of chemical signals from neurons and ensure that neuropeptides are secreted predominantly at high firing rates. Interestingly, the inhibitory effect of tomosyn on DCV fusion in adrenal chromaffin cells is calcium-dependent and could be overridden by an increase in intracellular calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yizhar et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, it is possible that high-frequency stimulation and a massive increase in intracellular calcium required for the induction of neuronal DCV exocytosis overrides the regulatory effect of tomosyn.</p><p>Despite the lack of effect on DCV exocytosis, loss of tomosyns resulted in the decreased intracellular levels of overexpressed (NPY-pHluorin) and endogenous (BDNF, IA-2) DCV cargos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Importantly, this phenotype was reproduced in DKO neurons grown under three different culture conditions that vary in cell density and the ratio of neurons to glia (single neurons grown on glial microislands, sparse network cultures on glial feeder layer, and dense network cultures on coated plastic). This phenotype is consistent with the effect of tomosyn’s loss in platelets, i.e. a strong decrease in many secretory cargos, despite the fact that the release of these cargos was reduced, not enhanced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Ye et al., 2014</xref>). Tomosyn-deficient platelets showed more than 50% decrease in the levels of alpha-granules cargos, such as factor V and platelet factor 4 (PF4), although alpha-granule count was not affected. Similarly, loss of tomosyn orthologs SRO7/77 in yeast resulted in the altered composition of secretory vesicles and re-routing of a secretory cargo, sodium pumping ATPase Ena1p, from secretory vesicles into the degradative pathway (vacuole) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Forsmark et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wadskog et al., 2006</xref>). Despite the fact that alpha-granules in platelets and secretory vesicles in yeast differ from neuronal DCVs in many aspects, taken together, our published data suggest a general role of tomosyn and its orthologs in sorting cargos into various types of secretory granules. The enrichment of tomosyn at the TGN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) and decreased DCV and Golgi size in DKO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4A–C</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A–B</xref>) are consistent with such a role.</p><p>Importantly, the loss of tomosyns in neurons did not abolish the formation of new secretory granules, as evidenced by the normal budding of NPY-vesicles in the RUSH assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video1">Figure 5—video 1</xref>). However, NPY flux through the Golgi was slightly accelerated in DKO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F–H</xref>), supporting the hypothesis that tomosyn regulates the sorting of the soluble cargo at the TGN. The decreased size of DCVs suggests that loading of DCVs with secretory cargo is impaired in DKO, since DCV size is regulated by the amount of loaded cargo, at least in non-neuronal cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clermont et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boquist and Lorentzon, 1979</xref>). On the other hand, the peak amplitude of individual NPY-pHluorin fusion events, an estimate of NPY loading per fusing DCV, was not affected in DKO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). This discrepancy suggests that smaller DCVs in DKO may be reluctant to fuse due to the deficiency in specific transmembrane cargos necessary for DCV exocytosis. Another important observation is that interfering with lysosomal activity did not rescue cargo levels in DKO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), indicating that cargo is not mis-sorted to lysosomes in the absence of tomosyns.</p><p>Re-expression of tomosyn rescued protein, but not mRNA expression, of DCV cargos in DKO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). We found that the recombinase activity of Cre, irrespective of the presence of the lox<italic>P</italic> sites, affects the expression of some DCV cargos (<italic>Bdnf</italic>, <italic>Grp</italic>, <italic>Pcsk1</italic>), explaining the inability of tomosyn to rescue transcription of these genes. It has been long acknowledged that Cre expression can have deleterious side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schmidt et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Loonstra et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Heidmann and Lehner, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Forni et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Naiche and Papaioannou, 2007</xref>), although, to our knowledge, none were reported for primary neuronal cultures. Cre can catalyze recombination between pseudo (cryptic) lox<italic>P</italic> sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Thyagarajan et al., 2000</xref>). Our data suggest that Cre expression in postmitotic neurons affects neuronal transcriptome and warrants caution when interpreting data on the proteome DKO neurons.</p><p>Notwithstanding this effect, the current study provides robust evidence that the decrease of BDNF at the protein level is caused, to a large extent, specifically by the loss of tomosyns, and not by the effects of Cre on transcription. First, BDNF levels were decreased by more than 50% in DKO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D and E–F</xref>), and only by around 26% in Cre-expressing wild-type neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F–G</xref>). Second, BDNF levels in DKO were restored to approximately 80% of control levels by re-expression of tomosyn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref>). Finally, in support of the specific effects of tomosyn on DCV cargos, levels of the overexpressed NPY-pHluorin levels were decreased in DKO, but not in Cre-expressing wild-type neurons, and this decrease was rescued by the re-expression of tomosyn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, the SNARE domain of tomosyn was dispensable for the rescue of BDNF levels in DKO, suggesting that the N-terminal WD40-domain mediates this effect of tomosyn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G–H</xref>). The main structural feature of the WD40-domain are two bulky beta-propellers comprised of multiple WD40 repeats. This domain constitutes the largest part of tomosyn’s molecule, and it is best conserved among all tomosyn orthologs, including the yeast SRO7/77 that, in fact, lack the canonical SNARE domain. Previous studies showed that WD40-domain alone is not sufficient to rescue synaptic transmission defects caused by the loss of tomosyn orthologs in the fly and nematode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burdina et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sauvola et al., 2021</xref>). On the other hand, overexpression of the WD40 domain alone has an inhibitory effect on secretion from bovine chromaffin and rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yizhar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bielopolski et al., 2014</xref>). This effect has been attributed to the binding of specific loops in the WD40 propeller region to SNAP25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bielopolski et al., 2014</xref>). Several other interaction partners of tomosyn were reported to bind to the WD40-propellers, such as Rab3A and synaptotagmin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yamamoto et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cazares et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that the WD40 domain may serve as a scaffold for the assembly of the dynamic protein complexes. The strength of these interactions can be regulated by posttranslational modifications of the WD40 domain, such as phosphorylation (by PKA, ROCK) and SUMOylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baba et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gladycheva et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ferdaoussi et al., 2017</xref>). A recent study identified tomosyn as an inhibitor of RhoA in the WD40-domain dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shen et al., 2020</xref>). RhoA is a small GTPase that regulates, among other processes, membrane trafficking at the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Quassollo et al., 2015</xref>). Remarkably, Sro7 was originally identified in a genome-wide screen as a multicopy suppressor of RHO3, an ortholog of Rho GTPases in yeast, suggesting an evolutionary conserved link between tomosyn and Rho GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Matsui and Toh-E, 1992</xref>). Further studies are required to validate the potential regulation of Rho by tomosyn and to assess a role of this hypothetical pathway at the Golgi.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Normally, hippocampi from several pups from one nest were pooled in one culture preparation, which was considered as one biological replicate. Hippocampi were dissected in Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS, Sigma H9394) supplemented with 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.2–7.5, Gibco 15630056) and digested with 0.25% trypsin (Gibco 15090046) at 37 °C for 15 min. After the digestion, tissue pieces were washed in HBSS and triturated using fire-polished Pasteur pipettes in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM, VWR Life Science VWRC392-0415) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS, Gibco 10270), non-essential amino acids (Sigma M7145), and antibiotics (penicillin/streptomycin, Gibco 15140122). For most immunocytochemistry (ICC) experiments, cell suspension was sparsely plated on a feeder layer of rat glia at a density of 20–30×10<sup>3</sup>/well on 15 mm coverslips. For BDNF ICC and pHluorin imaging experiments, neurons were plated on glial micro-islands at a density of 1500/well (to obtain single neuron cultures). For RUSH, rat glia was omitted, and neurons were plated on glass coverslips at a density of approximately 120×10<sup>3</sup>/well on 15 mm coverslips. Prior to plating, glass coverslips were coated with poly-L-ornithine (Sigma P4957) and laminin (Sigma L2020). For western blot, proteomics, electron microscopy, and qPCR experiments, neurons were plated on coated plastic without the glia feeder layer at a density of 400×10<sup>3</sup>/well in a six-well plate. Cultures were maintained in a humified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in Neurobasal medium (Gibco 21103049) supplemented with B27 (Gibco 17504044), 10 mM HEPES, GlutaMAX (Gibco 35050038) and antibiotics (penicillin/streptomycin, Gibco 15140122). To induce loss of tomosyns, cultures were transduced within 8 hr after plating with a lentivirus encoding Cre-recombinase expressed under the control of synapsin promoter (pSyn-Cre-mCherry).

in neuronal cultures from mice expressing conditional alleles of tomosyn and tomosyn-2. Tomosyn is a large soluble SNARE protein, where earlier work in multiple species suggested that it functions as a competitive inhibitor of cognate SNARE interactions impairing fusion. The authors show that while loss of tomosyns did not affect dense core vesicle exocytosis, it reduced the expression of several key dense core cargos, including BDNF, with limited impact on intracellular vesicle trafficking or Golgi function. These results suggest that tomosyns impact neuropeptide and neurotrophin secretion by regulating dense core vesicle cargo production but not exocytosis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85561.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Kavalali</surname><given-names>Ege T</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02vm5rt34</institution-id><institution>Vanderbilt University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Rizzoli</surname><given-names>Silvio O</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/021ft0n22</institution-id><institution>University Medical Center Göttingen</institution></institution-wrap><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.12.18.520925">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.18.520925v2">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Silvio O Rizzoli (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall, there is an overall need for better characterization of the KO phenotype. Moreover, some form of &quot;rescue&quot; experiments are needed to validate the specificity of the effects. Ideally, rescue experiments aimed at separating the effects of the SNARE motif versus the WD40 domains of tomosyn should be performed. These experiments should address many of the concerns below.</p><p>1. BDNF transcripts have been shown to be regulated by subtle changes in activity or even in response to changes in the balance of excitatory versus inhibitory spontaneous neurotransmission (PMID: 34348149; PMID: 35947950). Therefore, it is important to provide further evidence against an indirect effect of tomosyn loss-of-function beyond CREB phosphorylation.</p><p>2. It is also important to go a step further and demonstrate whether these effects require tomosyns' SNARE motif or other regions such as the WD40 domains via rescue experiments. Rescue experiments can also address the specificity of the effects as indicated in #1 above.</p><p>3. in Figure 5, supplement 1, the authors document the colocalization of tomosyn with the trans-Golgi network. This analysis should be paralleled with an analysis of the colocalization of this molecule with dense-core vesicle markers and synaptic vesicle markers. The authors' work suggests that the colocalization with vesicular proteins would be poorer than that with the Golgi apparatus. Please analyze carefully.</p><p>4. The mouse model developed is well documented and provides a powerful approach to understanding the mechanisms through which tomosyns exert the many effects attributed to them in a wide variety of systems. The hippocampal culture systems utilized in this study allowed the authors to identify many fascinating differences between neurons that develop in the presence or absence of tomosyns. The culture systems used vary greatly in cell density, the ratio of neurons to glial cells, and plating substrates. Given that neuronal development is affected by each of these parameters, it cannot be assumed that the mass spectrometry data obtained for dense cultures accurately describes a single neuron grown on a glial microisland. Was an attempt made to select what appeared to be pyramidal neurons when analyzing single cells? Or were Cre-recombinase-positive cells examined in an unbiased manner? What percentage of neurons were transduced by the Cre-recombinase encoding lentiviruses?</p><p>5. Single granule monitoring using exogenous NPY-pHluorin as a DCV reporter allowed the authors to address many aspects of regulated secretion. Although no change in stimulated secretion was observed, a decrease in the total number of DCVs was detected and reduced levels of NPY-pHluorin were observed in the axons and dendrites of TTX-silenced DKO cultures. Increased intracellular degradation of NPY-pHluorin or increased basal secretion of this DCV-reporter could account for the observed decrease in content. Referring to this effect as &quot;regulation&quot; does not seem wise. Please comment.</p><p>6. The differences between WT and DKO cultures detected by mass spectrometry need extensive analysis. What could the dramatic increase in mitochondrial proteins mean? Why was it impossible to detect BDNF in DKO cultures by mass spectrometry when immunocytochemistry and mRNA analysis revealed only a two-fold drop? What does the observed increase in glutamatergic and GABAergic markers predict for neuropeptide expression? Certain neuropeptides are more highly expressed in one cell type than in the other. Were the changes in protein expression more prominent for neuronal proteins or glial proteins?</p><p>7. Tomosyns are known to affect the exocytosis of a wide variety of vesicles in other systems (e.g. dense core vesicles in β-cells, GLUT4-containing endocytic vesicles in adipocytes and constitutive vesicles in PC12 cells) and may have similarly broad effects in hippocampal neurons. The authors conclude that tomosyns do not regulate the release of dense core vesicle cargo by hippocampal neurons. Using an elegant assay to detect the release of single dense core vesicles containing NPY-pHluorin, a decrease in DCV diameter is detected (and confirmed using electron microscopy). When electrically stimulated over a 25 sec time period, both WT and DKO neurons released 8% of their DCV content (Figure 1E). It is known that DCVs in axons and dendrites respond to different stimuli and that DCV content proteins are released under basal conditions (in the absence of any secretagogue). Please comment.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Tomosyn affects dense core vesicle composition but not exocytosis in mammalian neurons&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Lu Chen (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved and all reviewers agree that revisions are substantive. However, there are a few remaining issues that need to be addressed/amended in the text as pointed out by Reviewer #3, as outlined below:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The revised manuscript presents the authors' data in a more logical manner, making it substantially easier to read and understand than the earlier version. The finding that expression of active Cre recombinase in control neurons results in diminished expression of mRNAs encoding Bdnf, Vgf, Pcsk1 and Grp complicates interpretation of the data, but the rescue experiments added to the revised manuscript give the authors a means of dealing with this unexpected complexity. The authors were very responsive to the previous critiques.</p><p>I would like to suggest two modifications to the revised text, in order to make it more comprehensible to a general audience. First, cells depend on an array of vesicles to facilitate trafficking and communication between their various membranous organelles. The authors distinguish synaptic vesicles (SVs) from dense core vesicles (DCVs), but often revert to talking about vesicles, with no indication of the type of vesicle to which they are referring. In the Abstract (line 4), the authors refer to &quot;vesicle exocytosis&quot; – here this means SVs, not DCVs, but the text needs to say so. Again, in the Abstract (line 17), they suggest a role for tomosyns in &quot;vesicle biogenesis&quot;; here they are referring to DCVs, and need to be specific. The biogenesis of SVs differs greatly from the biogenesis of DCVs. In the Introduction (line 74), the reader is told that rat sympathetic neurons show a decrease in neurotransmitter release upon depletion of tomosyn – is this a reference to SVs or a reference to DCVs, which contain a variety of peptides used for signaling by sympathetic neurons?</p><p>Secondly, the literature makes it abundantly clear that secretion is a very cell-type specific phenomenon. Multiple isoforms of v-SNAREs and t-SNARES play important roles in different tissues, a complexity not really acknowledged in this manuscript. While the first phase of insulin secretion by β-cells depends on Syntaxin 1 and SNAP25, sustained release involves Syntaxin 4 and SNAP23. Which v-SNAREs and t-SNAREs are relevant to the secretion of peptide-containing DCVs in neurons? Platelet α-granules, referred to in the Discussion as an example of DCVs, clearly require multivesicular bodies for their maturation; they receive membrane proteins from the plasma membrane, via the endocytic pathway.</p><p>Additional Points:</p><p>In setting up their study, the authors state the both SVs and DCVs require an identical basic machinery consisting of sntaxin-1, SNAP25 and VAMP2. While they mention that some of the &quot;many other proteins&quot; involved in the fusion process are &quot;differentially required for SV and DCV exocytosis&quot;, they fail to mention the many other ways in which SVs and DCVs (along with myriad of other vesicles in cells) differ – ER/Golgi synthesis and loading of granules vs. local synthesis and vesicle reloading at nerve terminals and types of stimuli required for release, amongst many other differences.</p><p>The authors used leupeptin to inhibit lysosomal proteolysis and observed a two-fold increase in BDNF levels in both the double knockout cultures and in wildtype cultures. This is a striking result, unlike what is typically seen in endocrine cells; although it does not explain why the DKO and WT neurons differ, it suggests much more rapid degradation of DCV cargo in neurons than in endocrine cells. The ability of another lysosomal inhibitor, along with quantification of levels of another cargo protein (IA-2, for example) would strengthen this conclusion.</p><p>Line 121 – NPY loading per vesicle was not affected by the loss of tomosyns. How do the authors interpret this observation in light of their EM analysis (lines 210-211), which indicates that DCVs are smaller in the tomosyn DKO neurons than in Control neurons (Figure 4C)?</p><p>Figure 2 G and I – Panel I shows a greater than two-fold increase in BDNF upon leupeptin treatment of control cultures, but does not show an increase in BDNF in DKO cultures treated with leupeptin. It is difficult to make sense of Panel I and the text that refers to it (lines 177-178).</p><p>Figure 5 – Supplement 1C-F – Tomosyn/IA-2 co-localization appears to be much less extensive than Tomosyn/SYPH co-localization. IA-2 is expected to be in DCVs and in vesicles of the endocytic pathway (based on trafficking studies in β-cells).</p><p>Line 326 – The authors try to explain &quot;the reluctance of DCV to fuse&quot;, suggesting that a poor &quot;choice&quot; has been made. An alternate view to consider is that the difference in ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity exhibited by SVs and DCVs facilitates frequency-dependent responses, with DCVs and their often peptidergic content, recruited only when firing rates are high.</p><p>Line 340 – The authors discuss the fascinating α-granule phenotype observed in platelets lacking tomosyn. However, the reader needs to be reminded that α-granules differ in many ways from the DCVs being studied in neurons; membrane associated receptors such as P-selectin are major α-granule components, along with VWF and fibrinogen. The biogenesis/maturation of α-granules is complex (with roles for multivesicular bodies/late endosomes) and quite distinct from that of the DCVs of neurons and β-cells.</p><p>Line 342 – In discussing yeast tomosyn orthologs, the authors need to explain that yeast lack both SVs and DCVs and that these yeast orthologs lack a SNARE domain and affect Golgi trafficking, as observed in this study.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85561.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall, there is an overall need for better characterization of the KO phenotype.

To this end, we performed three sets of experiments to test specificity of tomosyn's effect on BDNF levels. First, we tested whether expression of tomosyn restores BDNF protein levels in DKO neurons. Indeed, BDNF levels were restored to 80% of control upon re-expression of tomosyn, as evidenced by ICC (Figure 2C-D), indicating that the decrease in BDNF is largely caused by tomosyn deficiency.</p><p>Second, we tested if altered synaptic transmission contributes to the decreased transcription of <italic>Bdnf</italic> and other DCV cargo in DKO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Blocking action potential-mediated firing for 6 h using tetrodotoxin (TTX) did not rescue the decreased expression of <italic>Bdnf</italic> and other DCV cargos, indicating that the attenuated expression was not caused by altered neuronal activity. Conversely, blocking inhibitory input using picrotoxin (PTX) for 6 h resulted in a massive increase of <italic>Bdnf</italic> (transcripts 1 and 4) mRNA expression. This massive increase blunted the difference between DKO and control neurons, but we find this effect difficult to interpret given the fact that the PTX effect is much larger than the effect of Cre and a ceiling effect may explain the blunted difference. PTX treatment did not affect expression of some other tested cargos (<italic>Grp</italic> and <italic>Npy</italic>) and did not rescue the genotype specific-difference in the mRNA of these genes. As pointed out by the reviewer, PTX may affect <italic>Bdnf</italic> transcription not only by increasing activity, but also via blocking spontaneous inhibitory input at the absence of firing. We tested this contribution by applying both PTX and TTX. We observed no rescue of the decreased <italic>Bdnf</italic> mRNA expression by PTX when action potential-evoked firing was blocked. These data suggest that potential differences in spontaneous inhibitory input do not explain the observed decrease in <italic>Bdnf</italic> mRNA in Cre-expressing <italic>Stxbp5/5l</italic><sup>lox</sup> neurons.</p><p>Finally, we tested if re-expression of tomosyn rescues transcription of <italic>Bdnf</italic> and other DCV cargos in DKO. Unexpectedly, it was not the case (Figure 6D). Following this unexpected finding, we tested if expression of Cre recombinase <italic>per se</italic> accounts for the decrease in <italic>Bdnf</italic> mRNA in DKO. To do that, we tested effects of Cre expression in wild-type neurons (not bearing lox<italic>P</italic> sites) (Figure 6E). Cre expression in wild-type neurons resulted in an approximately two-fold decrease of <italic>Bdnf</italic> transcript 1 mRNA levels, similar to the decrease observed in <italic>Stxbp5/5l</italic><sup>lox</sup> ('floxed' neurons). These data indicate that Cre expression has an unexpected effect on expression of (at least) some <italic>Bdnf</italic> transcript isoforms. However, despite this effect, Cre-expressing wild-type neurons show only 26% decrease in BDNF protein compared to &gt;50% decrease in floxed neurons (Figure 6F-G, 2E-F), indicating that loss of tomosyns specifically affects BDNF protein levels (which can be largely rescued by expression of tomosyn, see the first paragraph). In line with this, total <italic>Bdnf</italic> mRNA expression (tested with primers recognizing all eleven transcript isoforms) was decreased by 34% in DKO (data added to Figure 6A), insufficient to explain the massive decrease of BDNF at the protein level.</p><p>We included data on the direct effects of Cre on the transcription of <italic>Bdnf</italic> and other DCV cargos to Figure 6 (panel E) since we think that this finding can be of interest to many neuroscientists using Cre-expressing primary neurons as a model system.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Effects of tetrodotoxin (TTX) and picrotoxin (PTX) on the mRNA levels of DCV cargos in (Δ)Cre-expressing neurons.</title><p>(A) mRNA levels of DCV cargo genes upon treatment of (Δ)Cre-expressing cultures with either 1 μM TTX or 50 μM PTX.

Re-expression of wild-type tomosyn raised BDNF protein levels from 45% to approximately 70% of control levels, and the mutant lacking the SNARE domain had a similar effect. These data suggest that tomosyn regulates BDNF protein levels, and that the SNARE-domain is dispensable for this effect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. in Figure 5, supplement 1, the authors document the colocalization of tomosyn with the trans-Golgi network.

The mouse model developed is well documented and provides a powerful approach to understanding the mechanisms through which tomosyns exert the many effects attributed to them in a wide variety of systems. The hippocampal culture systems utilized in this study allowed the authors to identify many fascinating differences between neurons that develop in the presence or absence of tomosyns. The culture systems used vary greatly in cell density, the ratio of neurons to glial cells, and plating substrates. Given that neuronal development is affected by each of these parameters, it cannot be assumed that the mass spectrometry data obtained for dense cultures accurately describes a single neuron grown on a glial microisland. Was an attempt made to select what appeared to be pyramidal neurons when analyzing single cells? Or were Cre-recombinase-positive cells examined in an unbiased manner? What percentage of neurons were transduced by the Cre-recombinase encoding lentiviruses?</p></disp-quote><p>In all our experiments, (Δ)Cre-positive cells were analyzed in an unbiased manner. With any new (Δ)Cre-encoding lentivirus batch, we determined a virus titer enabling us to achieve a nearly 100% transduction efficiency (see an example staining in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>). The efficiency of tomosyn loss was also confirmed by WB (Figure 1 —figure supplement 1B), where no tomosyn band was detected in lysates of Cre-transduced neurons. Thus, no bias was introduced by picking Cre-positive cells.</p><p>We agree that a culture system may have an impact on tomosyn null phenotypes and that mass spectrometry data obtained for dense cultures may not accurately describe proteome changes of single neurons grown on glial microislands. Specific culture systems were chosen based on experimental needs (performing mass spectrometry on single neurons on microislands is not feasible). However, the effect of tomosyn's loss on DCV cargo abundance is independent of culture conditions. Similar effects were observed in three different systems: single neurons grown on glial microislands (Figure 1E, 2C-D), sparse network cultures grown on glial feeder layer (Figure 2A-B), and dense cultures on coated plastic (Figure 2E-F). Taken together, these data indicate that the effect of tomosyn on DCV cargo abundance is cell-autonomous and not a consequence of specialized culture conditions.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Immunostaining of DIV14 network cultures transduced with (Δ)Cre-mCherry at DIV0.</title><p>Expression of Cre, but not ΔCre lacking the catalytic domain, resulted in a loss of specific tomosyn staining in nearly all imaged neurons.

Single granule monitoring using exogenous NPY-pHluorin as a DCV reporter allowed the authors to address many aspects of regulated secretion. Although no change in stimulated secretion was observed, a decrease in the total number of DCVs was detected and reduced levels of NPY-pHluorin were observed in the axons and dendrites of TTX-silenced DKO cultures. Increased intracellular degradation of NPY-pHluorin or increased basal secretion of this DCV-reporter could account for the observed decrease in content. Referring to this effect as &quot;regulation&quot; does not seem wise. Please comment.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this concern. Based on the data on tomosyn orthologs in yeast, Sro7/77, it is indeed plausible that increased intracellular degradation is responsible for the decrease in DCV cargo content in DKO. Loss of Sro7/77 results in mis-targeting of a secretory cargo to vacuole for degradation (Wadskog <italic>et al.,</italic> 2006). In the revised manuscript, we tested whether inhibition of lysosomal degradation rescues the difference in BDNF levels between the genotypes, which was not the case (new Figure 2G, 2I). These data suggest that increased lysosomal degradation does not account for the decrease in BDNF in the absence of tomosyns.</p><p>As for the use of the term “regulation”: we replaced it in the revised version of the manuscript by more specific description of the observed effects. We also replaced “regulates” by “affects” in the title of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The differences between WT and DKO cultures detected by mass spectrometry need extensive analysis. What could the dramatic increase in mitochondrial proteins mean?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the need for a better analysis and discussion of the mass spectrometry data, and we now revised this part of the manuscript. We annotated top-upregulated mitochondrial proteins using MitoCarta3.0, an open-source inventory of mitochondrial proteins (Rath <italic>et al.,</italic> 2021) (Supplementary File 1). Interestingly, most of the upregulated proteins were components of the electron transport chain responsible for oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Other mitochondrial proteins, for example proteins involved in mitochondrial DNA replication and transcription (POLG2, TFAM, EXOG), were not affected in DKO, suggesting normal numbers of mitochondria in DKO. We have added this information to the revised manuscript (lines 190-195). Aerobic oxidation in neurons is tightly linked to neuronal activity and calcium signaling, since neuronal firing is an energy consuming process (Kann <italic>et al.,</italic> 2011; Wong-Riley, 2012; Harris <italic>et al.,</italic> 2012). Tomosyn is a well-known regulator of synaptic activity in both cultured neurons and in the brain, therefore, we speculate that the loss of tomosyns affects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Why was it impossible to detect BDNF in DKO cultures by mass spectrometry when immunocytochemistry and mRNA analysis revealed only a two-fold drop?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this discrepancy requires more analyses. We checked our raw mass spectrometry data and found that BDNF was, in fact, detected in DKO, but only in one out of six biological replicates (=independent cultures) and with one peptide only (=one detection event). In contrast, several unique peptides of BDNF were detected multiple times across six biological replicates in the control condition. So technically, BDNF was detected in DKO (once), but this single detection event was not sufficient to statistically quantify the difference between the genotypes. We changed the text in the Results section accordingly (lines 185-188). The single detection of BDNF in one DKO sample rules out any technical issues in our mass spectrometry pipeline (i.e. the detection was possible). We conclude that low levels of BDNF in most DKO samples fall below the detection threshold of our proteomics setup. To validate this conclusion, we have now performed analysis of BDNF in mass cultures by WB, which we added to Figure 2 (panels E-F). DKO samples showed a 65% decrease in BDNF levels by WB. Hence, the revised manuscript now shows a strong reduction in BDNF protein levels, using three independent methods (ICC, WB, mass spectrometry). The size effect is different between the ICC and WB possibly due to the different culture conditions: ICC was performed on single neurons grown on glia microislands, while WB was done on mass cultures grown on plastic.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What does the observed increase in glutamatergic and GABAergic markers predict for neuropeptide expression? Certain neuropeptides are more highly expressed in one cell type than in the other.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, neuropeptide expression is cell type specific and changes in glutamatergic and GABAergic markers could in principle indicate a biased representation of a neuronal population that went into proteomics or Western blot analysis. However, based on the published single-cell transcriptomics data (Saunders <italic>et al.,</italic> 2018), expression of the affected neuropeptides was not confined to a specific neuronal population (e. g. glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons) (lines 266-268 in the Results section). For example, <italic>Grp,</italic> decreased in Cre<sup>+</sup> neurons, is expressed by a subpopulation of glutamatergic neurons only, while expression of <italic>Npy</italic> (also decreased in Cre<sup>+</sup> neurons) is restricted to a subpopulation of GABAergic interneurons. Furthermore, expression of <italic>Sst</italic>, which is co-expressed together with <italic>Npy</italic> in a subpopulation of GABAergic neurons, was not affected in Cre<sup>+</sup> neurons. Thus, changed expression of specific neuropeptides cannot be explained by altered composition of neuronal cultures in Cre<sup>+</sup> condition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Were the changes in protein expression more prominent for neuronal proteins or glial proteins?</p></disp-quote><p>Given our main aim (testing the role of tomosyns in neuronal DCV exocytosis), our analyses focused on neurons. Neuronal cultures prepared from early postnatal brains do not contain many glia cells as confirmed by MAP2 immunostaining (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>). In line with this, we did not detect many canonical glia markers, such as CLDN10, FGFR3, ALDH1L1, in control and DKO lysates by mass spectrometry. Among glial proteins that were detected in our proteome analysis (such as LCAT, ACSBG1, GFAP), none showed altered expression in DKO neurons (Figure 3 source data 1). Thus, though our experimental setup does not allow us to draw strong conclusions on effects of tomosyns on glial proteome, the data suggest that the loss of tomosyns does not result in major changes in glial protein expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Tomosyns are known to affect the exocytosis of a wide variety of vesicles in other systems (e.g. dense core vesicles in β-cells, GLUT4-containing endocytic vesicles in adipocytes and constitutive vesicles in PC12 cells) and may have similarly broad effects in hippocampal neurons. The authors conclude that tomosyns do not regulate the release of dense core vesicle cargo by hippocampal neurons. Using an elegant assay to detect the release of single dense core vesicles containing NPY-pHluorin, a decrease in DCV diameter is detected (and confirmed using electron microscopy). When electrically stimulated over a 25 sec time period, both WT and DKO neurons released 8% of their DCV content (Figure 1E). It is known that DCVs in axons and dendrites respond to different stimuli and that DCV content proteins are released under basal conditions (in the absence of any secretagogue). Please comment.</p></disp-quote><p>A previous study from our lab showed that approximately 80% of DCV fusion events happen in axons of hippocampal neurons (Persoon <italic>et al.,</italic> 2018). The same study also concluded that approximately 6% of the total DCV pool undergoes exocytosis during strong electric stimulation, which is consistent with the results of the current study. We have added these statements to the revised manuscript (lines 110-111, 117-120).</p><p>Indeed, DCV exocytosis may occur in the absence of stimulation. However, we observed virtually no fusion events in the first 30 sec of recordings (baseline) or in the period after stimulation (26.5 sec) in neurons of both genotypes, suggesting that spontaneous fusion events are rare events, insufficient to explain the substantial reduction in DCV cargo in DKO neurons.

However, there are a few remaining issues that need to be addressed/amended in the text as pointed out by Reviewer #3, as outlined below:</p><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The revised manuscript presents the authors' data in a more logical manner, making it substantially easier to read and understand than the earlier version. The finding that expression of active Cre recombinase in control neurons results in diminished expression of mRNAs encoding Bdnf, Vgf, Pcsk1 and Grp complicates interpretation of the data, but the rescue experiments added to the revised manuscript give the authors a means of dealing with this unexpected complexity. The authors were very responsive to the previous critiques.</p><p>I would like to suggest two modifications to the revised text, in order to make it more comprehensible to a general audience. First, cells depend on an array of vesicles to facilitate trafficking and communication between their various membranous organelles. The authors distinguish synaptic vesicles (SVs) from dense core vesicles (DCVs), but often revert to talking about vesicles, with no indication of the type of vesicle to which they are referring. In the Abstract (line 4), the authors refer to &quot;vesicle exocytosis&quot; – here this means SVs, not DCVs, but the text needs to say so. Again, in the Abstract (line 17), they suggest a role for tomosyns in &quot;vesicle biogenesis&quot;; here they are referring to DCVs, and need to be specific. The biogenesis of SVs differs greatly from the biogenesis of DCVs. In the Introduction (line 74), the reader is told that rat sympathetic neurons show a decrease in neurotransmitter release upon depletion of tomosyn – is this a reference to SVs or a reference to DCVs, which contain a variety of peptides used for signaling by sympathetic neurons?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and agree that, especially in the context of our manuscript, the type of vesicle should be clearly indicated throughout the manuscript. We corrected the abstract and main text accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Secondly, the literature makes it abundantly clear that secretion is a very cell-type specific phenomenon. Multiple isoforms of v-SNAREs and t-SNARES play important roles in different tissues, a complexity not really acknowledged in this manuscript. While the first phase of insulin secretion by β-cells depends on Syntaxin 1 and SNAP25, sustained release involves Syntaxin 4 and SNAP23. Which v-SNAREs and t-SNAREs are relevant to the secretion of peptide-containing DCVs in neurons? Platelet α-granules, referred to in the Discussion as an example of DCVs, clearly require multivesicular bodies for their maturation; they receive membrane proteins from the plasma membrane, via the endocytic pathway.</p></disp-quote><p>A large body of evidence suggests that SNAP25 and VAMP2 are strictly required for DCV fusion in mature hippocampal and cortical neurons (Shimojo et al., 2015; Arora et al., 2017; Hoogstraaten et al., 2020). Conversely, VAMP1/3 and SNAP23/29 were dispensable for DCV exocytosis in these neuronal populations, and SNAP47 showed a modulatory effect on BDNF secretion but could not restore secretion in SNAP25-lacking cortical neurons (Shimojo et al., 2015; Hoogstraaten et al., 2020). We added corresponding references to the introduction section (lines 45-47). Though some sensory neurons may require distinct sets of SNAREs for DCV exocytosis (Meng et al., 2007), such neuron type-specific differences in DCV fusion machinery have not been systematically addressed yet. Even less is known about trafficking pathways of transmembrane proteins to DCVs in neurons. Intriguingly, evidence from endocrine cells suggests that transmembrane DCV cargos use endocytic route for delivery to DCVs (Bäck et al., 2010; Hummer et al., 2019), which blurs the line between DCVs and lysosome-related organelles, such as α-granules in platelets (Ma et al., 2021). Nevertheless, as the reviewer pointed out, α-granules are clearly distinct from DCVs in many parameters. We added this important comment to the discussion (lines 357-360).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional Points:</p><p>In setting up their study, the authors state the both SVs and DCVs require an identical basic machinery consisting of sntaxin-1, SNAP25 and VAMP2. While they mention that some of the &quot;many other proteins&quot; involved in the fusion process are &quot;differentially required for SV and DCV exocytosis&quot;, they fail to mention the many other ways in which SVs and DCVs (along with myriad of other vesicles in cells) differ – ER/Golgi synthesis and loading of granules vs. local synthesis and vesicle reloading at nerve terminals and types of stimuli required for release, amongst many other differences.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and modified the introduction accordingly (lines 38-43).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors used leupeptin to inhibit lysosomal proteolysis and observed a two-fold increase in BDNF levels in both the double knockout cultures and in wildtype cultures. This is a striking result, unlike what is typically seen in endocrine cells; although it does not explain why the DKO and WT neurons differ, it suggests much more rapid degradation of DCV cargo in neurons than in endocrine cells. The ability of another lysosomal inhibitor, along with quantification of levels of another cargo protein (IA-2, for example) would strengthen this conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the observed increase in BDNF upon 24h leupeptin treatment is impressive, although it has been reported for cortical neurons (Evans et al., 2011). It has been proposed that neurons synthesize BDNF in excess and regulate its levels by lysosomal degradation. We now corroborated this observation by using another lysosomal inhibitor (E64d) in combination with the ICC-based detection of BDNF. Treatment of WT neurons with E64d for 24h resulted in a massive increase of BDNF signal concentrated in organelles positive for the endolysosomal marker LIMP2, suggesting that a significant portion of BDNF is routed to lysosomes in neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>). We next tested if another neuronal DCV cargo, CHGB, is subjected to such a rapid degradation by lysosomes. Interestingly, treatment of neurons with E64d for 24h failed to raise CHGB levels, as evidenced by WB. These data suggest that the speed of lysosomal degradation differs between neuronal DCV cargos.</p><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Effect of lysosomal proteolysis inhibition by E64d (30 μM for 24h) on levels of BDNF and CHGB.</title><p>(A) Representative images of the BDNF immunostaining and quantification of the somatic BDNF signal in control- and E64d-treated neurons.
