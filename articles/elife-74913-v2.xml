Currently, little is known about the disease mechanism of non-infectious uveitis. A large body of mechanistic studies using experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) in rodents suggest that T cells play a role in non-infectious uveitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Caspi, 2010</xref>). Human non-infectious uveitis is characterized by inflammation and T cells infiltrating the eyes through unknown mechanisms. The genetic association between non-infectious uveitis and <italic>MHC</italic>, and <italic>ERAP1</italic>, <italic>ERAP2</italic> genes indicates that antigen presentation is central to the etiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kuiper and Venema, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Huang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kuiper et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Márquez et al., 2017</xref>). A key antigen presenting cell type are dendritic cells. Despite their important role in EAU, dendritic cells have yet to be fully investigated in human non-infectious uveitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). CD1c-positive conventional dendritic cells (CD1c+ DCs) have been found to be associated with disease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2014</xref>), and are abundant in eye fluid of patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">O’Rourke et al., 2018</xref>). In order to understand the role of CD1c+ DCs in non-infectious uveitis, it is necessary to understand their functions.</p><p>Several single-cell studies have revealed that the CD1c+ DCs (and its murine equivalent, termed ‘cDC2s’) consists of multiple subsets derived from distinct progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Villani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dutertre et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cytlak et al., 2020</xref>). The type I IFN family of cytokines promotes the expansion of a subset of CD1c+ DCs called ‘DC3’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dutertre et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Girard et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bourdely et al., 2020</xref>). DC3s are increased in blood of type I IFN-driven <italic>systemic lupus erythematosus</italic> (SLE) patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dutertre et al., 2019</xref>). A significant difference between non-infectious uveitis and SLE is that active uveitis is accompanied by lower levels of type I IFN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kuiper et al., 2022</xref>). It should be noted that although type I IFNs can induce lupus-like disease, they can also suppress non-infectious uveitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rönnblom et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rönnblom et al., 1990</xref>), pointing to an alternative disease mechanism implicating CD1c+ DCs in non-infectious uveitis. Hence, we do not fully understand the characteristics of CD1c+ DC during autoimmunity, especially in conditions not driven by type I IFNs.</p><p>For the purpose of characterizing the core transcriptional features and subset composition of CD1c+ DCs in autoimmunity of the eye, we used whole transcriptome profiling by bulk RNA-sequencing of peripheral blood CD1c+ DCs and multiparameter flow cytometry of two cohorts of non-infectious uveitis patients and healthy donors. We constructed co-expression networks that identified a robust gene module associated with non-infectious uveitis in patients that helped identify a CX3CR1-positive CD1c+ DC subset.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Patients and patient material</title><p>This study was conducted in compliance with the Helsinki principles. Ethical approval was requested and obtained from the Medical Ethical Research Committee in Utrecht (METC protocol number #14-065/M). All patients signed written informed consent before participation. We collected blood from a discovery cohort of 23 and a replication cohort of 28 adult patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) with HLA-B27-associated acute anterior uveitis (AU), idiopathic intermediate uveitis (IU), or HLA-A29-associated birdshot uveitis (BU). Patients were recruited at the outbound patient clinic of the Department of Ophthalmology of the University Medical Center Utrecht between July 2014 and January 2017. We recruited 27 age- and sex-matched anonymous blood donors of European Ancestry with no history of ocular inflammatory disease at the same institute to serve as unaffected controls (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Uveitis was classified and graded in accordance with the SUN classification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jabs et al., 2005</xref>). Each patient underwent a full ophthalmological examination by an ophthalmologist experienced in uveitis, routine laboratory screening, and an X-ray of the lungs. Laboratory screening included erythrocyte sedimentation rate, renal and liver function tests, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and screening for infectious agents in the serum and an Interferon-Gamma Release Assay (IGRA) was obtained for all patients. All patients with AU and BU were HLA-B27 or HLA-A29-positive, respectively (confirmed by HLA typing). All patients had active uveitis (new onset or relapse) and there was no clinical evidence for uveitis-associated systemic inflammatory disease (e.g., rheumatic condition) till the time of sampling. None of the patients received systemic immunomodulatory treatment in the last 3 months, other than low dose (≤10 mg) oral prednisolone in one BU patient of cohort II and one AU patient of cohort I.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Characteristics of the patients and controls from cohorts I and II.</title><p>Abbreviations: BU: birdshot uveitis, AU: HLA-B27-associated anterior uveitis, HC: healthy control, IU: idiopathic intermediate uveitis, n.a.: not applicable, *Fisher’s exact test, **ANOVA, ***Kruskal–Wallis.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Cohort I</th><th align="left" valign="top">AU</th><th align="left" valign="top">IU</th><th align="left" valign="top">BU</th><th align="left" valign="top">HC</th><th align="left" valign="top">p value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>N</italic></td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">10</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">5</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">8</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">13</td><td align="left" valign="top">Total = 36</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Male/female</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">2/8</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">3/2</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">5/3</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">5/8</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.26*</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Age in years; mean ± SD</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" valign="top">45 ± 16</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" valign="top">30 ± 9</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" valign="top">42 ± 10</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" valign="top">42 ± 13</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.24***</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Disease duration in years; median (range)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">8.1 (0.2–22.3)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">3.4 (0.4–14.1)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.9 (0.2–19.9)</td><td align="left" valign="top">n.a.</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.36**</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Cohort II</td><td align="left" valign="top">AU</td><td align="left" valign="top">IU</td><td align="left" valign="top">BU</td><td align="left" valign="top">HC</td><td align="left" valign="top">p value</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>N</italic></td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">9</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">9</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">10</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">14</td><td align="left" valign="top">Total = 42</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Male/female</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">3/6</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">2/7</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">4/6</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">6/8</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.8790*</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Age in years; mean ± SD</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" valign="top">47 ± 17</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" valign="top">39 ± 14</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" valign="top">52 ± 13</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" valign="top">39 ± 10</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.06***</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Disease duration in years; median (range)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">5.8 (0.1–39.3)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">3.7 (0.2–20.0)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">1.3 (0.2–15.1)</td><td align="left" valign="top">n.a.</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.14**</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>CD1c+ DC purification</title><p>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by standard ficoll density gradient centrifugation from 70 ml heparinized blood immediately after blood withdrawal (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden).

The analysis with flowSOM clearly distinguished four CD1c+ DC clusters (cluster number 22, 37, 44, and 45) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). We extracted the data for these four CD1c+ DC clusters and conducted <italic>principal component analysis</italic> (PCA). The PCA biplot identified CD5 and CD163 as top loadings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>), which defines the <italic>DC2s</italic> (cluster 45), CD5−CD163− DC3s (cluster 37), and CD5−CD163+ DC3s (clusters 22 and 44) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dutertre et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B, C</xref>). Among the identified clusters, we detected a significant reduction in the frequency of cluster 44 in patients compared to controls (Welch <italic>t</italic>-test, p = 0.03, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

However, cluster 44 had relatively higher levels of CX3CR1 than cluster 22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E, F</xref>).

According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brown et al., 2019</xref>, CD1c+ DCs exhibit two subsets: cDC2A and cDC2B, whereas cDC2B exhibits higher expression of CX3CR1 and produces more TNF-alpha and IL-6 than cDC2A upon stimulation. Accordingly, uveitis-associated CX3CR1+ DC3s described in this study exhibit similar phenotypical and functional features.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dutertre et al., 2019</xref> showed that the phenotype of peripheral blood CD1c+ DCs can be further segregated according to the expression of CD163 and CD5, with ‘DC3’ cells being characterized as CD5−CD163− or CD5−CD163+ cells and ‘DC2’ as CD5+CD163 cells. Our flow-cytometry results confirm these findings, but we also show that CD5−CD163+ DC3s that express CD14 are composed of CX3CR1-positive and CX3CR1-negative cells, of which the CX3CR1+ population is implicated in non-infectious uveitis.</p><p>Single-cell analysis supported that CD1c+ DCs in eye fluid of patients with non-infectious uveitis contain also a population that has a gene profile reminiscent of CX3CR1+ DC3s, with relatively higher levels of CX3CR1, CD36, CCR2, and lower levels of RUNX3. Patients with SLE display accumulation of CD14+ DC3s in blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dutertre et al., 2019</xref>), while the population of CD14+ DC3 cells was decreased in non-infectious uveitis patients. The differences between non-infectious uveitis and SLE may be related to distinct (i.e., opposite) immunopathological mechanisms; Type I IFNs drive the maturation of cDC2s into ‘inflammatory cDC2s’ (infcDC2s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bosteels et al., 2020</xref>) and can induce CD1c+ DCs to express a distinct set of surface receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Girard et al., 2020</xref>). The type I IFN-α drives immunopathology of SLE and administration of type I IFN therapy can induce <italic>lupus-like</italic> disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rönnblom et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rönnblom et al., 1990</xref>). In favor of attributing the seemingly contrasting observations in blood CD1c+ subsets between SLE and non-infectious uveitis to distinct biology is the fact that, in contrast to elevated IFN-α in patients with SLE, in non-infectious uveitis patient’s disease exacerbations correlate with reduced blood type I IFN concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kuiper et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Obermoser and Pascual, 2010</xref>). Despite the importance of type I IFN signaling on DC3s, our results suggest that DC3s are also dysregulated in conditions associated with decreased type I IFNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kuiper et al., 2022</xref>), supporting additional pathways involved in DC3 regulation during chronic inflammation.</p><p>We showed that the gene module of CD1c+ DCs showed overlap with the gene signature of disrupted NOTCH2 signaling in cDC2s. <italic>Notch2</italic> signaling is mediated via the NF-κB family member <italic>Relb</italic> in murine cDC2s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Diener et al., 2021</xref>). NF-κB signaling via RelB suppresses type I IFN signaling in cDC2s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Saha et al., 2020</xref>) while selective deletion of RelB in dendritic cells protects against autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Diener et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andreas et al., 2019</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that the enrichment for NOTCH gene signatures implies altered NF-κB-Relb signaling in CD1c+ DCs, with a mechanism that varies between diseases mediated by type I IFNs (e.g., SLE) and type I IFN-negative diseases (e.g., uveitis). Although this warrants further investigation, some circumstantial evidence for this is the presence of NF-κB family members in the black module, such as <italic>NFKB1</italic> and <italic>NFKBIA</italic>, the former associated previously with a CX3CR1+ cDC2s, while the latter can regulate <italic>Relb</italic> function in dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shih et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sun, 2011</xref>). NF-κB-Relb signaling has been shown to suppress type I IFN via a histone demethylase encoded by <italic>KDM4A</italic> which was also in the black module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jin et al., 2014</xref>). Regardless, the NF-κB pathways are regulated by the TNFR1, the main receptor for TNF-alpha (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hayden and Ghosh, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Maney et al., 2014</xref>). TNFR1 is expressed at the cell surface of cDC2s and its ectodomain cleaved by the NOTCH2-pathway regulator ADAM10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Maney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Iberg et al., 2022</xref>). We showed that both TNF-alpha and sTNFR1 were higher in the secretome of activated CX3CR1+ DC3s. This is in agreement with previous studies on CD36+ DC3s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Villani et al., 2017</xref>) or CX3CR1+ cDC2B (T-bet−) that also produced higher levels of TNF-alpha (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brown et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, altered NF-κB signaling specifically in cDC2 is associated with clinical response to anti-TNF-alpha therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Andres-Ejarque et al., 2021</xref>). Anti-TNF therapy is effective for treatment of non-infectious uveitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Touhami et al., 2019</xref>), while anti-TNF therapy may also result in a dysregulated type I IFN response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Conrad et al., 2018</xref>) indicating potentially cross regulatory mechanisms via NF-κB signaling and type I IFN signaling affecting cDC2s. More research is needed to resolve the regulatory mechanisms driving CD1+ DC changes in type I IFN-negative inflammation, including non-infectious uveitis. It is also possible that the change in CD1c+ DCs observed in this study results from cytokine-induced precursor emigration or differentiation or that the affected peripheral blood DC3s marked by CX3CR1 are in a precursor or pre-activation state.</p><p>Other disease modifying factors possibly affect the CD1c+ DC pool in uveitis patients. In mice, antibiotic treatment to experimentally disturb the microbiota affects a cDC2 subset phenotypically similar to CD1c+ DCs and decreases their frequency in the intestine of mice, which suggests microbiota-dependent signals involved in the maintenance of cDC2 subsets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brown et al., 2019</xref>). This is especially interesting in light of growing evidence that microbiota-dependent signals cause autoreactive T cells to trigger uveitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Horai et al., 2015</xref>), which makes it tempting to speculate that gut-resident cDC2 subsets contribute to the activation of T cells in uveitis models. Dietary components can influence subsets of intestinal dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ko et al., 2020</xref>). Regardless, most likely, an ensemble of disease modulating factors is involved. For example, myeloid cytokines, such as GM-CSF, contribute to autoimmunity of the eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Croxford et al., 2015</xref>) and GM-CSF has been shown to stimulate the differentiation of human CD1c+ subset from progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bourdely et al., 2020</xref>). However, GM-CSF signaling in conventional dendritic cells has a minor role in the inception of EAU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bing et al., 2020</xref>). Our data support that stimulation of CD1c+subsets with GM-CSF or TLR ligands does not induce the transcriptional features of CD1c+ DCs during non-infectious uveitis, which is in line with previous observations that support that stimulated cDC2s do not convert from one into another subset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bourdely et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Note that our results of a decreased subset of CD1c+ DCs in non-infectious uveitis are in contrast with previous flow-cytometry reports in non-infectious uveitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2014</xref> reported an increase of CD1c+ myeloid dendritic cells in non-infectious uveitis. It is important to note, however, that their study did not include the DC marker CD11c, thereby including CD1c+CD11c− populations that do not cluster phenotypically with CD1c+ (CD11c+) DCs (e.g., <italic>cluster 46</italic>, se <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), which may explain the differences compared to our study.</p><p>Better understanding of the changes in the CD1c+ DC pool during human non-infectious uveitis will help develop strategies to pharmacologically influence putative disease pathways involved at an early disease stage, which may lay the foundation for the design of effective strategies to halt progress toward severe visual complications or blindness.

Your revised article has been evaluated by Betty Diamond (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>The authors utilized deep transcriptional profiling of isolated CD1c+ peripheral blood cells to identify a peripheral blood biomarker of uveitis, followed by flow cytometric analysis of protein expression to test the hypothesis that a subset of CD1c+ cells are reduced in uveitis patients. Identification of peripheral blood biomarkers of uveitis is important and their study is based on analysis of a reasonable number of study subjects with active disease, therefore the data supporting the first conclusion that a differential gene expression profile exists in uveitis is well-supported and convincing. The subsequent analysis which attempts to define and new cell type based on comparison with published expression datasets, while hypothesis-generating, is inadequate, as sufficient phenotypic and functional analyses were not performed to reach their conclusions. Similarly, the comparison with genes expressed by ocular CD1c+ cells from a separate dataset is not sufficient to conclude that the peripheral blood CD1c+ cells migrate into the eye.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have addressed many of the concerns in the original reviews, and while the discovery of a subpopulation of blood-derived DCs that are changed in uveitis would be interesting the revision does not leave me convinced that this is truly a unique population of cells. Specifically the flow cytometry data in Figure 5/supplement suggests that the CD14 population is derived from a population that is bisected by the original gate, rather than from a population of CD1c+ DCs limiting functional analysis, and the scRNA seq does not show that the cells expressing black module genes are distinct from those that don't.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors set out to utilize advance informatics techniques to advance our understanding of a cell type previously shown to play a role in uveitis, type 2 conventional dendritic cells (previously termed mDC1). They accumulated a valuable set of samples from untreated, active disease and employed a testing and validation cohort which reproduced a core set of genes differentially expressed within the CD1c+ dendritic cells in the peripheral blood of patients with uveitis. Importantly these cells appear altered regardless of the subtype of uveitis. They then astutely question whether the transcriptional signature simply represents different proportions of cell subtypes or states and test this hypothesis using flow cytometry.</p><p>They also attempt to probe the mechanism driving this particular cell type/state by cleverly drawing on published data sets, however these hypothesis-generating experiments are not validated experimentally in a uveitis system.</p><p>They utilize in vitro analysis of similar cells isolated from human patients and show that the cells can be induced to make a specific set of cytokines which is different from a related dendritic cell type, however the lack of concordance with published activated DC2s, or the transcriptional signature in their own ex vivo activated DC2s raises more questions than it answers.</p><p>The manuscript was difficult to read, largely because it is trying to accomplish too many goals, but also because the informatics techniques and external data sets were not described sufficiently for an average reader to readily evaluate the method and conclusions, and the conclusions were overstated throughout the paper. Overall, too many hypotheses were tested, alternative hypotheses were not considered/discussed. The data should probably be divided into at least 2 papers, one which explores the peripheral blood subsets more concretely, and one which attempts to elucidate a mechanisms by which low RUNX3 expression is associated with the genes expressed more highly in DC2s in the peripheral blood of uveitis patients.</p><p>1. The rationale for depleting CD14 in the validation cohort is not clear and justified. CD14 expression on dendritic cells has been established in the literature (ex Duterte Immunity 2019). This reviewer wonders if a better flow of data would be to start with the current second cohort, CD14 depleted, ID the black module, realize that some genes discovered have been associated with CD14+DC3, then utilize a second cohort that includes CD14+CD1c+ cells to validate and expand the original gene set.</p><p>2. Experiments probing the transcriptional regulation of the uveitis-enriched gene set are not definitive, but hypothesis-generating, and left in this story, are distracting from the primary observation of a cell type differentially present in the blood of uveitis patients.</p><p>3. The authors claim to have found an inflammatory cell type, but the gene expression profile does not recapitulate inflammation-induced DC2 gene expression profile. Figure 3 attempts to shed mechanistic light but only opens more questions, like if viral infection in mice (figure 3A lower panel) and multiple inflammatory stimuli (figure 3C) induce a transcriptional program opposite what they are finding in these cells in the peripheral blood of uveitis patients, how are the cells identified in this paper likely relevant to eye inflammation?</p><p>4. Pro-inflammatory CD14+DC3 increased in blood in SLE patients, but according to authors interpretation, they find a similar cell type is decreased in peripheral blood in uveitis. The authors adhere to a possible explanation that these cells are trafficking to the eye, but by the same logic, SLE patients should have an even more significant reduction, not increase in their peripheral DC3 counts. This is not discussed.</p><p>5. Even more importantly, the Chen et al. papers which are cited generally by the authors, showed the opposite- that CD1c+ DCs are increased in the blood of patients with uveitis, and correlate with disease activity. No attempt is made by the authors to compare their data with this data derived from a larger number of patients, or discuss the difference. The authors have essentially ignored this key discrepancy with previously published data.</p><p>6. Despite changing some text around the hypothesis that this cell type is reduced in the blood because it migrates to the eye (numerically impossible as pointed out by prior reviewer #1), this notion is reiterated several other places in the paper and should be removed, and frankly, reconsidered. It is also possible that the change in peripheral blood cell type/state frequency results from cytokine-induced precursor emigration/differentiation. Perhaps there is actually a fraction of DC2-type cells that are increased in the blood in uveitis (as Chen found) but express the transcriptional program identified in the paper because they are pre-activated cells?</p><p>7. The analysis of ocular DC2s which concludes that the current cell type, CD14+DC3s with black module gene expression, are present in the eye is not convincing. The methods are not clearly explained, however it appears that rather than utilizing unbiased cluster analysis and performing differential gene expression analysis between the patients with non-infectious uveitis, and the control (endophthalmitis), or using another technique like GSEA which they used in previous figures to correlate the black module genes with the genes expressed by the ocular DC2s, the authors appear to have selected individual cells that expressed the black modules genes, then compared the expression of black module genes to the cells that did not express black module genes.</p><p>8. The authors state in their response to reviewer #1 comments &quot;we profiled available eye fluid biopsies and paired plasma by Olink proteomics to measure immune mediators from patients and controls from this study (and several additional samples, including aqueous humor from non-inflammatory cataract controls – see revised Figure 5 panel D). This analysis shows that cytokines produced by CD36+CX3CR1+ DCs such as TNF-α and IL-6 are specifically increased in eye tissue of patients, but not in blood.&quot;-Neither this data, or discussion of it are included in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Finally, a concern is that the title is a gross overstatement of their findings:</p><p>1. They have not demonstrated that the cells in this paper induce inflammation, and especially not in the context of uveitis- only that similar cells from healthy patients produce a different set of cytokines when stimulated in vitro compared to another cell type.</p><p>2. They have not demonstrated that these very cells migrate to the eye, only that similar genes are present in a possibly similar ocular cell type in another data set.</p><p>3. They do not demonstrate type I IFN-negative autoimmunity in the eye. This was a huge stretch, presumably from prior assumptions about the mechanisms driving uveitis along with the finding that their cell type does not share a transcriptional program with murine DC2s activated in a viral infection.</p><p>In regard to addressing the Previous Editor Concerns:</p><p>1. The informatics analysis for most of the paper is likely sufficient, however the methods are not communicated succinctly and clearly such that non-informatics experts can understand the rationale and method for each analysis. The analysis of the intraocular DCs was not clear and from the details provided, did appear appropriate.</p><p>2. Revision of claim to have identified a new type of cDC2- This is still not satisfactory as:</p><p>a. authors have not ruled out the possibility that the cells are monocyte-derived by transcriptional analysis, protein expression or functional analysis. The use of CD14-deplete cells to recapitulate the gene expression profile is not sufficient to determine that the cells in this paper are not monocyte-derived, as CD14-expression is demonstrated on cells confirmed by FLT3L response to be dendritic cells in Duterte et al. Immunity 2019.</p><p>b. To be defined as a new subset of the previously defined DC3 subset, one would need to exactly replicate the marker expression and then show that the new markers subset that subset further, the current manuscript may simple be focusing on different genes/proteins expressed by one or more previously described subsets.</p><p>c. As this paper is useful for describing a cell type or state that differentiates uveitis from healthy patients, these experiments do not need to be done to publish this paper, but the naming of the cell type should be tempered to simply describe the markers that were expressed and suggest how they fit into the Duterte/Villani schema of DC2/DC3 classification. In actuality, the discrimination of cDC2 from monocyte-derived DC2-like cells has proven difficult in many papers, thus the authors are advised to stay out of the mud, so-to-speak.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Transcriptome network analysis implicates CX3CR1-positive type 3 dendritic cells in non-infectious uveitis&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Betty Diamond (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>CD1c+ dendritic cells have been found in the peripheral blood and eyes of patients with active uveitis. The authors set out to characterize CD1c+ dendritic cells in uveitis. They establish that the CD1c+ population varies between uveitis and healthy controls in both gene expression and the frequency of a subset of CD1c+ DCs, recently termed DC3s. Finally, the authors utilize a previously published dataset to show that cells with similar gene expression can be found in the eye during active uveitis.</p><p>Review:</p><p>The authors compare sorted CD1c+ DCs from patients with non-infectious uveitis and healthy controls and find a gene expression signature associated with uveitis, regardless of anatomic subtype or severity, that includes expression of the chemokine receptor CX3CR1. They corroborate this finding with a second cohort of CD1c+CD14+ cells, which strengthens the uveitis-specific CD1c+ DC signature.</p><p>The authors then compare the genes enriched in these uveitis CD1c+ DCs with previously published datasets analyzing murine CD1c+ DCs. They found more overlap between uveitis patient CD1c+ DC genes and murine RUNX3/<italic>NOTCH2</italic> KO CD1c+ DCs than with murine viral-infected cells. While the data suggests that IFN signaling may be less relevant in these cells, the authors' conclusion that the genes differentially expressed by peripheral blood CD1c+ DCs in uveitis are not mediated by type I IFNs is overstated and alternative explanations should also be considered.</p><p>Next, the authors used flow cytometry to show that blood CD36+CX3CR1+CD1c+ DCs (thus labeled DC3s) were diminished in uveitis vs healthy controls, suggesting that the difference in CD1c+ gene expression between uveitis and healthy controls may actually be due to differential presence of CD1c+ subsets. The difference is small, but statistically significant, although the observation could have been strengthened by quantifying this cell type longitudinally in the same patients during active and inactive disease.</p><p>Next the authors found that LTA-stimulated CX3CR1+ DC3s from healthy controls secrete higher levels of uveitis-relevant inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, compared to CX3CR1- DC3s. This experiment was performed on a small number of healthy controls and not compared with cytokine production by DC3s from uveitis patients, which could have further supported the authors conclusion that the differential gene expression identified in Figure 1 was due to reduced proportions of CX3CR1+ DC3 cells in uveitis patients vs healthy controls, rather than qualitative differences between uveitis and healthy DC3s.</p><p>Finally, the authors find expression of CD36 and CX3CR1 on CLEC10A+ (which they use as a proxy for CD1C) cells by aqueous dendritic cells from a previously published dataset, suggesting that DC3s similar to those found at reduced frequency in the peripheral blood are present in aqueous inflammation, supporting their relevance in uveitis.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>Specifically, there are errors in the methods, results, and legends that must be corrected.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In the revised paper entitled &quot;Transcriptome network analysis implicates CX3CR1-positive type 3 dendritic cells in non-infectious uveitis,&quot; Hiddingh, Vandit, Verhagen et al. explore the gene expression of PBMCs in non-infectious uveitis patients and demonstrate a CX3CR1-positive Cd1c+ gene signature that is altered in non-infectious uveitis. They show that this population is decreased in the peripheral blood, could be regulated by notch signaling, expresses proinflammatory cytokines upon stimulation with LTA, and are present in the eye during uveitis.</p><p>The hypothesis that a cD1c+ population of DCs that could be related to uveitis in humans is intriguing and deserves further study. Their use of multiple methods to explore this population and the use of multiple cohorts are a strength of the manuscript, and it raises many intriguing questions that are potentially interesting, such as if this population is expressing inflammatory cytokines upon stimulation, why are they decreased in uveitis?</p><p>There are still areas where the manuscript is hard to follow and there are some concerns with the experimental methodology. The difficulty following the author's story is partially due to errors in cross-referencing statements in the text with their figures that support the data and understanding the experiments from the figure legends. For instance, in lines 313-315, the authors state &quot;Furthermore, in CD1c+ DCs from healthy human donors, IFN-α did not induce downregulation of RUNX3 as observed CD1c+ DCs from non-infectious uveitis patients. Figure 2 – Figure 2 supplement 1&quot;. Data to support this statement is not found in Figure 2 or Figure 2 supplements (only healthy control data). The Figure 2 Supplement 1 legend references &quot;the notch-negative condition in d&quot; with a d in that figure.</p><p>Methodologically, the backgating for the manual gating of CD11c/CD1c suggests that the CD36+CX3CR1+ population is really part of a larger population of CD11c+ cells, raising the question of if this population is too poorly defined in this experimental context. This concern is slightly ameliorated by the appearance of a CD36hiCX3CR1hiCD1c+ population in the unsupervised clustering.</p><p>Despite these weaknesses, there is enough strength in using multiple methods and replication with multiple patient cohorts to overcome these concerns and to utilize it as a basis to further explore the functions of this population in uveitis pathogenesis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have responded to most of the previous reviews and have generated a more clear and cohesive manuscript.</p><p>Additional recommendations:</p><p>Figure 1</p><p>The text rationale for CD14 separation is confusing, consider omitting it.</p><p>A better methodology would have been to repeat analysis with new cohort I followed by validation using new cohort II rather than simply comparing the cohorts, but this reads more clearly and logically than the prior version and the overall conclusions seem valid.</p><p>Figure 1 Sup 1 not needed, emphasized the odd methodology sorting &quot;cohort II&quot; for CD14- recommend omitting this from the final version, or using instead Figure 3- Supplement 2 could be moved to the supplement for Figure 1 to explain why black module (from the CD14-sorted cohort) is stronger than then enriched modules from cohort I.</p><p>CD14+ CD1c+CD11c+CD36+CXCR3+ DC3s seem to be a subset of CD1c+CD11c+CD36+CXCR3+ DC3s, which may be why there is a stronger gene expression signature black module from cohort II vs the blue and green modules from cohort 1.</p><p>The supplemental experimental data shows that sorted DC3s from healthy peripheral blood treated with a variety of inflammatory stimuli upregulate RUNX3. One alternative explanation not discussed by the authors is that peripheral blood DC3s are in a precursor or pre-activation state.</p><p>Text: in CD1c+ DCs from healthy human donors, IFN-α did not induce downregulation of RUNX3 as observed in CD1c+ DCs from non-infectious uveitis patients, however supplemental figure 2 only tests CD1c DCs from healthy patients. CD1c+ DCs from uveitis patients were never stimulated with IFN to test whether they downregulate RUNX3 after this stimuli. This textual discussion of the experimental data is misleading.</p><p>Sup figure 3 final panel should be G, not H.</p><p>Aqueous scRNA samples are listed as obtained from Utrecht in the methods section and should cite the previous dataset.</p><p>Data used from prior sources should be more clearly detailed in legends and text.

CLEC10A and C5AR should both be shown and the label should not state CD1c+ if this expression was not assessed- this is misleading.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.74913.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Improved informatics analysis to correct for false discovery and stronger correlation with intra-ocular cDC2s, per reviewer #3</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the editor for the time and effort to review our work.

With this in mind, we therefore went to great lengths to attribute the results to CD1c+ DCs. First of all, we used a series of MACS isolations to remove contamination from other cells. For cohort I, fresh PBMCs were immediately subjected to magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) for the removal (positive selection) of CD304+ cells (pDC), followed by CD19<sup>+</sup> cells (B cell), and subsequently isolation of CD1c+ cells by using the CD1c+ (BDCA1) isolation kit (see <italic>Methods</italic>). We now have provided additional experimental data of flow cytometry analysis of the MACS-isolated cell fractions used for RNA-seq of cohort I. As shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1, we used highly purified CD1c+ cDC2 cell fractions (median [interquartile range] % = 96[3]% pure) with no difference between groups in any of the residual cell populations. We outlined this in the Results section on page 10. As shown in revised Figure 2A-C (see also <italic>reviewer #1</italic> comment 1), we conducted additional experiment to show that the black module genes are not from CD14+ monocytes (not dependent on CD14+ surface expression), but from CD1c+ DCs. Also, in cohort II, we used CD3-CD19-CD56-HLA-DR+CD11c+CD1c+CD14- cells for RNA-seq analysis sorted by flow cytometry.

Although <italic>WGCNA</italic> does not recommends filtering genes by differential expression, we aimed to prioritize genes linked to uveitis while controlling for possible false positives in 3 steps: (1) As a compromise between not filtering genes and using only a strict fraction of differentially expressed genes at <italic>Padj&lt;0.05</italic>, we included genes with raw <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05 to construct uveitis-relevant gene modules with sufficient resolution.

In our opinion, the strategy to replicate disease-associated gene modules is much more robust as illustrated by corroboration of these data by unbiased flow cytometry data and scRNAseq analysis. Regardless, we have now also added analysis with adjusted <italic>P</italic>-values in the result section (revised Figure 1B, Figure 1 Supplement 2F), and describe that genes with high module membership were also significantly increased in uveitis after correction for multiple testing in the result section on page 11 (<italic>Padj</italic>&lt;0.05, Supplementary File 1H).

We determined the approximate cluster sizes for cluster 81,41,61, and 83 which revealed that the clusters together represented &lt;1% in the singlet gate (input data for flowSOM). Because identification of rare cell types is challenging for unsupervised gating algorithms, including <italic>flowSOM</italic> (reliance on cellular density which is non optimal for rare population detection), we aimed to improve detection of CD1c+ DC phenotypes by gating out lymphocytes. To this end, we reanalyzed the flowcytometry data of PBMCs of patients and controls with flowSOM using Lin-(CD3-CD19-CD56-) HLA-DR+ gated cells as input. As shown in Figure 4 – Supplement 1 this clearly identified (again) a cluster of 4 CD1c+ DC phenotypes, which we show are highly reminiscent of <italic>DC2</italic> and <italic>DC3</italic> cells (revised Figure 4B). We have updated Figure 4A-F with this significantly improved data and now show that the percentage of one particular cluster (now called cluster 44) is the single cluster that is significantly decreased in blood of patients (revised Figure 4B,C), and importantly, this cluster is distinguished by higher CD36 and CX3CR1 expression but not CD14, in line with our RNA-seq data and scRNAseq analysis (revised Figure 4E, 4F, 4J, Figure 4 – Supplement 2). Finally, we show that cluster 44 can be well identified by manual gating of CD36+CX3CR1+ CD1c+ DCs.

Now we describe that cluster 1 exhibits the pattern of expression we found in peripheral blood to be associated with CX3CR1+ DC3. We hope the reviewer agrees that we have now shown that CD1c+ DCs in eye fluid appear to cluster into distinct clusters, one of which is similar to a CX3CR1+ DC3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors set out to utilize advance informatics techniques to advance our understanding of a cell type previously shown to play a role in uveitis, type 2 conventional dendritic cells (previously termed mDC1). They accumulated a valuable set of samples from untreated, active disease and employed a testing and validation cohort which reproduced a core set of genes differentially expressed within the CD1c+ dendritic cells in the peripheral blood of patients with uveitis. Importantly these cells appear altered regardless of the subtype of uveitis. They then astutely question whether the transcriptional signature simply represents different proportions of cell subtypes or states and test this hypothesis using flow cytometry.</p><p>They also attempt to probe the mechanism driving this particular cell type/state by cleverly drawing on published data sets, however these hypothesis-generating experiments are not validated experimentally in a uveitis system.</p><p>They utilize in vitro analysis of similar cells isolated from human patients and show that the cells can be induced to make a specific set of cytokines which is different from a related dendritic cell type, however the lack of concordance with published activated DC2s, or the transcriptional signature in their own ex vivo activated DC2s raises more questions than it answers.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's constructive comments and additional feedback. The reviewer may have been confused by the description of &quot;in vivo activated&quot; cDC2s, whereas this should have been “inflammatory” cDC2s, which are type I IFN-Dependent murine cDC2 subsets induced by pneumonia viruses in mice. We regret this mistake. Specifically, we wanted to demonstrate that CD1c+ DC transcriptomes of patients with non-infectious uveitis do not match those of these type I IFN dependent cDC2. The signature of patients is also not induced by type I IFN stimulation. We have clarified this in more detail in the result section.</p><p>Furthermore, we show that the CX3CR1-positive CD1c+ DCs in this study secreted similar levels of IL-23 and higher levels of TNF α and IL-6 than the CD36-CX3CR1- DC3 subsets after activation. Interestingly, this observation is in agreement with Villani et al. (Science 2017; PMID: 28428369) who observed that stimulated CD1c+CD36+ DC3s (CD1c_B population) produced more TNF α than CD36-DC3s (CD1c_A). Additionally, Brown et al. (Cell 2019) found that CX3CR1+ cDC2s produce more IL-6 and TNF-α than their CX3CR1-negative counterparts. Combined, our data on ex vivo stimulated cDC2s indicate that the secretome of activated DC3s in this study is consistent with previous findings. This has been added to the Discussion section. Hopefully, the reviewer will agree that these points do answer some questions, but further research is needed to fully understand these changes and their relation to the cause of non-infectious uveitis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript was difficult to read, largely because it is trying to accomplish too many goals, but also because the informatics techniques and external data sets were not described sufficiently for an average reader to readily evaluate the method and conclusions, and the conclusions were overstated throughout the paper. Overall, too many hypotheses were tested, alternative hypotheses were not considered/discussed. The data should probably be divided into at least 2 papers, one which explores the peripheral blood subsets more concretely, and one which attempts to elucidate a mechanisms by which low RUNX3 expression is associated with the genes expressed more highly in DC2s in the peripheral blood of uveitis patients.</p></disp-quote><p>We have rewritten sections to improve readability. We have provided more details on the analysis to accommodate readers without experience in computational analyses.

The rationale for depleting CD14 in the validation cohort is not clear and justified. CD14 expression on dendritic cells has been established in the literature (ex Duterte Immunity 2019). This reviewer wonders if a better flow of data would be to start with the current second cohort, CD14 depleted, ID the black module, realize that some genes discovered have been associated with CD14+DC3, then utilize a second cohort that includes CD14+CD1c+ cells to validate and expand the original gene set.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on the reviewer's recommendation, we started with the second cohort and re-ran all analyses.

We believe it is important to show that there is no enrichment for type I IFN signalling, but rather for signaling pathways that distinguish discrete subsets of CD1c+ DCs, which forms the basis for flow cytometry analysis. The Results section now summarizes the potential transcriptional regulation very briefly. Our hope is that the reviewer now considers this issue better taken care of within the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors claim to have found an inflammatory cell type, but the gene expression profile does not recapitulate inflammation-induced DC2 gene expression profile. Figure 3 attempts to shed mechanistic light but only opens more questions, like if viral infection in mice (figure 3A lower panel) and multiple inflammatory stimuli (figure 3C) induce a transcriptional program opposite what they are finding in these cells in the peripheral blood of uveitis patients, how are the cells identified in this paper likely relevant to eye inflammation?</p></disp-quote><p>CX3CR1+ DC3s produce more TNF α and IL-6, so they were regarded as “inflammatory” by us. However, we now believe that this is somewhat confusing, particularly regarding other subsets previously called &quot;inflammatory&quot;. The manuscript has been revised to remove this. Unlike type I IFN, this subset is associated with different transcriptional programming mediated by unknown molecular cues. CX3CR1+ cDC2s display a different gene profile than inflammatory (type I IFN) cDC2s in our study, which is consistent with previous studies in mice (PMID: 34526403). We have outlined in greater detail what we believe drives these cells in non-infectious uveitis in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Pro-inflammatory CD14+DC3 increased in blood in SLE patients, but according to authors interpretation, they find a similar cell type is decreased in peripheral blood in uveitis. The authors adhere to a possible explanation that these cells are trafficking to the eye, but by the same logic, SLE patients should have an even more significant reduction, not increase in their peripheral DC3 counts. This is not discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Our view is similar to the reviewer's that this line of reasoning is paradoxical. In the Discussion section, we have substantially revised the comparison of type I IFNs in SLE and signaling in dendritic cells of patients with non-infectious uveitis. Hopefully, the reviewer finds that the revised discussion adequately addresses this issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Even more importantly, the Chen et al. papers which are cited generally by the authors, showed the opposite- that CD1c+ DCs are increased in the blood of patients with uveitis, and correlate with disease activity. No attempt is made by the authors to compare their data with this data derived from a larger number of patients, or discuss the difference. The authors have essentially ignored this key discrepancy with previously published data.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that a comparison with Chen et al's previous work is warranted. Chen and colleagues attempted to quantify CD1c+ myeloid dendritic cells in their work, but CD11c wasn't used in their flow cytometry panel. Based on our data, this approach would include quantification of CD1c+ CD11c-negative cells as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>). If we include all CD1c+ populations (regardless of CD11c), we would have an overall increase in &quot;CD1c+ DCs&quot; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>) – similar to the conclusion by <italic>Chen et al.</italic> Even when CD11c is not considered in cluster analysis, however, CD1c+ CD11c- cells (cluster 46) do not cluster with our identified CD1c+ DCs, which indicates they may represent a different type of cell. In the Discussion section, we addressed this issue.

Despite changing some text around the hypothesis that this cell type is reduced in the blood because it migrates to the eye (numerically impossible as pointed out by prior reviewer #1), this notion is reiterated several other places in the paper and should be removed, and frankly, reconsidered. It is also possible that the change in peripheral blood cell type/state frequency results from cytokine-induced precursor emigration/differentiation. Perhaps there is actually a fraction of DC2-type cells that are increased in the blood in uveitis (as Chen found) but express the transcriptional program identified in the paper because they are pre-activated cells?</p></disp-quote><p>Based on the reviewer's suggestion in the Discussion section, we have adopted a hypothesis that cytokine-induced precursor emigration/differentiation may also contribute to the change in peripheral blood cell type/state frequency.

The analysis of ocular DC2s which concludes that the current cell type, CD14+DC3s with black module gene expression, are present in the eye is not convincing. The methods are not clearly explained, however it appears that rather than utilizing unbiased cluster analysis and performing differential gene expression analysis between the patients with non-infectious uveitis, and the control (endophthalmitis), or using another technique like GSEA which they used in previous figures to correlate the black module genes with the genes expressed by the ocular DC2s, the authors appear to have selected individual cells that expressed the black modules genes, then compared the expression of black module genes to the cells that did not express black module genes.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that a more unbiased cluster analysis of ocular CD1c+ dendritic cells would be more appropriate. Therefore, we reanalyzed the single cell RNA seq data and conducted cluster analysis of the CD1c+ DCs. Because we aimed to demonstrate that inflamed eyes of patients contain cells that express key genes associated with CX3CR1+ DC3s, we sorted single-cell RNA seq data for CD1c+ using CLEC10A as a classical tissue-cDC2 marker (Heger et al. Front Immunol. 2018), removing monocytes using C5AR1 (CD88- cells, according to Duterte et al. Immunity 2019, Bourdely et al. Immunity 2020). We then clustered cells and compared their gene expression for genes associated with CX3CR1+ DC3. Cluster 1 exhibits the pattern of expression we found in peripheral blood to be associated with CX3CR1+ DC3. We hope the reviewer agrees that CD1c+ DCs in eye fluid appear to cluster into distinct clusters, one of which has a gene profile of key genes that is reminiscent of CX3CR1+ DC3s.

We meant to say that while <italic>RUNX3</italic> was lower in patients with uveitis in RNA-seq data, stimulation of CD1c+ DCs from healthy controls with IFN-α did result in a decrease in <italic>RUNX3</italic> as support for that fact that IFN-α is unlikely causing the lower expression of <italic>RUNX3</italic> as observed by RNA-seq in uveitis patients. It has been changed to “Furthermore, while <italic>RUNX3</italic> was downregulated in RNA-seq data from CD1c+ DCs from non-infectious uveitis patients (Figure 1I), stimulation of CD1c+ DCs with from healthy human donors with IFN-α resulted in upregulation of <italic>RUNX3”.</italic> Our hope is that the reviewer will agree that this is a more appropriate formulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Sup figure 3 final panel should be G, not H.</p></disp-quote><p>This was a typo.
