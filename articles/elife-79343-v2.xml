and dynamics of proteins in intact tissues or whole animals is key to understanding protein function. However, to date, this is challenging, as the accessibility of large antibodies to dense tissues is often limited, and fluorescent proteins inserted close to a domain of interest may affect protein function. These complications apply in particular to muscle sarcomeres, arguably one of the most protein-dense assemblies in nature, which complicates studying sarcomere morphogenesis at molecular resolution. Here, we introduce a toolbox of nanobodies recognising various domains of the two <italic>Drosophila</italic> titin homologs, Sallimus and Projectin, as well as the key sarcomeric proteins Obscurin, α-Actinin, and Zasp52. We verified the superior labelling qualities of our nanobodies in muscle tissue as compared to antibodies. By applying our toolbox to larval muscles, we found a gigantic Sallimus isoform stretching more than 2 µm to bridge the sarcomeric I-band, while Projectin covers almost the entire myosin filaments in a polar orientation. Transgenic expression of tagged nanobodies confirmed their high affinity-binding without affecting target protein function. Finally, adding a degradation signal to anti-Sallimus nanobodies suggested that it is difficult to fully degrade Sallimus in mature sarcomeres; however, expression of these nanobodies caused developmental lethality. These results may inspire the generation of similar toolboxes for other large protein complexes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> or mammals.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Our muscles are not just for lifting weights. They also keep us alive. For example, our heartbeat is powered by the muscles in the heart wall. Just like other organs in the body, muscles are made up of cells called muscle fibres. Each muscle fibre is divided into many smaller units, or ‘sarcomeres’, which contain specialised proteins that pull on each other to produce muscle contractions.</p><p>Although the structure of mature muscles is rather well understood, we know much less about how muscles develop or how they are maintained throughout adult life. Understanding this is especially important in the case of the heart, because its muscle cells are not replaced throughout our lives. Instead, the heart muscle cells we are born with are maintained as we age while working continuously. This means that the proteins within the heart muscle sarcomeres are continuously under mechanical stress and may need to be repaired. How this repair might happen is not well understood.</p><p>Nanobodies are very small versions of antibodies that recognise and bind to specific protein targets. In biological research, they are used as a tool to observe proteins of interest within cells. This is done by labelling nanobodies, for example, with chemical fluorophores or fluorescent proteins; once labelled, the nanobody binds to its target protein, and scientists can monitor its location and behaviour within the cell. Cells, and even flies, can also be genetically manipulated to produce labelled nanobodies themselves, which has the advantage of visualising the dynamic behaviour of the target protein in the living cell or organism.</p><p>To better study the proteins in muscle cells, scientists from two different research groups developed a nanobody ‘toolbox’ that specifically targets sarcomere proteins. First, Loreau et al. made a ‘library’ of labelled nanobodies targeting different sarcomere proteins in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> fruit flies. Second, they used this library of nanobodies to locate several sarcomere proteins in the mature sarcomeres of different fly muscles. Third, using flies that had been genetically altered to produce the labelled nanobodies in their muscle cells, Loreau et al. were able to observe the behaviour of the target proteins in the living muscle. Together, these experiments showed that one protein in <italic>Drosophila</italic> that is similar to the human sarcomere protein titin has a similar size to the human version, whereas a second <italic>Drosophila</italic> titin-like protein is shorter and located at a different place in the sarcomere. Both of these proteins work together to stabilise muscle fibres, which is also the role of human titin.</p><p>The nanobodies generated here are a significant contribution to the tools available to study muscle development and maintenance. Loreau et al. hope that they will help reveal how sarcomere proteins like titin are maintained, especially in the heart, and ultimately how the heart muscle manages to continue working throughout our lives.</p></abstract><kwd-group

that power animal movements. Sarcomere morphology is remarkably conserved from fruit flies to humans: each sarcomere is bordered by two Z-discs that cross-link the plus-ends of parallel actin filaments, while their minus ends face towards the centrally located bipolar myosin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lange et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lemke and Schnorrer, 2017</xref>). Both filaments are stably linked by the gigantic titin spring protein, which in mammals binds with its N-terminus to α-actinin at the Z-disc and is embedded with its C-terminus at the M-band of the sarcomere. Thus, titin determines the length of the mammalian sarcomere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Linke, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Luis and Schnorrer, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tskhovrebova and Trinick, 2003</xref>).</p><p>As sarcomere architecture is well-conserved, <italic>Drosophila</italic> is an excellent model to study how a sarcomere is built during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Katzemich et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Katzemich et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Orfanos et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Weitkunat et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Weitkunat et al., 2014</xref>). Generation of monoclonal antibodies against <italic>Drosophila</italic> sarcomere proteins has been helpful to locate key proteins within the mature sarcomere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burkart et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ferguson et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Katzemich et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lakey et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Qiu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Szikora et al., 2020</xref>). However, to date, there is no comprehensive toolbox of antibodies recognising defined domains of the large sarcomeric proteins, in particular against defined domains of the two large <italic>Drosophila</italic> titin homologs, Sallimus (Sls) and Projectin (gene called <italic>bent</italic>, <italic>bt</italic>). Such tools would be valuable to study how the sarcomeric machine assembles during morphogenesis.</p><p>Recent gene-tagging approaches have generated a substantial number of <italic>Drosophila</italic> transgenic lines, each expressing one sarcomeric protein fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) at its C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sarov et al., 2016</xref>) or at a random internal position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buszczak et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kanca et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kelso et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nagarkar-Jaiswal et al., 2015</xref>). Nevertheless, a number of these tagged lines label only a subset of protein isoforms or result in homozygous loss of function phenotypes as the GFP-tagged protein cannot fully support the function of the endogenous protein in the dense sarcomeric environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">O’Donnell et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Orfanos and Sparrow, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Orfanos et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sarov et al., 2016</xref>). Hence, GFP tagging does not always provide an optimal solution to study the native dynamics of a sarcomeric protein.</p><p>These limitations motivated us to develop an alternative to antibodies and GFP-tagged lines for sarcomeric proteins. We chose the recent camelid nanobody technology because of the small size of the nanobodies (~4 nm, 12–15 kDa), their single-chain protein nature, and their potentially high affinity against target domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Muyldermans, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pleiner et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pleiner et al., 2015</xref>). As nanobodies can be used on fixed samples or fused to a fluorescent protein and expressed in living tissues, nanobodies are ideal tools to quantify the position and dynamics of sarcomeric proteins in their dense environment.</p><p>Thus far, the application of nanobodies to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> model has been largely restricted to commercially available GFP and mCherry nanobodies that allowed localisation, trapping, or degradation of GFP-tagged or mCherry-tagged proteins in <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ákos et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caussinus et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harmansa and Affolter, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harmansa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harmansa et al., 2015</xref>). Recently, nanobodies were used to locate <italic>Drosophila</italic> proteins tagged with short artificial nanotags (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vigano et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Xu et al., 2022</xref>). However, nanobodies that recognise endogenous <italic>Drosophila</italic> protein domains have not been reported.</p><p>Here we generated a nanobody toolbox against seven different epitopes of the two <italic>Drosophila</italic> titin homologs, Sallimus (Sls) and Projectin (Proj). Additionally, we raised nanobodies against two epitopes of the core M-band protein Obscurin and against epitopes of the key Z-disc proteins α-Actinin and Zasp52. We verified their specificity as well as their superior penetration and labelling efficiencies compared to antibodies. Applying our nanobodies to <italic>Drosophila</italic> muscle tissues confirmed the expression of different Sls isoforms in different muscle types and identified a gigantic more than 2-µm long Sls protein in larval muscles. It further showed that Projectin is bound to the myosin filament in a strictly polar fashion, resembling the mammalian titin homolog. It also revealed unexpected differences in Obscurin isoform expression in different muscle types.

This demonstrates the favourable diffusion properties of the small nanobodies in the very dense and crowded environment of adult flight muscles. Labelling of myofibrils in the past was often achieved on isolated myofibrils to improve antibody accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burkart et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Szikora et al., 2020</xref>), but myofibril isolation may change sarcomere mechanics and thus lead to unwanted mechanical or structural artefacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ayme-Southgate et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kulke et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>We further tested the labelling of muscles by our nanobodies in late stage 17 embryos, which have already deposited a larval cuticle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Moussian, 2010</xref>), impeding the penetration of large labels. In stage 16 embryos, we found the expected co-localisation of Sls-Nano2, with the anti-Sls antibody, as well as the co-localisation of Proj-Nano30 recognising Proj-Ig5-8 with an anti-Projectin antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A–C</xref>). Both Sls and Proj proteins are not yet displaying a striated pattern as sarcomeres have not yet been assembled at stage 16. While our nanobodies stained the body muscles of stage 17 embryos well, which displayed the striated pattern of the first formed sarcomeres, neither anti-Sls (anti-Kettin), Mhc, nor Projectin antibodies produced a good staining pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A–C</xref>).

Co-staining flight muscles with the Sls-Nano2, which recognises Sls-Ig13/14 close to the N-terminus of Sls, and the Sls-Nano42 recognising Sls-Ig51-Fn2 close to the C-terminus of Sls, revealed single and overlapping bands present at the sarcomeric Z-disc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). This pattern is expected since flight muscles contain a very short ~100 nm wide I-band (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burkart et al., 2007</xref>).

The same patterns were found with our other N- or C-terminal anti-Projectin nanobodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Hence, the anti-Projectin nanobodies established that Projectin is oriented linearly in flight muscles, with its N-terminus being closer to the Z-disc and its C-terminus facing the myosin filaments. Quantifying the precise positions of the Sls and Projectin domains bound by our nanobodies in flight muscles requires super-resolution microscopy, which is reported in an accompanying manuscript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schueder et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to flight muscles, <italic>Drosophila</italic> leg or larval muscles have longer I-bands, likely caused by the expression of longer Sls splice isoforms that include large parts of the flexible PEVK spring domains, making these muscles softer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burkart et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Spletter and Schnorrer, 2014</xref>). However, the precise positions of the N- and C-terminal ends of Sls in these muscle types remained to be determined. To address this open question, we prepared fixed adult hemithoraces and L3 larval fillets and stained leg or larval body muscles with nanobodies that recognise the N- or C-terminus of Sls. The Sls-Nano2 signal overlaps with the Z-disc in leg and larval muscles, similar to flight muscles. However, Sls-Nano42, which recognises the C-terminal portion of Sls-Ig51-Fn2, showed two distinct bands with larger distances in larval muscles compared to leg muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>).

Consistent with these reports, staining of adult leg or larval body muscles with nanobodies that recognise the N- and C-terminal portions of Projectin, Proj-Nano30, and Proj-Nano37, respectively, showed two large blocks, instead of sharp bands located on the myosin filaments in both adult leg and larval body muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>).

We wanted to verify this surprising finding and double stained larval muscles with additional combinations of N- and C-terminal Projectin nanobodies, namely Proj-Nano28 that recognises Proj-Fn1/2 with Proj-Nano34 that recognises the Projectin kinase domain and Proj-Nano29 that recognises Proj-Fn1/2 combined with Proj-Nano35 also recognising the kinase domain.

To test if our nanobodies could be engineered to induce degradation of Sallimus, we fused the same F-box as used for the GFP nanobodies (NSlmb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caussinus et al., 2011</xref>) to Sls-Nano2 and Sls-Nano42 and made transgenic flies with them under UAS control that we called UAS-Sls-Nano2-deGrad and UAS-Sls-Nano42-deGrad, respectively. When expressing Sls-Nano2-deGrad under <italic>Mef2</italic>-GAL4 control in larval muscles from embryonic stages onwards, we found in stainings that the fluorescent signal of labelled Sls-Nano2 (Ig13/14) was reduced by ~80% as compared to control larvae. However, staining with the anti-Kettin antibody (binding to the neighbouring Sls-Ig16) was less reduced, whereas C-terminal Sls-Nano39 showed a normal intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A and B</xref>). We interpret this pattern as Sls-Nano2-deGrad partially masking its epitope and as an incomplete, segment-wise degradation of Sallimus. The incompleteness of degradation can be explained by a stable sarcomeric assembly limiting the access of the proteasome and by the <italic>Mef2</italic> promoter (driving expression of the deGrad-Nanobody) being weaker than the Sallimus promoter in mature larval muscles.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Sls-Nano-deGrad <italic>in vivo</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Control (top) or Sls-Nano2-deGrad (bottom) expressing larval muscles stained with Sls-Nano2 (green), anti-Kettin (white), and Sls-Nano39 (magenta) and imaged with scanning confocal microscopy.

In addition, we observed a variable myofibril thickness in the few surviving Sls-Nano42-deGrad adults, which is never found in wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>), pointing to a specific defect in myofibril maturation that might be controlled by Sls availability.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Nanobodies as tools for developmental biology</title><p>Thus far, the application of nanobodies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> had been limited to nanobodies against fluorescent proteins or recently against short epitope tags (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caussinus et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harmansa and Affolter, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harmansa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harmansa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Xu et al., 2022</xref>). These former studies have shown that nanobodies against GFP can be used to trap secreted Dpp in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing disc and hence demonstrated the strong binding of nanobodies to their target also <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harmansa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harmansa et al., 2017</xref>). Here we demonstrated that the high affinity of nanobodies to their targets <italic>in vivo</italic> is not limited to the commercially available GFP nanobody that the fly community has extensively used in the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caussinus et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harmansa and Affolter, 2018</xref>). This is significant as many GFP fusion proteins do not retain full functionality, as reported not only for Dpp-GFP but also for sarcomeric proteins such as Mhc-GFP, Sls-GFP, or troponin-GFP fusion attempts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Matsuda et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Orfanos et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sarov et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>High affinity to the target epitopes is likely the case for most members of the here presented nanobody toolbox, as exemplified in detail for Sls-Nano2. Our FRAP data of Sls-Nano2-NeonGreen suggest that Sallimus is not mobile in a 30-min interval in mature larval sarcomeres. It will be interesting to extend these studies to longer time frames as mammalian titin was suggested to be surprisingly dynamic at least in <italic>in vitro</italic> cultured cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rudolph et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Nanobodies can also be engineered to induce the degradation or inactivation of the target protein <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caussinus et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nagarkar-Jaiswal et al., 2015</xref>). Our proof of principle experiments presented here suggests that this is likely also the case for the here developed Sls nanobodies when fused to a degradation signal. However, how sarcomeric proteins are turned over is still unclear. Given that sarcomeres are very dense structures that likely exclude most soluble proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">O’Donnell et al., 1989</xref>), it is hard to imagine how 26S proteasomes can gain access. Another challenge is how to degrade a protein as large as Sallimus. A significant force would be required to pull it out of its sarcomeric anchorage since Sls is bound to the Z-disc at one end and to the thick filament at the other. It is thus perhaps not surprising that targeting a single degron to Sallimus does not suffice for a complete degradation. The induced lethality during pupal stages, however, suggests some dramatic consequences during adult muscle development that need further analysis.</p><p>Nanobodies were also used as conditional blockers of their target domains, such as blocking the kinase domain of estimated glomerular filtration rate in cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tabtimmai et al., 2019</xref>), even without a degradation signal. Hence, the here generated nanobody toolbox is a first step towards a modulation of Sls or Projectin domain activity <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>The small size of nanobodies not only allows superior penetration into tissues as shown here for late-stage <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos or thick flight muscle tissue but also places possible labels very close to their target epitopes. This is relevant for super-resolution microscopy that can resolve the target location with a precision better than 5 nm resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ostersehlt et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schnitzbauer et al., 2017</xref>) or for cryo-electron-tomography, with which the native structure of titin in the sarcomere might be resolvable in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). High labelling density and proximity of the label to the target are key to identify the nature of unknown protein densities in tomograms. Hence, our toolbox should not only provide a resource to mechanistically study the function of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> sarcomeric proteins in more detail in the future but may also inspire the <italic>Drosophila</italic> community to invest more into the generation of nanobodies, instead of generating antibodies by default.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>A <italic>Drosophila</italic> titin and sarcomere nanobody toolbox</title><p>We introduced here the generation and characterisation of 22 different nanobodies that were raised against 11 different target domains, three are present in Sls and four in Projectin, two in Obscurin and one each in α-Actinin and Zasp52. We characterised their specificity in embryonic and larval muscles and verified that nanobodies are indeed well suited to diffuse into dense muscle tissues. They even label muscles of late stage embryos, which are impermeable to antibodies because of their chitin skeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Moussian, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Staining larval, leg and flight muscles with our nanobodies confirmed the existence of different Sls, Projectin and Obscurin isoforms in the different muscle types. The stiff flight muscles do contain a short version of Sls, which does not allow to resolve the N- and C-terminal ends of Sls using confocal microscopy. This was only possible by using super-resolution microscopy with our here developed nanobodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schueder et al., 2023</xref>). Larval muscles express a novel shorter Obscurin isoform missing the N-terminal SH3 and RhoGEF domains.</p><p>Our data suggest that most of the Sls isoforms present in flight muscles do contain the C-terminal Sls-Ig51-Fn2 domains. This is consistent with developmental transcriptomics results that included splice isoform annotations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Spletter et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Spletter et al., 2018</xref>), and the very low expression of a Sls isoform that uses an early alternative stop codon, which is rather expressed in leg muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sarov et al., 2016</xref>). This is significant as the initially proposed short Sls isoform named Kettin is not supposed to contain the C-terminal Sls-Ig51-Fn2 domains and hence would not bridge across the thin I-band of flight muscles to the myosin filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burkart et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lakey et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Szikora et al., 2020</xref>). Our new nanobodies now clarify that most Sls isoforms have at least the potential to bridge to the myosin filament in flight muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schueder et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Similarly, our Projectin nanobodies verified the defined orientation of elongated Projectin in flight muscle sarcomeres with its N-terminus facing the Z-disc and its C-terminal kinase domain oriented towards the centre of myosin filament. In the accompanying manuscript, these tools enabled the determination of the precise position of the Projectin ends in the flight muscles using super-resolution microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schueder et al., 2023</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>A long stretched Sls isoform in larval muscle</title><p>Larval muscles are considered soft compared to stiff flight muscles. This is consistent with their large dynamic length range: larval sarcomeres have a relaxed length of about 8.5 µm and can contract up to about 4.5 µm. In contrast, flight muscle sarcomeres only contract 3.5% of their length during flight, about 120 nm (measured in <italic>Drosophila virilis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chan and Dickinson, 1996</xref>). Consistent with this, the I-band of relaxed larval muscles is long, about 2 µm. Hence, our finding that Sls has a length of more than 2 µm in relaxed larval muscles is only logical, considering that Sls needs to elastically bridge from the Z-disc to the myosin filament. However, this finding still comes as a significant surprise, since the mammalian titin is considered to be the ‘longest’ protein in the animal kingdom; however, it is ‘only’ 1.5 µm long in 3 µm long relaxed human sarcomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Linke, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Llewellyn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Regev et al., 2011</xref>). Mammalian titin is certainly the largest protein by molecular weight (up to 3800 kDa) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brynnel et al., 2018</xref>), whereas the longest predicted <italic>Drosophila</italic> Sls isoform has a mass of ‘only’ 2100 kDa. The long extension of Sls found here makes it likely that Sls is under strong mechanical tension in larval muscles, and hence its long PEVK spring domains are likely unfolded to allow bridging of the long I-band in the relaxed state of the larval muscle (model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). Such, <italic>Drosophila</italic> Sls may store a significant amount of energy for the next round of muscle contraction, purely by unfolding its PEVK domains and not necessarily needing to unfold any of its Ig domains, the latter has recently been suggested for mammalian titin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rivas-Pardo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rivas-Pardo et al., 2020</xref>). Hence, our data identify that insect Sls might indeed be one of the ‘longest’ proteins naturally occurring in animals, a truly deserving member of the titin protein family. Similarly, long titin family members with extensive elastic domains were also found in the claw muscles of crayfish (as <italic>Drosophila</italic> an arthropod) that contain extensively long sarcomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fukuzawa et al., 2001</xref>). Importantly, also <italic>C. elegans</italic> contains a Sallimus homolog called TTN-1. TTN-1 is a 2 MDa protein that spans across the I-band and was thus also suggested to mechanically link the Z-disc to the myosin filaments in <italic>C. elegans</italic> body muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Forbes et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>A defined orientation of Projectin on myosin filaments</title><p>In contrast to Sls, Projectin does not locate in a sharp band in larval or leg muscles, but rather as a broad block, which had been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lakey et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Saide et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vigoreaux et al., 1991</xref>). Our data revealed here that the N- and C-terminal ends of Projectin display slightly shifted localisations, with the C-terminus located closer to the M-band compared to the N-terminus. This strongly suggests that each Projectin protein has a defined orientation on the myosin filament (model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). Currently, it remains unclear if neighbouring Projectin molecules overlap or if they are arrayed in a linear way to decorate the thick filament, similar to how the mammalian titin protein is supposed to decorate it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tonino et al., 2017</xref>). If they do not overlap much, about eight or nine ~250-nm long Projectin molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schueder et al., 2023</xref>) would be needed to bridge half the myosin filament. This is consistent with the theoretical length of a chain of about 70 folded Ig and Fn domains, each about 4 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mayans et al., 2001</xref>). Super-resolution imaging of larval muscles using the here generated nanobodies will be needed to answer this interesting question.</p><p>The fact that Projectin decorates the entire thick filament of likely all <italic>Drosophila</italic> muscles, except indirect flight muscles, has the interesting consequence that the Projectin kinase is also located along the entire thick filament. The same is true for the <italic>C. elegans</italic> Projectin homolog called Twitchin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Forbes et al., 2010</xref>), so <italic>Drosophila</italic> Projectin is not the exception. Titin kinases, including the Projectin kinase, are possibly modulated by mechanical stretch: an inhibitory C-terminal tail needs to be pulled out of the kinase domain to allow kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gautel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gräter et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kobe et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lange et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, the larval muscle localisation of Projectin would allow it to respond to stretch with kinase activation along the entire thick filament, and not only at the M-band as is the case for mammalian muscle. Hence, it will be interesting to test if the Projectin kinase activity is required for sarcomere formation or function. Thus far, this has been tested in <italic>C. elegans</italic>: a kinase-dead variant of Twitchin results in normal sarcomere morphology but abnormally strong muscle contractions that lead to an evolutionary disadvantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Matsunaga et al., 2017</xref>). The <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval muscles would be a good model to further investigate the role of this evolutionally conserved kinase domain, and our here generated nanobodies, four of which target the Projectin kinase domain might be a valuable tool for such future studies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

Next, we used Swissmodel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Waterhouse et al., 2018</xref>) to predict domain borders for stably folding fragments. These fragments were then codon-optimised for expression in <italic>E. coli</italic> and cloned into a His14-bdSUMO fusion vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Frey and Görlich, 2014a</xref>).

Bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 50 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 20 mM imidazole/HCl pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, and lysed by a freeze-thaw cycle followed by sonication. The lysate was cleared by ultracentrifugation in a T645 rotor (Thermo) at 35,000 rpm for 90 min. Purification by Ni(II) chelate capture and elution with 100 nM of the tag-cleaving bdSENP1 protease was as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frey and Görlich, 2014b</xref>). One hundred micrograms of each antigen (in phosphate-buffered saline [PBS]) were used per immunisation with 200 µl Fama as an adjuvant (Gerbu #3030), following two pre-immunisations with myofibrils isolated from flight muscles of 500 adult flies.</p><p>Blood sampling, lymphocyte isolation, and construction of an M13 phage display library were done as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pleiner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pleiner et al., 2018</xref>). Phage display itself was performed with 1 nM biotinylated baits immobilised to streptavidin magnetic beads. Selected clones were sequenced in a 96-well format. Coding sequences were cloned for expression into H<sub>14</sub>-NEDD8 or His<sub>14</sub>-ScSUMO vectors, with ectopic cysteines at N- and C-termini of the nanobody. The here described nanobody expression constructs are listed in the Material availability statement at the end of the Methods section and are available at Addgene (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.addgene.org/Dirk_Gorlich/">https://www.addgene.org/Dirk_Gorlich/</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Nanobody expression, purification, and labelling</title><p>Nanobodies were expressed in NEB Shuffle Express, which allows the structural disulphide bond to be (partially) formed. Bacteria were grown initially in 5-l flasks containing 250 ml TB medium supplemented with 50 µg/ml kanamycin and 0.5% glucose overnight at 37 °C to stationary phase (OD<sub>600</sub> ~10). The cultures were then shifted to 21 °C, diluted with 500 ml fresh medium, and induced 20 min later with 100 µM IPTG for 4 hr.</p><p>Bacteria were pelleted and resuspended in 50 ml sonication buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 20 mM imidazole/HCl pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM reduced glutathione [GSH], 2.5 mM oxidised glutathione [GSSG]). Lysis was done by one freeze-thaw cycle followed by sonication and ultracentrifugation as described above. The lysates were then either frozen in aliquots and stored at –80 °C until further use or used directly for large-scale purification. For the latter, 30 ml of lysate was bound at 4 °C to 2 ml Ni(II) matrix; the matrix was extensively washed with sonication buffer, followed by protease buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 20 mM imidazole/HCl pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM GSH, 5% w/v glycerol). Elution was done with 50 nM ScUlp1 in protease buffer overnight at 4 °C or for 2 hr at room temperature (RT). Typical yields range between 10 and 50 mg nanobody per litre of culture.</p><p>For labelling, we used two different strategies. For in-solution-labelling, we reduced prepurified nanobodies for 5 min with 20 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) on ice. Then, free DTT was removed by gelfitration on a Nap5 Sephadex G25 column (Cytiva) equilibrated and degassed in 50 mM potassium phosphate pH 6.8, 300 mM NaCl, and 1 mM imidazole (using a sample volume not exceeding 400 µl). Fluorophore-maleimides were dissolved to 10 mM in dimethylformamide, used in ~50% excess over cysteines to be labelled and pipetted into Eppendorf tubes (placed on ice) before the reduced nanobodies were added. The labelling reaction is fast and typically completed within a few minutes. Free fluorophore was then removed by gel filtration on a Nap5 column, equilibrated in 50 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol (for nanobodies with a negative net charge), or with 100 mM potassium phosphate pH 6.8, 10% glycerol (for nanobodies with a positive net charge). For storage at 4 °C, 0.05% sodium azide was added. Long-term storage was at –80 °C.</p><p>Quality control was done by SDS-PAGE. For most fluorophores, unlabelled, single, and double labelled nanobodies are well resolved, which allows for assessing the completeness of the labelling reaction (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Fluorescence images were acquired from unstained/unfixed gels with a Fuji FLA-9000 system. Concentrations of nanobody, fluorophore, and density of labelling were measured photometrically at 280 nm and at the absorption maximum of the used fluorophore. Extinction coefficient of the nanobody at 280 nm was deduced from its amino acid composition and used to calculate the protein concentration, also considering the cross-absorbance of the fluorophore at 280 nm. Extinction coefficients of the fluorophores at 280 nm and the absorption maximum were taken from the respective suppliers.</p><p>Alternatively, nanobodies were labelled while bound as His<sub>14</sub>-ScSUMO or His<sub>14</sub>NEDD8 fusions to a Ni(II) chelate matrix. The matrix should be resistant to reduction by DTT. We used here a homemade matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goerlich and Frey, 2015</xref>); however, the cOmplete His-Tag purification matrix from Roche was working equally well. In brief, 30 µl Ni beads were slightly overloaded with nanobody, typically by binding 650 µl lysate to them (this usually requires titration). The beads were then washed three times in 650 µl sonication buffer; the ectopic cysteines were reduced by a 5-min incubation at 0 °C with 20 mM DTT, 50 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, and 15 mM imidazole pH 7.5. The beads were then washed twice with degassed prelabelling buffer (50 mM potassium phosphate pH 6.8, 15 mM imidazole/HCl pH 7.0, 300 mM NaCl). Two hundred microlitres of labelling solution (100–200 µM fluorophore in 50 mM potassium phosphate pH 6.8, 1 mM imidazole/HCl pH 7.0, 300 mM NaCl) was added; the beads were shaken for 20 min at 0–4 °C, washed twice in prelabelling buffer, once in cleavage buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 20% glycerol), and finally eluted with 100 µl 50 nM ScUlp1 (in cleavage buffer) overnight at 4 °C. The eluates typically contained 100 µM labelled nanobody and 50 nM was typically used for stainings.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Biolayer interferometry (BLI)</title><p>BLI experiments were performed using High Precision Streptavidin biosensors and an Octet RED96e instrument (ForteBio/Sartorius) at 25 °C with PBS pH 7.4, 0.02% (w/v) Tween-20 and 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin as assay buffer. Sls-Nano2, modified via one N-terminal and one C-terminal ectopic cysteine with two Biotin-PEG<sub>3</sub>-Maleimide molecules (Iris Biotech), was bound at 0.6 µg/ml concentration to the sensors until a wavelength shift/binding signal of 0.4 nm was reached. After one washing step in buffer, the biosensors were dipped into wells containing a concentration series of the Sls-Ig13/14 domains to measure the association rate and then incubated with assay buffer for dissociation. Data were reference-subtracted, and curves were fitted globally with a 1:1 binding model (Octet Data Analysis HT 12.0 software).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Myofibril isolation for immunisation</title><p>We hand-dissected indirect flight muscles from 1000 adult wild-type flies from the Luminy strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leonte et al., 2021</xref>) in two batches of 500 each. To dissect, we cut away wings, head, and abdomen and separated the thoraces into two halves along the midline using small dissection scissors (#15009–08 Fine Science Tools) and placed them into relaxing solution (100 mM NaCl, 20 mM NaP<sub>i</sub> pH 7.2, 6 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM ATP, 0.5% Triton X-100, complete protease inhibitor cocktail [Merck, Sigma #11697498001]) with 50% glycerol for a few minutes under the dissection scope. We then cut and scooped out the flight muscles, without taking gut or jump muscles using scissors and fine forceps (#11252–20 Dumont#5, Fine Science Tools). We collected flight muscles from 500 flies in one tube in relaxing buffer plus 50% glycerol and left them up to 24 hr at –20 °C. Then, we spun the myofibrils down at 200 g and washed the pellet with relaxing buffer without glycerol. The purified myofibrils were then frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C until used for alpaca immunisation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Fly strains and genetics</title><p>Fly stocks were maintained under standard culture conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avellaneda et al., 2021</xref>).

Flies were allowed to lay overnight, and the next day, the embryos were collected and aged for at least another 8 hr at 27 °C. For fixation, embryos were dechorionated in 50% bleach for 2–3 min and then fixed for 20 min with a 1:1 mixture of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA in fresh PBS) and heptane in glass tubes on a shaker at RT. To free the embryos from the vitelline membrane, the fixative (lower phase) was removed with a glass pipette, one volume of methanol (MeOH) was added, and the tube was shaken vigorously. Dechorionated embryos sank to the bottom and were washed 3× with MeOH.

After washing once with PBS-T, the thoraces were placed on a slide with double-sticky tape with the head position facing the sticky tape and cut sagittally with a microtome blade (Pfm Medical Feather C35). Hemithoraces were stained with fluorescent nanobodies and rhodamine-phalloidin (1:1000 Molecular Probes) for 2 hr at RT or overnight at 4 °C. Hemithoraces were washed twice with PBS-T, mounted in SlowFadeTM Gold Antifade (Thermo Fisher) using two coverslips as spacers, and flight or leg muscles were imaged with a Zeiss LSM880 confocal microscope using a 63× objective.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Analysing antibody versus nanobody labelling intensity decay over depth</title><p>We manually drew selections with Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>) on stacks obtained with confocal imaging; each selection consisted of one myofibril. We used these selections to extract intensity profiles that were then analysed automatically using Python custom codes. The automated analysis to extract the intensity of each band consisted of the following: (a) locate bands in profiles using the peak finding algorithm find_peaks from the Scipy library; (b) subtract background on the profile, linear fitting the 35% lowest values of the profile and subtracting this fit on the profile; (c) fit bands on the background-corrected profile with Gaussian functions; and (d) estimate the area under the curve of these fits. This initial analysis allowed us to estimate the integrated intensity of bands of Obscurin-GFP and epitopes labelled with the Kettin (Sls-Ig16) antibody and Sls-Nano2 (Sls-Ig13/14) nanobody. To estimate how fast intensity decays with depth in the confocal z-stacks, for each animal, we fitted an exponential decay function to the averaged band intensity over each selection (a myofibril) versus the depth where it was imaged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). The decay lengths obtained were then reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>. In our imaging conditions, the decay of intensity with the depth of GFP was higher than the one of Sls-Nano2, likely caused by faster bleaching of GFP compared to the Alexa488 dye when acquiring a z-stack.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Dissection and staining of larval muscles</title><p>To perform antibody or nanobody stainings of larval muscles, L3 larvae were collected with a brush and placed at 4 °C.

Pinned larvae were dissected with sharp scissors from the dorsal side in HL3 buffer, and interior organs (gut and fat body) were removed with forceps. The remaining larval fillets were fixed in 4% PFA in PBS-T for 30 min and then blocked in 4% normal goat serum for 30 min at RT on a shaker.

First, confocal images of larval muscle were corrected for background: for this purpose, we selected an area of about 10 × 10 µm in the image without myofibrils and estimated the average pixel intensity. This value was then subtracted from the image. Second, to estimate the relative amount of nanobodies, we positioned rectangular selections encompassing regions of sarcomeres labelled by nanobodies, from which we extracted the average intensity and repeated this to have 100 selections. The rectangular selections had the same size in all measurements to ensure reproducibility.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Generation of <italic>UAS-Nano-mNeonGreen</italic> transgenic flies</title><p>To clone <italic>UAS-Sls-Nano2-NeonGreen</italic>, we linearised pUAST-attB with EcoRI and inserted mNeonGreen by Gibson Assembly (Gibson Assembly) after amplification of mNeonGreen with 5′-<named-content content-type="sequence">ACTCTGAATAGGGAATTGGGAATTC</named-content>-3′ and 5′-<named-content content-type="sequence">CGGCCGCAGATCTGTTAAC</named-content>-3′ primers.

The Pylon viewer software from Basler was used to control acquisition, and exposure time was adjusted for enhanced contrast. The assays were repeated at least two times for each genotype, with assays done on different days. The videos were analysed using FIMTrack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Risse et al., 2017</xref>), and data were visualized via Python.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Live imaging of larval muscles</title><p>To quantify Sls-Nano2 localisation <italic>in vivo</italic>, we crossed <italic>UAS-Sls-Nano2-NeonGreen</italic> flies with <italic>Mef2-</italic>GAL4 and collected L3 larvae. To reduce the movement of the living larvae, larvae were anaesthetised for 5 min with diethyl ether (Aldrich) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kakanj et al., 2020</xref>) and then mounted in 10 S halocarbon oil. Larvae were imaged with an Olympus spinning disc confocal microscope with a 60 × objective. Photobleaching was performed with a 488 nm laser (Rapp-opto), and recovery was quantified for 30 min. Regions of interest (20 × 10 µm) inside the bleached area, in the non-bleached area, or outside the muscle as background were selected, and their intensities were measured at each time point. To calculate the ratio of FRAP, the intensity of the bleached area background subtracted was divided by the intensity in the non-bleached area background subtracted.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Materials availability statement</title><p>Newly generated code is publicly available here: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/PierreMangeol/titin_PAINT">https://github.com/PierreMangeol/titin_PAINT</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Loreau, 2022</xref> copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/swh:1:dir:7cf858f54cace3efa40b555fcae4b5cac732a875;origin=https://github.com/PierreMangeol/titin_PAINT;visit=swh:1:snp:71531abc5244f43f3577dca505ff3fe5e18dc76f;anchor=swh:1:rev:95e2ac29f658f8fca2435d93ab3c6326c786047d">swh:1:rev:95e2ac29f658f8fca2435d93ab3c6326c786047d</ext-link>) <italic>E. coli</italic> nanobody expression vectors are available from Addgene (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.addgene.org/Dirk_Gorlich/">https://www.addgene.org/Dirk_Gorlich/</ext-link>).

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A nanobody toolbox to investigate localisation and dynamics of <italic>Drosophila</italic> titins&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 4 peer reviewers, including Michel Labouesse as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Hidde L Ploegh (Reviewer #2); Guy M Benian (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential evisions:</p><p>The three external reviewers for each of your two manuscripts, along with myself as a guest editor, are overall supportive of your work. We think that you are introducing interesting tools, although one of the reviewers thinks that you overemphasized the novelty of nanobodies as an approach. The model you propose for sarcomere localization of the titin-like fly homologs Sallimus and Projectin is interesting and should inspire further work.</p><p>That being said, after exchanging views among the reviewers, we feel that there is probably too much redundancy between the two manuscripts in terms of methods and overall conclusions.</p><p>1) We suggest that you merge both manuscripts. This would allow you to show that your data are consistent among the two different muscle types (leg muscle and flight muscle), with an overlap in localization of the C-term of Sls with the N-term of Projectin at the outer edge of the A-band. The generation of the nanobodies and their ability to penetrate tissues would be described only once.</p><p>2) In terms of additional experiments, we ask that you use a nanobody-GFP to determine whether the expression of the nanobody fused to mNeonGreen in muscle might affect muscle function or affect the behavior of the fusion. You could easily test this by performing some sort of motility assays on the larva and determine whether muscle sarcomere structure is affected after immunostaining with various marker antibodies. Alternatively, you could use the nanobody-GFP to follow the course of a contraction/relaxation cycle in vivo. When reorganizing your manuscripts into a single one, please give better credit to the <italic>C. elegans</italic> muscle field (as requested by one reviewer), and generally attend to other comments formulated by the reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Comments:</p><p>Please further prove that your nanobodies can be used in functional tools, along the lines that you outlined in the discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The discussion mentions a number of possible nanobody applications (lines 347-354), none of which are pursued in this manuscript. References to reviews (of which there are quite a few) that describe such applications would therefore be sufficient.</p><p>I found the writing to be rather imprecise/sloppy and ambiguous in places. Excess verbiage such as non-essential adjectives and adverbs should be removed wherever possible. In general, the overuse of gerunds is to be discouraged, as is the repeated use of 'toolbox'. The logical conjunction 'and' should not be used to string disparate clauses together.</p><p>To avoid lab jargon, the correct descriptor of nanobodies should include the prefix 'anti'. Therefore: anti-Projectin nanobodies' instead of &quot;Projectin nanobodies'. The authors should decide on using either 'N-term 'or 'N-terminus', 'C-term' or 'C-terminus' and be consistent throughout the manuscript. I don't think the term 'N-terminal nanobody' or 'C-terminal nanobody' can be used as shorthand for a 'nanobody that recognizes the N- or C-terminal segment of …' I have corrected this for a number of occurrences but gave up after a while.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have only a few suggestions for this really excellent, timely, and innovative study and report. First, there should be more rationale given for their approach to generating the nanobodies. For example, the authors should state why Alpacas vs. some other animal species like rabbit or goat were chosen, and more importantly, why did they first immunize with flight muscle myofibrils before immunizing with the various recombinantly expressed domains? What was the reason for not just simply immunizing with the domains? Second, the authors mention several times that their staining of various muscle types confirmed the existence of different Sallimus and Projectin isoforms in different muscle types. Could they confirm this idea by performing western blots with at least some of their nanobodies? I know that doing western blots for such large polypeptides is challenging, but it can be done, especially with lower percentage acrylamide gels or even agarose gels as has been done for mammalian titin. However, I would not require this data in the current manuscript. Just saying that it would be nice to see at least some of this, and would also demonstrate the utility of nanobodies for western detection; indeed with their higher affinities, perhaps detection levels are also enhanced, compared to use of conventional antibodies. Third, in addition to my comment in the Public Review about the authors ignoring work in other invertebrates especially <italic>C. elegans</italic>, in the Discussion, the authors make an interesting comment regarding Projectin, &quot;Hence, it will be interesting to resolve in the future if the kinase activity is required for sarcomere formation or function.&quot; At the risk of tooting my lab's own work, we have already investigated this question for twitchin (Projectin) in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. In Matsunaga et al. (2017), we used CRISPR to gene edit the twitchin gene so that it expressed a full-length abundant twitchin in which the protein kinase domain had been rendered catalytically inactive. These worms have normal sarcomere structure but move faster and contract more than wild type worms, suggesting that the normal function of the catalytic activity of twitchin kinase is to inhibit muscle activity.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Authors test the specificities of their Nanobodies in late embryos using muscle-specific RNAi attenuation of sls and bent. Among them, Sls-Nano2 is expected to detect both short and long Sls isoforms whereas Sls-Nano39 and Sls-Nano42 only the long ones. Staining of all of them is strongly reduced in Sls-RNAi context. What could be interesting to test is:</p><p>i) Whether nanobodies directed to the same protein region (here Sls C-term rich of Ig repeats) have similar efficacy and specificity of detection.</p><p>ii) Whether the expression of short Sls isoform detected by the Sls-Nano2 and potentially not overlapping with Projectin could be specific for developmental stages before the sarcomere assembly.</p><p>One potential application of Nanobodies is their use in following native proteins in vivo. Because proteins tagged with GFP are often functionally affected it would be of interest to test whether the functionality of proteins to which Nonobodies bind is preserved. Here authors could test whether Sls-Nano2NeoGreen expressed in muscle has an impact or not on Sls muscle function.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79343.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The three external reviewers for each of your two manuscripts, along with myself as a guest editor, are overall supportive of your work.

To substantiate this, we have largely expanded the here presented nanobody toolbox paper. We have added 10 additional new nanobodies against different domains of the key sarcomeric proteins Obscurin, α-Actinin and Zasp52 to make the resource more complete. As α-Actinin and Zasp52 are not muscle specific, we expect these nanobodies to be used by the wide community of <italic>Drosophila</italic> epithelial biologists. We have further included the detailed characterisations of the Sls-Nano2-NeonGreen expressing larval muscles and have generated additional Nanobody-NeonGreen fusion fly strains. Finally, we provide a first analysis of two Sls nanobodies tagged with a deGrad degradation signal in vivo. This shows an interesting modification of parts of the Sls protein in vivo.</p><p>Furthermore, to remove redundancy, we have moved the nanobody penetration data in flight muscles from the PAINT paper to this toolbox paper and also moved almost all the confocal analysis to the toolbox paper, as requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) We suggest that you merge both manuscripts.

We only left a basic Figure 1 in the DNA-PAINT manuscript to be able to understand it for the reader as a stand-alone paper.</p><p>We want to briefly reiterate why the nanobody toolbox resource paper should stand on its own:</p><p>1. It now reports the generation of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> sarcomere protein nanobody resource (22 different nanobodies against 11 different epitopes) – we would like to remind the reviewers that not a single nanobody against a fly protein domain has been published to date. Thus, our effective pipeline should inspire future work in various directions for the large fly community. The anti-α-Actinin and Zasp52 nanobodies will be applicable to many different tissues, in particular epithelial tissues.</p><p>In this paper, we do include all data from all three muscle types, larval, leg and flight muscles, so these data are not spread over the 2 papers (in particular after including most of Figures1 and 2 from the PAINT paper in the revised toolbox papers, thanks for suggesting this).</p><p>2. We demonstrate the superior labelling and penetration efficiencies of our nanobodies compared to antibodies in embryonic and flight muscles.</p><p>3. The paper shows that nanobodies against fly proteins (and not only against GFP) can be used to live image the dynamics of the target protein. Biologically, this shows that Sallimus (fly I-band titin) once incorporated into the sarcomere is not mobile anymore. This contrasts publications in cultured cardiomyocytes that suggested rather fast mobility of mammalian titin, likely because of the limited sarcomere maturation in vitro (PMID 31757849). Hence, we provide an important finding relevant for sarcomere homeostasis.</p><p>We now also show data that larval crawling speed and larval muscle structure is not affected by the nanobody expression, thanks for suggesting these important controls.</p><p>4. We further show that both Sallimus and Projectin are needed for their striated localisation as soon as sarcomeres form in late-stage embryos. Although this was assumed before, it was never shown, as Sls or Projection mutants die as embryos and staining of latestate embryos is hardly feasible with traditional antibodies. However, only late stage 17 embryos do show striated muscles. Again, an important finding for the fly muscle field that is relevant to the mammalian field too, as it suggests that only Sallimus together with Projectin can fulfil the mammalian titin function.</p><p>5. Using the nanobodies, we found that Sls protein is extending over more than 2 µm in relaxed larval muscle to reach the myosin filament (longer than the 1.5µm of the long human titin isoform!). This is a significant finding as the <italic>Drosophila</italic> titins were always considered too short to act as bona fide ruler proteins. We now cite a paper from crab muscle showing that <italic>Drosophila</italic> is not the exception and thus hopefully our findings will convince the mammalian muscle community that Sls and Projectin are true functional homologs of mammalian titin.</p><p>6. Furthermore, using our nanobodies, we found that Projectin is incorporated in a polar orientation into the thick filament. Together, with its essential role to form a striated larval sarcomere this finding is stressing the functional homology of the fly titin homologs with the single mammalian titin homolog once more. It may also open a new way of thinking how thick filament length is controlled outside of vertebrate muscle. This should finally convince the mammalian field that Sls and Projectin are functional titin homologs.</p><p>7. Finally, our first proof of principle data on the Sls-nanobody-deGrad fusions open interesting new avenues for future experiments during sarcomere development and sarcomere homeostasis that we are not able to fully extent here in this resource manuscript.</p><p>Together, we think these findings are justifying an <italic>eLife</italic> resource paper. In any case, if a back-to-back publication of the two manuscripts in <italic>eLife</italic> is not accepted, then we will move with both to another Journal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In terms of additional experiments, we ask that you use a nanobody-GFP to determine whether the expression of the nanobody fused to mNeonGreen in muscle might affect muscle function or affect the behavior of the fusion. You could easily test this by performing some sort of motility assays on the larva and determine whether muscle sarcomere structure is affected after immunostaining with various marker antibodies. Alternatively, you could use the nanobody-GFP to follow the course of a contraction/relaxation cycle in vivo. When reorganizing your manuscripts into a single one, please give better credit to the <italic>C. elegans</italic> muscle field (as requested by one reviewer), and generally attend to other comments formulated by the reviewers.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for these valuable suggestions, we have done these experiments and text changes. We detail these changes below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Comments:</p><p>Please further prove that your nanobodies can be used in functional tools, along the lines that you outlined in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>As explained above we have now included additional nanobodies that will be of general use outside of the muscle community and provide new data showing that the NeonGreen nanobody fusions are valuable tools as well as show data on the nanobody deGrad fusion, which result in interesting loss of function phenotypes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The discussion mentions a number of possible nanobody applications (lines 347-354), none of which are pursued in this manuscript. References to reviews (of which there are quite a few) that describe such applications would therefore be sufficient.</p><p>I found the writing to be rather imprecise/sloppy and ambiguous in places. Excess verbiage such as non-essential adjectives and adverbs should be removed wherever possible. In general, the overuse of gerunds is to be discouraged, as is the repeated use of 'toolbox'. The logical conjunction 'and' should not be used to string disparate clauses together.</p><p>To avoid lab jargon, the correct descriptor of nanobodies should include the prefix 'anti'. Therefore: anti-Projectin nanobodies' instead of &quot;Projectin nanobodies'. The authors should decide on using either 'N-term 'or 'N-terminus', 'C-term' or 'C-terminus' and be consistent throughout the manuscript. I don't think the term 'N-terminal nanobody' or 'C-terminal nanobody' can be used as shorthand for a 'nanobody that recognizes the N- or C-terminal segment of …' I have corrected this for a number of occurrences but gave up after a while.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the energy of this reviewer to change and improve our writing style. We went through all the suggestions and mostly included them. Thanks for this extensive effort. We hope this reviewer will appreciate our revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I have only a few suggestions for this really excellent, timely, and innovative study and report. First, there should be more rationale given for their approach to generating the nanobodies. For example, the authors should state why Alpacas vs. some other animal species like rabbit or goat were chosen, and more importantly, why did they first immunize with flight muscle myofibrils before immunizing with the various recombinantly expressed domains? What was the reason for not just simply immunizing with the domains?</p></disp-quote><p>As we have injected all the domains into the same alpaca. We rationalised that a base immunisation against all the abundant <italic>Drosophila</italic> proteins can be advantageous. We have added a sentence in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, the authors mention several times that their staining of various muscle types confirmed the existence of different Sallimus and Projectin isoforms in different muscle types. Could they confirm this idea by performing western blots with at least some of their nanobodies? I know that doing western blots for such large polypeptides is challenging, but it can be done, especially with lower percentage acrylamide gels or even agarose gels as has been done for mammalian titin. However, I would not require this data in the current manuscript. Just saying that it would be nice to see at least some of this, and would also demonstrate the utility of nanobodies for western detection; indeed with their higher affinities, perhaps detection levels are also enhanced, compared to use of conventional antibodies.</p></disp-quote><p>We have not tried our nanobodies for western blotting. However, it established that typical nanobodies recognise folded domains and do not work with SDS-denatured samples. Exceptions from this rule are very rare, and with our choice of immunogens it is even more unlikely that linear (Western blot compatible) epitopes recognised. In any case, the presence of different Sls isoforms is already documented in the literature on RNA (Spletter et al. 2018) and protein level (Lakey et al. 1997; Burkart et al. 2007), we cite these papers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Third, in addition to my comment in the Public Review about the authors ignoring work in other invertebrates especially <italic>C. elegans</italic>, in the Discussion, the authors make an interesting comment regarding Projectin, &quot;Hence, it will be interesting to resolve in the future if the kinase activity is required for sarcomere formation or function.&quot; At the risk of tooting my lab's own work, we have already investigated this question for twitchin (Projectin) in C. elegans. In Matsunaga et al. (2017), we used CRISPR to gene edit the twitchin gene so that it expressed a full-length abundant twitchin in which the protein kinase domain had been rendered catalytically inactive. These worms have normal sarcomere structure but move faster and contract more than wild type worms, suggesting that the normal function of the catalytic activity of twitchin kinase is to inhibit muscle activity.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for highlighting the really interesting paper that we had missed. We now included it, as well as the other <italic>C. elegans</italic> paper, in our discussion.</p><p>We again want to thank this reviewer for appreciating our manuscript and help making it more widely relevant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #4 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Authors test the specificities of their Nanobodies in late embryos using muscle-specific RNAi attenuation of sls and bent. Among them, Sls-Nano2 is expected to detect both short and long Sls isoforms whereas Sls-Nano39 and Sls-Nano42 only the long ones. Staining of all of them is strongly reduced in Sls-RNAi context. What could be interesting to test is:</p><p>i) Whether nanobodies directed to the same protein region (here Sls C-term rich of Ig repeats) have similar efficacy and specificity of detection.</p></disp-quote><p>Is the reviewer asking is Sls-Nano42 and Sls-Nano48 (both against SlsIg51-Fn2) bind with the same affinity? We have not tested this in detail. In immunostainings they show comparable intensities, similar to Sls-Nano39 (against Sls-Ig49/50). See Figure 5 and Figure 5 Supplement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>ii) Whether the expression of short Sls isoform detected by the Sls-Nano2 and potentially not overlapping with Projectin could be specific for developmental stages before the sarcomere assembly.</p></disp-quote><p>In the embryo, at stage 16 before the first sarcomeres assemble, both long and short isoforms are likely present. At least the long isoform is present as Sls-Nano2, Sls-Nano39 and Sls-Nano42 give a good signal in stainings (Figure 4). We believe that without the long Sls isoform actin cannot be stably linked to myosin, hence a sarcomere cannot be assembled.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One potential application of Nanobodies is their use in following native proteins in vivo. Because proteins tagged with GFP are often functionally affected it would be of interest to test whether the functionality of proteins to which Nonobodies bind is preserved. Here authors could test whether Sls-Nano2NeoGreen expressed in muscle has an impact or not on Sls muscle function.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this valuable comment. We have now included detailed analysis of larval crawling and sarcomere morphology in the Sls-Nano2-NeonGreen expressing muscle and find that they behave normally.</p></body></sub-article></article>
