Msp1 also resides on peroxisomes but it remains unknown how native TA proteins on mitochondria and peroxisomes evade Msp1 surveillance. We used live-cell quantitative cell microscopy tools and drug-inducible gene expression to dissect Msp1 function. We found that a small fraction of peroxisomal Pex15, exaggerated by overexpression, is turned over by Msp1. Kinetic measurements guided by theoretical modeling revealed that Pex15 molecules at mitochondria display age-independent Msp1 sensitivity. By contrast, Pex15 molecules at peroxisomes are rapidly converted from an initial Msp1-sensitive to an Msp1-resistant state. Lastly, we show that Pex15 interacts with the peroxisomal membrane protein Pex3, which shields Pex15 from Msp1-dependent turnover. In sum, our work argues that Msp1 selects its substrates on the basis of their solitary membrane existence.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28507.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The phrase “finding a needle in a haystack” refers to the difficulty of locating a specific target among a large number of very similar objects. Living cells face a comparable challenge whenever they carry out seek and destroy missions aimed at broken or otherwise undesirable molecules. Scientists are still figuring out how these quality control systems can quickly and accurately pick out the few unwanted molecules that occasionally appear in crowds of normal molecules.</p><p>Msp1 is a quality control protein that resides on the outer surfaces of two compartments within cells: mitochondria and peroxisomes. Previous work showed that when a protein called Pex15, which is normally found in peroxisomes, is mistakenly sent to mitochondria it is rapidly eliminated by Msp1.</p><p>Weir et al. set out to understand if Msp1 can distinguish incorrectly localized Pex15 from correctly localized Pex15. Fluorescence microscopy was used to watch how Msp1 eliminates Pex15 from compartments within living yeast cells. Although Msp1 did not normally recognize Pex15 at peroxisomes, when Weir et al. attempted to over-load peroxisomes with Pex15 they saw that Msp1 provided a counterforce. Comparing how quickly cells eliminated excess Pex15 at peroxisomes with predictions from mathematical models showed that Pex15 “matures” from an Msp1-sensitive to an Msp1-insensitive state. Further experiments revealed that Pex15 binds to another protein found in peroxisomes, called Pex3, which protects Pex15 from Msp1. By contrast, occasional Pex15 molecules that reached mitochondria remained immature and sensitive to Msp1.</p><p>Proteins similar to Msp1 are also found in humans, and Weir et al. hope that a better understanding of how Msp1 works in yeast will help scientists studying human disorders caused by defects in similar quality control systems. This could help to combat disease like cancer, neurodegenerative diseases and cystic fibrosis – which have all been linked to quality control systems that have started to target too few or too many proteins.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>quality control</kwd><kwd>AAA ATPase</kwd><kwd>tail-anchored protein</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>peroxisome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Denic</surname><given-names>Vladimir</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Msp1, a membrane-integral AAA ATPase at mitochondria and peroxisomes, selectively recognizes uncomplexed substrate molecules in vivo while avoiding substrates stabilized by binding partners.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tail-anchored (TA) proteins are integral membrane proteins with a single C-terminal transmembrane segment (TMS). In the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae,</italic> the majority of TA proteins are captured post-translationally by cytosolic factors of the conserved Guided Entry of TA proteins (GET) pathway, which deliver them to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane for insertion by a dedicated insertase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Denic et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hegde and Keenan, 2011</xref>). TA proteins native to the outer mitochondrial and peroxisomal membranes are directly inserted into these membranes by mechanisms that are not well defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Papić et al., 2013</xref>, and reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Borgese and Fasana, 2011</xref>). Gene deletions of GET pathway components (<italic>getΔ</italic>) result in reduced cell growth, TA protein mistargeting to mitochondria, and cytosolic TA protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jonikas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schuldiner et al., 2008</xref>). Two recent studies identified the ATPase associated with diverse cellular activities (AAA ATPase) Msp1 as an additional factor for supporting cell viability in the absence of GET pathway function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Okreglak and Walter, 2014</xref>). Specifically, they observed that <italic>msp1Δ</italic> cells accumulate mislocalized TA proteins in the mitochondria and that double <italic>msp1Δ getΔ</italic> cells have synthetic sick genetic interactions. This sick phenotype is associated with disruption of mitochondrial function and is exacerbated by overexpression of TA proteins prone to mislocalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2014b</xref>). Msp1 is a cytosolically-facing transmembrane AAA ATPase which resides on both mitochondria and peroxisomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Okreglak and Walter, 2014</xref>). Closely-related members of Msp1’s AAA ATPase subfamily form hexamers that bind hydrophobic membrane substrates and use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to extract them from the membrane for protein degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Olivares et al., 2016</xref>). Several lines of evidence are consistent with the working model that Msp1 operates by a similar mechanism: ATPase-dead mutations of Msp1 are unable to complement <italic>msp1Δ </italic>mutant phenotypes; mitochondrial mistargeting of TA proteins leads to their enhanced co-immunoprecipitation with ATPase-dead Msp1; cells lacking Msp1 have increased half-lives of mistargeted TA proteins; and lastly, a complementary analysis of the mammalian Msp1 homolog ATAD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2014b</xref>) established a conserved role for Msp1 in correcting errors in TA protein sorting.</p><p>Substrate selectivity mechanisms of many AAA proteins have been successfully dissected by bulk cell approaches for measuring substrate turnover. These approaches are resolution-limited, however, when used to study Msp1 in <italic>getΔ</italic> cells because TA proteins mistargeted to mitochondria co-exist with a dominant TA population that remains correctly localized in the same cell. Previous studies overcame this issue through two different approaches that increased the ratio of mistargeted to properly localized substrates. In one case, cells were engineered to produce a Pex15 deletion mutant (Pex15<sub>ΔC30</sub>) that is efficiently mistargeted to mitochondria because it lacks its native peroxisomal targeting signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Okreglak and Walter, 2014</xref>). A major limitation of this approach, however, is its inherent unsuitability for establishing if native Pex15 is a latent Msp1 substrate because of undefined peroxisomal factors. Second, a cell microscopy pulse-chase approach was used to monitor turnover of mitochondrial signal from transiently expressed fluorescently-labeled wild-type Pex15 made susceptible to mistargeting by deletion of <italic>GET3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2014b</xref>). In this approach, expression of Pex15 was transcriptionally controlled by the inducible <italic>GAL</italic> promoter in cells expressing wild-type, ATPase-dead, or no Msp1. Comparison of mitochondrial Pex15 clearance following <italic>GAL</italic> promoter shut-off revealed that cells lacking functional Msp1 had a reduced fractional rate of substrate clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2014b</xref>); however, these cells also had a larger starting population of mitochondrial Pex15. Thus the presence of Msp1 during Pex15 pulse periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Okreglak and Walter, 2014</xref>) leaves open the possibility that Msp1 does not mediate substrate extraction from the mitochondrial outer membrane but instead blocks substrate insertion into this membrane. Distinguishing between these possibilities requires better tools for temporally controlling and accurately measuring Msp1 activity in cells.</p><p>Substrate recognition by AAA proteins can be controlled by a variety of intrinsic substrate determinants and extrinsic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Olivares et al., 2016</xref>). Some insight into Msp1 substrate selectivity comes from negative evidence showing that native mitochondrial TA proteins are inefficient Msp1 substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2014b</xref>). Thus, substrates might contain intrinsic Msp1 recognition determinants or native mitochondrial TA proteins might be protected from Msp1 recognition by extrinsic mitochondrial factors. Similarly, the potential existence of extrinsic peroxisomal factors might explain why Pex15 (a native peroxisomal TA protein) appears to stably co-reside with Msp1 at peroxisomes but is a substrate for Msp1 at mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Okreglak and Walter, 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Efficient clearance of a fully-integrated substrate from mitochondria by de novo Msp1 induction</title><p>To generate a defined Msp1 substrate population prior to initiation of Msp1 activity, we utilized two established synthetic drug-inducible gene expression systems to orthogonally control expression of Pex15 and Msp1. Briefly, we created a yeast strain genetic background with two transcriptional activator-promoter pairs: 1. the doxycycline (DOX)-activated reverse tetracycline trans-activator (rTA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Roney et al., 2016</xref>) for controlling expression of fluorescently-labeled Pex15 (YFP-Pex15) from the <italic>TET</italic> promoter; and 2. the β-estradiol-activated synthetic transcription factor Z4EV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">McIsaac et al., 2013</xref>) for controlling Msp1 expression from the Z4EV-driven (<italic>ZD)</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Next, we pre-loaded mitochondria with Pex15 in the absence of any detectable Msp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) by growing cells for 2 hr in the presence of a high DOX concentration (50 μg/ml) necessary to induce sufficient mitochondrial mistargeting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and see below). This was followed by 2 hr of DOX wash-out to allow for mitochondrial maturation of newly-synthesized YFP-Pex15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Using confocal microscopy, we could resolve the relatively faint mitochondrial YFP fluorescence from the much brighter punctate YFP fluorescence (corresponding to peroxisomes, see below) by signal co-localization with Tom70-mTurquoise2 (a mitochondrial marker; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref>, and Materials and methods for computational image analysis details). Lastly, we monitored changes in mitochondrial YFP-Pex15 fluorescence density by timelapse live-cell imaging in the presence or absence of β-estradiol to define the effect of de novo induction of Msp1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Starting with the same pre-existing mitochondrial Pex15 population, we found that de novo Msp1 induction significantly enhanced mitochondrial YFP signal decay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>). We reached a similar conclusion when we used a deletion variant of Pex15 (Pex15<sub>ΔC30</sub>) that is efficiently mistargeted to mitochondria because it lacks a C-terminal peroxisome targeting signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Okreglak and Walter, 2014</xref>)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). To establish if Pex15<sub>ΔC30</sub>was fully membrane-integrated prior to Msp1 induction, we harvested cells after DOX treatment. Following cell lysis, we isolated crude mitochondria by centrifugation and treated them with Proteinase K (PK). Immunoblotting analysis against a C-terminal epitope engineered on Pex15 revealed the existence of a protected TMS-containing fragment that became PK-sensitive after solubilizing mitochondrial membranes with detergent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Taken together, these findings argue that Msp1 can extract a fully-integrated substrate from the mitochondrial outer membrane and gave us a new tool for mechanistic dissection of Msp1 function in vivo.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28507.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Pulse-chase analysis of mitochondrial Pex15 turnover by Msp1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cells containing the doxycycline-inducible promoter driving YFP-Pex15 expression and the β-estradiol-inducible promoter driving Msp1 expression were grown for 2 hr in the presence of 50 µg/ml doxycycline (DOX) before they were washed and grown for 2 hr in drug-free media. <italic>PEX15</italic> mRNAs have a half-life of ~31 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Geisberg et al., 2014</xref>), arguing that approximately 7.3% of <italic>PEX15</italic> mRNAs remained when imaging began.

In search of an answer to this question, we repeated our analysis at higher temporal resolution and found a major difference between the kinetic signatures of mitochondrial and peroxisomal Pex15 turnover by Msp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and see below). Specifically, while mitochondrial Pex15 turnover showed simple exponential decay (<italic>i.e.</italic> linear decay after log-transformation), the decay of peroxisomal Pex15 appeared to be more complex, comprising faster and slower kinetic components. We detected no major kinetic differences between Msp1 targeting to mitochondria and peroxisomes that could explain this phenomenon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>) but found a potential clue from a proteome-wide pulse-chase study showing that while most proteins decay exponentially, some exhibit non-exponential decay that can be explained by their stoichiometric excess over their binding partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McShane et al., 2016</xref>). Since peroxisomal membranes have unique residents that interact with native Pex15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eckert and Johnsson, 2003</xref>), we hypothesized that non-exponential decay of overexpressed peroxisomal Pex15 arises due to the existence of an Msp1-sensitive ‘solitary’ Pex15 state and an Msp1-insensitive ‘partner-bound’ Pex15 state. This solitary state would be minimally populated by endogenously expressed Pex15 under steady-state conditions, but a significant fraction of overexpressed Pex15 molecules would be solitary because of stoichiometric excess. By contrast, since mitochondria are unlikely to have Pex15-binding partners, mitochondrial Pex15 would exist in an obligate solitary state and would therefore decay exponentially.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28507.012</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Experimental and theoretical evidence for the 2-state model of Pex15 turnover at peroxisomes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The apparent difference in the kinetic profiles of Msp1-induced substrate turnover at peroxisomes (Pex15) versus mitochondria (Pex15<sub>ΔC30</sub>).

We also restricted our analysis to the first 45 min of β-estradiol treatment because longer Msp1 induction times led to a significant fraction of mitochondria with no detectable YFP signal, which would interfere with turnover fitting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, later timepoints). In both the presence and absence of Msp1, our measurements could be similarly explained by both 1-state and 2-state models.

Specifically, in the 1-state model, transient Msp1 overexpression in cells with constitutive Pex15 expression should equally destabilize all Pex15 molecules, thus rapidly reducing their mean age over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, top left panel). By contrast, in the 2-state model, Pex15 age should be buffered against Msp1 overexpression because of two opposing forces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, top right panel): At one end, there would be an increase in k<sub>decay,1</sub> leading to less nascent Pex15, which would drive down the mean age over time. However, there would also be an opposing consequence of rapid depletion of new peroxisomal Pex15 by Msp1: the mature population of Pex15 would receive fewer new (younger) molecules, which would drive up the mean age over time. Notably, both models predict that transient Msp1 expression would result in a decrease in peroxisomal Pex15 levels, albeit with differing kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, bottom panels).

To look for additional Pex15 binding partners, we noted that the Pex1/6/15 complex is a regulator of peroxisome destruction by selective autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kamber et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nuttall et al., 2014</xref>).

Consistent with a previously published split-ubiquitin assay for detecting protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eckert and Johnsson, 2003</xref>), we found that Pex15 interacts with Pex3 by co-immunoprecipitation analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Before we could test if Pex3 protects Pex15 from Msp1-dependent turnover, we had to overcome a major technical challenge. Specifically, Pex3 is essential for targeting of numerous peroxisomal membrane proteins, which is why <italic>pex3Δ</italic> cells lack functional peroxisomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fang et al., 2004</xref>). Since Pex3 is normally turned over very slowly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Belle et al., 2006</xref>), promoter shut-off is not a suitable method for acutely depleting Pex3. Instead, we exploited an established Auxin-inducible degradation system to rapidly eliminate Pex3 from peroxisomes in situ. First, we appended a tandem V5 epitope tag followed by an Auxin-inducible degron sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nishimura et al., 2009</xref>) to the cytosolic C-terminus of Pex3 (Pex3-V5-AID).

Immunoblotting analysis for the V5 epitope revealed that Auxin addition induced rapid Pex3 destruction, which was dependent on OsTir1 expression and independent of Msp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B–E</xref>).

To monitor changes in peroxisomal sfYFP fluorescence density after Pex3 depletion we again used live-cell confocal microscopy combined with computational image analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Strikingly, we observed that Pex3 degradation immediately increased the rate of Msp1-dependent Pex15 turnover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), thus unmasking endogenous Pex15 as a latent substrate. By contrast, Pex3 degradation did not result in Msp1-dependent destabilization of Pex11 and Pex12, two peroxisomal membrane proteins we analyzed as controls for the substrate specificity of Msp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1I–J</xref>). We observed a similar phenomenon in cells overexpressing YFP-Pex15, albeit to a lesser extent, possibly because of excess YFP-Pex15 relative to endogenous Pex3 prior to Auxin addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F–H</xref>). Consistent with this idea, constitutive overexpression of Pex3 from the strong <italic>TDH3</italic> promoter blunted the effect of de novo Msp1 induction on transiently overexpressed YFP-Pex15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–E</xref>).

This suggests that the TMS of Msp1 is an ambiguous targeting signal whose function is to localize the rest of Msp1 into proximity with its substrates. To explore this issue, we first attempted to restrict Msp1 to either mitochondria or peroxisomes by replacing Msp1’s TMS with the signal anchor of Tom70 (Tom70<sub>TMS</sub>-Msp1), a mitochondrial outer membrane resident, or the transmembrane peroxisomal targeting signal of Pex22 (Pex22<sub>TMS</sub>-Msp1), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Indeed, Tom70<sub>TMS</sub>-Msp1-YFP produced from the <italic>MSP1</italic> promoter is primarily localized to mitochondria with some residual localization to peroxisomes, whereas Pex22<sub>TMS</sub>-Msp1-YFP was exclusively localized to peroxisomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

This analysis revealed that Pex22<sub>TMS</sub>-Msp1 enhanced substrate turnover more robustly than Tom70<sub>TMS</sub>-Msp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>), which we can simply explain by its relatively higher peroxisome abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).

Two recent studies revealed that yeast Msp1 (ATAD1 in humans), a AAA membrane protein resident on the surface of mitochondria and peroxisomes, is part of a conserved mechanism for preventing mistargeted TA proteins from accumulating in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Okreglak and Walter, 2014</xref>). At the same time, this pioneering work raised an important question about Msp1’s substrate selectivity: What distinguishes TA proteins mistargeted to mitochondria from TA proteins native to mitochondria and peroxisomes?</p><p>Here, we answer this question as it pertains to Pex15, a native peroxisomal TA protein known to be an Msp1 substrate when mistargeted to mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Okreglak and Walter, 2014</xref>). As our starting point, we coupled live-cell quantitative microscopy with two orthogonal drug-inducible gene-expression systems to show that de novo induction of Msp1 activity clears a fully-integrated Pex15 variant from mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This result solidifies the working model in the literature that Msp1 is a mechanoenzyme capable of extracting its substrates from the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Okreglak and Walter, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wohlever et al., 2017</xref>). We were also able to reveal that peroxisomal Pex15 is a latent Msp1 substrate at peroxisomes. The key starting observation that led us to this conclusion was that Pex15 overexpressed at peroxisomes was turned over by an unusual non-exponential process, which depended on Msp1 induction. By model fitting of these data and comparative analysis with the exponential decay of mitochondrial Pex15, we found evidence for a Pex15 maturation mechanism unique to peroxisomes. By positing that this mechanism converts newly-resident peroxisomal Pex15 from an initial Msp1-sensitive state to an Msp1-resistant state, we were able to account for the non-exponential decay kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Moreover, we validated a key prediction of this mechanism by showing that Msp1 selectively removes peroxisomal Pex15 from the young end of its molecular age distribution. More broadly, a testable hypothesis that emerges as an extension of our work is that native mitochondrial TA proteins are latent substrates normally shielded from Msp1 by maturation mechanisms specific to mitochondria.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28507.020</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model for substrate selection by Msp1.</title><p>On the left, mistargeted Pex15 inserts into mitochondria and is then recognized by Msp1 for extraction. On the right, following insertion into peroxisomes, nascent Pex15 can be recognized by Msp1 in principle but in practice this requires either Pex15 and/or Msp1 to be present above their usual levels. Otherwise, normal Msp1 recognition is slow relative to the faster ‘maturation’ process involving Pex3 interaction with Pex15, which blocks Msp1 recognition.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-28507-fig8-v2"/></fig><p>The precise molecular mechanism by which Pex15 matures into an Msp1-resistant state remains to be worked out. However, our evidence strongly argues that complex assembly between Pex15 and the peroxisomal membrane protein Pex3 is a critical component of this process. Pex3 has been previously shown to play a role in the insertion of peroxisomal membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fang et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, it is possible that loss of Pex3 function leads to indirect loss of another membrane protein that itself blocks Msp1-dependent turnover of Pex15. We cannot formally exclude this possibility but we find it unlikely for three reasons. First, we showed that Pex3 co-immunoprecipitates with Pex15. Thus, in principle, Pex3 could physically occlude an Msp1 binding site on Pex15 or make Pex15 structurally more resistant to mechanodisruption. Second, we showed that rapid degradation of Pex3 causes a near-instantaneous increase in the rate of Msp1-dependent Pex15 clearance from peroxisomes without destabilizing two control peroxisomal membrane proteins. Third, we found that overproduction of Pex3 increased protection of overexpressed Pex15 from Msp1-dependent turnover at peroxisomes. Our results do not rule out the possibility that additional binding partners of Pex15, such as certain components of the importomer for peroxisomal matrix proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rosenkranz et al., 2006</xref>), confer protection from Msp1. More broadly, a simple extension of our working model for Msp1 substrate selectivity leads to the intriguing hypothesis that native mitochondrial TA proteins are shielded from Msp1 by their binding partners. The microscopy methodology we have described here will facilitate testing of this idea in the near future.</p><p>Lastly, our work adds Msp1 to the growing class of proteostasis pathways that mediate degradation of excess subunits of soluble (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sung et al., 2016</xref>) and transmembrane complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kihara et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Westphal et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, Msp1 is expressed at a relatively low level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ghaemmaghami et al., 2003</xref>) and its prolonged overexpression induces severe growth defects (data not shown). This raises the possibility that superphysiological levels of Msp1 are detrimental because they reduce the abundance of undefined protein complexes via hypervigilant membrane clearance of immature subunits and complex assembly intermediates. Future tests of this idea using proteome-wide approaches have the potential to define the full breadth of Msp1’s role in maintaining protein complex homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Culture media was removed and adhered cells were immediately overlaid with a 1% agarose pad containing complete synthetic media with glucose and supplemented with drugs when applicable. The agarose pad was overlaid with liquid media for timelapse imaging experiments. Live-cell imaging was performed at 25°C on a TI microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a CSU-10 spinning disk (Yokogawa, Tokyo, Japan), an ImagEM EM-CCD camera (Hamamatsu, Hamamatsu, Japan), and a 100 × 1.45 NA objective (Nikon).

To identify peroxisomes and mitochondria, images of their respective markers were processed by an object segmentation script. Briefly, images were smoothed using a Gaussian filter and then organelle edges were identified by processing each slice with a Canny edge detector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Canny, 1986</xref>) implemented in the Python package scikit-image. Enclosed objects were filled and individual three-dimensional objects were identified by locally maximizing Euclidean distance to the object border. Individual objects were identified and separated by watershed segmentation as implemented in scikit-image. For mitochondria, contiguous but separately segmented objects were merged to form one mitochondrion. For YFP-Pex15 quantitation at mitochondria, regions of mitochondria that overlapped with peroxisomes were removed by eliminating segmented mitochondria pixels that overlapped with segmented peroxisomes.

Fluorescence density was calculated by dividing total pixel intensity by object volume in pixels. Background was calculated empirically by measuring Pex15 fluorescence intensity in peroxisomes and/or mitochondria in cells lacking fluorescently labeled Pex15, and the mean background density was subtracted from each segmented object’s fluorescence density. Because Pex15 fluorescence density was approximately log-normally distributed, mean and standard error of the mean were calculated on logarithmically transformed fluorescence densities when applicable. Plotting was performed using R and the ggplot2 package.

For the 1-state model, log-transformed mean fluorescence densities at each time point were fit to a linear model using least squares fitting in R. For the 2-state model, logarithmically transformed data was fit to a logarithmically transformed version of a previously derived 2-state degradation model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sin et al., 2016</xref>) using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Levenberg, 1944</xref>) for non-linear least squares fitting as implemented in the R package minpack.lm. Error for fit parameters was obtained from fit summary statistics. The difference between the 1-state and 2-state model fits was determined by integrating the difference between the two fit equations over the measured time interval, then dividing by the time interval to normalize across timecourse experiments of different lengths. See <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.github.com/deniclab/Weir_2017_analysis">www.github.com/deniclab/Weir_2017_analysis</ext-link> for tabulated data and R code. Observed half-life was determined by converting the peroxisomal YFP-Pex15 –Msp1 k<sub>decay</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) using the equation half-life = ln(2)/k<sub>decay</sub>, and then multiplied by 60 to convert from hours to minutes. Error bars represent standard error of the mean.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Simulation of protein age and turnover</title><p>To stochastically model peroxisomal Pex15 levels and age following transient Msp1 expression, we used a Gillespie algorithm approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gillespie, 1977</xref>). In brief, this approach cycles through the following steps: 1. Model the expected time until the next ‘event’ takes place (import, degradation, or maturation of a Pex15 molecule) by summing event rates and drawing from an exponential distribution based on the summed rate constant, 2. Age all simulated Pex15 molecules according to time passage, 3. Determine which of the possible events took place by weighted random draws based on each event’s probability of occurring, 4. Execute that event, and then repeat these steps until the simulation’s time has expired. Based on our observation that Pex15 turnover in the absence of Msp1 occurs with exponential decay kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), we established starting conditions by drawing 1000 ages from an exponential distribution with half-life indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>. For the rest of the simulation we used this rate constant to predict import of new molecules and as a steady-state degradation rate constant (and as k<sub>decay,2</sub> in 2-state simulations). We treated this vector of 1000 ages as a single peroxisome containing 1000 Pex15 molecules (this is likely an over-estimation of Pex15 amounts in many cases, but over-estimating Pex15 levels improved statistical robustness of the analysis and did not alter simulation mean outcomes). When simulating steady state 2-state behavior using the calculated k<sub>mat</sub> value, we found that ~60% of the elements existed in the ‘unstable’ form at steady state (data not shown) and therefore used this as a starting value. For 2-state simulations we randomly drew 600 of the vector elements to be ‘unstable’ at the start of the simulation, weighting probabilities of each draw using an exponential distribution with k<sub>mat</sub> as the decay rate constant. After validating that our starting conditions represented a stable steady state by simulating without perturbing rate constants, we began the reported simulations with k<sub>decay</sub> set to 2.82 hr<sup>−1</sup>, the best linear fit for turnover from the first three time points (for 1-state simulations), or with k<sub>decay,1</sub> (for 2-state simulations) set to the calculated value from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>. Simulations ran for 4 hr of simulated time and values for particle age and abundance were recorded at every simulated minute. 100 simulations were performed with each set of parameters and the mean particle age and abundance at each minute were calculated across the 100 simulations. Finally, we modeled maturation of sfYFP fluorescence and mCherry fluorescence based on established maturation half-times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hansen and O'Shea, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Khmelinskii et al., 2012</xref>), respectively) and calculated the mean population tFT ratio at each minute. We normalized these data to the value at the simulation’s starting point.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by Ivan Dikic as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study has investigated the function of the AAA+ ATPase Msp1, a recently discovered factor needed for degradation of tail–anchored (TA) membrane proteins mislocalized to mitochondria and peroxisomes. Relatively little is known about what defines an Msp1 substrate or how this factor facilitates substrate degradation, but this pathway is likely to be important for maintenance of mitochondrial (and presumably peroxisomal) homeostasis. Earlier work had established that the peroxisomal protein Pex15 is a target for Msp1–mediated degradation when it is mis–targeted to mitochondria. Yet, Pex15 can co–exist with Msp1 in peroxisomes. Why Pex15 is a target for the Msp1 pathway in mitochondria but not in peroxisomes is the main issue that has been addressed. The central proposal in this study is that Msp1–dependent degradation of Pex15 occurs only when Pex15 is free from its Pex3 binding partner. The primary support for this conclusion is the observation that Pex15 over–expression, which presumably saturates its Pex3 partner, results in Msp1–dependent Pex15 degradation even from peroxisomes. The implication is that Msp1 may select its clients on the basis of being 'solitary' from their native multi–protein complexes. This would explain how Msp1 can reside in both mitochondria and peroxisomes to degrade only mislocalized proteins while avoiding normal residents.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The main new suggestion in this manuscript, that Pex15 in isolation from its Pex3 binding partner is the molecular target of Msp1 in peroxisomes, was found to be plausible but not strongly established. Thus, most of the suggested experiments are aimed toward improving support for this key claim.</p><p>1) While the model presented is intriguing, the data do not, at present, fully support the claim that Msp1 is active on the peroxisomal membrane. The authors claim that Pex3 protects Pex15 from Msp1 mediated degradation. However, there is no experimental indication that this interaction occurs on the peroxisomal membrane. In fact, in Lam et al., 2010, Pex3 was shown to interact with Pex15 only during biogenesis and in the ER. Thus, to establish the central claim of this study, it seems critical to convincingly show that Pex15 actually interacts with Pex3 in peroxisomes, thereby lending support to the idea that this interaction is the protective agent in peroxisomes.</p><p>2) Part of the support for Pex3 being important in protecting Pex15 from degradation is the finding that Pex3 deletion results in Pex15 degradation. However, controls are not shown to ascertain whether the effect of Pex3 elimination causes a change in the peroxisomal membrane that alters the half–life of all peroxisomal proteins. It is important to establish the degree of specificity of Msp1–mediated degradation upon Pex3 deletion and rule out a more trivial generic destabilization of peroxisomes in general.</p><p>3) The authors claim that the degraded Pex15 in peroxisomes is the overexpressed fraction that presumably saturates Pex3. This claim would be more strongly supported by three additional results. First (and easiest), it is important to establish that the low concentration of Doxycycline used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> (for example) causes overexpression of the protein. The authors could, for example, add a control image that compares the overexpressed phenotype with its native expression levels to be sure that the experiment starts when Pex15 is actually overexpressed. Second, it is worth testing whether co–expression of Pex3 can blunt Msp1 degradation of Pex15. Third, it is worth testing whether quantitative IP of Pex3 is able to co–deplete Pex15 in wt cells, that excess Msp1 has no effect on this, and that co–depletion is only partial when Pex15 is overexpressed (i.e., showing that it is indeed in excess of Pex3).</p><p>4) The experiment showing that Pex15 is actually inserted into the membrane as a transmembrane protein was not convincing (and I'm a bit suspicious about whether this is actually the case). The C–terminal region does not seem to contain a transmembrane segment by prediction algorithms (e.g., TMHMM), and manual inspection fails to reveal any region that contains a continuous hydrophobic sequence longer than ~10 residues. It is in this context that the protease protection experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> becomes important. Unfortunately, the blot is rather dirty in the critical control lane. This appears to be due to Triton X–100 in that sample forming mixed micelles with SDS that migrate near and distort the region of the blot where their key protected fragment runs. This distortion makes it quite plausible that the band seen with detergent might well be the same band seen without detergent, but altered in its migration due to the mixed micelle artifact. If this were the case, the data would not convincingly support transmembrane insertion. Thus, the authors must clean up this experiment. There are a couple of options: (i) use far less detergent, such as 0.1% Tx100, to minimize the artifact; (ii) immunoprecipitate the sample before doing the blot, with the last wash of the IPs being in detergent–free buffer to avoid this artifact.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28507.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The main new suggestion in this manuscript, that Pex15 in isolation from its Pex3 binding partner is the molecular target of Msp1 in peroxisomes, was found to be plausible but not strongly established.

In that manuscript, the authors isolated microsomes from yeast cells and then performed vesicle budding assays to produce vesicles containing both Pex3 and Pex15 (distinct from COPII vesicles that can co–bud from microsomes under these in vitro conditions). However, these experiments do not demonstrate any evidence of physical interaction between Pex3 and Pex15 (in the ER or in the aforementioned vesicles) nor is this one of the claims by the authors. Indeed, the only experiment performed to assess whether Pex3 and Pex15 directly interact is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> of that paper, in which the authors affinity–purified Pex15 from budded vesicles in the presence or absence of Triton X–100. A small fraction of Pex3 only copurified with Pex15 in the absence of detergent, suggesting that these proteins reside in the same vesicles to some extent, but do not physically interact (or at least not in a way that persists following immunoprecipitation in the presence of detergent). Further contributing to this confusion, the Saccharomyces Genome Database has misannotated the existence of a Pex3 and Pex15 reconstituted complex based on this manuscript, when in fact the data only support cofractionation in vesicles.</p><p>Related to this matter, we thank reviewer #2 for pointing out that a bulk–cell interaction between Pex3 and Pex15 was previously observed using split ubiquitin technology in Eckert and Johnsson, 2003 (now referenced in the revised manuscript). This inspired us to use a related approach with sub–cellular resolution to experimentally test our claim that Pex15 and Pex3 physically interact at peroxisomes. Specifically, we made yeast strains expressing from endogenous loci Pex15 and Pex3 tagged with the N– and C–terminal fragments of the fluorescent protein Venus, respectively. Only in the presence of both fluorescent protein fragment tags did we observe bimolecular fluorescence complementation resulting in Venus fluorescence, which co–localized fluorescence from a peroxisomal matrix marker (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>).</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-28507-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Part of the support for Pex3 being important in protecting Pex15 from degradation is the finding that Pex3 deletion results in Pex15 degradation.

Before addressing this concern, we reasoned that our original data might underestimate the actual contribution of Pex3 to protection of natively–expressed Pex15 because they were obtained following TET inducible overexpression of YFP–Pex15. Thus, we switched to monitoring the dynamics of peroxisomal membrane proteins expressed from their native promoters. Indeed, this resulted in a more dramatic destabilization of Pex15 by an Msp1–dependent process (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–C</xref> compared to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F–G</xref> in the revised manuscript). By contrast, two other peroxisomal membrane proteins, Pex11 and Pex12, persisted at peroxisomes following degradation of Pex3, regardless of whether Msp1 was present or not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1I–J</xref> in the revised manuscript). Taken together, these new data argue against the possibility that Pex3 depletion induces generic Msp1–dependent destabilization of peroxisomal membrane proteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors claim that the degraded Pex15 in peroxisomes is the overexpressed fraction that presumably saturates Pex3.

In the original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B–C</xref> we compared the peroxisomal levels of YFPPex15 produced from its endogenous promoter to the amount produced following 2 hours of induction with 5 ug/ml doxycycline, a concentration lower than that used for any of our Pex15 turnover experiments. This resulted in YFP–Pex15 levels 10 times higher at peroxisomes than in cells where the protein was produced from the endogenous <italic>PEX15</italic> promoter. To test if elevated expression of Pex3 could blunt Msp1 degradation of excess Pex15 molecules, we overexpressed Pex3 from the strong <italic>TDH3</italic> promoter and obtained the expected result. Since this approach didn’t confer complete protection from Msp1, it points to the presence of additional protection factors. Indeed, Pex15 has been shown to interact with several other peroxisomal membrane proteins in previous studies (for examples, see Eckert and Johannson, 2003 and Rosenkranz et al.,2006, among others), which may play a role in shielding Pex15 from Msp1. We have added a section to the discussion covering these points.</p><p>Lastly, we have attempted to quantitate the extent of the Pex3–Pex15 interaction after extraction from membranes with detergent. After optimizing our affinity purification of Pex3 (natively expressed), we found that near–quantitative Pex3 from the flow–through was accompanied by only a partial depletion of Pex15 (also natively expressed). Since affinity purification protocols in detergent have a tendency to disrupt labile native membrane protein interactions, we plan to develop in the future quantitative in vivo reporters of Pex3–Pex15 complex dynamics (e.g. FRET–based).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The experiment showing that Pex15 is actually inserted into the membrane as a transmembrane protein was not convincing (and I'm a bit suspicious about whether this is actually the case). The C–terminal region does not seem to contain a transmembrane segment by prediction algorithms (e.g., TMHMM), and manual inspection fails to reveal any region that contains a continuous hydrophobic sequence longer than ~10 residues. It is in this context that the protease protection experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> becomes important. Unfortunately, the blot is rather dirty in the critical control lane. This appears to be due to Triton X–100 in that sample forming mixed micelles with SDS that migrate near and distort the region of the blot where their key protected fragment runs. This distortion makes it quite plausible that the band seen with detergent might well be the same band seen without detergent, but altered in its migration due to the mixed micelle artifact. If this were the case, the data would not convincingly support transmembrane insertion. Thus, the authors must clean up this experiment. There are a couple of options: (i) use far less detergent, such as 0.1% Tx100, to minimize the artifact; (ii) immunoprecipitate the sample before doing the blot, with the last wash of the IPs being in detergent–free buffer to avoid this artifact.</p></disp-quote><p>The relatively hydrophilic transmembrane segments of mitochondrial and peroxisomal membrane proteins are notoriously difficult to predict by algorithms trained using databases dominated by the more hydrophobic secretory pathway membrane proteins. For example, TMHMM does not predict that either Msp1 or Pex14 are membrane–integral even though this is well–established by protease protection assays (see Chen et al.,2014 and Albertini et al.,1997, respectively). Thus, we took the advice to improve the quality of our own protease protection assay for Pex15ΔC30 in earnest. We repeated this assay using a room temperature protease treatment rather than 4 °C and did not observe any background banding in the Triton X–100 control lane (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We note that room temperature incubation of mitochondria resulted in loss of the N–terminal YFP from most molecules of Pex15ΔC30 as well as Proteinase K–independent degradation of Tom70. We therefore did not include the anti–Tom70 control blot. A related concern was expressed by reviewer #2 about protein size, prompting us to now display the contiguous anti–V5 blot (with molecular markers indicated) that shows full–length and YFP clipped Pex15ΔC30–V5, as well as the much smaller protected fragment (PF) that has the expected size of the Pex15 transmembrane domain–V5.</p></body></sub-article></article>
