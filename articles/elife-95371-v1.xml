While DCVs and synaptic vesicles (SVs) share fundamental SNARE/SM proteins for exocytosis, a detailed understanding of DCV exocytosis remains elusive. We recently identified the RAB3-RIM1 pathway to be essential for DCV, but not SV exocytosis, highlighting a significant distinction between the SV and DCV secretory pathways. Whether RIM1 is the only RAB3 effector that is essential for DCV exocytosis is currently unknown. In this study, we show that rabphilin-3A (RPH3A), a known downstream effector of RAB3A, is a negative regulator of DCV exocytosis. Using live-cell imaging at single-vesicle resolution with RPH3A deficient hippocampal mouse neurons, we show that DCV exocytosis increased threefold in the absence of RPH3A. RAB3A-binding deficient RPH3A lost its punctate distribution, but still restored DCV exocytosis to WT levels when re-expressed. SNAP25-binding deficient RPH3A did not rescue DCV exocytosis. In addition, we show that RPH3A did not travel with DCVs, but remained stationary at presynapses. RPH3A null neurons also had longer neurites, which was partly restored when ablating all regulated secretion with tetanus neurotoxin. Taken together, these results show that RPH3A negatively regulates DCV exocytosis, potentially also affecting neuron size. Furthermore, RAB3A interaction is required for the synaptic enrichment of RPH3A, but not for limiting DCV exocytosis. Instead, the interaction of RPH3A with SNAP25 is relevant for inhibiting DCV exocytosis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>rabphilin-3A</kwd><kwd>neuropeptide release</kwd><kwd>dense core vesicles</kwd><kwd>SNAP25</kwd><kwd>hippocampal mouse neurons</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>322966</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Verhage</surname><given-names>Matthijs</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Live imaging at single-vesicle resolution reveals rabphilin-3A as the first identified negative regulator of neuropeptide release in mammalian neurons.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neuropeptides and neurotrophins are crucial neuronal signaling molecules that play diverse roles in brain development, neurogenesis, and synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Malva et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Park and Poo, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">van den Pol, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zaben and Gray, 2013</xref>). These neuromodulators are sorted at the trans-Golgi network and packaged into dense core vesicles (DCVs). Similar to neurotransmitter release from synaptic vesicles (SVs), neuropeptide release is calcium and activity-dependent. However, unlike SVs, DCVs can fuse at various locations in the neuron, requiring higher and more sustained stimulation frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Balkowiec and Katz, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hartmann et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Persoon et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, all SNARE/SM proteins essential for exocytosis are shared between these two secretory pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arora et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Farina et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hoogstraaten et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Puntman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Südhof, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van de Bospoort et al., 2012</xref>). However, while SV secretory pathways are well characterized, a detailed understanding of DCV exocytosis is still emerging. We recently discovered that RAB3, a protein largely dispensable for SV exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schlüter et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schlüter et al., 2004</xref>), and its effector RIM1 to be essential for DCV exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Persoon et al., 2019</xref>). This indispensable role of the RAB3-RIM pathway signifies a main difference between SV and DCV exocytosis. Whether RIM is the only RAB3 effector that is essential for DCV exocytosis is currently unknown.</p><p>Rabphilin-3A (RPH3A) is a downstream effector of RAB3A that is highly expressed in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schlüter et al., 1999</xref>). RPH3A expression increases throughout development, similar to established synaptic proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baldarelli et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blake et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Krupke et al., 2017</xref>). RPH3A binds RAB3A and RAB27 and contains two lipid- and calcium-binding C2 domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guillén et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tsuboi and Fukuda, 2005</xref>). The second C2 domain (C2B) binds SNAP25 in a calcium-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deák et al., 2006</xref>). Similar to RAB3 null mutants, depletion of RPH3A shows no detectable synaptic phenotype in mice under normal physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schlüter et al., 1999</xref>), and only a mild phenotype in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Staunton et al., 2001</xref>). However, mutant mice do show increased synaptic recovery after intense stimulation, which is rescued by reintroducing full-length (FL) RPH3A but not a mutant that lacks the C2B domain. This suggests that RPH3A negatively regulates SV recycling after depletion of the releasable vesicle pool, and that this function depends on its interaction with SNAP25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deák et al., 2006</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the absence of RBF-1, the homolog of RPH3A, exacerbates the phenotypes of other SNARE mutants, as observed in the <italic>rbf-1/ric-4</italic> (RPH3A/SNAP25) double mutant, suggesting that RPH3A contributes to SNARE protein function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Staunton et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>The role of RPH3A in the context of DCV exocytosis within mammalian neurons remains unclear. Notably, a recent genetic screen in <italic>C. elegans</italic> revealed that <italic>rbf-1</italic> depletion increases the release of fluorescently tagged neuropeptides without affecting the frequency of spontaneous mini-EPSCs. This suggest a potential negative regulatory role for RPH3A in neuropeptide release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Laurent et al., 2018</xref>), opposite to RIM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Persoon et al., 2019</xref>). However, it remains uncertain whether RPH3A functions as a negative regulator in mammalian neurons, and whether, similar to synaptic transmission, the interaction with SNAP25 is important.</p><p>We set out to determine the role of RPH3A in DCV exocytosis in hippocampal mouse neurons, and to investigate the relevance of RAB3A and SNAP25 binding. We found that RPH3A did not travel with DCVs, but remained stationary at synapses. Using RPH3A null mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schlüter et al., 1999</xref>) we show that the absence of RPH3A indeed increased DCV exocytosis. Furthermore, RPH3A null neurons exhibit longer neurites and an increased number of DCVs. This effect was partly reduced when all regulated secretion was eliminated by tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hoogstraaten et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shimojo et al., 2015</xref>), indicating that the increased neurite length partially depends on regulated secretion. Finally, expressing a mutant RPH3A unable to bind RAB3A/RAB27A restored DCV exocytosis, but not when expressing a mutant RPH3A unable to bind SNAP25. This suggests that limiting DCV exocytosis does not depend on the interaction with RAB3A, but at least in part on the interaction with SNAP25.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>RPH3A is enriched in presynaptic structures</title><p>RPH3A is reported to localize to both pre- and postsynaptic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stanic et al., 2015</xref>), and on DCVs through its RAB-binding domain in PC12 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fukuda et al., 2004</xref>). We first determined whether RPH3A is expressed in excitatory or inhibitory mouse neurons. To test this, we immunostained for RPH3A in hippocampal VGLUT+ wildtype (WT) neurons and striatal VGAT+ WT neurons at 14 days in vitro (DIV14, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We found no difference in RPH3A expression between hippocampal and striatal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To localize RPH3A with higher spatial precision and confirm localization on DCVs, we performed stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy in hippocampal mouse neurons at DIV14. RPH3A staining was predominantly punctate and overlapped with the presynaptic marker Synapsin1 (Syn1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>) and, to a lesser extent, with the postsynaptic marker Homer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and C</xref>). RPH3A partly colocalized with DCV marker chromogranin B (ChgB, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and D</xref>). Pearson’s correlation coefficients were similar for RPH3A with either Syn1, Homer, or ChgB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), however, Manders’ overlap coefficient analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Manders et al., 1992</xref>) revealed that RPH3A colocalized significantly more with Syn1 than Homer or ChgB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). In addition, most RPH3A puncta contained Syn1, but not all Syn1 puncta contained RPH3A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). These data suggest that RPH3A is a synaptic protein with predominantly presynaptic accumulation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>RPH3A localizes to the presynapses.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images of wildtype (WT) hippocampal neurons (top) with zooms (bottom) co-stained for RPH3A (magenta) and Syn1 (cyan), Homer (green), or ChgB (yellow).

Three mutant versions of RPH3A: A C-terminal truncation (trunc.

These data suggest that the interaction with RAB3A is required for RPH3A’s synaptic localization. CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation may also be involved in the synaptic localization of RPH3A.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>RPH3A does not travel with DCVs</title><p>Recent evidence has demonstrated that RAB3A is transported together with DCVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Persoon et al., 2019</xref>).

This is in line with previous studies showing synaptic enrichment of RPH3A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mizoguchi et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stanic et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stanic et al., 2017</xref>). RPH3A showed mostly a punctate distribution, except in the presynapse, where it tends to accumulate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Previous studies showed that inactivation of <italic>synapsin1</italic> and <italic>2</italic> genes decreased RPH3A levels but increased phosphorylation of the remaining RPH3A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lonart and Simsek-Duran, 2006</xref>). Hence, synapsins may, directly or indirectly, contribute to presynaptic RPH3A accumulation, for instance as part of the phase separation of the vesicle cluster. In addition, phosphorylation reduces RPH3A’s affinity for membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Foletti et al., 2001</xref>) and therefore preferential presynaptic dephosphorylation may also help to explain the presynaptic RPH3A accumulation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>RPH3A does not travel with DCVs in hippocampal neurons</title><p>We demonstrated that FL and truncated RPH3A are highly stationary at synapses. However, a RPH3A mutant unable to bind RAB3A/RAB27A was more mobile (faster recovery after photobleaching, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), and lost its punctate distribution. This indicates that the synaptic enrichment of RPH3A depends, at least in part, on RAB3A/RAB27A interactions. This is in line with previous findings showing that the expression levels and localization of RPH3A in mammalian neurons are dependent on RAB3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schlüter et al., 1999</xref>). These data do not exclude that RPH3A interacts with immobile DCVs at synapses, potentially in a docked or primed state at the release sites, consistent with our conclusion that RPH3A serves as a negative regulator of DCV exocytosis. Based on these findings, we propose that RAB3A recruits RPH3A to DCV release sites, where it interacts with (immobile) DCVs and potentially competes with essential DCV proteins, such as synaptobrevin/VAMP2 and synaptotagmin-1/synaptotagmin-7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hoogstraaten et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van Westen et al., 2021</xref>), for SNAP25 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Role of RPH3A in dense core vesicle (DCV) exocytosis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) RPH3A binding to RAB3 through its RAB-binding domain (RBD) ensures confined presynaptic localization of RPH3A.

The increase in released fraction upon RPH3A depletion was most significant during intense, prolonged stimulation (16 bursts of 50 APs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>). During more distributed stimulation, a similar trend was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F–H</xref>). Together, these results suggest that RPH3A is a negative regulator of DCV exocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>). This is in line with <italic>C. elegans</italic> data, showing that the lack of the nematode homolog <italic>rbf-1</italic> increased DCV exocytosis, but had no effect on spontaneous release of SVs. This suggests that <italic>rbf-1</italic> limits DCV exocytosis only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Laurent et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, expression of FL RPH3A in PC12 cells reduced high KCl-dependent neuropeptide release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fukuda et al., 2004</xref>). In this study, we demonstrated that RPH3A also negatively regulated neuropeptide release in mammalian hippocampal neurons. Our prior estimations in mouse hippocampal neurons indicated that merely 1–6% of the total DCV pool undergo exocytosis upon strong stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Persoon et al., 2018</xref>), implying the existence of an inhibitory release mechanism. To our knowledge, RPH3A is the only negative regulator of DCV exocytosis in mammalian neurons identified so far, without substantial impact on SV exocytosis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>The limiting effect of RPH3A on DCV exocytosis partially depends on SNAP25 binding</title><p>We recently discovered that RAB3 and its effector RIM1 are positive regulators of DCV exocytosis in mammalian hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Persoon et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, we demonstrated that RPH3A serves as a negative regulator of DCV exocytosis. Given that RPH3A is a downstream effector of RAB3, and that RAB3 is necessary for synaptic RPH3A enrichment, we expected that the interaction with RAB3 plays a role in limiting DCV exocytosis. However, enhanced DCV exocytosis was rescued upon expression of a RPH3A mutant that was unable to bind RAB3A/RAB27A, suggesting that the limiting effect of RPH3A on DCV exocytosis is independent of an interaction with RAB3A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). This indicates that even though RAB3A is important for the localization of RPH3A, RPH3A can still limit exocytosis when its punctate organization is lost, suggesting that the interaction with RAB3A is not rate limiting. One other potential mechanism by which RPH3A could directly limit exocytosis is by limiting SNAP25 availability. Previous research has demonstrated that RPH3A binding to SNAP25 negatively regulates SV recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deák et al., 2006</xref>). We found that expressing mutant RPH3A that lacks SNAP25 binding in KO neurons does not fully restore DCV exocytosis to WT levels. This suggests that RPH3A limits DCV exocytosis by interacting with SNAP25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). The partial selectivity for the DCV secretory pathway may be attributed to RPH3A functioning as a downstream effector of RAB3A. RAB3 is essential for DCV exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Persoon et al., 2019</xref>) but largely redundant for synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schlüter et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schlüter et al., 2004</xref>). Based on our findings, we propose that RAB3A plays a role in recruiting RPH3A to synaptic exocytosis sites, where RPH3A might bind available SNAP25, potentially restricting the assembly of SNARE complexes and thereby inhibiting DCV exocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Increased regulated secretion in RPH3A KO neurons might lead to longer neurites</title><p>RPH3A KO neurons have longer neurites that correlated with the number of DCVs as shown before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Persoon et al., 2018</xref>). In agreement with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahnert-Hilger et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grosse et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Osen-Sand et al., 1996</xref>), we find that TeNT expression did not affect neurite length of WT neurons, but showed a trend toward shorter neurites in RPH3A KO neurons. Based on this, we speculate that the increased neurite length in RPH3A KO neurons might, at least partially, be driven by TeNT-dependent regulated secretion, in particular VAMP1, 2, or 3 mediated exocytosis. Given that neuropeptides and neurotrophic factors are key modulators of neuronal maturation and outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mu et al., 2010</xref>), and that RPH3A depletion leads to increased DCV exocytosis, it stands to reason that we observed longer neurites in RPH3A KO neurons.</p><p>The partial rescue by TeNT suggests RPH3A-dependent mechanisms that could explain the increase in neuron size besides regulated secretion. RPH3A could control neurite length by regulating the actin cytoskeleton. RPH3A interacts with actin via binding to ⍺-actinin and β-adducin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baldini et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coppola et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kato et al., 1996</xref>).

Regulation of the actin cytoskeleton has extensively been linked to neurite outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Meberg and Bamburg, 2000</xref>) making it plausible that lack of RPH3A alters actin regulation, resulting in longer neurites.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> C57BL/6J</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Charles River</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain code 631</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Rph3a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schlüter et al., 1999</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">–</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">See section ‘Animals’</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-chromogranin B (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SySy</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">259103</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1:500</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-RPH3A (mouse monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Transduction Laboratories</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">–</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1:1000</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-MAP2 (chicken polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Abcam</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ab5392</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1:500</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-Syn1 (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">#P610;

After 30 s of baseline, 2×8 (separated by 30 s) or 1×16 train(s) of 50 APs at 50 Hz (interspaced by 0.5 s) were initiated by a Master-8 (AMPI) and a stimulus generator (A-385, World Precision Instruments) delivering 1 ms pulses of 30 mA. NPY-pHluorin was dequenched 50 s or 80 s after the last stimulation train by superfusing Tyrode’s with 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl (replacing 50 mM NaCl). For a detailed protocol of DCV fusion analyses, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moro et al., 2021</xref>.</p><p>For co-travel experiments, neurons were infected with NPY-mCherry or NPY-pHluorin and FL or mutant RPH3A fused to EGFP or mCherry. Imaging was performed at DIV9–10 on a Nikon Ti-E eclipse microscope with a LU4A laser system, appropriate filter sets, ×60 oil objective (NA=1.4), and EMCCD camera (Andor DU-897). Sequential images for both 488 and 561 color channels were acquired for 2 min at 2 Hz. After 2 min, both axonal and dendritic stretches were photobleached to enhance visualization of moving vesicles entering the bleached area. A galvano laser scanner was used to scan a selected area with both lasers at 100% (26.9 μs pixel dwell time). Bleaching was followed by an 8 min acquisition at 2 Hz in both channels. To visualize NPY-pHluorin, neurons were continuously perfused in Tyrode’s containing 25 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl (replacing 25 mM NaCl). NPY-pHluorin showed more resistance for bleaching. However, this did not affect the experiment as bleaching was only applied to enhance visualization of moving vesicles and facilitate analysis.</p><p>For fixed experiments, confocal images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal laser-scanning microscope (×40 objective; NA 1.3) and LSM 510 software (version 3.2 Zeiss) or an A1R Nikon confocal microscope with LU4A laser unit (×40 objective; NA 1.3) and NIS elements software (version 4.60, Nikon). To determine both dendrite (MAP2) and axon (Tau) length, the whole glial island was visualized by stitching 4 images (604.7×604.7 µm<sup>2</sup>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Analyses</title><p>For DCV fusion experiments, ImageJ was used to manually place 3×3 pixel ROIs around each NPY-pHluorin fusion event on both axons and dendrites, excluding the soma. An NPY-pHluorin event was considered a DCV fusion event if it suddenly appeared and if the maximal fluorescence was at least twice the SD above noise. Custom-written MATLAB (MathWorks, Inc) scripts were used to calculate the number and timing of fusion events. The remaining DCV number per neuron was determined as the number of fluorescent puncta during NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> perfusion, corrected for overlapping puncta. The released fraction was calculated by dividing the total number of fusion events by the remaining pool size. For a detailed protocol of DCV fusion analyses, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moro et al., 2021</xref>.</p><p>For DCV co-travel experiments, segmented lines were drawn along the neurites and kymographs were created using the KymoResliceWide plugin in ImageJ. Puncta were considered moving if the minimal displacement during the whole 2 or 8 min acquisition was at least 3/4 µm within a 10 s period.</p><p>For fixed experiments, the number of endogenous ChgB+ puncta were counted using SynD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schmitz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van de Bospoort et al., 2012</xref>) software (version 491). All puncta were divided by the mode of the first quartile of puncta intensity values (an estimate for a single DCV) to estimate the total number of DCVs per neuron. Based on this, the total number of DCVs per neuron was quantified. To determine dendritic and axonal length, a mask was created using MAP2 and Tau immunostaining, respectively. Single-pixel images were obtained from the masks. The distances between the neighboring pixels within the dendrite mask are summed together to obtain the dendrite or axon length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schmitz et al., 2011</xref>). For colocalization experiments, the Pearson’s and Manders’ correlation coefficients were determined using the JACoP plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bolte and Cordelières, 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Statistical tests were performed using R or GraphPad Prism. Normal distributions of all data were assessed with Shapiro-Wilk normality tests and Levene’s test of homogeneity of variances. Multi-level models were used to account for variance within the animals when variance between animals significantly improved the model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aarts et al., 2014</xref>). To compare two groups, unpaired Student’s t-test in the case of normal distributed data or Mann-Whitney U tests for non-parametric data were used. For multiple comparisons the Kruskal-Wallis test was used for non-parametric data followed by Dunn’s multiple comparisons test to compare conditions. Data is represented as boxplots (25–75% interquartile range) with the median (line), mean (+), and Tukey whiskers or bar graphs with SEM. N numbers represent number of independent experiments, with the number of individual neurons in brackets. Dots in all graphs indicate single neuron observations, unless stated otherwise.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animals were housed and bred in accordance with Dutch and institutional guidelines.

Motivated by their earlier discovery that the Rab3-RIM1 pathway is essential for neuronal LDCV exocytosis, the authors now examined the role of the Rab3 effector Rabphilin-3A in neuronal LDCV secretion. Based on live, confocal, and super-resolution imaging approaches, the authors provide evidence for a synaptic enrichment of Rabphilin-3A and for independent trafficking of Rabphilin-3A and LDCVs. Using an elegant NPY-pHluorin imaging approach, they show that genetic deletion of Rabphilin-3A causes an increase in electrically triggered LDCV fusion events and increased neurite length.

Based on multiple live and confocal imaging approaches, the authors provide evidence for a synaptic enrichment of Rabphilin-3A and for independent trafficking of Rabphilin-3A and LDCVs.

Using mCherry- or pHluorin-tagged NPY expression and EGFP- or mCherry tagged RPHA3, the authors first analyse the colocalization of DCVs and RPH3A. Using FRAP, the authors next analyse the mobility of DCVs and RAB3A in neurites. The authors go on to determine the number of exocytotic events of DCVs in response to high-frequency electrical stimulation and find that RPH3A ko increases the number of exocytotic events by a factor 2-3, but not the fraction of released DCVs in a given cell (8x 50Hz stim). In contrast, the release fraction is also increased in RBP3A KOs when doubling the stimulation number (16x 50Hz). They further observe that RPH3A ko increases dendrite and axon length and the overall number of ChgrB-positive DCVs. However, the overall number of DCVs and dendritic length in ko cells directly correlate, indicating that the number of vesicles per dendritic length remains unaffected in the RPH3A KOs. Lentiviral co-expression of tetanus toxin (TeNT) showed a non-significant trend to reduce axon and dendrite length in RPH3a KOs. Finally, the authors use co-expression of RAB3A and SNAP25 constructs to show that RAB3A but not SNAP25 interaction is required to allow the exocytosis-enhancing effect in RPH3A KOs.</p><p>While the authors' methodology is sound, the microscopy results are performed well and analyzed appropriately, but their results in larger parts do not sufficiently support their conclusions.

However, in addition to neurotransmitters, neurons also secrete neuropeptides and neurotrophins, which are stored in dense core vesicles (DCVs). These factors play a crucial role in cell survival, growth, and shaping the excitability of neurons. The mechanism of release for DCVs is similar, but not identical, to that used for SV exocytosis. This results in slow kinetic and low release probabilities for DCV compared to SV exocytosis. There is a limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie these differences. By investigating the role of rabphilin-3A (RPH3A), Hoogstraaten et al. uncovered for the first time a protein that inhibits DCV exocytosis in neurons.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>In the current work, Hoogstraaten et al. investigate the function of rabphilin-3A (RPH3A) in DVC exocytosis. This RAB3 effector protein has been shown to possess a Ca2+ binding site and an independent SNAP25 binding site. Using colocalization analysis of confocal imaging the authors show that in hippocampal neurons RPH3A is enriched at pre- and post-synaptic sites and associates specifically with immobile DCVs. Using site-specific RPH3A mutants they found that the synaptic location was due to its RAB3 interaction site. They further could show that RPH3A inhibits DCV exocytosis due to its interaction with SNAP25. They came to that conclusion by comparing NPY-pHluorin release in WT and RPH3A KO cells and by performing rescue experiments with RPH3A mutants. Finally, the authors showed that by inhibiting stimulated DCV release, RPH3A controlled the axon and dendrite length possibly through the reduced release of neurotrophins. Thereby, they pinpoint how the proper regulation of DCV exocytosis affects neuron physiology.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their positive evaluation of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Data context</p><p>One of the findings is that RPH3A accumulates at synapses and is mainly associated with immobile DCVs.</p><p>However, Farina et al. (2015) showed that 66% of all DCVs are secreted at synapses and that these DCVs are immobile prior to secretion. To provide additional context to the data, it would be valuable to determine if RPH3A KO specifically enhances secretion at synapses. Additionally, the authors propose that RPH3A decreases DCV exocytosis by sequestering SNAP25 availability. At first glance, this hypothesis appears suitable. However, due to RPH3A synaptic localization, it should also limit SV exocytosis, which it does not. In this context, the only explanation for RPH3A's specific inhibition of DCV exocytosis is that RPH3A is located at a synapse site remote from the active zone, thus protecting the pool of SNAP25 involved in SV exocytosis from binding to RPH3A. This hypothesis could be tested using super-resolution microscopy.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their suggestion. We have now performed super resolution microscopy, see Joint Public Review item (i). However, these new data do not necessarily explain the stronger effect of RP3A deficiency on DCV exocytosis, relative to SV exocytosis. We have added a short discussion on this topic to the revised manuscript, see Joint Public Review item (iv).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Technical weakness</p><p>One technical weakness of this work consists in the proper counting of labeled DCVs. This is significant since most findings in this manuscript rely on this analysis. Since the data was acquired with epi-fluorescence or confocal microscopy, it doesn't provide the resolution to visualize individual DCVs when they are clumped. The authors use a proxy to count the number of DCVs by measuring the total fluorescence of individual large spots and dividing it by the fluorescence intensity of discrete spots assuming that these correspond to individual DCVs. This is an appropriate method but it heavily depends on the assumption that all DCVs are loaded with the same amount of NPY-pHluorin or chromogranin B (ChgB). Due to the importance of this analysis for this manuscript, I suggest that the authors show that the number of DCVs per µm2 is indeed affected by RPH3A KO using super-resolution techniques such as dSTORM, STED, SIM, or SRRF.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that this is a crucial issue, that we have not addressed optimally until now. We have previously devoted a large part of a previous manuscript to this issue, but have not referred to this previous work clearly enough. We have now clarified this (p 7, line 187-190). In brief, we have previously quantified the ratio between fluorescent intensity of ChgB and NPY-pHluorin in confocal microscopy over the number of dSTORM puncta in sparse areas of WT mouse hippocampal neurons (Persoon et al., 2018). This quantification yielded a unitary fluorescence intensity per vesicle that was very stable of different neurons. Although there might be some underestimation of the total number of DCVs when using confocal microscopy, the study of Persoon et al. (2018) has demonstrated that these parameters correlate well and that the estimations are accurate. Considering that the rF/F0 is similar in RPH3A WT and KO neurons (now Figure S2I), meaning that the intensity of NPY-pHluorin of one fusion event is comparable, we can presume that this correlation also applies for the RPH3A KO neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Major points:</p><p>(1) The authors perform an extensive analysis regarding the colocalization of RPH3A and DCVs (Figure 1 upper part). This analysis is hampered by the fact that the recorded data has in relation to vesicle size limited resolution (&gt; 1 µm) to allow making strong claims here. In my view, super-resolution microscopy would be required for the co-localization studies shown in Figure 1.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree and have now performed super-resolution microscopy, see Joint Public Review item (i)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The FRAP experiments (Figure 1 lower part) cannot be sufficiently understood from what is presented. The methods say that both laser channels were activated during bleaching but NPY-pHluorin is not bleached in Fig.1E. Explanation of the bleaching is not very circumspect. In 1D, it is rather EGFP-RPH3A that is entering the bleached area than the NPY vesicles. These experiments require a more careful explanation of methodology, observed results, and their interpretation. Overall, the observed effects in the original kymograph traces require a better explanation.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that NPY-pHluorin in Figure 1E (now Figure 2C) is not completely bleached. NPY-pHluorin appeared to be more difficult to bleach than NPY-mCherry. However, it is important to clarify that we merely bleached the neurites to remove the stationary puncta and facilitate our analysis of DCV/RPH3A dynamics. This bleaching step does not affect the interpretation of our results. We apologize that this was not clearly stated in the text and have made the necessary adjustments in legend, results- and methods section, (p 6-7, line 162-163; p 5, line 140-142 and p 19, line 508-513). Additionally, we apologize for the accidental switch of the kymographs for NPY-mCherry and EGFP-RPH3A in Figure 1D (now Figure 2B, C). We greatly appreciate identifying this error.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Figure 1: The authors need to mention whether axons, dendrites, or both were analyzed throughout the different panels and how they were identified. Is it possible that axons were wrapping around dendrites in their cultures (compare e.g. Shimojo et al., 2015)? Given the limited spatial resolution and because of this wrapping, interpretation of results could be affected.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree with the reviewer’s assessment and conclusion. We are unable to distinguish axons from dendrites using this experimental design. We have made sure to specify in the text that our observation that RPH3A does not co-travel with DCVs is true for both dendrites and axons, (p 5, line 150).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Figure 2: The exocytosis imaging is elegant and potentially very insightful. The effect in the RPH3A KOs is convincing. However, the authors determine the efficacy of exocytosis from NPY-pHluorin unquenching of DCVs only. This is only one of several possible parameters to read out the efficiency of exocytosis. Kinetics like e.g. delay between stimulation and start of exocytosis events or release time course of NPY after DCV fusion were not determined. Such analysis could give a better insight into what process before or after the fusion of DCVs is affected by RPH3A ko.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the reviewer. We have now included the duration of the fusion events (new Figure S2D-F). The start time of the fusion events are shown in the cumulative plots in now Figure 3F and I. The kinetics are normal in the RPH3A KO neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, it needs to be mentioned whether 2C and D are from WT or ko cultures. It would be best to show representative examples from both genotypes.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now adjusted this in the new figure (now Figure 3C, D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The number of fusion events is much increased but the release fraction is not significantly changed. While this is consistent with results in Figure 4C it is at variance with 4F. This raises questions about the reliability of the effects in RPH3A KOs.</p></disp-quote><p>The release fraction indicates the number of fusion events normalized to the total DCV pool. In Figure 4D, we observed a slightly bigger pool size, which explains the lack of significance when analyzing the released fraction. In Figure 4G, however, DCV pool sizes are similar between KO and WT, leading to a statistically significant effect on release fraction in KO neurons. Furthermore, Figures 4B and E distinctly show a substantial increase in fusion events in RPH3A KO neurons. This variability in pool size observed could potentially be attributed to variation in culture or inherent biological variability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given the increased number of ChgrB-positive DCVs in RPH3A KOs (shown in Figure 2) and that only the cumulative number of exocytosis events were analysed, how can the authors exclude that the RPH3A ko only affects vesicle number but not release, if the % change in released vesicles is not different to WT? Kinetics of release don't seem to be affected. Importantly, what was the density of NPY-pHluorin vesicles in WT vs. ko?</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 2 (now Figure 5) we show that RPH3A KO neurons are larger and contain more endogenous ChgB+ puncta than WT neurons. This increased number of ChgrB+ puncta scales with their size as puncta density is not increased. A previous study (Persoon et al., 2018) has demonstrated a strong correlation between DCV number and neuron size. Our data show that RPH3A deficiency increased DCV exocytosis, but the released fraction of vesicles depends on the total number of DCVs, which we determined during live recording by dequenching NPY-pHluorin using NH4+. Considering that this is an overexpression of a heterologous DCV-fusion reporter, and not endogenous staining of DCVs, as in the case of ChgrB+ puncta, some variability is not unexpected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also in these experiments, the question arises of whether the authors analyse axons, dendrites, or both throughout the different panels and how they were identified.</p></disp-quote><p>In our experimental design we record all fusion events per cell, including both axons and dendrites but excluding the cell soma. We have clarified this in the method section, (p 19, line 508 and p 19, line 521-522).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Figure 3: in D the authors show that ChgrB-pos. DCV density is slightly increased in KOs. How does this relate to the density of NPY-pHluorin DCVS in Figure 2?</p></disp-quote><p>We do not observe a difference in NPY-pHluorin density (see Author response image 1). However, it is important to note that we relied on tracing neurites in live recording images to determine the neuronal size. In contrast, the ChgB density was based on dendritic length using MAP2 (post-hoc) staining was limited. In addition, Chgr+ puncta represent an endogenous DCV staining, NPY-pHluorin quantification is based on overexpression of a heterologous DCV-fusion reporter. These two factors likely contribute some variability.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-95371-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors show a non-significant trend of TeNT coexpression to reduce axon and dendrite lengths in RPH3A KOs. While this trend is visible, I think one cannot draw conclusions from that when not reaching significance. The argument of the authors that the increased axon and dendrite lengths are created by growth factor peptide release from DCV during culture time is interesting. However, the fact that TeNT expression shows a trend toward reducing this effect on axons/dendrites is not sufficient to prove the release of such growth factors.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree.

It shows that the increased number of DCV fusion events in RPH3A KOs is related to the interaction of RPH3A with RAB3A but not with SNAP25. As mentioned above, it is irritating that the reduction of fusion events in KOs and on the release fraction is sometimes reaching significance, but sometimes it does not. Likewise, the absence of significant effects on DCV numbers is not consistent with the results shown in Figures 3C and D.</p></disp-quote><p>DCV numbers in Figure 3 (now Figure 5) are determined by staining for endogenous ChgB, whereas in Figure 4D and G DCV numbers are determined by overexpressing NPY-pHluorin and counting the dequenched puncta following a NH4+ puff.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Figure 1B: truncation of the y-axis needs to be clearly indicated.</p></disp-quote><p>We have replaced this figure with new Figure 1 and have indicated truncations of the y-axis when needed (new Figure 1E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Page 10: &quot;Given that neuropeptides are key modulators of adult neurogenesis (Mu et al., 2010), and that RPH3A depletion leads to increased DCV exocytosis, it is coherent that we observed longer neurites in RPH3A KO neurons.&quot; I cannot follow the argument of the authors here: what has neurogenesis to do with neurite length?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion.

Single cell RNA-seq already suggests the protein is expressed in both, but we nevertheless decided to test expression of RPH3A protein in excitatory and inhibitory neurons, using immunocytochemistry with VGAT and VGLUT as markers in hippocampal and striatal WT neurons. We found that RPH3A is expressed in both VGLUT+ hippocampal neurons and VGAT+ striatal neurons (new Figure S1A, B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The differential use of ChgB and NPY as markers for DCVs should be clarified and compared as these are used at different stages of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We have previously addressed the comparison between ChgB and NPY-pHluorin (Persoon et al., 2018).

Can the author comment on that? What was the reason for using this dual stimulation protocol?</p></disp-quote><p>There is indeed some facilitation between the two 8 x 50 pulses in KO neurons and to a lesser extent also in the WT neurons, which we have observed before in WT neurons (Baginska et al., 2023). Baginska et al. (2023) showed recently that different stimulation protocols can influence certain fusion dynamics, like the ratio of persistent and transient events and event duration. We used two different stimulation protocols to thoroughly investigate the effect of RPH3A on exocytosis, and assess the robustness of our findings regarding the number of fusion events. Fusion kinetics was similar in WT an KO neurons for both stimulation protocols (new Figure 2D-F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Figure 3 quantifies dendrites length and then moves to quantify both axon and dendrites for the Tetanus toxin experiment.

How does it reconcile with the main conclusion on neurite length?</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 3H (now Figure 6C) shows the effect of the KO on axon length: the axon length is increased in RPH3A KO neurons compared to WT, similar to dendrite length. Re-expressing RPH3A in KO neurons rescues axonal length to WT levels. In Figure S3, we observe a similar trend as in main Figure 3 (new Figure 6), yet this effect did not reach significance. Based on this, we concluded that neurite length is increased upon RPH3A depletion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) For lay readers, please explain the total pool and how you measured it. However, see the next comment.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree. We have now defined this better in the revised manuscript, (p 19, line 524-527 and p 20, line 535-539).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) It is a bit hard to understand if the total number of DCV was increased in the KO and if the pool size was increased and in which figure it is quantified. Some sentences like: &quot;A trend towards a larger intracellular DCV pool in KO compared to WT neurons was observed&quot; do not fit with &quot;No difference in DCV pool size was observed between WT and KO neurons (Figure S2D)&quot; or with &quot;During stronger stimulation (16 bursts of 50 APs at 50 Hz), the total fusion and released fraction of DCVs were increased in KO neurons compared to WT&quot;. They are not directly supported, or not related to specific figures. Please indicate if the total DCVs pool, as measured by NH4, was increased and based on that, the fraction of the releasable DCVs following the long stimulation. From Figure 2H, the conclusion is an increase in fusion events. In general, NH4 is not quantified clearly- is it quantified in Figure S2C? And if it is a trend, how can it become significant in Figure 3?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree there has been some inconsistency in the way we describe the data on the total number of DCVs. We have addressed this in the revised text to ensure better clarity. The total DCV pool measured by NPY-pHluorin was not significantly increased in KO neurons, we see a trend towards a bigger DCV pool in the 2x8 50 Hz stimulation paradigm (now Figure S2C), therefore the released fraction of vesicles is not increased in Figure 1G (now Figure 3G). The number of DCV in Figure 3 (now Figure 5) is based on endogenous ChgB staining and not overexpression like the DCV pool measured by NPY-pHluorin. In Figure 3 (now Figure 5) we show that RPH3A KO neurons have slightly more ChgB+ puncta compared to WT.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(12) In Figure 3, the quantification is not clear, discrete puncta are not visible but rather a smear of chromogranin staining. How was it quantified? An independent method to count DCV number, size, and distribution like EM is necessary to support and add further understanding.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that discrete ChgB puncta are not completely visible in Figure 3 (now Figure 5). Besides the inherent limitation in resolution with confocal imaging, we believe that this is due to ChgB accumulation in the KO neurons, as shown in now Figure 5D. Nonetheless, to address this concern of the reviewer, we have selected other images that represent our dataset (now Figure 5A). Furthermore, the number of ChgB+ DCVs was calculated using SynD software (Schmitz et al., 2011; van de Bospoort et al., 2012) (see previous reply). EM would offer valuable independent confirmation on the total DCV number, size and distribution. However, with the current method we already know that vesicle numbers are at least similar. Does that justify the (major) investment in a quantitative EM study? Moreover, this issue does not affect the central message of the current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(13) Can the author discuss if the source of DCVs that are released at the synapse is similar or different from the source of DCVs fused while neurites elongate?</p></disp-quote><p>With our current experimental design, we are unable to draw conclusions regarding this aspect. We are not sure how experiments to identify this source (probably the Golgi?) would be crucial to sustain the central message of our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(14) An interesting and related question: what are the expression levels of RPH3A during development and neuronal growth during the nervous system development?</p></disp-quote><p>While we have not specifically examined the expression levels of RPH3A over development, public databases show that RPH3A expression increases over time in mice, consistent with other synaptic proteins (Blake et al., 2021; Baldarelli et al., 2021; Krupke et al., 2017). We have now added this to the revised manuscript (p 2, line 55-56).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(15) The conclusion from Figure 4 about the contribution of SNAP25 interaction to RPH3A inhibitory effect is not convincing. The data are scattered and in many neurons, high levels of fusion events were detected. Further or independent experiments are needed to support this conclusion. For example, is the interaction with SNAP25 important for its inhibitory activity in other DCV-releasing systems like adrenal medulla chromaffin cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that further studies in other DCV-releasing systems like chromaffin cells would provide valuable insight into the role of SNAP25 interaction in RPH3A’s inhibitory effect on exocytosis.

However, the peak intensity induced by single NPY-pHluorin labeled DCV fusion events (quanta) was unchanged (now Figure S2I). This indicates that the decrease in ChgB puncta intensity must be due to a reduced number of DCVs (quanta) in this specific location. We have interpreted that as ‘clustering’, or maybe ‘accumulation’. However, we only put forward this possibility. We are now more careful in our speculations within the text, (p 11 line 271-277).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(19) Final sentence: &quot;where RPH3A binds available SNAP25, consequently restricting the assembly of SNARE complexes&quot; should be either demonstrated or rephrased as no effect of trans or general SNARE complex formation is shown.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree.

Additionally, the authors demonstrated that the number of DCVs is directly proportional to the number of DCVs per µm2, and that RPH3A KO reduces DCV clustering. This conclusion was drawn by comparing ChgB with NPY-pHluorin loading of the DCVs. However, this comparison is not valid as ChgB is expressed at an endogenous level and NPY-pHluorin is over-expressed. In the KO situation where DCV exocytosis is enhanced, the available endogenous ChgB may be depleted faster than the overexpressed NPY-pHluorin. Hoogstraaten et al. should either perform a study in which ChgB is overexpressed to test whether the difference in DCV remains or at least provides an alternative interpretation of their data.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. The reviewer challenges one or two conclusions in our original manuscript (It is not entirely clear to what exactly “This conclusion” refers): (a) “the number of DCVs is directly proportional to the number of DCVs per µm2”, and (b) “that RPH3A KO reduces DCV clustering”. The reviewer probably means that the number of DCVs per neuron is directly proportional to size of the neuron (a) and states this (these) conclusion(s) are “not valid as ChgB is expressed at an endogenous level and NPY-pHluorin is over-expressed” because “endogenous ChgB may be depleted faster than the overexpressed NPY-pHluorin”. We have three arguments to conclude that faster depletion of ChgB cannot affect these two conclusions: (1) DCVs bud off from the Golgi with newly synthesized (fresh) ChgB. Whether or not a larger fraction of DCVs is released does not influence this initial ChgB loading into DCVs (together with over-expressed NPY-pHluorin); (2) in hippocampal neurons merely 1-6% of the total DCV pool undergoes exocytosis (the current study and also extensively demonstrated in Persoon et al., 2018). RPH3A KO neurons release few percent more of the total DCV pool. Hence, “depletion of ChgB” is only marginally different between experimental groups; and (c) the proposed experiment overexpressing ChgB will not help scrutinize our current conclusions as ChgB overexpression is known to affect DCV biogenesis and the total DCV pool, most likely much more than a few percent more release by RPH3A deficiency.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Hoogstraaten et al. conducted a thorough analysis of the impact of RPH3A KO and its rescue using various mutants on dendrite and axon length (see Supplementary Figure 3). However, they did not test the effect of the ΔSNAP25 mutant. The authors demonstrated that this mutant is the least efficient in rescuing DCV exocytosis (Figure 4E). Hence the neurons expressing this mutant should have a similar size to the KO neurons. This finding would strongly support the argument that DCV exocytosis regulates neuron size. Otherwise, it would suggest that RPH3A may have a function in regulating exocytosis at the growth cones that is independent of SNAP25. Since the authors most probably have the data that allows them to measure the neuron size (acquired for Supplementary Figure 2), I suggest that they perform the required analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree this is important and performed new experiments to determine the dendrite length of RPH3A WT, KO and KO neurons expressing the ΔSNAP25 mutant. We observed that the dendrite length of RPH3A KO neurons expressing ΔSNAP25 mutant is indeed similar to KO neurons (new Figure S3C). Although not significant we observe a clear trend towards bigger neurons compared to WT. This strengthens our conclusion that increased DCV exocytosis contributes to the observed increased neuronal size.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors displayed the result of DCV exocytosis in two ways. One is by showing the number of exocytosis events the other is to display the proportion of DCVs that were secreted. They do the latter by dividing the secreted DCV by the total number of DCVs. These are visualized at the end of the experiment through NH4+ application. While this method works well for synaptic secretion as the marker of SV is localized to the SV membrane and remains at the synapse upon SV exocytosis, it cannot be applied in the same manner when it is the DCV content that is labeled as it is released upon secretion. Hence, the total pool of vesicles should be the number of DCV counted upon NH4+ application in addition to those that are secreted. This way of analyzing the total pool of DCV might also explain the difference in this pool size between KO neurons stimulated two times with 8 stimuli instead of one time with 16 stimuli (Sup Fig 2 C and D). This is an important point as it affects the conclusions drawn from Figure 2.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewed for this comment. We agree, and we have made the necessary adjustments throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The kymogram of DCV exocytic events displayed in Figure 2D shows a majority of persistent (&gt;20s long) events. This is strange as NPY-pHluori corresponds to the released cargo. Previous work using the same labeling and stimulation technique showed that content release occurs in less than 10s (Baginska et al. 2023). The authors should comment on that difference.</p></disp-quote><p>In Baginska et al. (2023), the authors distinguished between persistent and transient events. The transient events are shorter than 10s for the 2x8 and 16x stimulation paradigms, whereas persistent events can last for more than 10s. In our study we did not make this distinction. However, in response to this reviewer, we have now quantified the fusion duration per cell. These new data show that the mean duration is similar between genotypes for both stimulation paradigms. We have added these new data (new Figure S2D-F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figures 1D and E, some puncta in the kymogram appeared to persist after bleaching.

NPY-pHluorin was more resistant to bleaching than NPY-mCherry. However, we merely bleached the neurites to facilitate our analysis by reducing fluorescence of the stationary puncta without causing phototoxicity. Some remaining fluorescence after bleaching does not affect our conclusions in any way.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the discussion, the paragraph titled &quot;RPH3A does not travel with DCVs in hippocampal neurons&quot; is quite confusing and would benefit from a streamlined explanation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewed for this comment.
