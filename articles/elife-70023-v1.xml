Prognosis is poor if therapy is initiated after an early critical period. However, clinical observations have shown that recovery from amblyopia can occur later in life when the non-deprived (fellow) eye is removed. The traditional interpretation of this finding is that vision is improved simply by the elimination of interocular suppression in primary visual cortex, revealing responses to previously subthreshold input. However, an alternative explanation is that silencing activity in the fellow eye establishes conditions in visual cortex that enable the weak connections from the amblyopic eye to gain strength, in which case the recovery would persist even if vision is restored in the fellow eye. Consistent with this idea, we show here in cats and mice that temporary inactivation of the fellow eye is sufficient to promote a full and enduring recovery from amblyopia at ages when conventional treatments fail. Thus, connections serving the amblyopic eye are capable of substantial plasticity beyond the critical period, and this potential is unleashed by reversibly silencing the fellow eye.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cat</kwd><kwd>amblyopia</kwd><kwd>tetrodotoxin</kwd><kwd>monocular deprivation</kwd><kwd>metaplasticity</kwd><kwd>ocular dominance plasticity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Cat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 EY029245</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bear</surname><given-names>Mark F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99 EY029326</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fong</surname><given-names>Ming-fai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>153333</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Duffy</surname><given-names>Kevin R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Visual impairment caused by monocular deprivation early in life can be reversed rapidly at older ages by temporarily blocking all activity in the non-deprived eye.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Amblyopia is a prevalent form of visual disability that emerges during infancy when inputs to the visual cortex from the two eyes are poorly balanced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Simons, 2005</xref>). The most common causes of amblyopia are strabismus and asymmetric refraction, but the most severe type—deprivation amblyopia—arises from opacities or obstructions of form vision (e.g., by cataract). The current standard of care is to restore clarity (e.g., by cataract extraction) and focus, and then promote recovery of the weak amblyopic eye by temporarily patching the fellow eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wallace et al., 2018</xref>). However, the effectiveness of occlusion therapy is limited by poor compliance, variable recovery outcomes, and a significant risk of recurrence. Additionally, occlusion therapy is largely ineffective if it is initiated after age 10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">DeSantis, 2014</xref>) or, in the case of deprivation amblyopia caused by congenital cataract, after the first year of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Birch and Stager, 1996</xref>). The need for improved treatments for amblyopia is widely acknowledged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Falcone et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Quinlan and Lukasiewicz, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Studies over many decades in cats and monkeys have shown how temporary monocular deprivation (MD) sets in motion a series of changes in primary visual cortex (V1) that degrade vision through the deprived eye. As in humans, these changes can be reversed by temporarily occluding the fellow eye, but the effectiveness of this procedure is again limited to a brief critical period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Blakemore et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Blakemore and Van Sluyters, 1974</xref>). Rodents have become the dominant animal model for study of the synaptic basis of amblyopia, and an important recent development has been the finding from multiple laboratories that diverse manipulations, all culminating in a global reduction in inhibition by a population of cortical interneurons, can allow recovery from the effects of MD at ages beyond the classically defined critical period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bavelier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hensch and Quinlan, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sengpiel, 2014</xref>). As exciting as these results are, however, most of the manipulations used in mice and rats to promote adult recovery have limited applicability to humans. Some are not feasible in a therapeutic setting (e.g., interneuron transplantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Davis et al., 2015</xref>]) and others require systemic exposure to agents that have actions beyond visual cortex (e.g., cholinesterase inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Morishita et al., 2010</xref>] and ketamine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Grieco et al., 2020</xref>]), and none have demonstrated meaningful clinical efficacy in a human study to date (e.g., fluoxetine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Huttunen et al., 2018</xref>], citalopram [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lagas et al., 2019</xref>], levodopa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Repka et al., 2015</xref>], donepezil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chung et al., 2017</xref>]). Indeed, some treatments that work robustly in rodents have yielded disappointing results when investigated in other species with a more differentiated visual system, like the cat (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Holman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Vorobyov et al., 2013</xref>). It is now recognized that studies limited to a single species, particularly rats or mice with primitive visual systems, may be unreliable guides to human amblyopia treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Mitchell and Sengpiel, 2018</xref>).</p><p>In the current study we took a ‘bedside to bench’ perspective. One interesting observation in the human clinical literature is that significant recovery from amblyopia can sometimes occur in adults when the normal (fellow) eye is damaged or removed (enucleated) following injury or disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">El Mallah et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kaarniranta and Kontkanen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Klaeger-Manzanell et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Rahi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Vereecken and Brabant, 1984</xref>). Similar findings in cat and monkey models have been interpreted to mean that a mechanism contributing to amblyopia is the continuous suppression of responses to the deprived eye by activity through the fellow eye that is relieved by enucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Harwerth et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hendrickson et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Hoffmann and Lippert, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kratz and Spear, 1976</xref>). According to this view, fellow eye enucleation enables detection of previously subthreshold input from the amblyopic eye simply by decreasing inhibitory tone in V1, similar to what is observed following direct pharmacological blockade of GABAergic inhibition with bicuculline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Burchfiel and Duffy, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Duffy et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sillito et al., 1981</xref>). If this were the sole basis for the observed recovery, amblyopic eye responses would again disappear if inhibition was restored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bear et al., 1985</xref>). An alternative but not unrelated hypothesis is that eliminating activity in the strong eye via enucleation allows experience through the amblyopic eye to drive long-lasting synaptic strengthening. A window of opportunity for recovery could be opened by even the temporary reduction in inhibition, as well as by a number of other homeostatic molecular mechanisms that promote excitatory synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cho and Bear, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Cooper and Bear, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lee and Kirkwood, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Li et al., 2019</xref>). If this idea is correct, merely silencing the fellow eye temporarily should be sufficient to enable a lasting recovery. Thus, the ‘suppression removal’ hypothesis predicts that amblyopia will be immediately mitigated by silencing the fellow eye, but only for as long as that eye is inactive, whereas the ‘synaptic strengthening’ hypothesis predicts that recovery will outlast the period of retinal inactivation. We have conducted experiments in two species, mouse and cat, to distinguish among these alternatives. Our results show that temporary inactivation of the fellow eye after long-term MD can permanently restore vision through both eyes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Temporary monocular inactivation potentiates non-inactivated eye responses in mouse V1</title><p>We first sought to characterize the impact of temporary retinal inactivation on the cortical responses to visual stimulation in neurotypical mice, initiated at postnatal day (P) 47, which is after the critical period has ended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Gordon and Stryker, 1996</xref>). Recording electrodes were implanted into the binocular zone of V1 layer 4 to measure baseline visual evoked potentials (VEPs) in awake, head-fixed animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In agreement with previous studies, under baseline conditions, the response to stimulation of the contralateral eye was approximately double that of the ipsilateral eye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>). The contralateral retina was then inactivated for 1–2 days using the voltage-gated sodium channel blocker, tetrodotoxin (TTX), injected into the vitreous humor. During the period of inactivation, responses to stimulation of the contralateral eye predictably fell to noise levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Meanwhile, responses to stimulation of the non-inactivated ipsilateral eye rose dramatically, as would be expected by loss of interocular suppression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Pietrasanta et al., 2014</xref>). We continued to track contralateral and ipsilateral VEPs for several days as the effect of TTX dissipated and retinal activity returned. Importantly, responses measured during stimulation of the contralateral eye returned to baseline levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and E</xref>), indicating that retinal inactivation was fully reversible. Non-inactivated (ipsilateral) eye responses remained elevated above baseline after the contralateral eye responses returned, but diminished significantly over the course of several days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>). These results demonstrate that removal of the influence of the dominant eye immediately augments responses through the non-dominant eye, consistent with relief from interocular suppression, but can also set the stage for lasting potentiation of responses to the non-inactivated eye.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Temporary inactivation of one retina potentiates visual responses to stimulation of the non-inactivated eye in awake, late-adolescent mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of mouse brain showing recording site in binocular V1 (V1b) and tetrodotoxin (TTX) injection site into contralateral eye.

To model deprivation amblyopia, we subjected mice to long-term MD initiated during the peak of the classical critical period for juvenile ocular dominance plasticity and extending 2 weeks beyond its closure (P26-47). To assess the consequences of fellow eye inactivation in amblyopic mice, we monitored VEPs from V1 just after opening the monocularly deprived eye, and then for several weeks after delivering a single intravitreal injection of TTX into the non-deprived eye (MD then TTX group; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Littermate controls were distributed into two additional groups: one undergoing 3 weeks of MD followed by fellow eye saline injection (MD group) and another undergoing sham eyelid suture/re-opening followed by a fellow eye saline injection (Sham group). In all cases, the deprived (or sham deprived) eye was contralateral to the recording electrode while the injected non-deprived fellow eye was ipsilateral. Immediately following eye opening, both groups that underwent MD showed clear depression of deprived contralateral eye VEPs, with response magnitudes approximately half of those observed in sham controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>). Longitudinal tracking of these animals revealed little change in contralateral visual responsiveness over several weeks in sham or MD animals receiving ipsilateral eye saline injections, confirming stability of the visual deficit. Strikingly, however, animals receiving fellow eye TTX injections following MD showed a significant increase in deprived eye responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) to values that were comparable to sham controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The recovery of contralateral eye responses to normal levels was stable for many weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>) and occurred across a range of spatial frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). These results indicate that temporary inactivation of the fellow eye promotes rapid, complete, and apparently permanent recovery of amblyopic eye responses in V1.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Fellow eye inactivation in mice promotes stable and complete recovery of vision in both eyes following long-term monocular deprivation (MD).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>Left</italic>, schematic of mouse brain showing recording site in V1b, as well as sites of deprivation and inactivation in the contralateral and ipsilateral eyes, respectively. <italic>Right</italic>, timeline showing experimental manipulations and recording session times.

As cats are precious, in these experiments we opted for a treatment duration of sufficient length to adequately test our hypothesis. Before MD, all cats had balanced responses to stimulation of either eye, and this was strongly shifted after MD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) due to weaker responses to deprived eye stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–F</xref>). In three of the four animals, we allowed 1–2 weeks of binocular vision prior to initiating inactivation and verified that the impairment in deprived eye responses was stable. During the period of inactivation, fellow eye responses were reduced to the level of control frequencies and gray screen values, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Meanwhile, responses to stimulation of the previously deprived (non-inactivated) eye were gradually potentiated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–F</xref>).

To explore the effect of fellow eye inactivation on an anatomical marker of ocular dominance plasticity, we compared post-mortem analysis of dLGN soma size from three cats that had undergone 3 weeks of MD followed by fellow eye inactivation with age-matched controls. Animals that underwent MD alone showed the classic shrinkage of dLGN cells in deprived laminae compared with the non-deprived lamina in the binocular segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H–I</xref>). In contrast, cats subjected to MD that additionally underwent fellow eye inactivation showed comparable soma sizes in deprived and non-deprived dLGN lamina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H–I</xref>). Importantly, this was not the result of atrophy of cells downstream of both eyes, as the soma size of animals undergoing fellow eye inactivation was statistically indistinguishable from those of normally reared controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>).

Traditional therapies, such as patching the fellow eye, are beneficial only when initiated at very young ages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Birch and Stager, 1996</xref>). Even when patching is initially successful, recurrence of amblyopia is common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bhola et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Holmes et al., 2004</xref>). These observations supported the view that the brain loses plasticity shortly after birth, when synaptic connections are essentially set for life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">LeVay et al., 1980</xref>). However, experiments over the past 40 years in a number of species have shown repeatedly that under certain conditions synaptic connections in V1 remain mutable seemingly across the lifespan. Notwithstanding the enormous potential these findings have for the treatment of amblyopia, efforts to translate this knowledge to human benefit have so far been unsuccessful. The steep challenge that remains is to devise a strategy for harnessing this plasticity to promote recovery of function that can be applied in a clinical setting.</p><p>The current study was motivated by numerous human clinical reports that stable and severe amblyopia can sometimes remit in adults when the fellow eye is damaged or removed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">El Mallah et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kaarniranta and Kontkanen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Klaeger-Manzanell et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Rahi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Vereecken and Brabant, 1984</xref>). Our experiments were designed to test the hypothesis that this remission is enabled, not by permanent removal of interocular suppression by the fellow eye, but by eliminating activity in the eye only for as long as required to allow connections from the amblyopic eye to become reestablished in V1. The data, obtained in two evolutionarily distant animal models, clearly indicate that stable and severe amblyopia can be reversed following temporary inactivation of the fellow eye. This recovery from amblyopia is durable, persisting for weeks after the TTX has worn off and vision is fully restored in the inactivated eye, and is observed in animals at ages beyond the classically defined critical period.</p><p>While our project was underway, we learned that the <italic>Rd8</italic> mutation of the <italic>Crb1</italic> gene is present in the C57BL/6 N vendor line used in many mouse studies, including our own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Mattapallil et al., 2012</xref>). This mutation causes late onset retinal degeneration detectable by multiple light-colored spots in the fundus of the eye that correspond histologically to retinal folds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chang et al., 2002</xref>). As part of our routine post-mortem tissue evaluation, we examined retinas from both eyes under a microscope to check for abnormalities in every mouse. In total, data from three mice were excluded, each because of darkened patches or dimples observed in the peripheral retinas of eyes that had received intravitreal injections of TTX (n = 2) or saline (n = 1). We ascribed these lesions to poorly executed injections, as they were not observed in eyes that were untreated, but we cannot rule out the possibility that one or more of these abnormalities was the result of the <italic>Rd8</italic> mutation. Regardless of cause, every animal with an observable retinal abnormality was excluded from our analysis. Although there might have been lesions too small for us to detect, we are confident in the validity of our conclusions for several reasons. First, any retinal degeneration would be expected to affect both eyes equally and be present regardless of treatment. Second, the oldest mice we used were 3 months of age, whereas the retinal degeneration caused by the <italic>Rd8</italic> mutation is most severe in animals 10 months of age or older (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aleman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aredo et al., 2015</xref>). Third, the <italic>Rd8</italic> mutation in C57BL/6 N mice does not alter VEPs elicited by full-field visual stimuli, electroretinograms, or retinal ganglion cell and optic nerve integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Stojic et al., 2017</xref>). Finally and perhaps most importantly, our conclusions generalize to the cat.</p><p>The current findings can be understood in the context of ‘Hebbian’ models of synaptic strengthening. By inactivating the dominant input, adaptations occur in V1 that enable visual experience to drive potentiation of synapses that are otherwise too weak to be modified (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Clothiaux et al., 1991</xref>). In this conceptual framework, recovery might be further enhanced as activity in the fellow eye returns, analogous to the phenomenon of associative long-term potentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barrionuevo and Brown, 1983</xref>). We note that this additional bootstrapping of the weak eye input would not be available if the fellow eye were permanently removed, perhaps explaining why in humans, loss of the fellow eye leads to recovery from amblyopia in only ~10% of cases after age 11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Rahi et al., 2002</xref>). We are far more successful in reversing amblyopia after the critical period in the animal models using temporary inactivation of the fellow eye than what has been observed using enucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Dräger, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Harwerth et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Kratz and Lehmkuhle, 1983</xref>).</p><p>The end of the critical period is typically defined as the age when RO is no longer able to reverse the effects of early MD. In mice, the critical period has been estimated to end at ~P32 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Gordon and Stryker, 1996</xref>), so we were surprised to see that 7 days of RO initiated at P47 restored responses through an eye that had been rendered amblyopic with 3 weeks of MD. However, unlike what was observed with fellow eye inactivation, the improvement after RO was short-lived. Similar reemergence of visual impairment following RO has been reported in amblyopic kittens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Mitchell et al., 1984</xref>). It is noteworthy that although occlusion therapy is the standard of care for visual correction in children, approximately one-quarter of patients experience worsening vision through the amblyopic eye within a year after treatment concludes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bhola et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Holmes et al., 2004</xref>). These clinical findings highlight the importance of evaluating the long-term stability of recovery in preclinical studies. While a number of potential therapies for amblyopia have been identified in rodent models, long-term stability is rarely monitored.</p><p>Occlusion and retinal inactivation are qualitatively different manipulations of visual experience, and a key scientific takeaway is that they have profoundly different long-term consequences on synaptic efficacy in the visual cortex. Eye patching and eyelid closure degrade image form, but have little effect on the overall activity of retinal ganglion cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Kuffler et al., 1957</xref>). Rather, occlusion replaces spatiotemporally structured patterns of activity with stochastic noise. During early development, it has been shown that this retinal noise can rapidly trigger the synaptic depression in V1 that causes amblyopia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Cooke and Bear, 2014</xref>). In contrast, visual responses and thalamocortical synaptic strength are preserved in V1 following a comparable period of intravitreal TTX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Coleman et al., 2010</xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Frenkel and Bear, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Iurilli et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Rittenhouse et al., 1999</xref>). Although RO can promote recovery during the critical period, our experiments show that only inactivation produces a durable effect when initiated later in life.</p><p>Previous studies in cats and rodents showed that recovery from a brief period of MD could be promoted by prolonged immersion in complete darkness as well as by temporary bilateral retinal inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Duffy and Mitchell, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Fong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">He et al., 2007</xref>). It is possible that dark exposure, binocular TTX, and fellow eye inactivation all tap into a common mechanism, but there are some important differences. To be effective, the period of darkness must be long (≥10 days) and cannot be interrupted, even briefly, by light exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Mitchell et al., 2016</xref>). Treatment of both retinas with TTX overcomes some of these limitations, but so far has been shown only to reverse the effects of 1 week MD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Fong et al., 2016</xref>), which may be too brief to accurately model human deprivation amblyopia. Darkness and binocular TTX are also less effective than fellow eye inactivation in promoting anatomical recovery beyond the critical period peak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Duffy et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, from a clinical standpoint, total visual deprivation is not practical. These procedures are known to disrupt circadian rhythms and cause visual hallucinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Pang, 2016</xref>), and would necessitate continuous patient care and supervision. Thus, finding that monocular TTX treatment is effective in reversing amblyopia caused by long-term MD in both cats and mice represents a substantial advance.</p><p>The precise mechanisms that enable connections downstream of the amblyopic eye to gain strength following fellow eye inactivation remain to be determined. However, consideration of the published consequences of monocular inactivation and related manipulations may provide some insight. Similar to our observation that retinal inactivation significantly potentiates responses through the non-inactivated eye, both monocular enucleation and optic nerve crush in adult rodents augment the spared eye responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Nys et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Vasalauskaite et al., 2019</xref>). Unilateral retinal inactivation and enucleation both reduce markers of synaptic inhibition in V1 of monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hendry et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Hendry et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hendry and Jones, 1988</xref>) and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barnes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Maffei and Turrigiano, 2008</xref>), but interestingly, not in cats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bear et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Benson et al., 1989</xref>). Our data argue against the hypothesis that stable recovery is accounted for by the <italic>permanent</italic> reduction in interocular suppression, as this is not observed after unilateral TTX in the neurotypical mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and would not account for the anatomical recovery of dLGN soma size in the cat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>). However, a change in inhibition, even if transient, could be sufficient to promote Hebbian potentiation of excitatory synapses serving the amblyopic eye. Excitatory synaptic plasticity could also be facilitated by increases in principal cell excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barnes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Maffei and Turrigiano, 2008</xref>) and adjustments in NMDA receptor properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Philpot et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Quinlan et al., 1999</xref>) that have been observed after dark exposure, retinal inactivation, or enucleation. Any or all of these homeostatic adjustments after fellow eye inactivation could account for the observed recovery of vision after the critical period, and it will be of interest in future studies to pinpoint the essential modifications. Although we do not yet know the precise mechanism, this gap in knowledge does not preclude application of insights gained here to amblyopia treatment. The mechanism for recovery enabled by patch therapy during the critical period is still not known, and yet this is the current standard of care for amblyopia.</p><p>The strengths of the current study are that (1) it is one of the few to satisfy the ‘two-species’ rule for establishing potential clinical efficacy, (2) it distinguishes between two distinct hypotheses for how adult enucleation of the fellow eye enables recovery from amblyopia, and (3) the experiments demonstrate durable recovery from the effect of long-term MD when traditional treatment fails. An injection of TTX (or equivalent) into the eye is not without risks that need to be carefully considered before contemplating human application (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dossarps et al., 2015</xref>). However, histological analysis of the cat retina and optic nerve revealed no deleterious effect of 10 days of TTX treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">DiCostanzo et al., 2020</xref>), and the electrophysiological analyses and behavioral observations in the current study indicate complete functional recovery of vision in the injected eye. Similarly, experiments in awake, behaving monkeys show full recovery of visual acuity and eye reflexes following intravitreal TTX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Foeller and Tychsen, 2019</xref>). Complete retinal inactivation in cats and monkeys can be achieved with 1.5–15 µg of TTX confined to the vitreous humor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ataman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">DiCostanzo et al., 2020</xref>). In humans, 30 µg of TTX administered subcutaneously twice a day for 4 days was reported to be safe and well tolerated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hagen et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, new biodegradable polymers have recently been developed for therapeutic delivery of TTX to achieve prolonged and local sodium channel blockade without detectable systemic toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, there may be a path forward to apply this strategy for the treatment of deprivation amblyopia in adult patients.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse studies</title><p>Mouse experiments were conducted using male and female wild-type animals on the C57BL/6 N background.

For monocular inactivation experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), baseline recordings were conducted followed by intravitreal TTX injections into the eye contralateral to the recording electrode. Recordings were then conducted 1 hr, 24 hr, 48 hr, 4 days, and 7 days after the injection. Target sample size (number of biological replicates) was computed in SPSS for a power of 0.85 and effect size measured in pilot data (not included in study). For MD experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>), eyelid suture (or sham suture) was performed at P26. Deprived eyes were re-opened (or sham re-opened) at P47 (5–7 days after implant surgery), and the first electrophysiological recording from V1 took place 45 min later. Shortly after the first recording session, animals underwent either intravitreal injections of TTX or saline into the fellow eye, in some experiments with RO or sham RO. Recording sessions occurred weekly thereafter until P75. All recordings were conducted blind to deprivation and treatment conditions, and each littermate group was handled by the same experimenter each week. Target sample size was estimated based on previously published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Fong et al., 2016</xref>). At the conclusion of the experiment, mice were euthanized, and the brains and eyeballs were harvested for post-mortem analyses. In order to be included in the final data set, mice needed to meet all of the following a priori determined inclusion criteria: mice maintained good health status throughout experiment; eyelid stayed fully closed during MD and RO; a visually evoked response greater than noise was detectable through at least one eye at baseline; cornea, retina, and all parts of eyeball were healthy and intact; an electrode track was observable within L4 of binocular V1; at least one other same-sex littermate was included in another experimental group. In total, 25 of 104 mice were excluded for failure to meet these criteria (sutured eyelid opened early, n = 5; poor signal-to-noise, n = 2; malocclusion, n = 3, corneal abrasion, n = 3; retinal abnormality, n = 3; electrode track location, n = 5; absence of same-sex littermate, n = 4). Exclusions were made blind to treatment group, except in the case where animals were removed due to absence of a same-sex littermate in another treatment group; this rule was applied only after all other blinded exclusions were performed. After unblinding, post hoc examination of the exclusions showed corneal abrasions only in MD eyes and retinal abnormalities only in the injected eyes, but otherwise no systematic bias in exclusions between groups. Sample sizes reported refer to biological replicates (distinct animals used to capture the biological variation associated with each condition). Individual animals were tracked longitudinally, although technical replicates (independent repeated measurements at each time point) were not used.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-2"><title>Eyelid suture</title><p>Animals were anesthetized via inhalation of isoflurane (1–3% in oxygen), and body temperature was maintained on a heated surface at 37°C. Both eyes were moistened with sterile saline. For MD and RO, the eye being sutured first had fur on upper and lower eyelid of trimmed, and the eyeball surface rinsed with sterile saline. A thin layer of ophthalmic ointment containing bacitracin, neomycin, and polymysin was placed on the eye. The eyelid was closed using a single mattress stitch of polypropylene suture (Ethicon, 7–0 Prolene, 8648 G), with care taken not to touch the corneal surface, and a square knot was tied on the exterior of the lower lid. Ophthalmic ointment was applied where the suture needle passed through the eyelid. Nails on the forepaws were filed or lightly trimmed. For sham sutures, the suture was cut and removed just prior to turning off anesthesia. To remove sutures (3 weeks later for MD and 1 week later for RO), mice were anesthetized and maintained as previously described. The suture was cut and removed, and eyelids were gently separated. The corneal surface was rinsed with sterile saline and examined for signs of damage. Sham animals were anesthetized, placed under the bright microscope for an equivalent amount of time as MD and RO animals, and had their sham MD or RO eyeball rinsed.

For the injected eye, an ~500 nm incision was made at the temporal corner of the eye, and a sterile silk suture thread (Ethicon, 7–0 silk, 7733 G) was pulled through the exposed sclera. The suture was pulled toward the nasal aspect to secure the globe and expose the temporal aspect of the eyeball. A 30-gauge needle was used to penetrate to the sclera and globe. The eye was rinsed with sterile saline just prior to inserting a glass micropipette into the vitreous chamber. A nanoliter injector was used to deliver 1 µl of either TTX (1 mM in citrate buffer; abcam ab120055) or saline. The micropipette was removed 1 min after the injection.

The fur on top of the head was shaved and the exposed scalp was cleaned using ethanol (70% v/v) and a povidone-iodine solution (10% w/v). An incision was made along the midline and connective tissue on the skull surface was removed. A steel post was affixed to the skull anterior to Bregma. A craniotomy was made over the right prefrontal cortex for implanting a silver wire reference electrode on the cortical surface. Another craniotomy was made over binocular V1 (3 mm lateral of Lambda) contralateral to the monocularly deprived (or sham MD) eye, and a tungsten microelectrode (300–500 kΩ; FHC 30070) was lowered to L4 (450 μm from cortical surface). The steel posts and male gold pins coupled to electrodes were secured to the skull using cyanoacrylate. The skull was then covered in dental cement (Lang Dental, Ortho-jet, 1530WHT, and 1306CLR). Animals were removed from anesthesia and transferred to a heated recovery chamber. Meloxicam (1 mg/kg s.c.) was administered during this initial recovery phase, as well as for 2 days post-operatively. Health was carefully monitored by experimenters and veterinary staff, and supplemental fluids or heat was delivered if needed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-5"><title>Electrophysiological recording</title><p>All mouse recordings were conducted in awake, head-fixed animals with full-field visual stimuli presented on an LCD monitor in the binocular visual field at a viewing distance of 20 cm. On the days prior to the initial recording, animals were habituated to head restraint, gray screen viewing, and an opaque occluder that restricted vision to one eye or the other. On each recording day, local field potential (LFP) data were recorded from layer 4 of binocular V1 during visual stimulation sessions lasting 13.5 min per eye. Continuous LFP data were collected, amplified, digitized, and low-pass filtered using the Recorder-64 system (Plexon). Other than the visual stimulus, the experimental room was kept dark and free of distractions (e.g., neither the experimenter nor other mice were present in the room during the recording session).

Stimuli were presented in blocks consisting of 50 phase reversals at 100% contrast for each of the following pseudo-randomly presented spatial frequencies: 0.05, 0.2, 0.4 cpd. Each block of stimuli was separated by a 30 s presentation of a luminance-matched gray screen. A distinct orientation (offset by at 30° offset from any previously viewed orientation) was used each week, and only non-cardinal orientations were selected for presentation.

Meanwhile, the brains were harvested and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature. Tissue remained in fixation solution for 72 hr and was thereafter stored in PBS. Coronal slices of the V1 were made at 50 µm using a vibrating microtome. Slices were rinsed with water and phosphate buffer, and then mounted on charged glass slides (Fisher Scientific, 12-550-15). The mounted slices dried at room temperature and ambient humidity for 24 hr.

Slices were imaged on a confocal microscope (Olympus) using the transmitted light channel, and digital micrographs of electrode tracks were saved.

Four animals subjected to physiological assessment had their deprived eye opened and were administered four to five intraocular injections of TTX into the fellow eye immediately (C475), or following 1 (C476, C479) or 2 weeks (C474) of binocular vision. Animals underwent electroencephalogram recordings at various points throughout the experimental timeline. The number of animals used in the study was determined in consultation with veterinary staff, with three littermates being tested first in parallel, and one animal being tested later to validate results in an age-matched animal from a different litter. Three animals (C474, C475, C476) were euthanized at ~P110, and tissue was harvested for anatomical analysis. Anatomical assessments were made on two additional groups of animals, which acted as our controls. The first control group (n = 3) was normally reared until age 14 weeks and then received five injections of vehicle solution (citrate buffer) into the right eye. The second control group (n = 3) was monocularly deprived at P30 for 3 weeks.

Following the procedure, animals were administered Metacam (0.05 mg/kg) for post-procedure analgesia, local anesthesia was produced with Alcaine sterile ophthalmic solution (1% proparacaine hydrochloride; CDMV, Canada), and a broad-spectrum topical antibiotic (1% Chloromycetin; CDMV) was administered to mitigate infection after surgery.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-3"><title>Intravitreal injections</title><p>Upon completion of the 3-week MD period, animals were anesthetized with 3–4% isoflurane and the eyelids were opened. Either immediately or after a period of binocular vision, animals had their fellow eye inactivated with intravitreal injection of TTX (ab120055; abcam, Eugene, OR) that was solubilized in citrate buffer at 3 mM. Dosage was 0.5 μl/100 g body weight but irrespective of weight, injection volume never exceeded 10 μl per injection. This approximate dosage blocks action potentials of affected cells without obstructing critical cellular functions such as fast axoplasmic transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ochs and Hollingsworth, 1971</xref>). Injections were administered through a puncture made with a disposable sterile needle that created a small hole in the sclera located at the pars plana. Using a surgical microscope, the measured volume of TTX solution was dispensed into the vitreous chamber with a sterilized Hamilton syringe (Hamilton Company, Reno, NV) fixed with a 30-gauge needle (point style 4) that was positioned through the original puncture and about 5–10 mm into the chamber angled away from the lens. The total volume of TTX was dispensed slowly, and when complete the needle was held in place for about a minute before it was retracted. Following intraocular injection, topical antibiotic (1% Chloromycetin) and anesthetic (Alcaine) were applied to the eye to prevent post-injection complications, and Metacam (0.05 mg/kg) was administered for post-procedure analgesia. Animals received four to five injections, one every 48 hr, and for each injection the original puncture site was used to avoid having to make another hole. During the period of inactivation, we employed basic assessments of visual behavior and measured VEPs to confirm inactivation. We verified the absence of a pupillary light reflex as well as the lack of visuomotor behaviors such as visual placing, visual startle, and the ability to track a moving laser spot. These assessments were made while vision in the non-injected eye was briefly occluded with an opaque contact lens.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-4"><title>Electrophysiological recording</title><p>All cat recordings were conducted in anesthetized animals with full-field visual stimuli presented on an LCD monitor in the binocular visual field at a viewing distance of 70 cm.

Hair on the head was trimmed and a disposable razor was used to shave parts of the scalp where recording sites were located, two positioned ~2–8 mm posterior and 1–4 mm lateral to interaural zero over the presumptive location of the left and right primary visual cortices, and another site over the midline of the frontal lobes that acted as a reference. Electrode sites were abraded with Nuprep EEG skin preparation gel (bio-medical, Ann Arbor, MI), and were then cleaned with alcohol pads. Reusable 10 mm gold cup Grass electrodes (FS-E5GH-48; bio-medical) were secured to each electrode site using Ten20 EEG conductive paste (bio-medical, Ann Arbor, MI) that was applied to the scalp. Impedance of the recording electrodes was measured in relation to the reference electrode to ensure values for each were below 5 kΩ.

The current study is the first to demonstrate that silencing activity in one eye can promote stable recovery from amblyopia. These findings were unexpected for three reasons. First and most obviously, selective and reversible manipulation of activity in the fellow (non-deprived) eye has been attempted in many prior studies by simply occluding this eye (reverse occlusion), but this is well known to be ineffective in promoting recovery after an early critical period (Birch and Stager, 1996; Blakemore and Van Sluyters, 1974). Thus, based on the existing literature, there was no reason to suspect that silencing the fellow eye temporarily with TTX would be so efficacious. Second, recovery from amblyopia in previous rodent studies, including our own, was a consequence of <italic>global</italic> manipulations of V1 physiology, for example, by prolonged immersion in complete darkness (He et al., 2007), silencing both retinas with TTX (Fong et al., 2016), pairing visual stimulation with exercise (Kaneko and Stryker, 2014), environmental enrichment (Sale et al., 2007; Tognini et al., 2012), food restriction (Spolidoro et al., 2011), transplanting interneurons (Davis et al., 2015), dissolving perineuronal nets (Lensjo et al., 2017; Pizzorusso et al., 2006), invasive (Bochner et al., 2014) and systemic drug treatments (Grieco et al., 2020; Maya Vetencourt et al., 2008; Sansevero et al., 2019; Silingardi et al., 2010), or by genetic manipulations (Hensch et al., 1998; Morishita et al., 2010; Stephany et al., 2018; Syken et al., 2006). Thus, it is both surprising and exciting that a manipulation as simple, selective, and temporary as monocular retinal silencing effectively reverses amblyopia caused by prolonged monocular deprivation after the critical period. Furthermore, the fact that this was observed in both cats and mice indicates this is not a phenomenon limited to rodents with poorly differentiated visual systems and limited binocular vision. Third, the recovery from amblyopia observed after enucleating the fellow eye in previous animal studies has been modest, and ascribed solely to the persistent loss of interocular suppression (Harwerth et al., 1984; Hendrickson et al., 1977; Hoffmann and Lippert, 1982; Kratz and Spear, 1976). If this interpretation were the explanation for inactivation of the fellow eye, one would expect that recovery of amblyopic eye responses would revert once the TTX had worn off, rather than the substantial and sustained recovery that we document in our study. Thus, one would not have predicted effectiveness of unilateral retinal inactivation in producing sustained improvements in responses to the amblyopic eye based on previous findings. We have revised our manuscript to clarify these important points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The current manuscript used 3 weeks MD, which is described as &quot;long-term&quot;, whereas the authors' previous Fong et al. 2016 PNAS work used 1 week MD, which is described as &quot;short-term.&quot; Is there something scientifically or clinically significant about 3 weeks vs 1 week of MD, or a reason based on previous work to expect a different outcome or different mechanism for MD of these two durations? The 1 week MD seemed to have long term effects on visual processing, which were then reversed by binocular TTX. Most labs deprive for less than 5 days for short-term MD, so the distinction between the 1 week protocol in the authors' PNAS paper, when compared to 3 weeks in this current manuscript is less distinct. Do the authors believe that the augmentation responses in normotypical mice (Figure 1) involve different mechanisms than those underlying augmentation in LTMD mice?</p></disp-quote><p>The significance of 3 weeks of MD is that the duration continues beyond the end of the critical period, when we can be sure there is no opportunity for spontaneous recovery that can come with binocular visual experience following short duration MD in younger animals. Studies in cats have shown that functional ocular dominance shifts can occur with short duration MD by synaptic modification alone, without the gross anatomical changes (e.g., altered ocular dominance columns or modification of LGN neurons) that are hallmarks of long-term MD. In addition, molecules such as neurofilament that are linked to deprivation-induced neural modifications continue to change beyond 1 week of monocular deprivation (Kutcher and Duffy, 2007). We believe that if our findings are to be relevant to treatment of human amblyopia caused by months or even years of altered visual experience, it is important to push the duration of MD in the animals to match the consequences of chronic deprivation.</p><p>Our 2016 paper used 1 week of MD in both mice and cats because we had identified this as the minimum duration of MD that produced long-lasting electrophysiological and behavioral deficits, which were not ameliorated by binocular visual experience alone. We referred to 1 week as “short-term MD” in comparison to the current study, but we understand the confusion given that many labs (including ours) routinely use durations of MD of 1-5 days. We have replaced the term &quot;short-term&quot; with &quot;1 week” to remove this ambiguity and now indicate in the discussion the rationale for using 3 week MD.</p><p>The persistent augmentation observed after unilateral retinal inactivation in neurotypical mice fades over days and therefore differs from the stable enhancement observed in the amblyopic eye. We now emphasize this finding in the results and include relevant comparisons in Figure 1. However, we do believe the effect of silencing the dominant eye observed in the neurotypical mice is an important clue for how temporary retinal inactivation can open a window of opportunity for recovery from amblyopia. For example, if silencing one eye reduces excitatory drive onto inhibitory interneurons, this would lower the threshold for long-term potentiation of inputs from the amblyopic eye. A similar augmentation of the ipsilateral eye response is observed after longer term MD of the contralateral eye, and depends upon activation of NMDA receptors in both juvenile and adult mice (Cho et al., 2009; Sato and Stryker, 2008; Sawtell et al., 2003). As we discuss in the manuscript, this is one potential mechanism that we are eager to examine in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In the Discussion, the authors highlight the clinical importance of being able to use monocular retinal inactivation with TTX vs binocular inactivation. Is there also a scientific take-away, beyond the extensive previous work in the literature using monocular manipulations?</p></disp-quote><p>The take-away from extensive previous work was that monocular manipulations alone do not work after the critical period. The scientific take-away from the current work is that this dogma is incorrect, and that there is an important difference between degrading images in one eye (leaving spontaneous ganglion cell activity intact), and silencing ganglion cell activity altogether. Indeed, suturing closed one eye during the critical period invariably weakens cortical responses to this eye in neurotypical mice. Monocular retinal inactivation for a comparable period does not have this deleterious effect (Coleman et al., 2010; Frenkel and Bear, 2004; Iurilli et al., 2012; Rittenhouse et al., 1999), and the current study shows no detriment to the inactivated eye when treatment is applied beyond the critical period peak. We expanded the Discussion to emphasize this key point.</p><p>Without conducting additional studies in which rearing conditions and treatment parameters are perfectly matched, it is difficult to state definitively that monocular manipulations are superior to binocular (or other) manipulations. However, we have observed that anatomical recovery following long-term MD is superior with monocular inactivation than it is with either dark exposure or binocular retinal inactivation (Duffy et al., 2018). The apparent superiority of monocular inactivation in mature animals presumably originates from the activity driven by weak eye inputs during the period of inactivation. Unlike with binocular inactivation, weak-eye inputs continue to propagate unobstructed visually-driven activity that may be more conducive to recovery.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) A point the authors highlight as a strength of the current study is that it &quot; distinguishes between two competing hypotheses for how adult enucleation of the fellow eye enables recovery from amblyopia&quot; (the two models being disinhibition vs plasticity), but the support for this claim was not clear. The main evidence for plasticity vs disinhibition would seem to be the &quot;1 hour&quot; time point (methods say earliest recording was 45 min), which is only tested in Figure 1, and which uses inactivation of the contralateral retina, as opposed to the ipsilateral retina in the rest of the figures, which test recovery from MD. Also, the &quot;immediate&quot; tests still seem to provide ample time for plasticity to occur-45min to 1 hour is what is typically used in slice experiments to measure LTP and LTD.</p><p>There seems to be some inconsistency in the authors' discussion of this issue: they argue in the discussion that the non-inactivated eye response to temporary TTX injection points to homeostatic mechanisms rather than interocular suppression. However, on page 6, 1st paragraph of the results regarding normotypical mice, they write: &quot;These results demonstrate that removal of the influence of the dominant eye immediately augments responses through the non-dominant eye, consistent with interocular suppression.&quot; However, these results are similar to those noted for LTMD experiments with persistent augmentation after washout of TTX. Please explain this contradiction.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the confusion on this point, and appreciate the opportunity to clarify. Interocular suppression is an ongoing process that accounts for binocular rivalry—why different images presented to the two eyes at the same time are perceived sequentially rather than simultaneously (Mentch et al., 2019). Relief from interocular suppression occurs immediately and reversibly when one eye is occluded. Thus, it was not surprising to see the non-dominant eye responses increase as the activity was blocked in the dominant eye of neurotypical mice. However, it was unexpected that the enhancement of non-dominant eye responses lasted for days after the TTX had worn off and responses in the dominant eye had fully recovered. The explanation we favor is that temporary relief from interocular suppression can open a window for plasticity of excitatory connections serving the other eye. Thus, in the case of amblyopia, when the fellow (dominant) eye is inactivated, activity in the amblyopic eye is capable of driving the Hebbian plasticity in visual cortex that is the physical basis for the permanent recovery of vision. The competing idea is that there is permanent reduction in interocular suppression after temporary silencing of the fellow eye. This explanation is not consistent with our observations that in addition to electrophysiological responses, the soma sizes of dLGN neurons serving the amblyopic eye also recover in the weeks after temporary retinal silencing. The shrinkage of dLGN neurons after MD is a well-known structural correlate of weakened excitatory synaptic transmission in the visual cortex (Bear and Colman, 1990; Hubel et al., 1977), and their regrowth suggests a long-term recovery of the strength of these inputs. We have updated the text in the Abstract, Introduction, and Discussion to clarify the distinctions between these hypotheses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) TTX was injected once in mice and 4-5 times in cats; a rationale should be provided for these choices. Does one injection not work in cats? Also, the Fong et al. 2016 study used 2 TTX binocular injections in cats; are more injections required for monocular injections?</p></disp-quote><p>This remains to be investigated fully. As cats are precious, we opted for a treatment duration of sufficient length that our hypothesis could be adequately tested. However, as shown in Figure 4E, changes in deprived-eye responses are clearly evident after a single injection of TTX into the fellow eye.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) C57BL6/N mice from Charles River are known to have retinal degeneration, (Mattapallil et al., 2012, Investigative Ophthalmology &amp; Visual Science, May 2012, Vol. 53, No. 6 ). Please report whether your mice have retinal degeneration, as this could influence the interpretation of the results, particularly in experiments involving older mice.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point and is broadly relevant to vision researchers. Admittedly, we learned of the rd8 mutation in the Crb1 gene (present in the retinal Muller glial cells) of C57BL/6N mice in the middle of our experiments and elected to continue using this sub-strain for within-study consistency. As part of our routine post-mortem tissue evaluation, we examined retinas from both eyes under a microscope to check for abnormalities. In total, data from 3 mice were excluded, each because of darkened patches/dimples observed in the peripheral retina. We believe these were the result of a poorly-aligned intravitreal injection because unblinding revealed that all cases were in the injected eyes of mice administered TTX (n=2) or saline (n=1). Although we cannot rule out the possibility that one or more of these abnormalities was the result of the rd8 mutation, we can say any animal with an observable retinal abnormality was excluded regardless of cause. Although we acknowledge that longitudinal in-vivo fundus imaging or OCT would provide a stronger evaluation of smaller retinal lesions, we did not have these tools available. While conceding the possibility that there might be lesions too small for us to detect, we believe the overall interpretation of our data is valid for several reasons:</p><p>1. The C57BL/6N sub-strain was used throughout the study, and the age of animals at the time of monocular deprivation and intravitreal injection is the same for all animals, including littermate controls.</p><p>2. Both eyes are equally susceptible to retinal degeneration.</p><p>3. We used full-field visual stimuli, rather than stimulating an isolated portion of the retina.</p><p>4. The rd8 mutation is most severe in animals 10 months or older (Aleman et al., 2011; Aredo et al., 2015). Our oldest mice were 3 months old.</p><p>5. The rd8 mutation found in C57BL/6N mice does not alter visually-evoked potentials, electroretinograms, or retinal ganglion cell / optic nerve integrity (Stojic et al., 2017).</p><p>6. The findings generalize across species.</p><p>To avoid concerns about retinopathy in the future, newer experiments are being conducted on the C57BL/6J substrain. We have detected no difference in response to MD or TTX, but we will report if any differences emerge.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Involvement (or not) of some of the known mechanisms of critical period plasticity, including, excitation-inhibition balance, chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans (CSPGs), myelin-derived factors (Nogo, MAG, OMgp etc) signaling, histone deacetylases (HDAC), and PirB, should be tested in mice. The results, positive or negative or mixed, would be helpful for understanding the mechanism underlying temporary inactivation induced recovery.</p></disp-quote><p>We enthusiastically agree with the reviewer that it is now of great interest to examine the potential contribution of each of these mechanisms to the effects we observe with temporary retinal silencing, and also to determine if these apply to species other than rodents. However, testing the contributions of each of these mechanisms will require a large-scale effort that is beyond the scope of the current project. As we note in the manuscript, the failure to have identified the mechanism for patch therapy has not precluded its use in clinical practice, so we believe our findings are of great value even without knowledge of the mechanism. Nevertheless, we are committed to investigating the mechanisms involved in promoting recovery in future studies.</p><p>References</p><p>Aleman, T.S., Cideciyan, A.V., Aguirre, G.K., Huang, W.C., Mullins, C.L., Roman, A.J., Sumaroka, A., Olivares, M.B., Tsai, F.F., Schwartz, S.B.<italic>, et al.</italic> (2011).
