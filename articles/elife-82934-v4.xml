development of cancer and therapy resistance. Although mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can actively migrate to tumor sites, their impact on chimeric antigen receptor modified T cell (CAR-T) immunotherapy has been little addressed. Using an in vitro cell co-culture model including lymphoma cells and macrophages, here we report that CAR-T cell-mediated cytotoxicity was significantly inhibited in the presence of MSCs. MSCs caused an increase of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and Treg cells but a decrease of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. In addition, MSCs stimulated the expression of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase and programmed cell death-ligand 1 which contributes to the immune-suppressive function of tumors. Moreover, MSCs suppressed key components of the NLRP3 inflammasome by modulating mitochondrial reactive oxygen species release. Interestingly, all these suppressive events hindering CAR-T efficacy could be abrogated if the stanniocalcin-1 (STC1) gene, which encodes the glycoprotein hormone STC-1, was knockdown in MSC. Using xenograft mice, we confirmed that CAR-T function could also be inhibited by MSC in vivo, and STC1 played a critical role. These data revealed a novel function of MSC and STC-1 in suppressing CAR-T efficacy, which should be considered in cancer therapy and may also have potential applications in controlling the toxicity arising from the excessive immune response.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Immunotherapy is a type of cancer treatment that helps the immune system fight cancer. For example, chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy is used to target several types of blood cancer. It works by reprogramming patients’ immune cells to target specific tumor cells. In blood cancers, CAR-T therapy works very well, but it can cause extreme responses from the patient’s immune system, which can be life threatening. In solid tumors, CAR-T therapy is much less successful because the tumors secrete molecules into the space surrounding them, which weaken the immune processes that attack cancerous cells.</p><p>Stem cells are the master cells of the body. Originating in the bone marrow, they can repair and regenerate the body’s cells. Cancer stem cells play a role in resistance to CAR-T therapy, due – in part – to their ability to renew themselves, but the role of another type of stem cell, called mesenchymal stem cells, was less clear. Mesenchymal stem cells develop into tissues that line organs and blood vessels. Although it is known that mesenchymal stem cells are present in most cancers and play a role in shaping and influencing the space around tumors, their impact on CAR-T therapy has not been studied in depth.</p><p>To find out more, Zhang et al. looked at the influence of a protein, called staniocalcin-1 (STC1), on CAR-T therapy, by studying cells grown in the laboratory and human tumor cells that had been implanted in mice.</p><p>Zhang et al. found that mesenchymal stem cells reduce the ability of CAR-T therapy to destroy cancer cells and that they needed STC1 to do this successfully. They also increased the expression of molecules that dampen the immune system, and suppressed molecules called inflammasomes, which are an important part of the way the immune system detects disease. Moreover, reducing the amount of STC1 that mesenchymal stem cells expressed restored the effectivity of CAR-T therapy.</p><p>This study increases our understanding of the way that mesenchymal stem cells affect CAR-T therapy. It has the potential to open up a new way of improving the efficiency of this treatment and of reducing the harmful side effects that it can cause.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mesenchymal stem cells</kwd><kwd>CAR-T</kwd><kwd>stanniocalcin-1</kwd><kwd>cancer therapy</kwd><kwd>macrophages</kwd><kwd>pfeiffer cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018YFA0901702</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Wenjian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Shandong Key Research and Development Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019GSF107088</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Qingxi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Science Foundation of Shandong</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZR202111220001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Wenjian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Science Foundation of Shandong</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZR2020MC077</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Wenjian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The stanniocalcin-1-dependent immunosuppressive roles of mesenchymal stem cell on chimeric antigen receptor modified T cell therapy.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Advances in chimeric antigen receptor modified T cell therapy (CAR-T) in recent years have shown enormous promise in cancer immunotherapy, which has produced unprecedented clinical outcomes, most notably for patients with hematologic malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Singh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Park et al., 2018</xref>). Despite the striking achievements, CAR-T therapy is also facing many challenges such as the treatment-related severe toxicity and side effects, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hong et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Freyer and Porter, 2020</xref>). CRS is the most common acute toxicity associated with an excessive immune response that causes fever, hypotension, and respiratory insufficiency. The neurotoxicity induced by CAR-T therapy exhibits a diverse array of neurologic symptoms such as tremors, expressive aphasia, and impaired attention. The precise mechanism that causes these life-threatening side effects remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Freyer and Porter, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jiang et al., 2019</xref>). On the other hand, the success of CAR-T therapy in treating solid tumors is still very limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Martinez and Moon, 2019</xref>). Identifying hurdles and potential mechanisms that impede the function of CAR-T cells is of vital importance to expanding its use. The immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) is one of the obstacles that diminishes the efficacy of CAR-T therapy, especially for solid tumors.</p><p>Among the many factors that can modulate TME and immune response, the impact of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) on CAR-T therapy has been little studied. MSC is a type of adult stem cell with high proliferative activity and multidirectional differentiation capacity. However, MSCs have additional paracrine effects that are believed to underlie their therapeutic functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jiang and Xu, 2020</xref>). By secreting a variety of cytokines into the tissue microenvironment, it has been known that MSCs can modulate extracellular matrix, promote angiogenesis, and suppress inflammation and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Keating, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Regmi et al., 2019</xref>). Some MSC-secreted cytokines, such as stromal cell-derived factor 1 and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/stem-cell-factor">stem cell factor</ext-link>, play important roles in hematopoietic and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/immunoregulation">immune regulation</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kawaguchi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Markov et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, studies suggest that MSCs can modulate the function of monocytic lineages cells, especially macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Németh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">YlÖstalo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Choi et al., 2011</xref>). Some reports also showed that MSCs could directly affect the functionality and cellular responses of T cells, Tregs, and memory T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tumangelova-Yuzeir et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Luque-Campos et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>It was reported that human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) could be activated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages to increase the expression and secretion of stanniocalcin-1 (STC1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Oh et al., 2014</xref>). STC1 was a mitochondria-related glycoprotein originally identified as a calcium/phosphate regulating hormone in bony fishes, and later on, it was found to be a pleiotropic factor involved in various degenerative diseases such as ocular and renal disease, as well as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yeung et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ohkouchi et al., 2015</xref>). STC1 could improve the cell survival and regeneration of MSCs in a paracrine fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ono et al., 2015</xref>). There was also evidence suggesting that STC1 played an oncogenic role in various types of tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Du et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2010</xref>). Based on a retrospective study of ~1500 clinical samples, it was concluded that high STC1 expression is associated with the poor clinical outcome of breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chang et al., 2015</xref>). It was proved that STC1 is involved in several oxidative and cancer-related signaling pathways, such as NF-κB, extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nguyen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chan et al., 2017</xref>). The expression and secretion of STC1 in cancer tissue can be stimulated by external stimuli, including external cytokines and oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nguyen et al., 2009</xref>). Under hypoxia conditions, STC1 could be modulated by Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) to facilitate the reprogramming of tumor metabolism from oxidative to glycolytic metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yeung et al., 2005</xref>). STC1 was also reported to participate in the process of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, which is associated with tumor invasion and the reshape of the tumor microenvironment, as well as increasing therapy resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pastushenko and Blanpain, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Considering the pleiotropic role of STC1, especially its intercellular linkage between MSCs, cancer cells, and macrophage stimulation, it is interesting to know what role it plays in connection to the functions of MSC in TME. Therefore, we generated a stable STC1 knockdown MSC cell line. With a cell co-culture model containing CAR-T cells, hMSCs, macrophages, and Pfeiffer lymphoma cells to partially mimic the tumor microenvironment together with a xenograft mice model, here we studied the impacts of MSC on CAR-T efficacy and the potential immune response change in the presence and absence of STC1.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Stable knockdown of STC1 in hMSC-inhibited cell migration, slightly suppressed cell proliferation, but no increase in apoptosis</title><p>To study the function of STC1, we first generated a stable knockdown cell line by lentivirus-based shRNA for the STC1 gene, and the expression of STC1 protein was evaluated by Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). STC1 stable knockdown in hMSCs exhibited a minor effect in cell survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and slightly reduced proliferation rate based on the small increase in the proportion of cells in G0/G1 phases versus that in the S phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) as determined by MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) and Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting (FACS) analysis. To investigate whether knockdown of STC1 affects cell migration, wound healing and transwell chamber assays were performed. After creating a ‘scratch’ in a monolayer of hMSCs, the closure of the gap was determined after 24 hr. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, compared to control hMSCs, the gap was less filled in hMSC<sup>sh</sup><italic><sup>STC1</sup></italic>. The inhibitory effect on cell migration was further confirmed by a transwell assay. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, there were significant migration and invasion observed in hMSCs<sup>shCtrl</sup>, whereas there was a &gt;30% reduction in migration across the transwell chamber membrane in hMSCs<sup>sh</sup><italic><sup>STC1</sup></italic>. To further determine whether knockdown of STC1 may have any lethal effect, apoptosis was determined by two different assays. To measure the early apoptosis, cells were stained with the Alexa Fluor 488 annexin V and the propidium iodide (PI) followed by flow cytometry to detect apoptosis-associated phosphatidylserine (PS) expression and membrane permeability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Parallelly, no DNA fragmentation was detected as determined with the TUNEL assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, the green dots were from the background due to overexposure). Both studies showed that knockdown of STC1 did not cause apoptosis of hMSCs.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The impact of stanniocalcin-1 (STC1) knockdown on cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis of hMSCs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blot analysis of STC1 protein expression in hMSCs.

The co-culture contained CD19 CAR-T cells, Pfeiffer cells that were from human diffuse large cell lymphoma, and M2 macrophages (derived from THP-1 cells by phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate [PMA] polarization for 24 hr) at a cell number ratio of 1:3:1. The cell-killing activity of CAR-T cells toward Pfeiffer cells was determined by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) cytotoxicity assay on total cell co-culture.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>, the ratio between CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> was about 1:4 when there were no hMSCs in co-culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). However, the addition of hMSC caused a significant increase of CD4<sup>+</sup> and a decrease of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), resulting in a ratio change to 2:1. Similar to the change of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, the percentage of regulatory T cells (Treg) was also significantly increased from ~3 to 12% when co-culture with hMSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>).

IDO and PD-L1 are two of the most important immunosuppressive proteins. IDO is an intracellular enzyme that converts tryptophan into inhibitory metabolites for T-cell activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ninomiya et al., 2015</xref>).

In addition, the macrophage is a critical part of immune response and an important regulator of immunotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">DeNardo and Ruffell, 2019</xref>). To further identify the mechanisms mediating the inhibitory effects of hMSCs, the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome was determined. The NLRP3 inflammasome is a critical component of the innate immune system mediating caspase-1 activation and proinflammatory cytokines secretion in response to harmful stimuli such as infection and endogenous stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Menu and Vince, 2011</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, the release of cleaved caspase-1 p20 in cell lysates, which is the indicator of caspase-1 activation, was detected after the PMA polarization of THP-1 cells to form the M1 macrophages (M-THP1). Following co-culture with CD19 CAR-T, the level of cleaved caspase-1 was significantly upregulated. The increase of active caspase-1 was abrogated when hMSCs were added into the co-culture. knock-down of STC1 led to another reverse and completely blocked the inhibitory function of hMSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Concomitant with the reduction in active caspase-1, the cleaved IL-1β mature form and absent-in-melanoma 2 (AIM2), two key components of the inflammasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kelley et al., 2019</xref>), were both increasingly expressed following M-THP1 polarization and further incubation with CAR-T (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

This result suggests that the immune-suppressive effect of hMSC was through its impact on macrophages, not CAR-T or Pfeiffer cells.

Previous studies have been mainly focused on the role of cancer stem cells. In the current study, we presented evidences that the presence of MSCs in TME may also be an important source of cancer treatment resistance. By modulating TME, MSCs showed a strong suppressive function on CAR-T efficacy toward lymphoma cells, and interestingly, the presence of the STC1 gene played a critical role.</p><p>The role of STC1 in cancer is paradoxical. Some reports showed that it exerts an oncogenic role, whereas other studies suggested the opposite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). The aberrant expression of STC1 has been reported to impact various types of cancer, such as triggering tumor angiogenesis by upregulating the expression of VEGF in gastric cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">He et al., 2011</xref>), causing tumorigenesis and poor clinical outcomes in ovarian, colorectal, and lung cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yeung et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). To date, the potential roles of STC1 in immunotherapy are still largely unknown. Here, we demonstrated that the presence of STC1 is critical for MSC to exert its immunosuppressive role by inhibiting cytotoxic T cell subsets, activating some key immune suppressive/escape mechanisms, and crosstalk with other immune cells.</p><p>First, a significant downregulation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T Cells together with the upregulation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T helper cell subsets and Tregs indicated that the suppressed CAR-T efficacy was at least partially associated with MSC’s function in modulating the proliferation of different T-cell subsets. Since the suppression of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was completely abrogated if knockdown STC1 in MSCs, it is clear that STC1 played a key role here. Moreover, considering that STC1 is secreted into the extracellular matrix in a paracrine manner, MSCs’ modulation of the T cell subsets is most likely indirectly via altered cytokine expression or other secondary molecules activated by STC1. In line with our study, it was recently reported that STC-1 negatively correlates with immunotherapy efﬁcacy and T cell activation by trapping calreticulin, which abrogates membrane calreticulin-directed antigen presentation function and phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lin et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The presence of MSCs also stimulated the expression of IDO and PD-L1, two important immune-suppressive molecules. Upregulation of IDO is an endogenous feedback mechanism controlling excessive immune responses, which can be produced both by tumor cells and macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Uyttenhove et al., 2003</xref>). IDO-mediated formation of immunosuppressive metabolites can inhibit T-cell proliferation and induce T-cell death through the dioxin receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Opitz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Frumento et al., 2002</xref>). PD-L1 is a well-characterized molecule of the major escape mechanism of immunotherapy by inhibiting PD-1-mediated effector T cell function and downregulating antigen tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ribas and Hu-Lieskovan, 2016</xref>). There have been numerous studies reporting the bidirectional interactions between MSCs and cancer cells, resulting in regulating the expression of PD-L1 on the surface of various cancer cells or TME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aboulkheyr and Bigdeli, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Krueger et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">O’Malley et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sun et al., 2018</xref>). Importantly, here we demonstrated that the upregulated expression of both IDO and PD-L1 by MSCs was much reduced if the STC1 gene was knockdown.</p><p>The paracrine activity of MSCs is now widely recognized as an important cellular mechanism to communicate with immune cells and various other cell types in TME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Teixeira et al., 2013</xref>). Consistent with previous studies, we found that the addition of hMSCs to the co-culture cell model suppressed the formation of NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages as determined by the downregulation of some key proteins including IL-1β, the activated caspase-1, and AIM. It was reported that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells could inhibit inflammasome-mediated caspase-1 activation and IL-1β release through TNF ligands or by interferon signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Guarda et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, the modulation of T-cell subsets and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by hMSC appear to be closely connected. Since NLRP3 inflammasome is a key factor in the neuroinflammation onset in CNS injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Menu and Vince, 2011</xref>), the suppression of NLRP3 inflammasome by hMSC may be potentially beneficial in reducing the exacerbated immune responses associated with CAR-T therapy.</p><p>The formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome was reported to be through NF-κB-dependent transcription of IL-1β, IL-18, and NLRP3, whereas its activation is triggered by extracellular stimuli such as lysosomal permeability, potassium efflux, and oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kelley et al., 2019</xref>). It has been proved that the expression and secretion of STC1 in multiple cell lines can be stimulated by external stimuli, including cytokines and oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nguyen et al., 2009</xref>). Considering that exogenous STC1 could be internalized by macrophages within 10 min and localizes to mitochondria and played a suppressing role in ROS generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2009</xref>), we speculated that the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome formation might be a feedback mechanism that occurred between macrophages and hMSC. It was reported that LPS-stimulated macrophages do stimulate the expression and secretion of STC1 in hMSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Oh et al., 2014</xref>). Our data further demonstrated that knockdown of STC1 deprived the function of hMSC in suppressing all the three markers used in the current study in determining NLRP3 inflammasome formation, as well as the suppression of mitochondria ROS production. These data support the idea that a feedback regulation mechanism exists between hMSC and macrophages during CAR-T therapy.</p><p>Using the Xenograft mice model, we confirmed that the tumor-killing efficacy of CAR-T could also be inhibited by hMSCs in vivo, whereas knockdown of STC1 effectively abolished the inhibition. Immunohistochemical data indicated that the downregulation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, upregulation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T helper cell subsets, and Tregs were all dependent on the function of STC1. Need to note that the amount of the injected hMSCs was much higher than that of the in vivo situation. Nevertheless, the results give a clear indication that STC1 is critical for the immune-suppressive function of hMSC.</p><p>In summary, the present study revealed a significant impact of hMSC in suppressing CAR-T efficacy and provided evidence that the STC1 gene played a critical role in the regulation of various immune-suppressive mechanisms. A speculative schema of the signaling and interactions among hMSC, macrophage, CAR-T, and tumor cells based on our current data is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. In this model, activated macrophages or stress signals during CAR-T therapy may prompt MSCs to secret STC-1 into the extracellular matrix of TME, serving as a pleiotropic factor to negatively impact the function of T cells and stimulate the expression of molecules that inactivate immune responses, ultimately providing an immunosuppressive effect of MSC. While further studies are needed to understand the detailed molecular interactions underlying, the findings we presented here are no doubt that would have potential clinical applications toward improving the efficiency of CAR-T therapy as well as reducing the excessive toxicity by modulating the level of STC1 in TME.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Proposed signaling and interactions among hMSC, macrophage, chimeric antigen receptor modified T cell (CAR-T), and tumor cells.</title><p>When cancer cells were destroyed by CAR-T cells, the release of fragmented DNA and other stimulating factors activated the release of mitochondria reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the formation of NLPR3 inflammasome.

Please pay attention to the following points.</p><p>1) How STC1 controls changes in MSCs' ability for hampering CAR T cell-mediated anti-tumor responses is unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>In this study, we demonstrated that the presence of STC1 is critical for MSCs to exert their immunosuppressive role by inhibiting cytotoxic T cell subsets, activating key immune suppressive/escape related molecules such as IDO and PD-L1, and crosstalking with macrophages in the TME. These immunosuppressive functions of MSC could be significantly hampered when the STC1 gene was knockdown. Considering that staniocalcin-1 is glycoprotein hormone that is secreted into the extracellular matrix in a paracrine manner, we would conclude that the role of STC-1 is not to alter the function of MSCs intracellularly. Rather, it facilitates the immunosuppressive capabilities of MSCs through extracellular secretion into the TME as a pleiotropic factor, thus impacting the functioning of T cells, cancer cells and other immune cells.</p><p>The reviewer's question is well taken, and we have added the points mentioned above to the Discussion section to ensure a more comprehensive conclusion. Moreover, a recent study published in Cancer Cell, which was suggested by the other reviewer, is consistent with our results. It has provided further mechanistic information on how stanniocalcin-1 impacts immunotherapy efﬁcacy and T cell activation. The reference has been cited and discussed as shown below.</p><p>&quot;In this model, activated macrophages or stress signals during CAR-T therapy may prompt MSCs to secret staniocalcin-1 into the extracellular matrix of TME, serving as a pleiotropic factor to negatively impact the function of T cells and stimulate the expression of molecules that inactivate immune responses, ultimately providing an immunosuppressive effect of MSC.&quot;.</p><p>&quot;In line with our study, it was recently reported that stanniocalcin-1 negatively correlates with immunotherapy efﬁcacy and T cell activation by trapping calreticulin, which abrogates membrane calreticulin-directed antigen presentation function and phagocytosis [50].&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) What does the author think about using MSC with STC-1 knockout? Can it still help reduce toxicity while maintaining CAR-T efficacy? This might be a potential application.</p></disp-quote><p>This is definitely an interesting idea. Based on the data presented in the current study, it is clear that knockdown of STC-1 would abrogate the immune-suppressive impact of MSC, and therefore affect CAR-T efficacy. However, whether the presence of MSC can help reduce cytokine release syndrome when losing the function of STC-1 requires further study. We agree with the reviewer, and we had briefly discussed this possibility at the very end of the discussion as shown below.</p><p>&quot;… the findings we presented here are no doubt that would have potential clinical applications toward improving the efficiency of CAR-T therapy as well as reducing the excessive toxicity by modulating the level of STC1 in TME&quot;.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Overall, the mechanistic part of this manuscript should be largely improved. Moreover, a careful evaluation of how MSCs modulate CAR T cell properties and differentiation should be examined. In addition, the methodology part should be elaborated since it is vague in many experimental settings.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the introduction and discussion to include more comprehensive information and analysis of the underlying mechanisms.</p><p>As to the methodology, we have conducted a thorough examination of the methodology section, providing more in-depth details, such as the generation of M2 stage macrophages and the cell co-culture model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

However, by comparison with control, the results gave reliable determination of cytotoxicity and the changes in ROS levels.
