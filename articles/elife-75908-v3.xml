Stromal cells have been shown to support AML survival and progression through various mechanisms. Nonetheless, whether AML cells could establish beneficial metabolic interactions with stromal cells is underexplored. By using a combination of human AML cell lines and AML patient samples together with mouse stromal cells and a MLL-AF9 mouse model, here we identify a novel metabolic crosstalk between AML and stromal cells where AML cells prompt stromal cells to secrete acetate for their own consumption to feed the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) and lipid biosynthesis. By performing transcriptome analysis and tracer-based metabolic NMR analysis, we observe that stromal cells present a higher rate of glycolysis when co-cultured with AML cells. We also find that acetate in stromal cells is derived from pyruvate via chemical conversion under the influence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) following ROS transfer from AML to stromal cells via gap junctions. Overall, we present a unique metabolic communication between AML and stromal cells and propose two different molecular targets, ACSS2 and gap junctions, that could potentially be exploited for adjuvant therapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>acute myeloid leukaemia</kwd><kwd>nuclear magnetic resonance</kwd><kwd>metabolism</kwd><kwd>microenvironment</kwd><kwd>human</kwd><kwd>mouse</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010661</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020 Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>H2020-MSCA-ITN-2015-675790</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Papatzikas</surname><given-names>Grigorios</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HaemMetabolome [EC-675790]</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schnütgen</surname><given-names>Frank</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB815 TP A10</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schnütgen</surname><given-names>Frank</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>208400/Z/17/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Günther</surname><given-names>Ulrich L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007137</institution-id><institution>Helse Nord RHF</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Strategisk-HN06-14</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arranz</surname><given-names>Lorena</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000855</institution-id><institution>University of Birmingham</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>67262-DIF Post-Covid Support Fund</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Garcia</surname><given-names>Paloma</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HaemMetabolome [EC-675790]</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cazier</surname><given-names>Jean-Baptiste</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

AML cells show a highly adaptive metabolism that allows them to efficiently use a variety of nutrients to obtain energy and generate biomass (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kreitz et al., 2019</xref>). This high metabolic plasticity confers AML cells a strong advantage against normal haematopoietic cells and has been related to AML aggressiveness. Although the metabolism in AML cells has been broadly investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kreitz et al., 2019</xref>), fewer studies have focused on identifying metabolic alterations related to the interaction between AML and niche cells. For instance, AML cells are known to interact and modulate niche components for their own support by secreting soluble factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schelker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Passaro et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zeng et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>), via exosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kumar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hornick et al., 2016</xref>) or by establishing direct interactions, mediated by gap junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kouzi et al., 2020</xref>) or tunnelling nanotubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Omsland et al., 2017</xref>). These interactions with components of the niche provide AML cells with survival cues and chemoresistance, ultimately contributing to increased relapse in AML patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schelker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zeng et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kouzi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ye et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Moschoi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Forte et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, it has been reported that adipocytes in the niche secrete fatty acids, which are metabolised by AML cells through β-oxidation to obtain energy, protecting AML cells from apoptosis and ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shafat et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tabe et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>As a consequence of their highly proliferative demand, AML cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baccelli et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pollyea et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Molina et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lagadinou et al., 2013</xref>) and, particularly, chemotherapy-resistant AML cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Farge et al., 2017</xref>) present abnormally high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hole et al., 2013</xref>). How AML cells cope with high ROS levels has been intriguing and recent reports are shedding some light on whether the microenvironment plays a role in the redox metabolism of AML cells. For instance, it was reported that Nestin<sup>+</sup> bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) support AML progression by increasing the bioenergetic capacity of AML cells and providing them with glutathione (GSH)-mediated antioxidant defence to balance the excess ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Forte et al., 2020</xref>). Similarly, a recent study showed that co-culturing BMSCs with AML cells leads to a decrease in AML ROS levels due to an activation of the antioxidant enzyme GPx-3 in AML cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vignon et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Our work provides new insight into the metabolic and redox crosstalk between AML and stromal cells, revealing a new metabolic interaction between AML and stromal cells. By combining transcriptomic and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data, our results demonstrate that stromal cell metabolism is rewired in co-culture resulting in higher glycolysis and pyruvate decarboxylation, leading to acetate secretion. Our results also show that AML cells are able to transfer ROS to stromal cells by direct interaction through gap junctions and that these ROS can be used by stromal cells to generate and secrete acetate, which is utilised by AML cells to feed the TCA cycle and to generate lipids. Targeting ROS transfer via modulation of gap junctions to suppress acetate provision by stromal cells or targeting acetate usage could serve as an adjuvant therapy to eradicate AML.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Co-culturing AML and stromal cells in direct contact triggers acetate secretion by stromal cells</title><p>We first sought to determine whether interactions between AML and stromal cells in co-culture would result in differences in the consumption or production of extracellular metabolites. For this purpose, three human AML cell lines (SKM-1, Kasumi-1 and HL-60) representing different AML subtypes (M5, M2 t(8;21), and M2, respectively) were cultured separately and in co-culture with MS-5, a stromal mouse cell line capable of maintaining haematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Itoh et al., 1989</xref>). The metabolic composition of the extracellular medium in each condition was analysed by <sup>1</sup>H-NMR and compared at different time points. The most striking difference found in co-culture compared to cells cultured separately was an increased secretion of acetate, which was common for the three cell lines used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Moreover, only stromal cells secreted acetate to a lower extent when cultured alone whereas AML cells did not secrete any acetate when cultured alone. Altogether, these findings suggest that acetate secretion is a result of a direct interaction between AML and stromal cells. In addition, the observation that only stromal cells secrete acetate under these conditions suggests that stromal cells could be responsible for the increased acetate secretion found in co-culture.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Acetate secretion by stromal cells increases in AML-stroma co-cultures of several AML cell lines and primary AML cells in direct contact.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Section of <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectra, corresponding to the methyl group of acetate, from extracellular medium samples of SKM-1 cells cultured alone (blue), MS-5 cells cultured alone (red) and SKM-1 and MS-5 cells in co-culture (green) after 24 hours.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, higher consumption of glucose along with a higher secretion of lactate was observed in AML and stromal cells in co-culture compared to single cultures, suggesting a higher glycolytic flux in co-culture. However, the levels of glucose consumption and lactate production in co-culture were similar to the sum of the glucose consumption and lactate production levels of the AML and stromal cells in single cultures, suggesting that the overall increase in glycolysis in co-culture was just a result of culturing both cell types together. Additionally, we observed no variation in glutamate and glutamine levels suggesting that these metabolites are not involved in interactions that result from co-culture and are utilised depending on their availability.</p><p>The metabolic differences found in co-culture, could be due to altered proliferation under these conditions. To determine whether this was the case, a CFSE-based proliferation assay was performed in which AML cellsbut not stromal cells were stained and their growth compared when cultured separately vs in co-culture. Over 48 hr, none of the human AML cell lines tested presented differences in their proliferation rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), thus confirming that the metabolic changes found in co-culture were caused by a mechanism independent of changes in proliferation.</p><p>Next, we aimed to determine whether cell-to-cell contact could play a role in the increased acetate secretion found in co-culture. For this we co-cultured AML and stromal cells separated by a permeable membrane, allowing cells to share the extracellular medium but impeding cell-to-cell contact. Co-culturing cells using a permeable membrane blocked the increase in acetate secretion observed under direct contact conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In fact, cells in co-culture presented lower levels of acetate than MS-5 cells cultured alone revealing that direct cell-to-cell contact is required for acetate secretion in co-culture.</p><p>To examine whether increased acetate secretion is specific for the interaction of AML cells with stromal cells, we co-cultured the human AML cell lines with the cervical human cancer cell line HeLa and compared the levels of acetate of each cell type cultured alone. We found that there was no acetate secretion in co-culture, also not by HeLa and AML cells cultured alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>), suggesting that increased acetate secretion is specific for an AML-stromal cell interaction.</p><p>Considering that our previous data seemed to indicate that MS-5 cells were responsible for acetate secretion when co-cultured with human AML cell lines, we decided to investigate how the levels of extracellular acetate would vary after separating cells from co-culture. The three human AML cell lines were co-cultured for 24 hr with the MS-5 mouse stromal cells prior to separation and subsequent culture in the same spent media. Extracellular acetate levels in previously co-cultured MS-5 cells followed a similar trend as before separation, suggesting that the MS-5 cells most likely are responsible for the increased acetate secretion found in co-culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Moreover, AML cells did not follow this trend as they either maintained the levels of acetate seen prior to separating the cells (Kasumi-1 and HL-60) or presented only a moderate increase (SKM-1) after being separated from co-culture.</p><p>We further investigated whether increased acetate secretion could take place in primary co-cultures using AML cells derived from patients and whether acetate secretion in co-culture could be specific for AML cells. To address this question, we isolated the CD34<sup>+</sup> population of four primary AML patient samples, and of three independent healthy donors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), cultured them in co-culture with MS-5 cells, and analysed the composition of the extracellular medium after 48 hr. We found that three out of four primary AML samples presented higher levels of acetate when co-cultured with MS-5 cells compared to MS-5 cells cultured alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Contrary, none of the healthy donor samples showed an increased acetate secretion in co-culture suggesting that acetate secretion is specific for AML cells in co-culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, we sought to determine whether in an in vivo setting, increased acetate production would be observed. For this, acetate levels were analysed in the bone marrow extracellular fluid (BMEF) of mice transplanted either with mouse MLL-AF9<sup>+</sup> leukaemic cells or with healthy wild type mouse hematopoietic cells. These experiments revealed that a significantly higher amount of acetate was present in the BMEF of mice suffering from leukaemia compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>AML cells consume and use acetate secreted by stromal cells to feed the TCA cycle and for lipogenesis</title><p>Following the finding that stromal cells might be responsible for acetate secretion in co-culture, we next examined whether AML cells could metabolise the secreted acetate. We first sought to define the concentration of secreted acetate in the extracellular medium in co-culture. For this, we compared a sample of extracellular medium from a co-culture of SKM-1 and MS-5 cells after 24 hr to a calibration curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), which allowed us to determine the concentration of acetate in co-culture as approximately 3–4 mM. We then investigated whether SKM-1 cells can consume acetate both in normal plasma concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gao et al., 2016</xref>) and co-culture concentrations (0.25 mM or 3 mM, respectively). In both cases, SKM-1 cells consumed acetate significantly after 48 hr, and in normal plasma conditions also after 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>We then employed a tracer-based approach using [2-<sup>13</sup>C]acetate to assess whether SKM-1 or MS-5 cells can utilise acetate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Both cell types imported <sup>13</sup>C labelled acetate as observed in NMR spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). However, only SKM-1 cells showed <sup>13</sup>C label incorporation in several TCA cycle related metabolites, including aspartate, citrate, glutamate, 2-oxoglutarate, glutathione, and proline, as well as in acetylcarnitine. Acetylcarnitine is known to be produced by cells when large amounts of acetyl-CoA are present in the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Childress et al., 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stephens et al., 2007</xref>), which could be in line with this experiment in which a high concentration of [2-<sup>13</sup>C]acetate (4 mM) was used.

We found that only AML cells incorporated <sup>13</sup>C into intracellular metabolites at both timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B-C</xref>). The intake of acetate by AML cells was very rapid, with several TCA cycle metabolites such as glutamate, oxoglutarate, malate, proline, and succinate showing label incorporation after 30 min of [2-<sup>13</sup>C]acetate labelling. The metabolisation pattern for all AML cells in co-culture was similar to that observed for SKM-1 cells alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B-C</xref>). We also investigated whether the acetate taken by AML cells undergoes alternative fates other than TCA cycle. For this purpose, we co-cultured AML and MS-5 cells for 24 hr before adding [2-<sup>13</sup>C]acetate to the spent extracellular medium and cultured them for further 8 or 48 hr before analysing the intracellular metabolites. No <sup>13</sup>C labelling was incorporated into lipids when co-cultures were labelled with [2-<sup>13</sup>C]acetate for 8 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). In contrast, at 48 hr the three AML cell lines presented <sup>1</sup>H<sup>13</sup>C-methyl signals at 0.7–0.8 ppm confirming labelling of lipid CH<sub>3</sub> groups (approximately 10–20% enrichment) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>Overall, these results indicated that AML cells could uptake and utilise the acetate secreted by stromal cells in co-culture as a substrate to feed into the TCA cycle and for lipid biosynthesis.</p><p>To understand the possible physiological relevance of our findings, we cultured the three human AML cell lines in normal media and glucose-free media in the presence of acetate, and treated them or not with the chemotherapy agent cytarabine (cytosine arabinoside, AraC). Our data showed that the AML cells studied displayed different degrees of sensitivity to AraC, with HL-60 cells being more sensitive and Kasumi-1 more resistant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Interestingly, we observed that the high sensitivity for AraC displayed by HL-60 cells could be partially counteracted by the presence of acetate in the cultures. We then investigated whether the inhibition of the acetyl CoA synthetase short-chain family member 2 (ACSS2i), has an effect of the survival of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). All human AML cell lines studied displayed high sensitivity to the ACSS2i when cultured in glucose with no added acetate, indicating the importance of ACSS2 in metabolism, as previously observed in myeloma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2021</xref>). In glucose-free media supplemented with 4 mM acetate, the survival of the cells was maintained. Interestingly, under this condition, the ACSS2i treatment alone did not have a profound detrimental effect on the survival of the cells. By performing [2-<sup>13</sup>C]acetate label incorporation we observed that the ACSS2i reduced the incorporation of acetate to the TCA metabolites by approximately 60% after 24 hr of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>), indicating the incomplete inhibition of the enzyme and thus still accessibility of acetate usage by the cell, providing an explanation for the higher survival in the medium supplemented with acetate compared to control media. Nonetheless, it was clear that when cells were treated with both drugs, ACSS2i treatment sensitised AML cells to AraC treatment.

We first confirmed that efficiency of inhibition by analysing the calcein-AM dye transfer in a control and treated co-culture of the three human AML cell lines and MS-5 cells. The CBX treatment significantly reduced fluorescence levels and the percentage of cells with calcein-AM for all the human AML cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

CBX treatment abrogated the decrease in ROS levels in the three human AML cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) and the increase of ROS levels in MS-5 mouse stromal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), indicating inhibition of ROS transfer in CBX treated co-cultures.</p><p>To get definitive proof that the formation of gap junctions is required for the metabolic re-wiring of stromal cells, we measured acetate production in AML cells and MS-5 cells cultured alone and in co-culture in the presence of CBX. Extracellular acetate levels were measured by <sup>1</sup>H-NMR after 24 hr. We found that inhibition of gap junctions by CBX treatment resulted in a decrease in acetate levels when mouse stromal cells were co-cultured with human AML cell lines compared to untreated co-cultures, indicating that indeed acetate secretion is dependent on the formation of gap junctions between AML and stromal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, to determine whether in an in vivo setting, the inhibition of gap junctions could counteract the effect of ROS in leukaemia progression, we turned to our MLL-AF9 mouse model. C57BL/6 J WT mice were transplanted with BM of MLL-AF9<sup>+</sup> mice and then treated either with a potent ROS inducer, tert-Butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kumar, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fatemi et al., 2013</xref>), or with TBHP in combination with CBX. Our results showed that TBHP treatment accelerated the development of overt AML, reducing the survival of the recipient mice, with the number of monocytes in blood five times higher than vehicle-treated leukaemic mice at the end-point analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G and H</xref>). In contrast, mice receiving both, TBHP and CBX, displayed survival and monocyte counts similar to vehicle-injected leukaemic mice. These experiments indicate that gap junction inhibition at least partially reduces the enhancing effect of ROS in the development of AML.</p><p>Once confirmed that acetate secretion is dependent of direct contact through gap junctions and ROS, we then sought to get further insight in the order of events and determine whether gap junctions are upregulated first, leading to increase ROS intake and metabolic re-wiring or whether the acetate production and gap junction formation were due to increased ROS. To discern between these two possibilities, we labelled MS-5 mouse stromal cells with calcein-AM, cultured them with unlabelled human AML cells in the presence of catalase and analysed the fluorescence of AML cells after three hours. We found that, for the three human AML cell lines tested, the calcein-AM transfer was reduced between 50 and 70% compared to cells co-cultured without the ROS scavenger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>), indicating that ROS is required for the establishment of gap junctions between AML and stromal cells.</p><p>Overall, our results indicate that ROS is required for the upregulation of gap junctions facilitating in this way its transfer to stromal cells for acetate production and that inhibition of gap junctions affects acetate secretion by stromal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Schematic summary of our findings.</title><p>AML cells present high levels of ROS that activate the formation of gap junctions.

Yet, metabolic crosstalk studies between AML and stromal cells remain scarce. Here, we have identified a novel metabolic communication between AML and stromal cells mediated by acetate. Our in vivo data shows high acetate levels in the bone marrow extracellular fluid of AML but not in healthy control mice, indicative of a potential role for acetate in AML development. Our in vitro data suggests that AML cells can modulate stromal cells into secreting acetate in co-culture, by rewiring stromal cell metabolism, and can then utilise acetate to feed their own TCA cycle and for lipid biosynthesis. Mechanistically, our data revealed that acetate secretion involves not only a higher glycolytic rate in stromal cells but is also a likely consequence of the non enzymatic ROS-mediated conversion of pyruvate to acetate., which was supported by the fact that MS-5 cells grown in thiamine-free media were still capable to produce acetate. Furthermore, our data indicates that AML cells can diminish their ROS levels by establishing gap junctions with stromal cells facilitating ROS transfer to stromal cells.</p><p>Studying the interactions between cancer cells and their microenvironment in terms of metabolism has become an exciting new field of cancer research. Our data indicates that AML cells can influence the metabolism of stromal cells causing increased acetate secretion, which was not observed in healthy counterparts.</p><p>We present several lines of evidence suggesting that stromal cells but not AML cells are responsible for acetate secretion: (i) stromal cells cultured alone secreted acetate, whilst AML cell lines and primary AML cells did not; (ii) after separating stromal cells from co-culture with AML cell lines, stromal cells continued to secrete acetate at a similar rate to that observed in co-culture; and, (iii) glycolysis was upregulated in stromal cells in co-culture, and glucose was found to be the precursor of the secreted acetate in co-culture. Thus, although some alternative metabolic rewiring in AML cells dependent on the direct contact with stromal cells cannot be discarded, our data strongly suggests stromal cells secreting acetate as the main pathway. Although we cannot provide an absolute proof that AML cells consume the acetate specifically secreted by stromal cells, our data adding <sup>13</sup>C-labelled acetate to co-cultured AML cells and showing label incorporation in several TCA cycle metabolites and in lipid metabolism exclusively in AML cells, strongly supports this hypothesis. Interestingly, acetate has been reported as an alternative fuel for cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lyssiotis and Cantley, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Comerford et al., 2014</xref>), especially under low oxygen conditions or lipid depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schug et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yoshii et al., 2009</xref>), but it has not previously been described to participate in crosstalk between any type of cancer cells and their microenvironment. Nonetheless, other monocarboxylate metabolites, such as lactate and alanine, have been reported to participate in different types of metabolic interplay between stromal and cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sousa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sonveaux et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Whitaker-Menezes et al., 2011</xref>). Our work reveals that aside from lactate and alanine, other monocarboxylate metabolites, such as acetate, can be utilised by leukaemic cells as a biofuel. Although acetate usage to feed the TCA cycle had already been described in AML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Saborano et al., 2019</xref>) and other types of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schug et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mashimo et al., 2014</xref>), this is, to our knowledge, the first report of AML cells utilising acetate secreted by stromal cells in co-culture.</p><p>We have also proposed a mechanism for the altered stromal cellular metabolism, involving increased glycolysis and the ROS-mediated chemical conversion of pyruvate to acetate. Transcriptomic data showed that glycolysis is upregulated in stromal cells in co-culture, and tracer-based metabolism using [U-<sup>13</sup>C]glucose, demonstrated that more label gets incorporated into acetate in stromal cells in co-culture compared to either AML or stromal cells cultured alone. Enrichment of hypoxia genes and elevated Pdk expression have been reported to be related to higher glycolytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Testa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kocabas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Takubo et al., 2013</xref>). Additionally, published single-cell transcriptomic data of stroma cells in vivo by the group of Scadden, has shown three specific clusters which have upregulated glycolysis and hypoxia pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baryawno et al., 2019</xref>). In particular, the osteoprogenitor cluster was shown to be upregulated in leukaemic mice and shared the same hallmark gene sets that MS-5 in co-culture (TNFα, Hypoxia, allograft rejection, glycolysis, IFNγ, K-RAS, complement, epithelial to mesenchymal transition and IL2-STAT5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baryawno et al., 2019</xref>). Similarly, other cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Migneco et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pavlides et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cruz-Bermúdez et al., 2019</xref> have also been shown to modulate stromal metabolism by increasing glycolysis. The proposed mechanism, involving higher glycolysis and pyruvate conversion to acetate via ROS, was further supported by increasing and lowering ROS levels in co-culture in our studies. Lowering ROS levels reduced the acetate secretion of MS-5 cells in co-culture to similar levels as when MS-5 cells are cultured alone, highlighting the implication of ROS in acetate secretion in co-culture.</p><p>AML cells are known to exhibit high levels of ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hole et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Robinson et al., 2020</xref>). However, our data has shown that AML cells in co-culture present lower levels of ROS than AML cells cultured alone, which is in agreement with recent studies in primary AML and mesenchymal stromal cell co-cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Forte et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vignon et al., 2020</xref>). The current mechanisms to describe this phenomenon involve mitochondrial transfer and activation of glutathione-related antioxidant pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Forte et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vignon et al., 2020</xref>), although previous data on haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) revealed that HSCs can directly transfer ROS via gap junctions to stromal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Taniguchi Ishikawa et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, our data showed that the decrease in ROS levels was counteracted by inhibiting contact between MS-5 and AML cells using a permeable membrane. We also found several gap junction genes upregulated in stromal cells in co-culture. Moreover, we prevented ROS transfer from AML to stromal cells by using the gap junction inhibitor CBX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kouzi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davidson et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davidson and Baumgarten, 1988</xref>), which abolished the increase in extracellular acetate level in co-cultures in vitro and partially reduced the effect of ROS inducers (TBHP) in the aggravation of AML in vivo. Thus, our results suggest that ROS transfer via gap junctions, at least partially, mediates the mechanism behind AML cells presenting lower levels of ROS in co-culture.</p><p>Overall, this work reveals a unique and novel metabolic communication between AML and stromal cells that involves acetate as the main crosstalk metabolite. We showed that AML cells are capable of modulating the metabolism of stromal cells by transferring ROS via gap junctions resulting in an increased secretion of acetate and its subsequent accumulation in the extracellular medium, which correlates with the observation of higher acetate levels in the bone marrow extracellular fluid of AML mice compared to control mice. Furthermore, we found that AML cells can consume acetate and use it to feed the TCA cycle and for lipid biosynthesis. We believe our findings provide a better understanding of how AML cells communicate with stromal cells and could serve as a basis for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to target AML cells by modulating gap junction formation or modulating acetate use as an adjuvant therapy.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

The spectral width was 12 ppm, the number of data points was TD 32,768, the interscan delay was 4 s. The <sup>1</sup>H carrier was set on the water frequency and the <sup>1</sup>H 90° pulse was calibrated at a power of 0.256 W and had a typical length of ca 7–8 μs. 64 scans and 8 dummy scans were acquired and the total experimental time was 7.5 min. Spectra were processed using the MetaboLab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ludwig and Günther, 2011</xref>) software within the MATLAB environment (MathWorks). A 0.3 Hz exponential apodization function was applied to FIDs followed by zero-filling to 131,072 data points prior to Fourier transformation. The chemical shift was calibrated by referencing the TMSP signal to 0 ppm and spectra were manually phase corrected. The baseline was corrected by applying a spline baseline correction, the water and edge regions of the spectra were excluded before scaling the spectra using a probabilistic quotient normalization (PQN). Chenomx 7.0 software (Chenomx Inc) and the human metabolome database (HMDB) were used to assign the metabolites present in the acquired spectra. Metabolite signal intensities were obtained directly from the spectra and were normalised to a control medium sample obtained at time 0 hr. For bone marrow extracellular fluid samples, metabolite signal areas were obtained directly from the spectra.</p><p>For <sup>13</sup>C-filtered <sup>1</sup>H-NMR experiments, [U-<sup>13</sup>C]glucose labelled medium samples were analysed with <sup>13</sup>C-filtered <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectroscopy as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Reed et al., 2019</xref>. Spectra were acquired at 300 K using a double gradient BIRD filter pulse sequence developed in-house (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Reed et al., 2019</xref>). A pulse program combining the <sup>1</sup>H[<sup>12</sup>C] and the all-<sup>1</sup>H experiments in scan-interleaved mode was used. The difference between the two FIDs yields the <sup>1</sup>H[<sup>13</sup>C] signal. The spectral width was 12 ppm, the number of data points was 16,384, and the relaxation delay was 5.3 s. 256 scans with 64 dummy scans were acquired and the experimental time was 15 min. <sup>13</sup>C-filtered <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectra were processed in Topspin 4.0.5 (Bruker). Spectra were zero filled to 32,768 data points before Fourier transformation. Phase correction was applied to the <sup>1</sup>H[-<sup>12</sup> C] and the all-<sup>1</sup>H spectra and the difference <sup>1</sup>H[<sup>13</sup>C] spectrum was obtained by aligning on chemical shift. Metabolites were selected in the <sup>1</sup>H[<sup>13</sup>C] spectrum and integrated in all the spectra (<sup>1</sup>H[<sup>12</sup>C], <sup>1</sup>H[<sup>13</sup>C] and all-<sup>1</sup>H).

For the <sup>1</sup>H dimension, the spectral width was 13.018 ppm with 2048 complex points as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Saborano et al., 2019</xref>. For the <sup>13</sup>C dimension, the spectral width was 160 ppm with 2048 complex points. Two scans were acquired per spectrum and with an interscan delay of 1.5 s. Non-uniform sampling (NUS) with a 25% sampling schedule (generated using the Wagner’s schedule generator (Gerhard Wagner Lab, Harvard Medical School) with a tolerance of 0.01 and default values for the other parameters) was used with 4096 increments yielding 8192 complex points after processing. The total experimental time was 4 hr. Spectra were processed and phased with NMRPipe (National Institute of Standards and Technology of the U.S.; Appendix 8.1). MetaboLab was used to reference the chemical shift using the signal for the methyl group of L-lactic acid, at 1.31/22.9 ppm in the <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C dimensions, respectively. Identification of metabolites in 2D spectra was carried out using the MetaboLab software which includes a chemical shift library for ca. 200 metabolites. Intensities were obtained from signals in the spectra and were corrected for differences in cell numbers contributing to the sample as follows: A <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectrum was acquired for each sample and the total metabolite area of this spectrum after removal of the water and TMSP reference signal was calculated in MetaboLab. The intensities in the 2D spectra were then divided by the total metabolite area of the corresponding <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectrum. To obtain the % of <sup>13</sup>C in a metabolite, the normalized intensity of a certain carbon in the labelled sample was divided by the normalized intensity of the same carbon in the unlabelled sample and was multiplied by the natural abundance of <sup>13</sup>C (1.1%).</p><p>To determine the <sup>13</sup>C-label incorporation in lipids, 1D <sup>1</sup>H spectra (zgpr, standard pulse sequence from Bruker) were acquired on a Bruker 600MHz spectrometer equipped with a 5 mm triple resonance pulse field gradient (PFG) room temperature probe at 300 K. The data was collected with a spectral width of 12 ppm, the number of data points was 32,768 and interscan delay was 4 s. The <sup>1</sup>H carrier was set at 7.26 ppm corresponding to CDCl<sub>3</sub>. The spectra were processed and analyzed using Bruker Topspin.

microenvironment. The work describes a novel phenomenon whereby the direct interaction of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines and bone marrow stromal cell lines results in increased production of extracellular acetate in stromal cells, which can then be metabolised by the AML cells. Overall, the data are very thought-provoking but future work some of which is technically challenging, will be necessary for a full appreciation of the biological relevance of this interaction.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.75908.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Lo Celso</surname><given-names>Cristina</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/041kmwe10</institution-id><institution>Imperial College London</institution></institution-wrap><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Milsom</surname><given-names>Michael D</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04cdgtt98</institution-id><institution>German Cancer Research Center</institution></institution-wrap><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.01.21.427406">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.21.427406v3">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below. We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Crosstalk between AML and stromal cells triggers acetate secretion through the metabolic rewiring of stromal cells&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Utpal Banerjee as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Mick Milson (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The suggested revisions are fairly extensive, and due to the current situation with the pandemic, if you will need more time than the usual 2 month time limit for revisions, please let our editorial office know and we will be flexible in adjusting to a reasonable time scale. There is only one major revision allowed, so please take your time (within reason), and attend to all the points raised. At <italic>eLife</italic>, our &quot;no scoop policy&quot; will protect your work if another similar paper appears in press during your revision.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The conclusion that acetate is used as biofuel by AML cells is not supported by the data at least in the co-culture. Please strengthen this conclusion based on the following comments, and specific comments from Reviewer 2 and 3. The intracellular labelling in Figure 2E does not show a significant increase in any of the TCA cycle intermediates labelling in the SKM-1 cells compared to MS-5 and S3B does not show the MS-5 levels at all. The big increase in acetyl-carnitine without corresponding increase in TCA cycle intermediates makes one wonder if there is a blockage in oxidation of this product.</p><p>2) It is important to show that the acetate used by AML cells is produced by MS5 cells. Is it possible to demonstrate not just AML cells uptake of acetate but the full pathway of U-C13 entering MS5 cells and subsequently AML cells? It should be possible to use data from the experiment with U-C13 glucose labelling, to show intracellular labelling in MS-5 and AML cells. These data will be very useful to 1. Confirm glycolysis is upregulated in MS-5 cells in co-culture, 2. Acetate is coming from the labelled pyruvate in MS-5 cells. These data should be presented to support the claims that at the moment is mostly indirect re MS-5 upregulating glycolysis and producing acetate via pyruvate through a non-enzymatic reaction. Please consider specific points from Reviewer 2 and 3 linked to this.</p><p>3) The biological relevance of the presented findings needs strengthening, especially given that the AML cells do not grow more on MS5 cells than in single culture. Are the findings linked to AML growth, or perhaps chemoresistance or leukaemia propagation? Please note points from Reviewer 1 and 3 when addressing this.</p><p>4) the link between gap junctions, ROS transfer and induction of acetate production needs strengthening. See Reviewr 2 point: the experiments are overall convincing including re the role of gap junctions. What is missing is direct proof that inhibiting gap junction would reduce acetate production in the co-culture and this is something that needs done to support the statement that it is the ROS transfer via gap junction that is leading to acetate production. And Reviewer 1: is the metabolic rewiring and overexpression of gap junctions a consequence of increased ROS? Or are gap junctions upregulated first, leading to increased ROS intake and metabolic re-wiring?</p><p>5)While further extensive in vivo experiments may be beyond the scope of this work and would require considerably longer than 3 months to complete, is there any evidence from already published transcriptomic datasets that stroma cells in vivo upregulate the same genes/pathways? Is it possible to identify the specific cell type responsible for the mechanism presented here?</p><p>6) Please clarify the rational behind the choice of AML cell lines and human healthy control samples used.</p><p>Further points:</p><p>7) Please consider specific points from each reviewer in your response letter.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) Is the metabolic rewiring and overexpression of gap junctions a consequence of increased ROS? Or are gap junctions upregulated first, leading to increased ROS intake and metabolic re-wiring?</p><p>2) Is there evidence from in vivo studies that stroma cells upregulate the same genes/pathways? Is it possible to identify the specific cell type responsible for the mechanism presented here? If a specific cell type appears to be important with this, it would be exciting to see an effect following specific targeting of that cell type, although this may be beyond the scope of the presented work.</p><p>3) Is the mechanism presented here supporting AML growth prior or also following chemotherapy administration?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Vilaplana-Lopera et al., highlights a novel interesting metabolic cross-talk between the stroma and AML cells through production of acetate. The main conclusion of the paper, ie that acetate production is increased in co-culture most likely because of stroma production and is taken up by AML cells, is supported by the data. Some of the other conclusions re the utilisation of acetate in AML cells and the exact mechanism leading to acetate production might require further experimental work to be fully supported. The authors make an effort to validate their findings in primary AML cells model and in vivo although the mechanistic insight is mostly done in AML cell lines grown on a MS-5 stromal layer. As a result whether the described interaction is also present in other stroma/AML combination remains to be demonstrated. However I think this is not necessary for this paper.</p><p>Technically the paper appears rigorous although I would not be able to comment on the technical aspects of the NMR analysis and I would hope some of the other reviewers can comment on that.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>Figure 1 – overall I find the data here convincing. My main criticism is that the author appear to support the notion that acetate comes from MS-5 cells only while it cannot be excluded that AML cells might be reprogrammed by the stroma to a certain extent to produce acetate as in 1D for SKM1 and HL60 there is a slight increase in acetate following interruption of the coculture. See below on how to strengthen this conclusion or otherwise reword the discussion.</p><p>Figure 2 – what do the author mean by physiological conditions? How is the acetate concentration of 0.25mM considered physiological and are they implying that their co-culture system is not physiological? Also the conclusion that acetate is used as biofuel by AML cells is not supported by the data at least in the coculture. The intracellular labelling in Figure 2E does not show a significant increase in any of the TCA cycle intermediates labelling in the SKM-1 cells compared to MS-5 and S3B does not show the MS-5 levels at all.

However, I would like to suggest some experiments that would help to solidify the claims that are made in the manuscript as well as potentially increase the impact of the work.</p><p>1) While the acetate secretion by stromal cells and uptake by AML cells is a very interesting finding, I'm sure that many readers would join me in asking: what is the biological relevance of this? Is it simply a metabolic quirk or does it convey some advantage to the AML cells? Can the authors find any aspect of altered biology in the AML cells that may be relevant to disease progression, therapy resistance, relapse etc? Is it possible to block/inhibit AML import of acetate or stromal cell secretion of acetate in order to assess the impact of this phenomenon? Can alterations in culture conditions or treatment with AML therapy relevant drugs demonstrate a dependency/advantage conferred by stromal derived acetate? If so, this would significantly boost the impact of the work and demonstrate the importance of the mechanism.</p><p>2) It may seem to be nit-picking, but I noted that it has not been directly shown that AML cells can metabolise the acetate that is produced by stromal cells upon co-culture. The metabolic tracing experiments have been performed using labelled acetate that has been added to the culture medium. Since this is a central claim of the manuscript, I think it is important to show this, if at all possible. Can the stromal cells be grown in media that will label the carbon molecules in acetate prior to co-culture, as opposed to adding acetate directly to the culture medium?</p><p>3) Although the authors show no effect of AML cell growth upon co-culture, they do not assess whether the growth of stromal cells is altered. This would have important implications for the interpretation of any alteration in metabolism of these cells.</p><p>4) I would strongly encourage the authors to use an additional method to rescue ROS production rather than NAC, which is problematic in this experimental setting since it can directly feed into the metabolic pathways that are being studied. As well as considering the use of other chemicals that are considered to act as antioxidants, I would also encourage the authors to explore overexpression of ROS detoxifying enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and catalase. By taking the latter approach, one could specifically detoxify ROS in either AML cells or stromal cells, which would help to strengthen the proposed transfer mechanism. Genetic ablation/knockdown of the same enzymes could also be used as an elegant way to strengthen the ROS transfer concept.</p><p>5) Relating to 4), I was very surprised that the authors referenced the prior work documenting transfer of mitochondria between stromal cells and HSCs via gap junctions, but did not address whether this was of any mechanistic relevance to their own observations. Since mitochondria are thought to be the major source of intracellular ROS, this would seem to be a clear alternative possible mechanism which would yield similar experimental outcomes to those observed by the authors.</p><p>6) The authors should make sure that the primary patient AML co-culture experiments have been conducted using identical culture conditions. It is problematic for the reader to assess the experimental outcome if culture conditions have been inconsistently altered across different test and control samples. I appreciate that such patient samples are not easy to acquire or work with, but the authors should repeat these experiments if necessary.</p><p>7) Related to 6), could the authors clearly state what the primary hematopoietic control cells that they use in the control experiments are? In the figure, it seems to suggest that peripheral blood mononuclear cells were used, but in the methods, it seems to suggest that CD34+ cells are used, which seems inconsistent with the description of PBMNCs. If the authors used CD34+ cells from AML patients, then I would suggest that CD34+ cells from the bone marrow of normal donors is probably the best control for this experiment.</p><p>My final comment is beyond the scope of the current manuscript, but I would also encourage the authors to pursue this line of investigation further using the murine MLL-AF9 model that they perform a preliminary characterization with in this manuscript. This would afford the possibility of using a wide range of genetic models to interrogate mechanism in vivo, as well as a being an attractive model to explore biological relevance in the context of disease evolution and therapy.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.75908.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The conclusion that acetate is used as biofuel by AML cells is not supported by the data at least in the co-culture. Please strengthen this conclusion based on the following comments, and specific comments from Reviewer 2 and 3. The intracellular labelling in Figure 2E does not show a significant increase in any of the TCA cycle intermediates labelling in the SKM-1 cells compared to MS-5 and S3B does not show the MS-5 levels at all. The big increase in acetyl-carnitine without corresponding increase in TCA cycle intermediates makes one wonder if there is a blockage in oxidation of this product.</p></disp-quote><p>We have taken into consideration the reviewers’ comments and performed intracellular labelling by adding [2-<sup>13</sup>C] acetate to the coculture before harvesting and separating AML and MS-5 cells 30 minutes after acetate addition. The new data clearly shows labelling in TCA intermediates: citrate, glutamate, oxoglutarate, malate, proline and succinate in SKM-1 and Kasumi-1 cells whilst labelled citrate, glutamate and succinate are the main metabolites found in HL-60 cells. In contrast, no labelled metabolites were found in the stromal cells. We have included this data in Figure 2C and Figure 2-Supplement Figure 2B-C (left panels). In this respect the result is the same as for MS-5 and SKM-1 grown in isolation.</p><p>We have also performed NMR experiments to detect intracellular labelling in MS-5 at 8 hours to complete former figure S3B (new Figure 2-Supplement Figure 2B-C, right panels). Consistent with observations for MS-5 in co-culture with SKM1 at 8h, no intracellular labelling was detected in MS-5 at any given time when co-cultured with any of the three AML cell lines. As the MS-5 labelling experiments did not show any labelling in TCA intermediates, neither at 2h nor at 8h (n=3), the intracellular analysis of MS5 at 30 minutes labelling and 8h labelling for Kasumi-1 and HL-60 was performed only in one set to confirm that no label was incorporated as previously agreed with the reviewer editor.</p><p>We have also explored other possible products of acetate by analysing the intracellular non-polar fraction of AML cells after labelling with [2-<sup>13</sup>C] acetate for 8 and 48 hours. Our data revealed that at 8h, no label incorporation could be detected in the non-polar or lipid fraction (New Figure 2- Supplement Figure 3). In contrast, at 48h, the <sup>1</sup>H spectrum shows <sup>13</sup>C-coupled <sup>1</sup>H-signals at 0.75-0.80 ppm arising from <sup>13</sup>C incorporation (<sup>13</sup>C ‘satellite’ signals) in lipid CH<sub>3</sub> groups (New Figure 2D and Figure 2-Supplement Figure 4). While NMR cannot determine the chain length of the lipids, integration of the signals yields the overall label incorporation in any lipid CH<sub>3</sub> groups, indicating that acetate is being used for lipid biosynthesis.</p><p>With regards to the big increase in labelled acetyl carnitine, we would like to clarify that the graphs represent percentage of label incorporation from labelled acetate and not metabolite concentration. What we can conclude from our data is that the label incorporation in most of the acetyl moiety of acetycarnitine (C9) is higher, hence, highlighting that it derives from acetate.</p><p>It is possible that an increase in the concentration of acetylcarnitine is also happening. This possibility would be in line with other reports showing that when formation of acetyl-CoA exceeds use by the TCA cycle, an increase in acetylcarnitine is observed which could function as a reservoir to keep the mitochondrial acetyl-CoA/free CoA ratio low to sustain TCA cycle flux (Lindeboom <italic>et al.,</italic> JCI, 2014). Therefore, the addition of labelled acetate could result in a big increase of labelled acetylcarnitine as storage to sustain TCA flux as previously reported. A block in b-oxidation would be supported by the slow incorporation into lipids but there is insufficient data to proof this point. However, high levels of label incorporation in acetylcarnitine and other TCA cycle intermediates are in agreement with the proposed mechanism where AML cells import and use acetate to feed the TCA cycle and for lipogenesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is important to show that the acetate used by AML cells is produced by MS5 cells. Is it possible to demonstrate not just AML cells uptake of acetate but the full pathway of U-C13 entering MS5 cells and subsequently AML cells? It should be possible to use data from the experiment with U-C13 glucose labelling , to show intracellular labelling in MS-5 and AML cells. These data will be very useful to 1. Confirm glycolysis is upregulated in MS-5 cells in co-culture, 2. Acetate is coming from the labelled pyruvate in MS-5 cells. These data should be presented to support the claims that at the moment is mostly indirect re MS-5 upregulating glycolysis and producing acetate via pyruvate through a non-enzymatic reaction. Please consider specific points from Reviewer 2 and 3 linked to this.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this concern raised by the reviewers as we also asked ourselves the same question. In part this question is answered in the question above, although it would be nicer to proof flux from MS-5 to AML cells directly. Unfortunately, this is extremely difficult, if not impossible. We believe this is because acetate is not transferred via any specific junction, but rather secreted from MS-5 cells (as proven by our data) and taken up by AML cells.</p><p>Nevertheless, we have attempted to label MS-5 cells with [U-<sup>13</sup>C]glucose prior to co-culture with AML cells. However, after removing the spent medium containing labelled acetate (and the remaining labelled glucose before co-culturing cells), the amount of label left in MS-5 cells is not sufficient to accumulate in the medium and be taken up by AML cells. Moreover, as new non-labelled glucose is added in the form of fresh medium when starting the co-culture, any acetate newly generated from glucose is unlabelled, hence decreasing even more the percentage of labelled acetate. This is consistent with the view described above that MS-5 cells actually do not store acetate, but rather secrete it into the medium, and part of it is subsequently taken up by AML cells. Without a sufficient amount of labelled acetate present in the medium it is impossible to detect labelling in AML cells by NMR (and possibly by any other technique).</p><p>We have performed 2D HSQCs spectra on intracellular polar metabolites in MS-5 cells cultured alone vs in co-culture labelled with [1,2-<sup>13</sup>C]glucose and have found that labelling in acetate, alanine and lactate is higher in co-culture (although only significant for lactate). This is more clear when %13C are represented as ratios.</p><p>Interestingly, we do not observe pyruvate intracellularly in MS-5 cells and therefore cannot assess label incorporation, probably owing to fast turn-over into acetate.</p><p>However, we believe that the build-up of acetate in the medium and the general increase in label incorporation in acetate and other metabolites derived from this pathway supports our claims on the upregulation of glycolysis in MS-5 cells in coculture and MS-5 cells as the major source for acetate. This data has been incorporated in Figure 3E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The biological relevance of the presented findings needs strengthening, especially given that the AML cells do not grow more on MS5 cells than in single culture. Are the findings linked to AML growth, or perhaps chemoresistance or leukaemia propagation? Please note points from Reviewer 1 and 3 when addressing this.</p></disp-quote><p>To understand the biological relevance of our findings we have performed survival assays when cells are treated with the chemotherapeutic drug cytarabine (AraC) and with the ACSS2 inhibitor (ACSS2i) alone or in combination, in medium without glucose in the presence of 4mM acetate or in normal media media (containing glucose but not acetate). This experiment was not performed in coculture as we reasoned it would be clearer to use just the cancer cells, to avoid the possibility of other metabolites provided by MS-5 having an effect on cell survival.</p><p>Our data shows that the AraC treatment affects cell survival in a cell line-dependent manner, with HL-60 being the more sensitive to this drug then Kasumi-1 and SKM-1. Interestingly and supporting the importance of acetate in cell metabolism, the survival of the cells treated with ACSS2i is greatly compromised and the combination of AraC and ACSS2i showed very consistently sensitisation of all the AML cell lines studied to AraC. We also performed these experiments in medium supplemented with a high concentration of acetate (4mM) and found a partial recovery of this sensitisation. We believe that these results highlight the importance of acetate for AML cells and reveal a potential role of acetate in AML chemoresistance. This data can be found in the new Figure 2E and explained in the text in lines 199-220.</p><p>Additionally, we have performed in vivo experiments in which mice were transplanted with leukaemic cells and injected with a ROS inducer (TBHP) alone or in combination with the gap junction inhibitor CBX. TBHP injection accelerated the development of leukaemia, promoting an increase in the total monocyte count in peripheral blood and reducing the lifespan of TBHP- versus vehicle-treated leukaemic mice. Moreover, our data showed that administration of the gap junction inhibitor partially counteracts the effect of TBPH in both monocyte counts and survival. This data can be found in the new Figure 5G and 5H and explained in the text in lines 357-367. These in vivo results support a biological relevance in leukaemia progression for our observations in vitro involving ROS transfer through gap junctions between AML and stromal cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) the link between gap junctions, ROS transfer and induction of acetate production needs strengthening. See Reviewr 2 point: the experiments are overall convincing including re the role of gap junctions. What is missing is direct proof that inhibiting gap junction would reduce acetate production in the co-culture and this is something that needs done to support the statement that it is the ROS transfer via gap junction that is leading to acetate production.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer and provide with a direct proof that inhibiting gap junctions reduces acetate production, we have performed co-cultures with CBX to inhibit the gap junctions and measured acetate extracellular levels by NMR. Our results show that gap junction inhibition reduces acetate production in co-cultures in the three cell lines. The results can be found in new Figure 5F and explained in the text in lines 349-356.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>And Reviewer 1: is the metabolic rewiring and overexpression of gap junctions a consequence of increased ROS? Or are gap junctions upregulated first, leading to increased ROS intake and metabolic re-wiring?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point that we have addressed by performing experiments using a ROS-scavenging enzyme (catalase) as suggested by reviewer 3. First, we performed a dose curve and observed that a decrease in ROS levels could be seen at concentrations above 100ug/ml. We chose 500ug/ml of catalase to perform further experiments. We pre-treated the AML cells with catalase for 24h and assessed gap junction formation by following the calcein-AM transfer protocol as before. Our results showed that catalase treatment reduces calcein-AM transfer in co-culture and, thus, the ability of forming gap junctions (new Figure 5I). This result together with new NMR data showing that in the presence of GAP junction inhibitor (CBX) the production of acetate is reduced (Figure 5F) provides clarification on the order of events, which we believe occurs as follows: high ROS in AML cells induces gap junction formation as a mechanism of ROS transfer to stromal cells causing the metabolic rewiring (model in new Figure 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) While further extensive in vivo experiments may be beyond the scope of this work and would require considerably longer than 3 months to complete, is there any evidence from already published transcriptomic datasets that stroma cells in vivo upregulate the same genes/pathways? Is it possible to identify the specific cell type responsible for the mechanism presented here?</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer we have made use of published data sets in particular the single cell RNA seq data published in Cell by the group of David Scadden (Baryawno et al., Cell 2019) in which they analysed the transcriptome of bone marrow stroma in homeostasis versus leukaemia (using MLL-AF9 knock-in mice: Corral et al., 1996). These data sets show three specific clusters (cluster 1, 4 and 7) present in leukaemic stroma, which have upregulated the glycolysis and hypoxia pathways. The proportion of osteoprogenitor cluster (cluster 7) was shown to increase in the stroma of leukaemic mice, and cells in this cluster shared the same hallmark gene sets that MS-5 in co-culture: TNFalpha, Hypoxia, allograft rejection, glycolysis, IFNγ, K-ras, complement, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, IL2-STAT5 etc (Table S4 in Baryawno et al., 2019).</p><p>This information has been included in the discussion, in lines 429-435.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Please clarify the rational behind the choice of AML cell lines and human healthy control samples used.</p></disp-quote><p>We made use of three different AML cell lines during this work to cover a range of AML and not looking at a specific subtype. The subtypes chosen would reflect M2 immature AML (HL-60), MS-5 mature AML (SKM-1) and AML with the common translocation AML1-ETO (Kasumi-1). As requested by the reviewer we have included this information in line 88.</p><p>Human healthy control samples were CD34+ cells from the peripheral blood.

The main conclusion of the paper, ie that acetate production is increased in co-culture most likely because of stroma production and is taken up by AML cells, is supported by the data. Some of the other conclusions re the utilisation of acetate in AML cells and the exact mechanism leading to acetate production might require further experimental work to be fully supported. The authors make an effort to validate their findings in primary AML cells model and in vivo although the mechanistic insight is mostly done in AML cell lines grown on a MS-5 stromal layer. As a result whether the described interaction is also present in other stroma/AML combination remains to be demonstrated. However I think this is not necessary for this paper.</p><p>Technically the paper appears rigorous although I would not be able to comment on the technical aspects of the NMR analysis and I would hope some of the other reviewers can comment on that.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>Figure 1 – overall I find the data here convincing. My main criticism is that the author appear to support the notion that acetate comes from MS-5 cells only while it cannot be excluded that AML cells might be reprogrammed by the stroma to a certain extent to produce acetate as in 1D for SKM1 and HL60 there is a slight increase in acetate following interruption of the coculture. See below on how to strengthen this conclusion or otherwise reword the discussion</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, the discussion has been reworded to contemplate the possibility of AML metabolism being rewired.

Stromal growth could not be altered as stromal cells are grown until confluency prior to the experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) I would strongly encourage the authors to use an additional method to rescue ROS production rather than NAC, which is problematic in this experimental setting since it can directly feed into the metabolic pathways that are being studied. As well as considering the use of other chemicals that are considered to act as antioxidants, I would also encourage the authors to explore overexpression of ROS detoxifying enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and catalase. By taking the latter approach, one could specifically detoxify ROS in either AML cells or stromal cells, which would help to strengthen the proposed transfer mechanism. Genetic ablation/knockdown of the same enzymes could also be used as an elegant way to strengthen the ROS transfer concept.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that experiments with genetic ablation/knockdown of catalase or superoxide dismutase would be a very good way to strengthen our results. Still, given the amount of time that we required for performing the essential experiments, these experiments have not been pursued.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have performed additional experiments using the ROS-scavenging enzyme catalase. Treating cocultures with catalase affected acetate production by MS-5 (New Figure 4-Supplement Figure 1C).</p><p>Additionally, based on the suggestion of using catalase to strengthen the proposed mechanism, we have performed experiments to determine the order of events (ROS/gap junction) and found a reduction in gap junction formation measured by calcein transfer when co-cultures are treated with catalase (New Figure 5I). Please, see answer to point 4 in “essentials”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Relating to 4), I was very surprised that the authors referenced the prior work documenting transfer of mitochondria between stromal cells and HSCs via gap junctions, but did not address whether this was of any mechanistic relevance to their own observations. Since mitochondria are thought to be the major source of intracellular ROS, this would seem to be a clear alternative possible mechanism which would yield similar experimental outcomes to those observed by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned by the reviewer, we were aware and cited the work of others revealing the importance of mitochondria and activation of glutathione-related antioxidant pathways in AML as a way of detox from ROS excess due to chemotherapy (Forte <italic>et al.,</italic> Cell Metabolism,2020 reference 14). Although the work from Forte <italic>et al.,</italic> did not explore the mechanism of mitochondria transfer, previous work by others have linked the mitochondrial transfer to the formation of tunnelling nanotubes (TNT) (Vignais et al., Stem cells International 2017; Kolba et al., Cell Death and Dis, 2019, Moschoi et al., Blood 2016). To our knowledge, mitochondria transfer between AML and stromal cells has never been linked directly to gap junctions Although transference of mitochondria through gap junction may indeed occur, our work aims to highlight a novel mechanism of ROS transfer (ROS/Gap/metabolic rewiring) that the AML cells use beyond mitochondria transfer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors should make sure that the primary patient AML co-culture experiments have been conducted using identical culture conditions. It is problematic for the reader to assess the experimental outcome if culture conditions have been inconsistently altered across different test and control samples. I appreciate that such patient samples are not easy to acquire or work with, but the authors should repeat these experiments if necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the concern of the reviewer. This was mainly due to the different growth conditions that were established in the two labs, JJ Schruinga’s lab where the first author of the paper spent a placement and our lab in the University of Birmingham. Still, I would think that the fact that by using two different culture conditions primary AML behave in the same way regarding acetate would be seen as a strength rather than a weakness, as it validates our observations in two different settings. Moreover, data is relative to MS-5 cells cultured in the exact conditions as the matching AML co-cultures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Related to 6), could the authors clearly state what the primary hematopoietic control cells that they use in the control experiments are? In the figure, it seems to suggest that peripheral blood mononuclear cells were used, but in the methods, it seems to suggest that CD34+ cells are used, which seems inconsistent with the description of PBMNCs. If the authors used CD34+ cells from AML patients, then I would suggest that CD34+ cells from the bone marrow of normal donors is probably the best control for this experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>We used CD34+ cells from peripheral blood. We have changed PBMC in the figure legend by “healthy” (Figure 1F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>My final comment is beyond the scope of the current manuscript, but I would also encourage the authors to pursue this line of investigation further using the murine MLL-AF9 model that they perform a preliminary characterization with in this manuscript. This would afford the possibility of using a wide range of genetic models to interrogate mechanism in vivo, as well as a being an attractive model to explore biological relevance in the context of disease evolution and therapy.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his comment; indeed this is something that we would like to pursue further.</p></body></sub-article></article>
