Wnt and macropinocytosis are often active in the same processes, and understanding how Wnt signaling and membrane trafficking cooperate should improve our understanding of embryonic development and cancer. Here, we show that a macropinocytosis activator, the tumor promoter phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), enhances Wnt signaling. Experiments using the <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryo as an in vivo model showed marked cooperation between the PMA phorbol ester and Wnt signaling, which was blocked by inhibitors of macropinocytosis, Rac1 activity, and lysosome acidification. Human colorectal cancer tissue arrays and xenografts in mice showed a correlation of cancer progression with increased macropinocytosis/multivesicular body/lysosome markers and decreased GSK3 levels. The crosstalk between canonical Wnt, focal adhesions, lysosomes, and macropinocytosis suggests possible therapeutic targets for cancer progression in Wnt-driven cancers.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Wnt signaling</kwd><kwd>macropinocytosis</kwd><kwd>lysosomes</kwd><kwd>colorectal cancer</kwd><kwd>β-catenin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014807</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research Coordinating Committee</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C21CRC2039</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>De Robertis</surname><given-names>Edward M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P20CA016042</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>De Robertis</surname><given-names>Edward M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007185</institution-id><institution>Sprague Endowment for Molecular Oncology, University of California, Los Angeles</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BD-55</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>De Robertis</surname><given-names>Edward M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The archetypal tumor promoter PMA, which promotes cancer without mutating the DNA, increases Wnt signaling by activating macropinocytosis and membrane trafficking in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos and tumor cells.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cancer progression is a process during which mutations in various signaling pathways accumulate in the cell leading to uncontrolled growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kinzler and Vogelstein, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</xref>). Cancer progression is also influenced by tumor promoters, substances that do not mutate the DNA by themselves but nevertheless facilitate cancer development. In 1941, Berenblum and Rous found that inflammatory agents such as croton oil or turpentine could induce skin cancer when applied repeatedly to mouse or rabbit skin, but only when an initiator mutagen such as benzopyrene or anthracene had been previously painted on that patch of skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berenblum, 1941</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rous and Kidd, 1941</xref>). The active agent in croton oil was later purified and found to be the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), also known as 12-<italic>O</italic>-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). The molecular mechanism by which PMA promotes cancer is incompletely understood but involves the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) in the plasma membrane, where PMA mimics the endogenous second messenger diacylglycerol (DAG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nishizuka, 1984</xref>). Tumor promoters cause chronic inflammation and significantly contribute to tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Weinberg and Weinberg, 2007</xref>).</p><p>The canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway is a major driver of cancer and plays a crucial role in embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">MacDonald et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nusse and Clevers, 2017</xref>). In the case of colon cancer, the great majority of tumors are initiated by mutation of the tumor suppressor Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC), which is a component of the destruction complex that normally degrades the transcriptional regulator β-catenin, leading to its accumulation in the nucleus and benign polyp formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kinzler and Vogelstein, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Segditsas and Tomlinson, 2006</xref>). Activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is also the driving force in many other cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Galluzzi et al., 2019</xref>). A key regulator of Wnt signaling is Glycogen Synthetase 3 (GSK3), which phosphorylates β-catenin, leading to the formation of a phosphodegron that triggers its degradation in the proteasome. Upon activation of the Wnt receptors, GSK3, together with the destruction complex, is sequestered into multivesicular bodies (MVBs), also known as the late endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Taelman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vinyoles et al., 2014</xref>). The translocation of GSK3 from the cytosol into MVBs/lysosomes leads to the stabilization of many other cellular proteins in addition to β-catenin, in a process designated Wnt-STOP (Wnt-Stabilization of Proteins) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acebron et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albrecht et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The many GSK3 phosphorylation targets stabilized by Wnt signaling include regulators of macropinocytosis such as Ras, Rac1, and Pak1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Taelman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albrecht et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jeong et al., 2012</xref>). A recent advance was the realization that Wnt signaling requires macropinocytosis (i.e., cell drinking) in order to traffic activated Wnt receptors and GSK3 to MVBs and lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Redelman-Sidi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tejeda-Muñoz et al., 2019</xref>). Wnt-induced macropinocytosis also causes the internalization of focal adhesions (FAs) and integrins from the cell surface into MVBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tejeda-Muñoz et al., 2022c</xref>). The requirement of macropinocytosis for Wnt signaling is revealed, for example, by the decrease in nuclear β-catenin when colorectal cancer (CRC) cells mutant for APC were treated with macropinocytosis inhibitors such as the derivative of the diuretic Amiloride known as 5-(<italic>N</italic>-Ethyl-<italic>N</italic>-isopropyl) Amiloride (EIPA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tejeda-Muñoz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tejeda-Muñoz and De Robertis, 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tejeda-Muñoz and De Robertis, 2022b</xref>).</p><p>Macropinocytosis is emerging in the field as a promising target for cancer treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lambies and Commisso, 2022</xref>). In addition, it has been found that the macropinocytosis induced by Wnt signaling causes significant lysosome acidification and activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albrecht et al., 2020</xref>). There is also accumulating evidence showing that the size and number of lysosomes increase during carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cardone et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kroemer and Jäättelä, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhitomirsky and Assaraf, 2016</xref>). Lysosomes, previously thought to be the garbage disposal of the cell, have emerged as central organelles in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kirkegaard and Jäättelä, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kirkegaard and Jäättelä, 2009</xref>).</p><p>From the considerations above, investigating the intersection of Wnt signaling, macropinocytosis, lysosomes, FAs, and membrane trafficking, is of great interest. While in most cells macropinocytosis requires stimulation of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Haigler et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yoshida et al., 2018</xref>), Ras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bar-Sagi and Feramisco, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Commisso et al., 2013</xref>), or Wnt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Redelman-Sidi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tejeda-Muñoz et al., 2019</xref>), some cells, such as amoebae and macrophages, have constitutive macropinocytosis. Importantly, Swanson discovered that the phorbol ester PMA stimulated macropinocytosis even in macrophages that were thought to have fully activated constitutive macropinocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Swanson, 1989</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we asked whether phorbol ester could interact with canonical Wnt signaling. Using the <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryo, which provides a premier model system to analyze the Wnt pathway, we found that PMA, which lacked any effects on its own, greatly sensitized the embryo to dorsalization by Wnt signaling, leading to the formation of radial head structures lacking trunks. The dorsalizing effect of PMA on embryos was blocked by the macropinocytosis inhibitor EIPA, the lysosomal V-ATPase inhibitor Bafilomycin A (Baf), or the Rac1 inhibitor EHT1864. Rac1 is an upstream regulator of the p21-activated kinase 1 (Pak1) required for actin-mediated macropinocytosis. Lysosomal activity was specifically required at the 32-cell stage for the activity of the Wnt-mimicking GSK3 inhibitor Lithium Chloride (LiCl). Ectopic axes induced by dominant- negative GSK3 (DN-GSK3-β) or β-catenin mRNAs were blocked by EIPA or dominant-negative Rab7, indicating a widespread requirement of membrane trafficking for Wnt signaling.</p><p>The involvement of membrane trafficking in Wnt-driven cancer was supported by immunostaining results of arrayed human CRC histological sections, in which we found that the grade of malignancy increased Pak1, CD63 (an MVB marker), and V0a3 (a V-ATPase subunit that marks lysosomes) levels, while decreasing GSK3. In <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos, twinning induced by Xwnt8 mRNA microinjection was blocked by inhibition of Rac1. In cultured CRC SW480 cells reconstituted with APC, the FA marker Tes was cytoplasmic, while the same cells mutant for APC (in which the Wnt pathway is activated) Tes was nuclear. The results suggest that macropinocytosis and membrane trafficking play an important role in embryogenesis and cancer progression.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The phorbol ester PMA potentiates Wnt-like signals in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos via macropinocytosis and lysosomal acidification</title><p>Wnt is one of the earliest signals in the embryo and it induces the formation of the primary dorsal–ventral and head-to-tail axes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Loh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Niehrs, 2012</xref>). It is known that β-catenin is required for Wnt signaling activation on the dorsal side during early cleavage. Recently, we reported that inhibition of macropinocytosis with EIPA, or of lysosomal acidification with Baf, ventralized endogenous early dorsal axis formation, leading in particular to reduced head and brain structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tejeda-Muñoz and De Robertis, 2022a</xref>). Activation of lysosomes on the dorsal side of the embryo was detectable as early as the 64-cell stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tejeda-Muñoz and De Robertis, 2022a</xref>).</p><p>The tumor promoter PMA is known to increase macropinocytosis in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Swanson, 1989</xref>). To test its activity during early development, we used a sensitized system in which a small amount of the GSK3 inhibitor LiCl (4 nl at 300 mM in a single ventral injection at 4-cell) causes only a small dorsalization with slightly enlarged heads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kao et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tejeda-Muñoz and De Robertis, 2022a</xref>). The dorsalizing effects of PMA were most striking when phenotypes were analyzed at the early tailbud stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–H</xref>). LiCl alone expanded head structures only slightly and PMA alone was without effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B, E</xref>). However, the combination of PMA and LiCl lead to radially dorsalized embryos consisting of head structures lacking trunks (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–F</xref>). This striking phenotype was eliminated by co-injection of EIPA or Baf, suggesting that macropinocytosis and lysosomal acidification are required for the effect of PMA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G, H</xref>). Injection of Baf alone decreased head and neural development, supporting a requirement for lysosomes for endogenous dorsal axis formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

The main finding was a synergistic positive effect between the tumor promoter phorbol ester (PMA) and activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway that was blocked by EIPA or Baf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). EIPA is a macropinocytosis inhibitor of the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger at the plasma membrane; it causes acidification of the submembranous cytoplasm and prevents actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Koivusalo et al., 2010</xref>).

Importantly, cancer malignancy correlated with low levels of GSK3 staining, both in human samples and nude mouse SW480 xenografts. Cancer cells require lysosome function and have changes in lysosomal volume and subcellular localization during oncogenic transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kirkegaard and Jäättelä, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kirkegaard and Jäättelä, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gocheva and Joyce, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kolwijck et al., 2010</xref>).

We previously reported that Wnt causes the endocytosis of FA proteins and depletion of Integrin β1 from the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tejeda-Muñoz et al., 2022c</xref>). We now report that Tes, a member of the PET-LIM family of FA proteins, changed subcellular localization after Wnt activation in SW480 cells.

FAK is a key signaling kinase that regulates FA signaling. In SW480 cells (which have constitutive Wnt signaling), FAK protein levels were increased by PMA, and this was inhibited by EIPA or Baf. The FAK inhibitor PF-00562271 inhibited β-catenin signaling in Luciferase assays, and reduced dorsal-anterior structures such as CNS in embryos after incubation for 7 min at 32-cell stage that is critical for the early Wnt signaling. These results suggest a possible crosstalk between FAs, Wnt signaling and tumor promoters in cancer progression and embryonic development.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Cooperation between PMA and Wnt</title><p>PMA activates PKC signaling by mimicking its physiological second messenger DAG, an activator of PKC.

It has been reported that PMA can stabilize CK1ε (Casein Kinase 1 epsilon), enhance its kinase activity, and induce LRP6 phosphorylation at Thr1479 and Ser1490, leading to the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Su et al., 2018</xref>). In the context of the present study, it is relevant that Wnt signaling rapidly triggers macropinocytosis and trafficking into lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tejeda-Muñoz et al., 2019</xref>). Macropinocytosis requires the activation of phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K) which leads to the formation of patches of PIP3 in the inner plasma membrane leaflet that initiate the formation of macropinocytic cups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Egami et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yoshida et al., 2018</xref>). During macropinosome formation, the PIP<sub>3</sub> lipid is then converted into DAG by phospholipase C gamma 1 (PLCγ1), and DAG activates PKC signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yoshida et al., 2018</xref>). It seems likely that PMA may facilitate Wnt/β-catenin signaling by mimicking the DAG lipid in macropinosomes. We have tested this hypothesis by direct addition of DAG to cells and found cooperation with Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Azbazdar et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>In the future, it will be interesting to study the role of chronic inflammation on macropinocytosis and tumor promotion.

After this treatment, the embryos were washed two times with 0.1× MMR solution and cultured until the tadpole stage, or incubated again for 7 min in 0.1 MMR solution containing 5 μM Baf, and washed as described before. In the converse experiment, embryos were first treated with Baf and then with LiCl.

Following up on their previous papers, the authors present evidence that PMA enhances Wnt signaling and embryonic patterning through macropinocytosis. Strikingly, PMA and Wnt ligand act synergistically to trigger macropinocytosis in fibroblasts. Proteins that are associated with the endo-lysosomal pathway and Wnt signaling are co-increased in colorectal cancer samples, consistent with their pro-tumorigenic action. The function of macropinocytosis is not well understood in most physiological contexts, and its role in Wnt signaling is intriguing. The authors use a wide range of models - <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos, cancer cells in culture and in xenografts and patient samples to investigate several endolysosomal processes that appear to act upstream or downstream of Wnt. This broad approach has the downside that results are often validated only in a subset of biological systems and that experiments tend to lack of mechanistic depth. The connections between PMA, Wnt signaling, Rac stabilization, FAK signaling and macropinocytosis remain unclear. Nevertheless, the results provide intriguing insights into a novel connection of the tumor promoting agent PMA and Wnt signaling in development and cancer.</p><p>The authors demonstrate striking, additive effects of Wnt3a and PMA in inducing macropinocytosis in 3T3 cells (Fig. 1 K-P). In the APC-mutant colorectal cancer line SW480, the authors show that PMA treatment increases macropinocytosis (Fig. S1). While these data provide additional confirmation that PMA can trigger macropinocytosis, they do not address the role of Wnt signaling directly. This could be done by restoring APC function in SW480 cells, or by ectopically activating Wnt signaling in a CRC cell line that lacks activating mutations in the Wnt pathway.

Furthermore, they investigate the effect of the inflammation inducer Phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) in WNT signalling activation through macropinocytosis. They propose that macropinocytosis is a key driver of WNT signalling, including upon oncogenic activation, with relevance in cancer progression.</p><p>I found the analyses and conclusions of the relevance of macropinocytosis in WNT signalling compelling, notably upon constitutive activation both during development and in CRC.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>However, I think this manuscript only partially characterises the effects of PMA in WNT signalling, largely due to a lack of an epistatic characterisation of PMA roles in Wnt activation. For example: 1- The authors show that PMA cooperate with (1) GSK3 inhibition in <italic>Xenopus</italic> to promote WNT activation, and (2) (possibly) with APCmut in SW480 to induce b-cat and FAK accumulation. To sustain a specific functional interaction between WNT and PMA, the effects should be tested through additional epistatic experiments. For example, does PMA cooperate with Wnt8 in axis duplication analyses? Does PMA cooperate with any other WNT alteration in CRC or other cell lines? Importantly, does APC re-introduction in SW480 rescue the effect of PMA? Such analyses could be critical to determine specificity of the functional interactions between WNT and PMA. This question could be addressed by performing classical epistatic analyses in cell lines (CRC or HEK) focusing on WNT activity, and by including rescue experiments targeting the WNT pathway downstream of the effects e.g., dnTCF, APC re- introduction, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that there was need for additional direct evidence of functional interactions of between macropinocytosis, Wnt signaling, and PMA beyond the previously provided target gene assays in <italic>Xenopus</italic> (now shown in Figure 1I) and luciferase assays in cultured cells (Figure 1J) which used LiCl and inhibition by Bafilomycin. We therefore carried out a new experiment using 3T3 cells, now shown in Figure 1K-P. Wnt3a protein increased the uptake of TMR-dextran 70 kDa, and PMA enhanced this response. The macropinocytosis inhibitor EIPA blocked induction of macropinocytosis by Wnt3a and PMA. These results were quantitated in Figure 1Q.

Following up on their previous papers, the authors present evidence that PMA enhances Wnt signaling and embryonic patterning through macropinocytosis. Proteins that are associated with the endo-lysosomal pathway and Wnt signaling are co-increased in colorectal cancer samples, consistent with their pro-tumorigenic action. The function of macropinocytosis is not well understood in most physiological contexts, and its role in Wnt signaling is intriguing. The authors use a wide range of models - <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos, cancer cells in culture and in xenografts and patient samples to investigate several endolysosomal processes that appear to act upstream or downstream of Wnt. A downside of this broad approach is a lack of mechanistic depth. In particular, few experiments monitor macropinocytosis directly, and macropinocytosis manipulations have pleiotropic effects that are open alternative interpretations. Several experiments are confirmatory of previous findings; the manuscript could be improved by focusing on the novel relationship between PMA-induced macropinocytosis and better support these conclusions with additional experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>New additional experiments focusing on the role of PMA are now provided.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors use a range of inhibitors that suppress macropinosome formation (EIPA, Bafilomycin A1, Rac1 inhibition). However, these are not specific macropinocytosis inhibitors (EIPA blocks an Na+/H+ exchanger, which is highly toxic and perturbs cellular pH balance; Bafilomycin blocks the V-ATPase, which has essential functions in the Golgi, endosomes and lysosomes; Rac1 signals through multiple downstream pathways). A specific macropinocytosis inhibitor does not exist, and it is thus important to support key conclusions with dextran uptake experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We used a wide range of inhibitors because the main idea is to show that membrane trafficking is important in Wnt and PMA activity. We would like to point out that the current experimental definition in the field of macropinocytosis, despite any caveats, is the ability to block dextran uptake with EIPA. Because inhibitors may not be entirely specific, we think using a broad approach to target membrane trafficking might be a plus. We now provide in Figure 1K-Q a new experiment showing that Wnt3a protein treatment increases dextran uptake and PMA stimulates this macropinocytosis in 3T3 cells. EIPA inhibited dextran macropinocytosis in the presence of Wnt and PMA (Figure 1N and 1Q). We also provide a time-lapse video of the rapid macropinocytic vesicles induction by PMA in SW480 CRC cells in which the plasma membrane is tagged (Supplemental Movie S1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The title states that PMA increases Wnt signaling through macropinocytosis. However, the mechanistic relationship between PMA-induced macropinocytosis and Wnt signaling is not well supported. The authors refer to a classical paper that demonstrates macropinocytosis induction by PMA in macrophages (PMID: 2613767). Unlike most cell types, macrophages display growth factor-induced and constitutive macropinocytic pathways (PMID: 30967001). It would thus be important to demonstrate macropinocytosis induction by PMA experimentally in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos / cancer cells. Does treatment with EIPA / Bafilomycin / Rac1i decrease the dextran signal in embryos? In macrophages, the PKC inhibitor Calphostin C blocks macropinocytosis induction by PMA (PMID: 25688212). Does Calphostin C block macropinocytosis in embryos / cancer cells? Do the various combinations of Wnts / Wnt agonists and PMA have additive or synergistic effects on dextran uptake? If the authors want to conclude that PMA activates Wnt signaling, it would also be important to demonstrate the effect of PMA on Wnt target gene expression.</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide a new experiment showing macropinocytosis induction of PMA experimentally in cancer cells.

With respect to final the point on the effect of PMA on Wnt target gene expression, this was shown in the context of the <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryo in Figure 1I (Siamois and Xnr3 are direct targets of Wnt).</p><fig id="sa3fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-89141-sa3-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The experiments concerning macropinosome formation in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos are not very convincing. Macropinosomes are circular vesicles whose size in mammalian cells ranges from 0.2 - 10 µM (PMID: 18612320). The TMR-dextran signal in Fig. 1A does not obviously label structures that look like macropinosomes; rather the signal is diffusely localized throughout the dorsal compartment, which could be extracellular (or perhaps cytosolic). I have similar concerns for the cell culture experiments, where dextran uptake is only shown for SW480 spheroids in Fig. S2. It would be helpful to quantify size of the circular structures (is this consistent with macropinosomes?).</p></disp-quote><p>In response, we have deleted the TMR experiments in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos; they will be reinvestigated at a later time. With respect to macropinosome sizes in cultured cells, they are indeed large at the plasma membrane level (see new Supplemental Movie S1), but rapidly decrease in size once dextran is concentrated inside the cell. This can be visualized in the new experiments showing dextran vesicles in Supplemental Figure S1J-K and Figure 1K-P.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Fig. 4I - J, the dramatic decrease in b-catenin and especially in Rac1 after overnight EIPA treatment is rather surprising. How do the authors explain these findings? Is there any evidence that macropinocytosis stabilizes Rac1? Could this be another effect of EIPA or general toxicity?</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide new evidence that Wnt signaling stabilizes Rac1. The old data relying on overnight EIPA treatment has been replaced by new experiments in 3T3 cells showing (i) that LiCl treatment increases levels of Rac1 protein and β-catenin levels (Figure 4I-J’’), (ii) that cells transfected with constitutively active β-catenin-GFP have higher levels of Rac1 than control untransfected cells (Figure 4K-K’’) and (iii) that Rac1 is stabilized in cells transfected with CA-Lrp6-GFP when compared to untransfected cells (Figure4L-L’’).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On a similar note, Fig. 6 K - L the FAK staining in control cells appears to localize to focal adhesions, but in PMA-treated cells is strongly localized throughout the cell. Do the authors have any thoughts on how PMA stabilizes FAK and where the kinase localizes under these conditions? Does PMA treatment increase FAK signaling activity?</p></disp-quote><p>The previous Figure 6K-L’’ are now found in Supplementary Figure S4, panels C-D’’. The result is that FAK is greatly stabilized by overnight incubation with PMA. How this achieved is unknown, perhaps the result of increased macropinocytosis, but we do not wish to speculate in the main manuscript. We have not measured FAK activity, but the FAK inhibitor PF-00562271 strongly decreased β-catenin signaling by GSK3 inhibition (Figure 6J) and has strong effects in neural development that mimic inhibition of the early Wnt signal (new experiments shown in Figure 6K-L’’’). The results suggest that FAK activity affects Wnt signaling and dorsal development; the molecular mechanism of this interaction is unknown but worthy of future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The tumor stainings in Figure 5 are interesting but correlative. Pak1 functions in multiple cellular processes and Pak1 levels are not a direct marker for macropinocytosis. In the discussion, the authors discuss evidence that the V-ATPase translocates to the plasma membrane in cancer to drive extracellular acidification. To which extent does the Voa3 staining reflect lysosomal V-ATPase? Do the authors have controls for antibody specificity?</p></disp-quote><p>It is true that Pak1 has multiple functions, yet it is essential for the actin machinery that drives macropinocytosis. We have now rephrased the discussion to say “Rac1 is an upstream regulator of the Pak1 kinase required for the actin machinery that drive macropinocytosis (Redelman-Sidi et al., 2018)”. We also explain that: “V-ATPase has been associated with acidification of the extracellular milieu in tumors (Capecci and Forgac, 2013; Hinton et al., 2009; Perona and Serrano, 1988). Extracellular acidification is probably due to increased numbers of lysosomes which are exocytosed, since V0a3 was located within the cytoplasm in advanced cancer or xenografts in mice (Figures 5I and S3I)”. The antibody we used for V0a3 is highly specific and has been used widely (Ramirez et al., 2019).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The manuscript by Tejeda-Munoz examines signaling by Wnt and macropinocytosis in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos and colon cancer cells. A major problem with the study is the extensive use of pleiotropic inhibitors as &quot;specific&quot; inhibitors of macropinocytosis in embryos. It is true that BafA and EIPA block macropinocytosis, but they do many other things as well. A major target of EIPA is the NheI Na+/proton transporter, which also regulates invasive structures (podosomes, invadopodia) which could have major roles in development. Similarly, Baf1 will disrupt lysosomes and the endocytic system, which secondary effects on mTOR signaling and growth factor receptor trafficking. The authors cannot assume that processes inhibited by these drugs demonstrate a role of macropinocytosis. While correlations in tumor samples between increased expression of PAK1 and V0a3 and decreased expression of GSK3 are consistent with a link between macropinocytosis and Wnt-driven malignancy, the cell and embryo-based experiments do not convincingly make this connection. Finally, the data on FAK and TES are not well integrated with the rest of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>The criticism that drugs are not entirely specific is a valid one. Our approach of using a variety of drugs such as EIPA, BafA, EHT1864 or FAK inhibitor PF-00562271 all point to the main conclusion that the membrane trafficking is important in signaling by Wnt and the action of the tumor promoter PMA. The data on FAK, TES and focal adhesions have been better integrated in the manuscript and new experiments on the effect of FAK inhibitor in embryonic dorsal development are now provided (Figure 6K-L’’’).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The data in Fig. 1A do not convincingly demonstrate macropinocytosis - it is impossible to tell what is being labeled by the dextran.</p></disp-quote><p>In response, we have deleted the TMR-dextran experiments in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos; they will be reported at a later time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The data in Fig. 2 do not make sense. LiCL2 bypasses the WNT activation pathway by inhibiting GSK3. If subsequent treatment with BafA blocks the effects of GSK3 inhibition, then BafrA is doing something unrelated to Wnt activation, whose target is the inhibition/sequestration of GSK3. While BafA might block GSK3 sequestration by inhibiting MVB function, it should have no effect on the inhibition of GSK3 by LiCl2.</p></disp-quote><p>We now explain in the main text describing Figure 2 in the results, the initial effect of GSK3 inhibition by LiCl is to trigger macropinocytosis (Albrecht et al., 2020). If the downstream acidification of lysosomes is inhibited, then the brief treatment with LiCl (7 min at 32-cell stage) has no effect (LiCl 1st+BafA 2nd, Figure 2H). BafA inhibits lysosomal acidification at 32-cell stage resulting in ventralization, but the effect of brief BafA treatment can be reversed by inducing membrane trafficking by LiCl (BafA 1st+LiCl 2nd, Figure 2C). The labelling of the figure panels C and H has been modified to indicate this is an order-of-addition experiment. These order-of-addition experiments strongly support the proposal that endogenous lysosomal activity is required to generate the initial endogenous Wnt signal that takes place at the 32-cell stage of development (Tejeda-Muñoz and De Robertis, 2022a).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The effect of EHT on MP in SW480 cells is not clearly related to what is happening in the embryos. The nearly total loss of staining for Rac and β-catenin after overnight EIPA does not implicate MP in protein stability - critical controls for cell viability and overall protein turnover are absent. Inhibition of WNT signaling might be expected to enhance β-catenin turnover, but the effect on Rac1 is surprising. A more quantitative analysis by western blotting is required.</p></disp-quote><p>The results from SW480 cells inhibition by EIPA have been replaced in Figure 4. We now provide new evidence in 3T3 cells that Wnt signaling stabilizes Rac1. The old data relying on EIPA treatment in SW480 cells has been replaced by new experiments in 3T3 cells showing (i) that LiCl treatment increases levels of Rac1 protein and β-catenin levels (Figure 4I-J’’), (ii) that cells transfected with constitutively active β-catenin-GFP have higher levels of Rac1 than control untransfected cells (Figure 4K-K’’) and (iii) that Rac1 is stabilized in cells transfected with CA-Lrp6-GFP when compared to untransfected cells (Figure4L-L’’). In the original EIPA experiment in SW480 cells, now deleted from this version of the manuscript, we tested the cell viability using a Vi-Cell Beckman-Coulter Viability Analyzer and found that cells were 96-98% viable but proliferation was strongly decreased after 12 h of EIPA treatment. The effect of brief Rac1 inhibition (7 min) in decreasing dorsal development in embryos at the critical 32-cell stage is robust (Figure 4A-C). In addition, coinjection of EHT is able to entirely block the effects of microinjected xWnt8 mRNA (compare Figure 4E to 4G, see also Figure 4H), suggesting that Rac1 is required for Wnt signaling. Quantitative target gene expression analysis is provided for the embryo experiments (Figure 4C and 4H); for the stabilization of Rac1 by Wnt we are not providing quantitative measurements, but found similar results with 3 independent approaches (LiCl, CA-β-catenin and CA-Lrp6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The data on FAK inhibition and TES trafficking are poorly integrated with the rest of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We attempted to better relate the TES trafficking to our previous paper showing that canonical Wnt signaling induces focal adhesion and Integrin-β1 endocytosis. We now write in the results: “We have previously reported a crosstalk between the Wnt and focal adhesion (FA) signaling pathways. Wnt3a treatment rapidly led to the endocytosis of Integrin β1 and of multiple focal adhesion proteins into MVBs (Tejeda-Muñoz et al., 2022). FAs link the actin cytoskeleton with the extracellular matrix (Figure 6A), and we now investigated whether FA activity is affected by Wnt signaling, PMA treatment and CRC progression”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>The reliance on pleiotropic inhibitors is a weakness and should be supplemented by genetic approaches to inhibit macropinocytosis.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, but that would be outside of the scope of this study.</p></body></sub-article></article>
