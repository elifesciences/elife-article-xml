misexpression in skeletal muscle causes facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). DUX4’s transcriptional activity has been extensively characterized, but the DUX4-induced proteome remains undescribed. Here, we report concurrent measurement of RNA and protein levels in DUX4-expressing cells via RNA-seq and quantitative mass spectrometry. DUX4 transcriptional targets were robustly translated, confirming the likely clinical relevance of proposed FSHD biomarkers. However, a multitude of mRNAs and proteins exhibited discordant expression changes upon DUX4 expression. Our dataset revealed unexpected proteomic, but not transcriptomic, dysregulation of diverse molecular pathways, including Golgi apparatus fragmentation, as well as extensive post-transcriptional buffering of stress-response genes. Key components of RNA degradation machineries, including UPF1, UPF3B, and XRN1, exhibited suppressed protein, but not mRNA, levels, explaining the build-up of aberrant RNAs that characterizes DUX4-expressing cells. Our results provide a resource for the FSHD community and illustrate the importance of post-transcriptional processes in DUX4-induced pathology.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy</kwd><kwd>nonsense-mediated RNA decay</kwd><kwd>post-transcriptional gene regulation</kwd><kwd>DUX4</kwd><kwd>FSHD</kwd><kwd>NMD</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01NS069539</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tapscott</surname><given-names>Stephen J</given-names></name><name><surname>Bradley</surname><given-names>Robert K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009824</institution-id><institution>FSH Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FSHS-22014-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jagannathan</surname><given-names>Sujatha</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005189</institution-id><institution>Leukemia and Lymphoma Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bradley</surname><given-names>Robert K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 CA015704</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ogata</surname><given-names>Yuko</given-names></name><name><surname>Gafken</surname><given-names>Philip R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000937</institution-id><institution>M.J.

Decades of work have generated a detailed list of the genes and pathways affected by DUX4 that may underlie FSHD pathophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Geng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Block et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Young et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Banerji et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Feng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Homma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dmitriev et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Shadle et al., 2017</xref>). An integrated model for how those DUX4-induced changes lead to disease has, however, remained elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Campbell et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lek et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Tassin et al., 2013</xref>). As transient and pulsatile expression of DUX4 is sufficient to induce pathology and cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Rickard et al., 2015</xref>), it is critical that we understand the cellular events and pathways set in motion by DUX4 that lead to eventual cell death, in order to develop effective therapeutics for FSHD.</p><p>DUX4 induces changes in the expression of hundreds of genes that impact dozens of highly interconnected pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Geng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Block et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Young et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Banerji et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Feng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Homma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dmitriev et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Shadle et al., 2017</xref>), making a cause-and-effect relationship between dysregulated gene expression and FSHD pathology difficult to discern. Because DUX4 is a strong transcriptional activator, most studies of DUX4 activity have focused on measuring gene expression at the transcript level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Geng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Rickard et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Knopp et al., 2016</xref>), thereby implicitly assuming that the transcriptome accurately represents the cellular proteome in DUX4-expressing cells. Although this is a reasonable assumption, it is well known that RNA and protein levels are not always concordant and that post-transcriptional regulation can result in divergent RNA and protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Schwanhäusser et al., 2011</xref>). A few proteomics studies have been conducted on FSHD muscle biopsies, but these early studies lack the depth necessary to allow meaningful comparisons with the DUX4-induced transcriptome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tassin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Celegato et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Laoudj-Chenivesse et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, given our recent discovery that DUX4 induces the proteolysis of a key RNA-binding protein, UPF1 (7), we hypothesized that paired measurements of RNA and protein levels might be particularly important in identifying altered post-transcriptional gene regulation in DUX4-expressing cells. Hence, we set out to generate reliable RNA- and protein-level measurements of DUX4-induced gene expression and, thereby, to elucidate the extent of post-transcriptional gene dysregulation in DUX4-expressing cells.</p><p>We used our previously established and validated cell culture models of DUX4 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jagannathan et al., 2016</xref>) to conduct RNA-seq and <underline>S</underline>table <underline>I</underline>sotope <underline>L</underline>abeling with <underline>A</underline>mino acids in <underline>C</underline>ell culture (SILAC) coupled with quantitative mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Harsha et al., 2008</xref>). The resulting data enabled us to measure DUX4-induced alterations in the transcriptome as well as protein levels for ~4000 genes with high confidence. Comparison of the transcript-level and protein-level alterations revealed three distinct patterns of expression for different subsets of genes: 1) concordant changes in expression at the RNA and protein levels for many transcriptional targets of DUX4; 2) post-transcriptional buffering of the expression of many genes, especially of those involved in stress-response pathways; and 3) discordant gene expression changes at the RNA versus protein levels for many genes, particularly those involved in RNA surveillance. Together, these findings highlight the importance of measuring the expressed proteome in order to understand DUX4 biology and the FSHD disease process fully.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Determining protein-level alterations in DUX4-expressing cells through quantitative mass spectrometry</title><p>In order to measure DUX4-induced changes to the cellular proteome, we conducted SILAC-based mass spectrometry in two independent DUX4 expression systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We previously showed that comparable gene expression profiles, which accurately capture the transcriptome of FSHD cells, are produced when DUX4 is expressed either via a lentiviral vector or when an inducible transgene is integrated into the genome of a myoblast cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jagannathan et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we used both of these expression systems to corroborate our results internally, thereby ensuring that our proteomic data were robust with respect to choice of model system.</p><p>We first established the efficiency of SILAC labeling and determined appropriate cell culture conditions and experimental timing in order to ensure near-complete labeling of proteins with heavy isotopic arginine and lysine. To this end, we cultured immortalized MB135 myoblasts in SILAC labeling media for a week and subjected the total protein from labeled cells, as well as a 1:1 mix of labeled to unlabeled cells, to mass spectrometry. Using the resulting mass spectra, we calculated labeling efficiency in two ways. First, we quantified the relative abundance of heavy and light spectra for several individual peptides and found that it showed a &gt; 95% labeling efficiency (a representative example is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Next, we analyzed the proteome-wide distribution of log-transformed heavy to light ratios of peptides from both the heavy-only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and the heavy:light mixed samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The distribution of heavy-to-light ratios was strongly skewed to the right in the heavy-only samples, indicating robust labeling with the heavy amino acids. By contrast, the heavy:light mixed sample yielded a distribution centered roughly around zero, as expected. On the basis of these data, we proceeded with the labeling conditions and increased the labeling time even further (to three weeks) in order to achieve maximal SILAC labeling of the MB135 myoblasts.</p><p>MB135 myoblasts that had been adapted to light or heavy SILAC media for 3 weeks were transduced with lentivirus carrying DUX4 (vDUX4) or GFP (vGFP) expression constructs. Samples were collected 24 hr and 36 hr post-transduction. In an independent experiment, MB135 cells carrying a doxycycline-inducible DUX4 transgene (iDUX4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jagannathan et al., 2016</xref>) were adapted to SILAC media for 3 weeks before DUX4 expression was induced with 1 µg/ml of doxycycline for 14 hr in two replicates carrying heavy and light SILAC labels. Paired controls with no treatment were also collected with both heavy and light labels. Total protein from cells expressing DUX4 were mixed with an equal amount of total protein from cells without DUX4 expression containing the opposite SILAC label to generate samples that were then subjected to mass spectrometry.</p><p>Peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) with quantified heavy to light ratios were subject to thorough screening for quality (e.g., filtering out single-peak spectra and spectra without unique mapping; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; see Materials and methods for further details). A histogram of log-transformed DUX4 to Control abundance ratios (log<sub>2</sub> (DUX4/Control) ratio) of peptides mapping to a DUX4 target gene, ZSCAN4, from both vDUX4 and iDUX4 datasets showed highly skewed log<sub>2</sub> (DUX4/Control) ratio, consistent with significant upregulation of the protein upon DUX4 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>). By contrast, plotting the log<sub>2</sub> (DUX4/Control) ratio of all individual peptides mapping to the housekeeping gene RPL15 showed that the ratio is centered around zero (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>), as would be expected for a gene with no differential expression upon DUX4 induction. These example plots illustrate the strong agreement between the expected and observed protein fold change values determined by SILAC mass spectrometry. Moreover, of the 65 genes identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Yao et al. (2014)</xref> as potential FSHD biomarkers on the basis of transcriptome analysis of FSHD patient samples, 8 were quantified in the vDUX4 proteomics study and 25 were quantified in the iDUX4 proteomics study and all of these genes show high induction at the protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). Note the lower number of peptides (and hence quantified proteins) from the vDUX4 sample, which indicates the lower depth of this dataset and yet yields fold changes that are highly consistent with those from the higher-depth iDUX4 dataset.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Quantitative mass spectrometry of DUX4-expressing cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the experimental set up and the subsequent data analysis steps used to measure protein fold change in cells expressing vDUX4 or iDUX4.

After filtering out genes that were only observed in one of the two label-swap replicates, we obtained quantitative proteomics information for 4005 genes, 3961 of which also had a corresponding RNA-seq measurement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; RNA-seq data previously reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jagannathan et al., 2016</xref>). The lower number of genes quantified by proteomics compared to RNA-seq is expected as proteomics is known to have lower sensitivity than RNA-seq.</p><p>To compare the RNA and protein expression level changes upon DUX4 expression qualitatively, we assessed the overlap of genes with an expression change of 4-fold or above. Among genes that are upregulated (&gt;2 log<sub>2</sub> fold change), the concordance between RNA and protein was roughly 40–50%, whereas similarly downregulated genes show very little concordance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To obtain a more quantitative measure of concordance, we generated a scatter plot of the RNA versus protein fold change for the 3961 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We found a reasonable level of correlation between these values with a Pearson’s correlation coefficient, r, of 0.51 (p-value&lt;2.2e-16).</p><p>To assess if other pathways are affected similarly at the RNA versus protein levels, we conducted a Gene Ontology (GO) analysis searching for genes that are up- or downregulated at the RNA and protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Surprisingly, we observed that the pathways that are affected at the RNA versus protein levels are quite distinct. Transcript level changes occur in genes that are involved in transcription and mRNA processing, whereas protein-level changes impact pathways including the humoral immune response, proteolysis and exocytosis. The exocytosis pathway was not implicated in any of the previous studies of DUX4 gene expression, so we sought to examine this phenomenon further by imaging the Golgi apparatus, which is the source of exocytotic vesicles in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Rodriguez-Boulan and Müsch, 2005</xref>). We found that DUX4-expressing cells showed severe fragmentation of their Golgi apparatus, which could be an indicator of a perturbation in the cellular secretory pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bexiga and Simpson, 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). As not every cell in the DUX4-induced condition showed fragmented Golgi apparatus, we also quantified the percentage of cells with robust DUX4 expression at 12 hr and 24 hr post-induction using immunostaining. We found the percentages of cells with DUX4 expression to be comparable to the percentage of cells with fragmented Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these results demonstrate that analyzing the protein measurements may give us insights that were not discernable in the transcriptome fold-change analysis performed in earlier studies.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Concordant changes in the RNA and protein abundance of several DUX4 transcriptional targets.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Table showing number of genes with fold changes in their RNA and protein levels in the iDUX4 datasets.

Pathway analysis did not reveal any significant trends among these genes. So instead, we decided to focus on one of the pathways that we have previously shown to be post-transcriptionally modulated, the nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Feng et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>A diagram showing RNA- versus protein-level changes in various components of this pathway demonstrates substantial post-transcriptional regulation in this pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Many of these genes, including UPF1, UPF2, UPF3B and XRN1, showed downregulation at the protein level. The downregulation of XRN1 is of particular interest as it is the 5’−3’ exonuclease that degrades NMD targets upon cleavage by the endonuclease, SMG6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Palacios, 2013</xref>). Moreover, SMG6 too is downregulated to a log<sub>2</sub> fold change of −4.7, although it is only detected as a single peptide and hence was filtered out of our analysis. Thus, DUX4-induced NMD inhibition appears to be a result of the post-transcriptional downregulation of multiple key players of the NMD pathway, which explains the severity of NMD inhibition in DUX4-expressing cells.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>DUX4 induces post-transcriptional gene regulation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scatter plot of log<sub>2</sub> fold change in RNA levels (DUX4/control) versus log<sub>2</sub> fold change in protein levels (DUX4/control).

We have previously shown that DUX4 induces proteasome-mediated degradation of UPF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Feng et al., 2015</xref>). Hence, we asked whether DUX4 affects known components and regulators of the ubiquitin proteasome. A scatterplot of all ubiquitin proteasome regulators shows a change in the expression of several such genes, one or more of which may underlie the rapid degradation of UPF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Further studies are needed to reveal the precise molecular mechanism behind this regulatory pathway and its downstream consequences. In summary, we propose that post-transcriptional gene regulation plays a critical role in inhibiting NMD and in perturbing the proteostasis in DUX4-expressing cells, and thus may underlie key aspects of FSHD pathology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><p>Finally, in order to enable researchers and patients in the FSHD community to access the data generated in this study, we developed a web tool for easy visualization of these data (screenshot shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

So, it is possible that despite being expressed at the transcript level, such genes may be translated poorly and/or be degraded rapidly upon translation because of the lack of cell-type chaperones or other factors. Here, we used quantitative mass spectrometry in two different cell culture models of FSHD to demonstrate that DUX4-induced transcripts are efficiently translated into stable proteins in muscle cells. We demonstrated previously that our vDUX4 and iDUX4 systems accurately capture the transcriptional program of FSHD cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jagannathan et al., 2016</xref>), so it is reasonable to assume that DUX4-induced transcripts are similarly translated into stable proteins in FSHD muscle. However, further work is required to confirm this definitively. Similarly, our data strongly motivate focused investigation of these DUX4-induced proteins to test their utility as potential FSHD biomarkers in relevant clinical samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Yao et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Next, we asked whether the changes in the DUX4 proteome are largely reflective of the changes to the transcriptome. We found that this is not the case. Although there is a positive correlation between these measurements (Pearson’s correlation coefficient of 0.51), hundreds of genes deviate from this trend. GO analysis of the most differentially expressed genes at the transcript versus protein levels revealed RNA splicing and processing as the prominent categories impacted at the transcript level, whereas protein-level changes impacted an entirely different set of pathways. We take these results as an indication that the transcriptome-level analysis paints an incomplete picture of DUX4 biology, which should be complemented with proteome-level analysis to provide a thorough understanding of how DUX4 misexpression causes FSHD.</p><p>We next pursued the various mechanisms by which protein-level changes deviate from the corresponding transcriptomic changes. We found that genes that are induced by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and unfolded protein stress are transcriptionally induced, but translationally buffered as a result of the translational repression that accompanies activation of these stress-response pathways. Motivated by this result, we hypothesize that DUX4-expressing cells are unable to mount a robust stress response, despite inducing the transcripts necessary to alleviate stress. We also show that multiple proteins in RNA surveillance pathways, including UPF1 and XRN1, are downregulated at the protein level, which may explain the drastic reduction in RNA quality control capacity that we observed in DUX4-expressing cells. From the proteomics data, we identified many genes that are involved in the ubiquitin proteasome pathway whose mis-regulation could alter protein stability. These genes may serve as a starting point for further investigation of how DUX4, which is best known as a transcriptional activator, induces widespread alterations in protein turnover.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Cell line <break/>(<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">MB135</td><td valign="top">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28171552">28171552</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line <break/>(<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">MB135-iDUX4</td><td valign="top">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28171552">28171552</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Rabbit anti- <break/>GM130 antibody</td><td valign="top">Bethyl <break/>Laboratories Inc.</td><td valign="top">Cat # A303-402A-T</td><td valign="top">(1:250)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Rabbit anti- <break/>Dux4 antibody</td><td valign="top">Abcam</td><td valign="top">Cat # ab124699</td><td valign="top">(1:500)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial <break/> assay, kit</td><td valign="top">ActinRed 555 <break/>ReadyProbes Reagent</td><td valign="top">ThermoFisher <break/>Scientific</td><td valign="top">Cat # R37112</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical <break/>compound, drug</td><td valign="top">DAPI</td><td valign="top">Sigma</td><td valign="top">Cat # D9542</td><td valign="top">(1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical <break/>compound, drug</td><td valign="top">L-LYSINE:2HCL <break/>UNLABELED</td><td valign="top">Cambridge Isotope <break/>Laboratories Inc.</td><td valign="top">Cat # ULM-8766-0.1</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical <break/>compound, drug</td><td valign="top">L-ARGININE:HCL <break/>UNLABELED</td><td valign="top">Cambridge Isotope <break/>Laboratories Inc.</td><td valign="top">Cat # ULM-8347-0.1</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical <break/>compound, drug</td><td valign="top">L-LYSINE:2HCL <break/>(13C6, 99%; 15N2, 99%)</td><td valign="top">Cambridge Isotope <break/>Laboratories Inc.</td><td valign="top">Cat # CNLM-291-H-0.05</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical <break/>compound, drug</td><td valign="top">L-ARGININE:HCL <break/>(13C6, 99%; 15N4, 99%)</td><td valign="top">Cambridge Isotope <break/>Laboratories Inc.</td><td valign="top">Cat # CNLM-539-H-0.05</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">Ham's F12 for SILAC</td><td valign="top">Pierce</td><td valign="top">Cat # 88424</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">Dialysed FBS for SILAC</td><td valign="top">Pierce</td><td valign="top">Cat # 88212</td><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and SILAC labeling</title><p>Proliferating human myoblasts (MB135) were cultured in F10 medium (Gibco/Life Technologies) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (Thermo Scientific), 10ng bFGF (Life Technologies), 1µM dexamethasone (Sigma) and 50U/50µg penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies).

Briefly, we filtered PSMs to remove the spectra carrying the following quality flags assigned by Proteome Discoverer – 'Inconsistently labeled', 'Indistinguishable channels', 'No quantitative values', 'Not unique', 'Redundant spectra', 'Single peak spectra', and 'Excluded by method' – all of which represent poor quality spectra. Next, we removed peptides that failed to map to a gene, and peptides mapping to genes in the cRAP database or to uncharacterized genes. We then assigned the median peptide fold change within an experiment as the summarized protein fold change value.</p><p>Upon comparing the gene-level fold changes obtained from four different samples, we noticed a strong correlation between the two viral replicates (Pearson’s <italic>r</italic> = 0.81), as well as the data from iDUX4 replicate 1 and both vDUX4 datasets (Pearson’s <italic>r</italic> = 0.79 and 0.77). The iDUX4 replicate 2, in which we swapped the isotopic labels used for the control and DUX4 samples, however, showed poor correlation with the three other samples because of a small set of proteins (103 proteins; 2.6% of total) that did not label efficiently. Proteins that do not label efficiently result in apparent anticorrelation between label-swap samples. This issue, wherein a small subset of proteins does not label efficiently, is a well-known problem in SILAC experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Park et al., 2012</xref>). Rather than ignoring this subset of proteins, which would require the imposition of potentially arbitrary thresholds, we instead followed the standard SILAC analysis procedure of taking the median value of H/L ratio across the two iDUX4 replicates as the final iDUX4 H/L ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Park et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ong and Mann, 2006</xref>). This procedure preserves the H/L ratio for proteins that labeled efficiently (the vast majority of the proteome) while bringing the H/L ratio for proteins that did not label efficiently to approximately 1 (corresponding to no measurable change). We then calculated <italic>p</italic>-values for the fold change calculated for the combined iDUX4 samples using a bootstrap approach. For a protein with n peptides whose H/L ratios were used to calculate protein fold change, we calculated the probability that n peptides chosen randomly out of all measured peptides would yield a similar fold change by chance. To this end, we generated a null distribution for each protein as follows. First, the same number of H/L ratios as the number of peptides quantified for that protein were randomly chosen from the set of all calculated peptide-level H/L ratios (n=229,558). With these randomly chosen H/L ratios, a fold change was calculated by computing the median. This process was repeated 1,000 times to generate the null distribution of H/L ratios for that protein. Using this null distribution, a <italic>p</italic>-value was calculated using a two-tailed Z test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Gene Ontology analysis</title><p> GO analysis was performed via the Overrepresentation Enrichment Analysis method using WebGestalt server (pmid:15980575; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cbl-gorilla.cs.technion.ac.il/">www.webgestalt.org</ext-link>).

requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Quantitative proteomics reveals key roles for post-transcriptional gene regulation in the molecular pathology of FSHD&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Andrew Berglund (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The study reveals the many proteomic changes caused by expression of DUX4. The comparison with transcriptomic data is important because it demonstrates that while there is a correlation between transcript and protein level changes (about 0.5), some protein levels changes are not predicted by changes in gene expression. In particular, it appears that post-transcriptional buffering of the stress-response pathway may not allow this pathway to operate in DUX4 induced cells. Post-transcriptional regulation also is important in the NMD pathway – building on previous findings from the Bradley and Tapscott groups. A nice web tool was built for others to access the data.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) An interesting observation is the down-regulation of several factors at the protein level that is required for mRNA surveillance and turnover, including UPF1, UPF3B, and XRN1. The authors previously reported in an <italic>eLife</italic> paper published in 2015 that expression of aberrant RNAs, including NMD substrates, is a characteristic of DUX4-expressing cells. It would therefore add considerably to their present study if they could use their SILAC MS data to assess the extent to which these transcriptomic changes correspond to the expression of aberrant protein products, and also describe possible examples in which this may provide novel insight into FSHD pathology.</p><p>2) It is apparent that the authors used a myoblast cell line for their experiments, but details are not provided. Is it the same MB135 line as used in their previous study? To what extent do the authors think they can extrapolate their findings to the pathophysiology of FSHD in skeletal muscle tissue? Are there available patient and/or FSHD mouse model samples with which they might begin to address this question? The limitations of using a cell line in their study should at least be discussed.</p><p>3) The authors performed their iDUX and vDUX4 experiments at different time points and using different instruments yet state that one served as a biological replicate for the other. It is unclear to this reviewer the overall degree of correlation between the changes observed using the two experimental approaches, nor how these compare to replicates performed for each protocol. It is also unclear in some cases whether protein level changes highlighted by the authors are consistently observed between the two approaches. Please clarify these details.</p><p>4) Related to the last comment, some aspects of the methods are vague or difficult to follow, particularly relating to MS data quantification and analyses. The authors should provide enough detail for the reader to follow and also explain their choice of methods for analyzing SILAC data. Also, many of the legends and the associated main text do not provide sufficient information to follow how various plots were generated. Figures 1B-E are examples. The authors should take particular care to expand their legends and descriptions of analyses to address this concern.</p><p>5) In terms of usefulness for potential biomarkers, it would be important to demonstrate that these findings in a cell model translate to clinical samples. To significantly strengthen the results from this work it would be great to see some of these findings recapitulated in samples from patients. It might be a very challenging request due to lack of samples or that very few cells express DUX4 in the disease state. If no relevant clinical samples can be obtained, the authors should be careful with how they describe the usefulness of the results in terms of biomarkers.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41740.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) An interesting observation is the down-regulation of several factors at the protein level that is required for mRNA surveillance and turnover, including UPF1, UPF3B, and XRN1.

Because mRNA translation is maintained after DUX4 expression (Figure 3C-D), it is reasonable to hypothesize that DUX4-expressing cells produce aberrant proteins that may contribute to the inflammatory phenotype of FSHD. However, as described below, obtaining direct evidence of such aberrant proteins from our SILAC data is challenging due to the limited coverage of proteomics data.</p><p>To address this comment, we conducted a focused analysis of our SILAC data to search for peptides arising from mRNAs that are normally degraded by nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). We successfully detected a number of peptides encoded by NMD substrates. However, we were unable to accurately measure peptide abundance or detect the same peptide across replicates. We believe that this is due to the low abundance of such “NMD peptides” as well as the inherent challenge of using proteomics to identify aberrant protein isoforms whose sequences are highly similar to much more abundant “normal” isoforms (e.g., an “NMD peptide” typically differs from its non-NMD counterpart by only 10-20aa at its C terminus).</p><p>We conducted a theoretical analysis (schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>) of all peptides that could arise from trypsin digestion of the theoretical human proteome (including NMD-targeted aberrant transcripts). This analysis revealed that only 3,568 peptides out of a total of 3,282,166 peptides (0.12%) are uniquely encoded by NMD substrate mRNAs. Of all possible peptides from the human proteome, we observed a total of ~45,000 unique peptides (1.3% of total peptides) after combining data from all of our SILAC samples (iDUX4, vDUX4, and the corresponding controls). This level of statistical power implies that we can only expect to observe a total of ~50 NMD peptides after combining data across all of our experiments. This theoretical calculation is consistent with our sporadic observation of NMD peptides in our data, but at such a low level that we cannot measure their abundance</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-41740-resp-fig1-v3.tif"/></fig><p>Given these inherent limitations of proteomics data, we believe that a different technology is most appropriate for detecting translation of aberrantly stabilized NMD substrate mRNAs. We are currently testing the suitability of ribosome profiling for this assay, but respectfully feel that these experiments are beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is apparent that the authors used a myoblast cell line for their experiments, but details are not provided. Is it the same MB135 line as used in their previous study?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we used the same MB135 cell line that was used in the previous study (Feng et al., 2015). We apologize for this omission. We provide this information in the revised manuscript, both in the Results and the Materials and methods sections, as follows.</p><p>Results:</p><p>“In order to measure DUX4-induced changes to the cellular proteome, we conducted SILAC-based mass spectrometry in two independent DUX4 expression systems (Figure 1A). […] Here, we used both of these expression systems in order to internally corroborate our results, thereby ensuring that our proteomic data were robust with respect to choice of model system.”</p><p>Materials and methods:</p><p>“To induce DUX4 expression in the MB135 iDUX4 cells, 1µg/ml of doxycycline was added for 8 or 14 hours, as indicated. For viral DUX4 expression, MB135 cells were transduced with lentivirus carrying DUX4 coding sequence under a hPGK promoter in the presence of polybrene.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To what extent do the authors think they can extrapolate their findings to the pathophysiology of FSHD in skeletal muscle tissue? Are there available patient and/or FSHD mouse model samples with which they might begin to address this question? The limitations of using a cell line in their study should at least be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>In addition to revealing the DUX4-induced proteome, a central goal of our study was to validate the utility of FSHD molecular biomarkers that we previously proposed (Figure 1D-E in this study; Yao et al., 2014). We originally identified these biomarkers by synthesizing transcriptome analyses of cell culture models of DUX4 expression with primary patient materials. These biomarkers are robustly up-regulated in FSHD relative to healthy control muscle and their expression correlates with clinical severity (Yao et al., 2014). Therefore, our report in the current study that these biomarkers are robustly up-regulated at both the mRNA and protein levels strongly suggests that our cell culture-based proteomics reveals important molecular features of FSHD.</p><p>The current study was necessarily limited to cell culture due to our use of the SILAC (Ong et al., 2002) technology to obtain quantitative estimates of protein abundance. While cell culture-based models of DUX4 expression cannot capture all aspects of FSHD pathophysiology, we previously demonstrated that our vDUX4 and iDUX4 cell culture systems accurately recapitulated the transcriptional profile of FSHD (Jagannathan et al., 2016). We therefore believe that our proteomics data likely captures molecular dysregulation that occurs in primary patient samples, although further work is required to confirm this.</p><p>We agree that it would be interesting to extend our studies to a murine system. However, despite substantial effort from several groups, including ours, there is no single, widely accepted mouse model of FSHD. The challenge of developing a mouse model that accurately captures key disease features may arise from the absence of <italic>DUX4</italic> from the mouse genome. The mouse <italic>Dux</italic> gene arose from an ancestral gene duplication and has a different DNA-binding profile and transcriptional program than does human <italic>DUX4</italic> (Whiddon et al., 2017).</p><p>The revised manuscript includes the following statement in the Discussion to address the reviewer’s point above:</p><p>“Here, we used quantitative mass spectrometry in two different cell culture models of FSHD to demonstrate that DUX4-induced transcripts are efficiently translated into stable proteins in muscle cells. […] Similarly, our data strongly motivate focused investigation of these DUX4-induced proteins to test their utility as potential FSHD biomarkers in relevant clinical samples.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors performed their iDUX and vDUX4 experiments at different time points and using different instruments yet state that one served as a biological replicate for the other.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for our confusing terminology. We used the word “replicate” to refer to these experiments, which are actually quite different (as the reviewer points out), in order to emphasize the high reproducibility that we observed between distinct experiments. In the revised manuscript, we clearly state that our data arose from independent experiments and samples that corroborate each other, rather than describing these data as arising from biological replicates.</p><p>Results:</p><p>“We previously showed that DUX4 expressed via a lentiviral vector versus an inducible transgene integrated into the genome of a myoblast cell line both yield comparable gene expression profiles that accurately capture the transcriptome of FSHD cells (Jagannathan et al., 2016). Here, we used both of these expression systems in order to internally corroborate our results, thereby ensuring that our proteomic data were robust with respect to choice of model system.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is unclear to this reviewer the overall degree of correlation between the changes observed using the two experimental approaches, nor how these compare to replicates performed for each protocol.</p></disp-quote><p>We observed excellent correlations between our two different experimental approaches and replicates, with one caveat that is inherent to SILAC experiments (described in more detail below). It is straightforward to assess the correlation between the two viral replicates (Pearson’s <italic>r</italic> = 0.81), as well as the data from iDUX4 replicate 1 and both vDUX4 datasets (Pearson’s <italic>r</italic> = 0.79 and 0.77; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref> for an example).</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-41740-resp-fig2-v3.tif"/></fig><p>The analysis is more complex for the comparison between the first and second iDUX4 replicates. These replicates correspond to a label-swap experiment, in which we swapped the labels used for the control and DUX4 samples. For this experiment, there was a small set of genes (103 genes; 2.6% of total) that did not label efficiently, and so exhibited anticorrelation between the samples. This issue, wherein a small subset of proteins does not label efficiently, is a well-known problem in SILAC experiments (e.g., Park et al., 2012). Rather than simply ignore this subset of genes, which would require the imposition of potentially arbitrary thresholds, we instead followed the standard SILAC analysis procedure of taking the median value of H/L ratio across the two iDUX4 replicates as the final iDUX4 H/L ratio (Ong and Mann, 2006). This procedure preserves the H/L ratio for proteins that labeled efficiently (the vast majority of the proteome) while bringing the H/L ratio for proteins that did not label efficiently to approximately 1 (corresponding to no measurable change). In the revised manuscript, we discuss this phenomenon and our method for handling it in the expanded:</p><p>Materials and methods section:</p><p>“Upon comparing the gene-level fold changes obtained from four different samples, we noticed a strong correlation between the two viral replicates (Pearson’s <italic>r</italic> = 0.81), as well as the data from iDUX4 replicate 1 and both vDUX4 datasets (Pearson’s <italic>r</italic> = 0.79 and 0.77).

However, doing so is very challenging due to unusual features of DUX4 and FSHD biology. DUX4 is only expressed in ~0.1% of FSHD cells (Snider et al., 2010), rendering direct detection of a DUX4-induced protein extremely difficult. For perspective, it is not yet possible to detect DUX4 protein itself via IHC in affected patient muscle. Because of DUX4’s sporadic and variegated expression pattern in FSHD cells, most of our understanding of DUX4-induced molecular dysregulation relies upon cell culture models. We and others have therefore devoted substantial effort to developing cell culture systems that accurately capture key molecular features of FSHD cells, such as our vDUX4 and iDUX4 systems (Jagannathan et al., 2016). We therefore believe that our proteomics data likely captures molecular dysregulation that occurs in primary patient samples, although we agree with the reviewer that further work is required to confirm this.</p><p>As the reviewer points out, an important goal of our study was to validate the utility of FSHD molecular biomarkers that we previously proposed (Figure 1D-E in this study; Yao et al., 2014). We originally identified these biomarkers by synthesizing transcriptome analyses of cell culture models of DUX4 expression with primary patient materials. These biomarkers are robustly up-regulated in FSHD relative to healthy control muscle and their expression correlates with clinical severity (Yao et al., 2014). However, prioritizing specific biomarkers for protein assay development in primary patient materials has been challenging because protein production had not been systematically tested. We believe that our current study provides this critical missing link.</p><p>The revised manuscript includes the following statement in the Discussion to address the reviewer’s point above:</p><p>“Here, we used quantitative mass spectrometry in two different cell culture models of FSHD to demonstrate that DUX4-induced transcripts are efficiently translated into stable proteins in muscle cells. […] Similarly, our data strongly motivate focused investigation of these DUX4-induced proteins to test their utility as potential FSHD biomarkers in relevant clinical samples (Yao et al., 2014).”</p><p>References:</p><p>Ong SE, Blagoev B, Kratchmarova I, Kristensen DB, Steen H, Pandey A, Mann M.
