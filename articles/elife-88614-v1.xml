Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying swallow control at a molecular and circuitry level remain largely unknown. Here, we find that mutation of the mechanotransduction channel genes <italic>nompC</italic>, <italic>Tmc,</italic> or <italic>piezo</italic> impairs the regular pumping rhythm of the cibarium during feeding of the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. A group of multi-dendritic mechanosensory neurons, which co-express the three channels, wrap the cibarium and are crucial for coordinating the filling and emptying of the cibarium. Inhibition of them causes difficulty in food emptying in the cibarium, while their activation leads to difficulty in cibarium filling. Synaptic and functional connections are detected between the pharyngeal mechanosensory neurons and the motor circuit that controls swallow. This study elucidates the role of mechanosensation in swallow, and provides insights for a better understanding of the neural basis of food swallow.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>feeding</kwd><kwd>mechanosensation</kwd><kwd>swallow</kwd><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31871059</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32022029</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021ZD0203300</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Multi-dendritic cibarium neurons in the fly pharynx sense mechanical force during swallowing by NOMPC, piezo, and Tmc, besides, these neurons interact with motor neurons to control food swallow.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pharyngeal sensory organs serve as the final checkpoint before food ingestion, monitoring the chemical and physical properties of food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Choi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Joseph et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kim et al., 2017</xref>). Real-time sensory feedback generated during swallow peristalsis is vital to the process of expelling food bolus from the mouth to esophagus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Manzo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McKellar, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McKellar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>). The pharyngeal sensation can also impact the internal state and appetite of animals, while feeding status can in turn affect swallowing behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ryan, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Saker et al., 2016</xref>). In humans, tactile and pressure receptors on the tongue and palate receive sensory inputs from distributed areas (e.g. bolus texture, shape, and size) and relay information to the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Iannilli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Simon et al., 2006</xref>). Chewing and ingesting tough or viscous foods can cause increased ‘oro-exposure time’ and reduced food intake as a result (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bolhuis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">de Graaf, 2012</xref>).</p><p>The pharynx contains a plethora of gustatory and mechanosensory neurons, and their functions are being gradually elucidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen and Dahanukar, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Choi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Joseph et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">LeDue et al., 2015</xref>). Physical properties of the food offer important information regarding its texture and influence animals’ inclination to eat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Torii and Moriyama, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wu et al., 2019b</xref>). Although it has been extensively studied how the food texture is sensed by peripheral sensory organs in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and other animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li and Montell, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sánchez-Alcañiz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>), how the internal sensory neurons monitor the physical quality of food to regulate ingestion remains elusive.</p><p>Feeding behaviors such as chewing and sucking require rhythmic and coordinated contraction of muscle groups, and are thought to be controlled by central pattern generators (CPGs). CPGs have been proposed to control many complex motor behaviors in different systems. They are defined as a neural assembly by their intrinsic oscillation and independence from sensory input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Grillner, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Marder and Bucher, 2001</xref>). In mammals, the muscles that coordinate food swallow are controlled by the CPGs in the brain stem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Marder and Bucher, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amirali et al., 2001</xref>). However, the identity of CPGs and their downstream circuits remain poorly understood.</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the swallow is driven by food pumping induced by the suction and compression of the cibarium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ferris, 1950</xref>). Pump frequency is independent of the concentration of sucrose or feeding state, but is largely regulated by food viscosity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Manzo et al., 2012</xref>). Silencing of certain groups of motor neurons (MNs) could disrupt pumping and ingestion, while activation could elicit arrhythmic pumping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Manzo et al., 2012</xref>). Rhythmic fluid ingestion has also been studied in other insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Marder and Bucher, 2007</xref>), but the molecular and neural basis controlling ingestion is still undiscovered.</p><p>Here, we identify a group of multi-dendritic mechanosensory neurons in the fly’s cibarium (md-C neurons) which are essential for swallow control. Inhibition of these neurons leads to difficulty in cibarium emptying and lower ingestion efficiency, while activation of them causes higher pump frequency and sometimes difficulty in cibarium filling. md-C neurons interact with the MNs in the brain to control swallowing. Our work provides insights into the regulation mechanism of swallow.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mechanotransduction channel genes are required for swallowing behavior</title><p>Flies exhibit a rhythmic swallow pattern when ingesting food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ferris, 1950</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Manzo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The whole action is composed of two steps: food is sucked into the cibarium (filling) and then expelled into the foregut (emptying). The frequency is not influenced by the taste but the viscosity of the food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Manzo et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that the mechanical force exerted by food bolus passing the cibarium is essential in maintaining the swallow rhythm. We thus tested the swallowing behavior of the mutant alleles of three mechanotransduction channel genes (<italic>nompC</italic>, <italic>piezo</italic>, <italic>Tmc</italic>), and found that these flies exhibited a lower pump frequency compared to control groups. Disruption of the mechanoreceptor function had a profound impact on the emptying phase of swallowing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>), with filling and emptying taking longer and the filling/emptying time ratio decreasing significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). About one-third of <italic>nompC</italic> mutants exhibited difficulty in cibarium emptying (emptying time&gt;0.3 s), indicating the essential role of mechanotransduction channel genes in swallowing behavior. However, the <italic>nompC</italic> mutant flies did not show a significant impairment in feeding efficiency, likely due to an increased volume of each pump (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

As a result, flies’ intake volume decreased dramatically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), indicating that md-C neurons are necessary for rhythmic pump and food ingestion.</p><p>We performed a double RNAi experiment for <italic>nompC</italic> and <italic>Piezo</italic> using <italic>Tmc-GAL4</italic> as a driver as the double mutant of these genes is lethal.

These results suggest that the channels may function complementarily.</p><p>While inhibiting md-C neurons caused difficulty in cibarium emptying, activating them optogenetically resulted in difficulty in cibarium filling. We activated md-C neurons with CsChrimson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Klapoetke et al., 2014</xref>) or ReaChR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lin et al., 2013</xref>). In some cases, no dye could be seen in the cibarium although flies strongly extended their proboscis against water (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>). This phenomenon could last for seconds but after several trials, flies can usually recover. In other cases, flies with md-C neurons activated show incomplete filling, indicated by decreased cibarium expansion, which was usually not observed in control groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Additionally, when flies consistently pump at a normal range (observed dye boundary in the cibarium is wider than 90% width of mouthpart), their pump frequency increased significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Flies with md-C neurons activated showed a reduced volume per pump (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), consistent with the small range of pump caused by incomplete filling. We thus speculated that the activation of md-C neurons could accelerate the emptying process but inhibit the filling process, which is opposite to their inhibition.</p><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="elife-88614-video4.mp4" id="video4"><label>Video 4.</label><caption><title>Optogenetic activation of md-C neurons caused accelerated swallowing, incomplete cibarium filling, and difficulty in filling.</title></caption></media><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Activation of md-C neurons led to dysphagia.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Optogenetic activation of md-C neurons with CsChrimson during food intake could induce accelerated swallowing, incomplete filling (the expansion range of cibarium decreased to about half the maximum), and difficulty in filling.

We found that 36 hr after labellum ablation, the signals of md-L neurons could no longer be observed in the mouth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), indicating that the axons of md-L likely decomposed after 36 hr, rendering them ineffective in influencing swallowing.

By expressing GCaMP6m in md-C neurons and cutting a small window in the head capsule, we could detect the fluorescent change of the md-C neurons’ projections in the brain when flies were swallowing sugar food. An increase of fluorescence intensity in the SEZ was observed when flies were ingesting food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J and K</xref>). As food ingestion delivered both gustatory and mechanosensory information, we asked whether md-C neurons were sensitive to taste input. The whole fly head was put into saline and a small window was cut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). When sucrose was added to the saline, no signal changes were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>), suggesting that md-C neurons responded to mechanical force but not gustatory cues during food ingestion.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>md-C neurons form synapses with MNs</title><p>So far, we have shown that md-C neurons regulate swallowing probably by sensing the expansion of the cibarium. But how do they coordinate with the downstream neural circuits to control the swallow? Two groups of MNs, MN11 and MN12, have been reported to control the muscles that execute the swallow process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Manzo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McKellar et al., 2020</xref>). We thus asked whether md-C neurons relay information of the cibarium volume to the MNs to control the swallow. We first tested their potential synaptic connection with GRASP (GFP reconstitution across synaptic partners) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Feinberg et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gordon and Scott, 2009</xref>), expressing one part of GFP in md-C neurons and the other part in MN12 or MN11. Signals could be detected in the SEZ where the neural projections of the two group neurons overlapped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>), suggesting that md-C neurons may directly synapse onto the motor control circuit in the SEZ. By expressing P2X<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">North, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fountain, 2013</xref>), an ATP receptor in <italic>Tmc</italic><sup>+</sup> neurons, we also found that calcium transients could be observed in MN12 and MN11 when activating md-C neurons, while the control group show no significant differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–I</xref>). Considering possible synaptic connections between md-C neurons and MNs, we suppose activation of md-C triggered by food bolus, might directly stimulate MNs to accelerate swallowing. These results suggest that MNs associated with swallowing are activated by sensory input in the cibarium to coordinate food ingestion during swallowing.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we find that a group of mechanosensory neurons in the pharynx respond to the mechanical force generated by the expansion of the cibarium during food ingestion. These neurons may form synaptic and functional connections with MNs in the brain, and constitute an essential part of the neural circuit that controls the swallow.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Multiple channels function in the same neurons</title><p>The mutants of either <italic>nompC</italic>, <italic>Tmc,</italic> or <italic>piezo</italic> showed defects in the swallow rhythm. However, we found that <italic>nompC</italic> seemed to play a more critical role as its mutation caused difficulty in emptying, while double mutation of <italic>Tmc</italic> and <italic>piezo</italic> did not. We speculated that <italic>nompC</italic> might be involved in swallowing liquid foods, as we used water in most experiments. While the md-C neurons also expressed both TMC and Piezo, we think these three channels could play different roles depending on physical properties of foods. The information generated by these three channels might be integrated in md-C neurons and helps the flies to distinguish the quality of food and regulate swallow.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Interaction between md-C neurons and the feeding control circuit</title><p>It was demonstrated that MN12 controlled muscle 12 to fill cibarium with food, while MN11 controlled muscle 11 to expel the foods into the foregut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Manzo et al., 2012</xref>). In accordance with this model, we have found that the activation of md-C neurons could activate MN11, and over-stimulation of md-C neurons could cause difficulty in filling, incomplete filling, and/or higher pump frequency. On the other hand, silencing md-C neurons blocks the emptying process because expanding of cibarium fails to activate MN11 which controls emptying, leading to difficulty in swallowing. Additionally, when pharyngeal mechanosensation was impaired by the mutation of the mechanotransduction channel genes, MNs may not obtain enough activation to drive muscle 11 contraction to completely empty the foods in cibarium, resulting in a slower pump rhythm, especially when foods are of high viscosity.</p><p>However, the circuits that control the swallow could be more complex than the circuit proposed above. It has been reported that the ingestion of foods is completed in a sequential activity of MNs where most parts of the proboscis are engaged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McKellar et al., 2020</xref>). Besides the bottom-up interaction between md-C neurons and MN12/11 demonstrated in this study, a top-down feedback mechanism may also exist. For example, we have found that knocking down GABA<sub>A</sub>-R in md-C neurons leads to a lower pump frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), suggesting that md-C neurons receive inhibitory signals during swallowing. Although it is unclear which neurons inhibit md-C neurons, we believe this is likely through a presynaptic mechanism on the axon termini of md-C neurons. Moreover, activating md-C induced calcium transients in MN12 and MN11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–I</xref>), indicating that MNs were stimulated by activation of md-C neurons. It is believed that sequential contraction of muscles would cause fluid bolus move through the proboscis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McKellar, 2016</xref>), we thus hypothesize that md-C neurons might sequentially stimulate MNs during swallowing. Also, it is possible that sequential activation generated by MNs and md-C might crosstalk with CPGs, which together form a steady pump frequency, depending on the mechanical quality of foods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L</xref>). Another possibility is that the activation of md-C neurons acts as a switch, altering the oscillation pattern of the swallowing CPGs from a resting state to a task state.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>CPGs in the control of swallow rhythm</title><p>It’s widely accepted that most rhythmic behaviors of animals are controlled by the CPGs in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Marder and Bucher, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Steuer and Guertin, 2019</xref>). For example, brain stem CPGs control the patterns of suck, lick, mastication, swallow, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Marder and Bucher, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amirali et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grillner and El Manira, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yamaguchi et al., 2017</xref>). Two lines of evidence support the notion that mechanical feedback from the cibarium during ingestion regulates the activity of CPGs or their downstream circuits that execute the pattern generated by CPGs. (1) High viscosity of food caused a reduction of pumping frequency while the rhythm remained essentially regular, indicating that the pattern was modulated rather than blocked. (2) Manipulation of md-C neurons could interfere with the highly rhythmic pumping. Although the CPGs that control swallow in <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain are still elusive, our data provides an entry point to elucidate the CPGs circuits and the neural circuits associated with them. As their activity can be modulated by md-C neurons, they can be potentially identified by searching for the downstream of md-C neurons.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Resource availability</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Lead contact</title><p>Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the lead contact, Wei Zhang, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://life.tsinghua.edu.cn/lifeen/info/1035/1345.htm">wei_zhang@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-2"><title>Materials availability</title><p>This study did not generate new unique reagents.

They demonstrate that pumping of the cibarium is subtly disrupted in mutants for piezo, TMC, and nomp-C. Evidence is presented that these three genes are co-expressed in a set of cibarial mechanosensory neurons named md-C. Silencing of md-C neurons results in disrupted cibarial emptying, while activation promotes faster pumping and/or difficulty filling. GRASP and chemogenetic activation of the md-C neurons is used to argue that they may be directly connected to motor neurons that control cibarial emptying.</p><p>The manuscript makes several convincing and useful contributions. First, identifying the md-C neurons and demonstrating their essential role for cibarium emptying provides reagents for further studying this circuit and also demonstrates the important of mechanosensation in driving pumping rhythms in the pharynx. Second, the suggestion that these mechanosensory neurons are directly connected to motor neurons controlling pumping stands in contrast to other sensory circuits identified in fly feeding and is an interesting idea that can be more rigorously tested in the future.</p><p>At the same time, there are several shortcomings that limit the scope of the paper and the confidence in some claims. These include:</p><p>a) the MN-LexA lines used for GRASP experiments are not characterized in any other way to demonstrate specificity. These were generated for this study using Phack methods, and their expression should be shown to be specific for MN11 and MN12 in order to interpret the GRASP experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggestion.

Seeing activation with a similar frequency to pumping would support the suggested role for these neurons, although GCaMP6s may be too slow for these purposes.</p></disp-quote><p>Profiling the dynamics of md-C neuron activation during swallowing is crucial for unraveling the operational model of md-C and validating our proposed hypothesis. Unfortunately, our assay faces challenges in detecting probable 6Hz fluorescent changes with GCaMP6s.</p><p>In general, we observed an increase of fluorescent signals during swallowing, but movement of alive flies during swallowing influenced the imaging recording, so we could not depict a decent tracing for calcium imaging for md-C neurons. To enhance the robustness of our findings, patching the md-C neurons would be a more convincing approach. As illustrated in Figure 2, the somata of md-C neurons are situated in the cibarium rather than the brain. patching of the md-C neuron somata in flies during ingestion is difficult.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e) The negative result in Figure 4K that is meant to rule out taste stimulation of md-C is not useful without a positive control for pharyngeal taste neuron activation in this same preparation.</p></disp-quote><p>We followed methods used in the previous work (Chen et al., Cell Rep., 2019, PMID:31644916), which we believe could confirm that md-C do not respond to sugars.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition to the experimental limitations described above, the manuscript could be organized in a way that is easier to read (for example, not jumping back and forth in figure order).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your suggestion and the manuscript has been reorganized.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Swallowing is an essential daily activity for survival, and pharyngo-laryngeal sensory function is critical for safe swallowing. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, it has been reported that the mechanical property of food (e.g. Viscosity) can modulate swallowing. However, how mechanical expansion of the pharynx or fluid content sense and control swallowing was elusive. Qin et al. showed that a group of pharyngeal mechanosensory neurons, as well as mechanosensory channels (nompC, Tmc, and Piezo), respond to these mechanical forces for regulation of swallowing in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>There are many reports on the effect of chemical properties of foods on feeding in fruit flies, but only limited studies reported how physical properties of food affect feeding especially pharyngeal mechanosensory neurons.

Can it be an expansion of cibarium or food viscosity, or both? In addition, if rhythmic and coordinated contraction of muscles 11 and 12 is essential for swallowing, how can simultaneous activation of MN 11 and 12 by md-C achieve this? Finally, previous reports showed that food viscosity mainly affects the filling rather than the emptying process, which seems different from their finding.</p></disp-quote><p>We have confirmed that swallowing sucrose water solution activated md-C neurons, while sucrose water solution alone could not (Figure 4J-K). We hypothesized that the viscosity of the food might influence this expansion process.</p><p>While we were unable to delineate the activation dynamics of md-C neurons, our proposal posits that these neurons could be activated in a single pump cycle, sequentially stimulating MN12 and MN11. Another possibility is that the activation of md-C neurons acts as a switch, altering the oscillation pattern of the swallowing central pattern generator (CPG) from a resting state to a working state.</p><p>In the experiments with w1118 flies fed with MC (methylcellulose) water, we observed that viscosity predominantly affects the filling process rather than the emptying process, consistent with previous findings. This raises an intriguing question. Our investigation into the mutation of mechanosensitive ion channels revealed a significant impact on the emptying process. We believe this is due to the loss of mechanosensation affecting the vibration of swallowing circuits, thereby influencing both the emptying and filling processes. In contrast, viscosity appears to make it more challenging for the fly to fill the cibarium with food, primarily attributable to the inherent properties of the food itself.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #4 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>A combination of optogenetic behavioral experiments and functional imaging are employed to identify the role of mechanosensory neurons in food swallowing in adult <italic>Drosophila</italic>. While some of the findings are intriguing and the overall goal of mapping a sensory to motor circuit for this rhythmic movement are admirable, the data presented could be improved.</p><p>The circuit proposed (and supported by GRASP contact data) shows these multi-dendritic neurons connecting to pharyngeal motor neurons. This is pretty direct - there is no evidence that they affect the hypothetical central pattern generator - just the execution of its rhythm. The optogenetic activation and inhibition experiments are constitutive, not patterned light, and they seem to disrupt the timing of pumping, not impose a new one. A slight slowing of the rhythm is not consistent with the proposed function.</p></disp-quote><p>Motor neurons implicated in patterned motions can be considered effectors of Central Pattern Generators (CPGs)(Marder et al., Curr Biol., 2001, PMID: 11728329; Hurkey et al., Nature., 2023, PMID:37225999). Given our observation of the connection between md-C neurons and motor neurons, it is reasonable to speculate that md-C neurons influence CPGs. Compared to the patterned light (0.1s light on and 0.1s light off) used in our optogenetic experiments, we noted no significant changes in their responses to continuous light stimulation. We think that optogenetic methods may lead to overstimulation of md-C neurons, failing to accurately mimic the expansion of the cibarium during feeding.</p><p>Dysfunction in mechanosensitive ion channels or mechanosensory neurons not only disrupts the timing of pumping but also results in decreased intake efficiency (Figure 1E). The water-swallowing rhythm is generally stable in flies, and swallowing is a vital process that may involve redundant ion channels to ensure its stability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The mechanosensory channel mutants nompC, piezo, and TMC have a range of defects. The role of these channels in swallowing may not be sufficiently specific to support the interpretation presented. Their other defects are not described here and their overall locomotor function is not measured. If the flies have trouble consuming sufficient food throughout their development, how healthy are they at the time of assay? The level of starvation or water deprivation can affect different properties of feeding - meal size and frequency. There is no description of how starvation state was standardized or measured in these experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>Defects in mechanosensory channel mutants nompC, piezo, and TMC, have been extensively investigated (Hehlert et al., Trends Neurosci., 2021, PMID:332570000). Mutations in these channels exhibit multifaceted effects, as illustrated in our RNAi experiments (see Figure 2E).Deprivation of water and food was performed in empty fly vials. It's important to note that the duration of starvation determines the fly's willingness to feed but not the pump frequency (Manzo et al., PNAS., 2012, PMID:22474379).</p><p>In most cases, female flies were deprived water and food in empty vials for 24 hours because after that most flies would be willing to drink water. The deprivation time is 12 hours for flies with nompC and Tmc mutated or flies with Kir2.1 expressed in md-C neurons, as some of these flies cannot survive 24h deprivation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The brain is likely to move considerably during swallow, so the GCaMP signal change may be a motion artifact. Sometimes this can be calculated by comparing GCaMP signal to that of a co-expressed fluorescent protein, but there is no mention that this is done here. Therefore, the GCaMP data cannot be interpreted.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not co-express a fluorescent protein with GCaMP for md-C. The head of the fly was mounted onto a glass slide, and we did not observe significant signal changes before feeding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p></disp-quote><p>.&gt;Abstract: I disagree that swallow is the first step of ingestion.

Swallowing curves were plotted using the inverse of the blue food intensity in the cibarium. In this representation, ascending lines signify filling, while descending lines indicate emptying (see Figure 2D, 3B). We maintain objectivity in our approach since, during the recording of swallowing behavior, the fly was fixed, and we exclusively used data for analysis when the Region of Interest (ROI) was in the cibarium. This ensures that the intensity values accurately reflect the filling and emptying processes. Furthermore, we conducted manual frame-by-frame checks of pump frequency, and the results align with those generated by the time series analyzer V3 of ImageJ.</p><p>For the assessment of total volume of ingestion, we referred the methods of CAFE, utilizing a measurable glass capillary.
