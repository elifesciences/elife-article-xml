Given that proteins display large ensembles of conformations, unique TSs would pose a huge entropic bottleneck for enzyme catalysis. To shed light on this question, we studied the nature of the enzymatic TS for the phosphoryl-transfer step in adenylate kinase by quantum-mechanics/molecular-mechanics calculations. We find a structurally wide set of energetically equivalent configurations that lie along the reaction coordinate and hence a broad transition-state ensemble (TSE). A conformationally delocalized ensemble, including asymmetric TSs, is rooted in the macroscopic nature of the enzyme. The computational results are buttressed by enzyme kinetics experiments that confirm the decrease of the entropy of activation predicted from such wide TSE. TSEs as a key for efficient enzyme catalysis further boosts a unifying concept for protein folding and conformational transitions underlying protein function.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>QM/MM</kwd><kwd>transition state</kwd><kwd>steered molecular dynamics</kwd><kwd>free-energy calculations</kwd><kwd>phosphoryl-transfer reactions</kwd><kwd>adenylate kinase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kern</surname><given-names>Dorothee</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Computational and experimental evidence shows that the reaction catalyzed by adenylate kinase operates through a broad transition-state ensemble (TSE), utilizing protein conformational diversity to reduce activation entropy.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Understanding the underlying physical mechanism of the impressive rate accelerations achieved by enzymes has been a central question in biology. Transition-state (TS) theory has provided the fundamental framework since the rate of a reaction is dictated by the free-energy difference between the ground state and TS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Truhlar, 2015</xref>). A wealth of research has led to the general notion that enzymatic rate acceleration is due to the enzymes’ much higher affinity to the TS relative to its substrates. This idea has been supported experimentally by the high affinities measured for transition-state analogs (TSA) relative to substrates, leading to the design of TSA as high-affine enzyme inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lienhard, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schramm, 2007</xref>). Since the TS represents a maximum in the free-energy landscape, its structure cannot be determined directly due to its low probability and ephemeral nature, TSA-bound species have been extensively used as structural proxies.</p><p>The classic TS theory and structural visualization of enzyme/TSA complexes lead to a current view of quite unique structures on the dividing surface at the maximum in the free-energy landscape. In contrast, it is now generally accepted that proteins are large ensembles of conformations, a concept rooted in pioneering work by Frauenfelder and coworkers for protein function, in analogy to the ensemble/funnel concept of protein folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Frauenfelder and Wolynes, 1985</xref>). Consequently, enzyme–substrate (ES) complexes – experimentally accessible as minima in the free-energy landscape – are composed of a vast ensemble of molecular configurations due to their macromolecular nature. Hence, catalysis by pathing through exclusive TS’s would pose a huge entropic bottleneck/energy barrier for enzyme-catalyzed reactions.</p><p>Motivated by this consideration, together with the marginal outcomes in current enzyme design relative to the catalytic power of naturally evolved enzymes, we set out to investigate the atomistic nature of TSs of the chemical step in an enzymatic cycle and its implication for rate acceleration by combining quantum-mechanics/molecular-mechanics (QM/MM) calculations and experiments. We take advantage of the groundbreaking work on TS theory by QM simulation developed in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kamerlin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Masgrau and Truhlar, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Warshel and Bora, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zinovjev and Tuñón, 2017</xref>), well summarized in several reviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cui, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Senn and Thiel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">van der Kamp and Mulholland, 2013</xref>). We chose a phosphoryl-transfer (P-transfer) reaction due to its impressive enzymatic rate acceleration, as the uncatalyzed reactions have extremely high-energy barriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kerns et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lassila et al., 2011</xref>). The chemical rationale for these high barriers and reasons as to why P-transfer reactions are ubiquitous in living organisms and are involved in almost all essential biological processes is elegantly discussed in a fundamental paper by Westheimer in 1987: ‘Why nature chose phosphates’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Westheimer, 1987</xref>). The central role of enzyme-catalyzed P-transfer reactions in biology (i.e., genetic code, energy storage, signaling, and compartmentalization) has led to extensive discussions and controversies of how enzymes catalyze these vital reactions so efficiently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen and Dunaway-Mariano, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kamerlin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kerns et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lassila et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pabis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Westheimer, 1987</xref>). Here, we combine QM/MM calculations with experimental temperature- and pH-dependent kinetic studies and X-ray crystallography of adenylate kinase (Adk) to shed light on the question of TS structures for the chemical step in its catalytic cycle. While QM/MM methods have been extensively applied to study enzymatic reactions, yielding accurate and detailed descriptions of the molecular events during catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acevedo and Jorgensen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheng et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dinner et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hahn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hirvonen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Karplus and Kuriyan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lai and Cui, 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">López-Canut et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mones et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Palermo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rosta et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Roston et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Roston and Cui, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Schwartz and Schramm, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Senn and Thiel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Turjanski et al., 2009</xref>), we test here the reaction free-energy profiles (FEPs) from simulations subsequently by designed experiments.

It is an essential enzyme found in every cell and organism. Extensive structural, dynamic, and kinetic studies led to a comprehensive picture of the overall Adk reaction mechanism and its underlying energy landscape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beckstein et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berry et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Berry et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Henzler-Wildman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kerns et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Müller et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Müller and Schulz, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wolf-Watz et al., 2004</xref>). The conformational change of the AMP- and ATP-lids closing and opening is crucial in the enzymatic cycle: Lid-closing positions the two substrates and the active-site residues for efficient chemistry (i.e., P-transfer) and prohibits the alternative, energetically favorable reaction of phosphoryl hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kerns et al., 2015</xref>). Lid-opening, essential for product release, and not P-transfer is the rate-limiting step in the catalytic cycle and Mg<sup>2+</sup> accelerates both steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kerns et al., 2015</xref>).

Instead of using the classification of associative versus dissociative character (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lassila et al., 2011</xref>), we rather apply the clear definition by Cui and coworkers of a tight versus loose TS for concerted P-transfer reactions as they are unambiguously related to the bond-order in the TS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lai and Cui, 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lai and Cui, 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Roston et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Roston and Cui, 2016</xref>). For Adk, a contraction of the active site is observed while passing through the TSE, as captured by the decrease in the distance between acceptor and leaving group during the transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, E</xref>). In the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, the acceptor and donor need to be within 4 Å for the reaction to occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) whereas in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> an acceptor–donor distance of 4.5 Å is sufficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The character of the TSE can best be seen from the widely used Moore-O’Ferrall–Jencks diagram (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jencks, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">O’Ferrall, 1970</xref>) that plots the distance from the transferring phosphate to the oxygen of the donor and acceptor, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The TSE changes from tight/synchronous without Mg<sup>2+</sup> (meaning high bond-order for both bonds between transferring phosphate to the leaving group and the attacking nucleophile) into loose with Mg<sup>2+</sup> (lower bond-order for these two bonds; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lai and Cui, 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lai and Cui, 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Roston et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Roston and Cui, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, from these two-dimensional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and the one-dimensional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) free-energy plots, we noticed a novel striking feature: a large ensemble of conformations in the TS region with vast differences in the position of the transferring phosphate but equal values in free energy for the enzyme with Mg<sup>2+</sup> (light blue dots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, yellow area in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In other words, the enzyme seems to operate with a wide TSE. In contrast, without Mg<sup>2+</sup> fewer conformations seem to comprise the TSE.

Mg<sup>2+</sup> achieves its catalytic effect on the chemical step playing several roles. It enables the donor and acceptor phosphates to come close enough to react, thus achieving a reactive conformation. In the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, a proton must bridge the terminal phosphates to prevent the strong electrostatic repulsion between the two nucleotides. In addition, Mg<sup>2+</sup> stabilizes the charge of the transferring phosphate and thereby lowering the enthalpic barrier. Most interestingly, the presence of a cation seems to result in a wide TSE. Structures of the TSE show that Mg<sup>2+</sup> is optimally coordinated to the transferring phosphates and water molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).</p><p>Besides the multifaceted role of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, our simulations provide insights into the function of the fully conserved arginine residues in the active site for lowering the activation barrier for this chemical reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplements 6</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s8">8</xref>). R85 appears to arrange the beta-phosphates of the ADPs in the proper position for the reaction to be started. R150 and R161 are involved in anchoring ATP and AMP residues in the backward reaction. These last two residues and R85 interact with the Pα of AMP, stabilizing its negative charge. R36 is near to the alpha-phosphate of AD(M)P along the entire catalytic reaction, stabilizing both the TS and products. Overall, interactions between these arginine side chains and several backbone amides and the Mg<sup>2+</sup> with the phosphates of the substrate make up a well-organized, asymmetric active site enabling efficient reversible P-transfer with a wide TSE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Umbrella sampling and committor analysis buttress wide TSE for Adk with Mg<sup>2+</sup></title><p>To verify our computational finding of a wide TSE in the fully assembled enzyme with Mg<sup>2+</sup> in contrast to a narrower TSE without a divalent metal, we performed QM/MM umbrella sampling and a committor analysis as described in methods.

To avoid the issues of accuracy of QM/MM simulations that are well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acevedo and Jorgensen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Elstner, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gaus et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Roston et al., 2018</xref>), our system has the advantage of comparing the exact same reaction coordinate with the only difference being the presence/absence of a single atom, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, thereby studying differences rather than absolute values. Since the reaction with Mg<sup>2+</sup> (fully active enzyme) revealed a more pronounced delocalization than the reaction in its absence, the divalent cation is predicted to lower the activation entropy. To test this prediction, we experimentally determined the enthalpic and entropic contributions to the chemical reaction barrier in Adk by measuring its temperature dependence in the presence and absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The experimental trick of replacing Mg<sup>2+</sup> with Ca<sup>2+</sup> was used since the chemical step with Mg<sup>2+</sup> is too fast to be experimentally measured, and previous studies showed that Ca<sup>2+</sup> is an appropriate mimic to selectively probe the chemical step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kerns et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The resulting Eyring plots for the two experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) deliver the enthalpic (Δ<italic>H</italic><sup>‡</sup> of 15.3 ± 0.5 and 16.7 ± 1 kcal/mol) and entropic (Δ<italic>S</italic><sup>‡</sup> = −5.7 ± 1.6 and −19.1 ± 3.1 cal/mol/K) contributions to the chemical reaction barrier in the presence and absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, respectively.

Full lid-closure results in an excellent preorientation of the donor and acceptor groups of the two bound nucleotides and the aiding active-site residues in the enzyme/substrate complex, in agreement with the general view of necessary pre-organization in enzyme catalysis. Lid-opening had been identified as the rate-limiting step in the enzymatic cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kerns et al., 2015</xref>), and the corresponding TSE for this conformational change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Stiller et al., 2019</xref>) and the high-resolution structure of next intermediate, the EP complex before product dissociation, recently been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Stiller et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>For a comprehensive understanding of the complete free-energy landscape of Adk catalysis, we here investigate the key step, catalyzing the actual chemical step of P-transfer. While ES and EP complexes such as Adk bound to ADP/Mg<sup>2+</sup> can be structurally characterized by traditional experimental methods as they represent a minimum in the free-energy landscape, the reaction path from substrate to product involving breaking and forming covalent bonds (chemical step) and traversing the crucial TS can only be ‘visualized’ by quantum mechanics-based molecular simulations. The power of such simulations to examine the chemical steps in enzymes, including P-transfer reactions, has been extensively documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lai and Cui, 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mokrushina et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pérez-Gallegos et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pérez-Gallegos et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Roston and Cui, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Valiev et al., 2007</xref>).

Enzymes, due to their macromolecular nature, provide a fundamentally different, advantageous way to catalyze these chemical reactions compared to the uncatalyzed reaction by employing a broad TSE. Many different molecular configurations can be accommodated in the TS region with comparable energies via collective motions, spanning a 1-Å range along the reaction coordinate for the transferring phosphate that travels a total distance of only 2 Å during the P-transfer. This features resemblance the now well-established conformational sampling of proteins in ground states such as ES complexes. Our findings explain why enzymes do not face an entropic bottleneck for catalysis. Furthermore, as enzyme active sites are asymmetric in contrast to the symmetric nature of the solvent for uncatalyzed reactions, we find that the TSE comprises also highly asymmetric conformations. Our findings help to resolve the controversy about the nature of the TS in enzyme-catalyzed P-transfer reactions between theory and experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lassila et al., 2011</xref>). The complex nature of the active site of enzymes, in contrast to simple solvent, results in different mechanisms in the enzyme-catalyzed reaction.</p><p>We note that a previous QM/MM minimum energy path calculations for a different Adk enzyme, <italic>E. coli</italic> Adk, using a semiempirical method had proposed a different mechanism with a stable metaphosphate intermediate, reporting an even lower energy for this metaphosphate intermediate than the ES and EP complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Shibanuma et al., 2020</xref>). In complex systems, such as enzymes, it is possible to observe artificial local minima when using minimum energy path searching strategies due to inadequate sampling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mendieta-Moreno, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Quesne et al., 2016</xref>). From our experimental NMR and X-ray data, we know that such a stable metaphosphate does not exist in Adk-catalyzed reactions, highlighting the importance of experimental verification of simulations as performed here, and the use of extensive sampling with proper thermodynamic treatment.</p><p>More recently, another group performed QM/MM simulations for <italic>E. coli</italic> Adk using the semiempirical AM1/d-phoT method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nam et al., 2007</xref>) and umbrella sampling, and measured and computed rate reduction in the chemical step by similar Arg mutants as reported here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ojeda-May et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dulko-Smith et al., 2023</xref>). In contrast to the paper described above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Shibanuma et al., 2020</xref>), their results are in agreement with our data. First, the experimentally measured rate reductions in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ojeda-May et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dulko-Smith et al., 2023</xref> are in full agreement with our results. Second, our activation barriers from umbrella sampling are qualitatively similar to their values, with the obvious differences in the enzyme species (we study the thermophilic Aquifex Adk), and their choice of analyzing the QM/MM simulations in the opposite direction ATP/AMP to 2 ADP molecules. The latter lead them to singly protonate one oxygen on ATP, since this ‘back reaction’ is faster for the monoprotonated state, in agreement with our simulations. This nice agreement in both experiments and computation by our two groups strengthens the validity of reported results.</p><p>Intriguingly, the Nam/Wolf-Watz team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ojeda-May et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dulko-Smith et al., 2023</xref>) and our group focus on completely different interpretations of the data! Nam/Wolf-Watz propose an interconnection, synchronization, between the chemical step and lid-opening. This language can be misleading since it can imply that the chemical step directly effects the opening, which of course cannot be the case. There is no ‘memory’ of the chemical step, the energy from the closing/opening step is dissipated within picoseconds. Lid-opening/closing is an energetically fully independent step from the P-transfer step, see our <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. We agree with the obvious result/interpretation by the authors that the Arg residues in the active site are important for both the P-transfer and the consequent lid-opening, but there is no synchronization between these independent steps. In contrast, we discover here a fundamental concept for rate enhancement by an optimal enzyme, the reduction in the activation entropy by a wide TSE. New experiments were triggered by our finding that then delivered experimental validation of this concept.</p><p>A wide TSE agrees with the definition of the TS being a surface on the potential energy surface instead of a saddle as elegantly discussed in a theoretical paper by Nussinov and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ma et al., 2000</xref>). Our results deliver concrete evidence for this fundamental concept from QM/MM calculations and commitment analysis on Adk that were further buttressed by the consequently designed experiments. Although we have only quantitatively demonstrated this TSE concept here for Adk-catalyzed P-transfer, we hypothesize such mechanism to be more general for enzyme catalysis as it is rooted in the macroscopic nature of proteins. A conformationally spread-out TSE is likely one reason why enzymes are much bigger than a few active-site residues: On the one hand residues remote from the site of the chemical action allow for conformational flexibility without the protein unfolding, on the other hand they allow for increasing the probability of highly choreographed motions along the reaction coordinate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hammes-Schiffer and Benkovic, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Klinman and Kohen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Saen-Oon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Schramm and Schwartz, 2018</xref>) while reducing excursions into unproductive conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Otten et al., 2020</xref>). The latter mechanism is directly demonstrated here in the TSE, as the configurations seen in the simulations are along the P-transfer reaction coordinate. We note that we focus here on equilibrium effects and an atomistic description of the TSE, this is not related to the fundamental work on dynamical effects manifested in transmission coefficients due to barrier recrossing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Antoniou and Schwartz, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zinovjev and Tuñón, 2017</xref>). The latter has been quantitatively demonstrated to play a minor role.</p><p>A question often being asked is why would nature evolve a conformational step to be rate limiting, as the lid-opening step for Adk? We propose that this is the ‘price’ the enzyme pays for stabilizing the ES complex to enable efficient rate acceleration of the chemical step, and for suppressing detrimental alternate reactions such as phosphate hydrolysis. Release of product requires disassembly of such closed, low-energy structure. These principles have now been directly revealed on an atomic scale for Adk: extensive electrostatic interactions of five Arg and one Lys with the phosphoryl groups to efficiently accelerate the P-transfer step, which then need to be broken for lid-opening to allow product release. The effect of different Arg mutations on the lid-opening has been recently nicely demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ojeda-May et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dulko-Smith et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>As long as the rate of this conformational transition (<italic>k</italic><sub>open</sub>) and hence <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> is not limiting for organismal fitness, there is no evolutionary pressure to further enhance it.</p><p>The importance of TSE including multiple transition pathways for protein folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Frauenfelder et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Royer, 2008</xref>), and more recently for protein conformational transitions within the folded state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pontiggia et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Stiller et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tsai and Nussinov, 2014</xref>) has been well documented. TSE in enzyme catalysis of chemical steps where covalent bonds are broken and formed as demonstrated here further promotes a unifying concept of protein folding and function, as the same principal concept of TSE is seen for these different types of conformational changes. Consequently, protein folding and function is embedded in a unifying energy landscape which is simply altered by ligands and solvent.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Computational setup of the system</title><p>The crystal structure of Adk from <italic>A. aeolicus</italic> in complex with Ap5A coordinated to Zn<sup>2+</sup> (PDB ID 2RGX; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Henzler-Wildman et al., 2007</xref>) was used as model.

The breaking bond is described by the oxygen atom for the AD(M)P and it will be called O<sub>leaving</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Higher-level DFT(PBE) free-energy calculations</title><p>The FEP of the ADK with Mg<sup>2+</sup> was also computed using a higher level of theory. Here, the QM system was described with PBE functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Perdew et al., 1996</xref>) using a DZVP basis set as implemented in the GPU-based code LIO that works with amber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nitsche et al., 2014</xref>). To take advantage of previous DFTB sampling, five lowest work versus RC profiles of the forward and backward reactions were selected, and segmented in 10 windows or stages. For each window, the FEP at the DFT(PBE) level was computed using SMD with a steering velocity of 0.05 Å/ps. Windows were combined to obtain both forward and backward FEP and the final profile was obtained by joining them. Details of the staged strategy can be found in references (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ozer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ozer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ganguly et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Commitment analysis</title><p>To verify the true nature of the observed TS we performed a commitment analysis. We first selected 20 structures for each of 11 points along the RC in the TS region (every 0.1 Å from −0.6 to 0.6 Å on the RC). Structures were equilibrated at the corresponding RC position for 5 ps using a harmonic restrain potential of 300 kcal/mol/Å. From the final equilibrated structure, we used the modified Berendsen thermostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bussi et al., 2007</xref>) to assign random initial velocities, and performed 10 non-restrained simulations. Each simulation was followed and determined whether it reached the reactants or products. Finally, the resulting probability (estimated from the observed frequency) to reach product for each point along the RC was computed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Umbrella sampling simulations</title><p>Finally, to avoid possible bias due to the use of MSMD to obtain the FEP, we also computed the corresponding profile using umbrella sampling. The initial structures for each window were randomly selected from the lowest work MSMD trajectories along the RC. The force constant for the harmonic restraint was set to 300 kcal/mol/Å<sup>2</sup>, ensuring sufficient confinement without inducing artificial behavior. Windows were separated every 0.1 Å along the whole RC. Each window simulation started with a equilibration run of 60 ps at NPT condition, followed by sampling over a production run of 40 ps, with coordinates recorded at 1 ps intervals and the reaction coordinate values every 1 fs. Simulations were performed at the previously described SCC-DFTB level of theory. The weighted histogram analysis method was employed to reconstruct the free-energy landscape from the individual window simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kumar et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grossfield, 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Principal component analysis</title><p>One single trajectory containing the TSE structures of MSMD and umbrella sampling was created by aligning the atoms of the P–O<sub>leaving</sub> and P–O<sub>attacking</sub> to a reference. The reference was the reactant structure (ADP/ADP). This was done in order to compare the TSEs using the same coordinate system. The principal component analysis was calculated over the transferring phosphate atoms, Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion, P<sub>α</sub> and O3α atoms from AD(M)P and P<sub>β</sub> and O3β atoms from AD(T)P. Those atoms were selected because they are directly involved in the chemical reaction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Steady-state kinetics measurements</title><p>Steady-state kinetics measurements for <italic>A. aeolicus</italic> Adk (Adk) were performed at different pH values in the absence of divalent metals (using 50 mM of EDTA) and the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> or Ca<sup>2+</sup>. In all cases, the reaction was started by the addition of 8 mM ADP and saturating metal concentrations were used if applicable (32 mM at pH 5 and 8 mM at pH 7 and 9, respectively). The enzyme concentration varied between 30 nM and 200 μM depending on the rate of interconversion; measurements were collected at 25°C. The amount of product was quantified with high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Protein precipitated by quench (30% Trichloroacetic acid,TCA, + 6 M HCl mixture) was separated with Spin-X centrifugal tube filters (Costar), filtered supernatant was diluted to avoid HPLC detector saturation, and the pH was brought to 6.0 to achieve optimal separation. The samples were analyzed on an HPLC system (Agilent Infinity 1260) with a high-precision autosampler (injection error &lt;0.1 μl) and analytical HPLC column ACE (i.d. 2.4 mm, length 250 mm, C18-AR, 5 Å pore size) and separated with isocratic elution with potassium phosphate mobile phase (100 mM, pH 6.1). The observed rate constants were determined from 8 to 15 data points for each temperature and/or pH value using initial rate analysis. The values and uncertainties (SD) shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref> were determined from least-squares linear regression. Similarly, values and uncertainties (SD) of Δ<italic>H</italic><sup>‡</sup> and Δ<italic>S</italic><sup>‡</sup> were extracted from linear regression of the data points presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Temperature dependence of catalysis and mutant activity</title><p>Experiments were essentially performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kerns et al., 2015</xref>) and above. In short, the steady-state kinetics measurements were collected at temperatures between 20 and 60°C for the temperature dependency and at 25°C for the mutants. For the temperature dependence, the samples contained 4 mM ADP and equimolar (with nucleotide) concentrations of calcium or 50 mM EDTA. The enzyme concentration was varied between 50 nM to 1 μM (with Ca<sup>2+</sup>) and 100 to 200 μM (with EDTA); buffer was 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, and 80 mM KCl. The amount of product produced over time (10–16 min) was quantified with HPLC and observed rates were extracted as described above. A similar approach was used for the Arg-to-Lys Aadk mutants, where the reaction was measured in both directions starting with either 4 mM ADP or ATP/AMP and equimolar (with nucleotide) concentrations of Mg<sup>2+</sup>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>D.K. is co-founder of Relay Therapeutics and MOMA Therapeutics</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Investigation, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-93099-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All the computational data produced in the current study is available in the following repository: ZENODO: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14647770">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14647770</ext-link>.</p><p>The following dataset was generated:</p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy" id="dataset1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Jara</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Marti</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name><name><surname>Kern</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Pontiggia</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Otten</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Agafonov</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2025">2025</year><data-title>Wide Transition-State Ensemble as Key Component for Enzyme Catalysis</data-title><source>Zenodo</source><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.5281/zenodo.14647770</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) to DK.

The entropy of activation is well estimated by the experiments from the experimental accuracy of these temperature-dependent changes in rate constants for the chemical step.

We appreciate the recognition of our experimental validation but understand your concern about the interpretation of our QM/MM results. To address this, we answer the specific questions below and added clearer explanations of the computational approach, including its limitations. We also better aligned the QM/MM results with both experimental data and theoretical expectations to strengthen the overall interpretation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Strengths:</p><p>The QM/MM free energy simulations have been carefully conducted. The accuracy of the semi-empirical QM/MM results was further supported by DFT/MM calculations, as well as qualitatively by several experimental studies.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) One key issue is the definition of the transition state ensemble. The authors appear to define this by simply considering structures that lie within a given free energy range from the barrier. However, this is not the rigorous definition of transition state ensemble, which should be defined in terms of committor distribution. This is not simply an issue of semantics, since only a rigorous definition allows a fair comparison between different cases - such as the transition state in an enzyme vs in solution, or with and without the metal ion. For a chemical reaction in a complex environment, it is also possible that many other variables (in addition to the breaking and forming P-O bonds) should be considered when one measures the diversity in the conformational ensemble.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, the authors included committor analysis. However, the discussion of the result is very brief. In particular, if we use the common definition of the transition state ensemble (TSE) as those featuring the committor around 0.5, the reaction coordinate of the TSE would span a much narrower range than those listed in Table 1. This point should be carefully addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right, the TSE is rigorously defined in terms of the committor distribution. We actually calculated the committor distribution for the reaction with and without Mg. We now added the figure showing the committor distribution for both reactions (Figure 3 – supplement 9). We did not include these results before because the committor distribution histogram would need more points to have a more accurate shape, requiring a high computational cost. We followed the reviewer’s suggestion and updated table 1 with the values from the committor distribution analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) While the experimental observation that the activation entropy differs significantly with and without the Ca2+ ion is interesting, it is difficult to connect this result with the &quot;wide&quot; transition state ensemble observed in the QM/MM simulations so far. Even without considering the definition of the transition state ensemble mentioned above, it is unlikely that a broader range of P-O distances would explain the substantial difference in the activation entropy measured in the experiment. Since the difference is sufficiently large, it should be possible to compute the value by repeating the free energy simulations at different temperatures, which would lead to a much more direct evaluation of the QM/MM model/result and the interpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>See our answer above about this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Major comments:</p><p>One of the remaining issues with this revision is the assertion of the wide transition states in the presence of Mg2+ ion. When discussing the transition state of phosphoryl transfer reactions, it is important to consider their nature as involving both the cleavage and formation of P-O bonds. While these two events can occur in concert with a single transition state, many studies have shown that one event often precedes the other. Sometimes, there is a slight drop in free energy between the two events, forming a transient intermediate. However, due to its very short lifetime, this intermediate state may not be detectable experimentally. Depending on the sequence of events, the transition state or the transient intermediate may exhibit characteristics of a metaphosphate or phosphorane-like species. Based on the DFTB simulation results presented in the paper, it appears that the reaction forms a metaphosphate-like transition state. In the present reaction, since the two oxygen atoms involved in the reaction are very good leaving groups with similar reactivity, it is not surprising to observe the two events near the TS with very similar relative free energies, and therefore, the free energy profile can be very flat near the TS. This is consistent with the statement that &quot;the transferring phosphate can be much closer to the leaving oxygen than the attacking oxygen and vice versa&quot; on page 9. In my opinion, however, this should not be considered as a wide transition state but rather a consequence of the two events occurring very close to each other along the reaction coordinate. This distinction can be considered a semantic issue, and as long as the authors clearly discuss this issue and clarify the meaning of the TS ensemble, the reviewer is okay with that. In its current form, the statement of the wide TS ensemble may lead to a misleading interpretation of the reaction under study.</p><p>An intermediate is clearly defined as a minimum in the free energy landscape. We see no evidence in any of your simulations of a minimum flanked by two transitions states, nor do we see any evidence in our NMR relaxation data or crystal structure ensemble refinement. We report our experimental and computational results, so that the reader can directly interpret the free energy landscapes for this system, avoiding semantics due to language ambiguity.</p><p>Second, based on the kinetic study, the free energy of the catalytic reaction is approximately zero. The authors suggest that at pH near 7, the ADP exists as a roughly</p><p>50-50 mixture between the singly protonated and fully charged states and consequently, the reaction free energies between the two scenarios cancel each other out. However, this argument is not correct. If [ADP(H)]/[ADP] is close to 1, the two reaction free energies, one with +6 kcal/mol and the other with -6 kcal/mol, imply that the protonation of the products (either ATP or AMP) requires ~12 kcal/mol (i.e., 9 pKa unit shift). Given the symmetric nature of the reaction and the similar pKa values between ATP, ADP versus AMP, such a large shift in the pKa of the product state is not expected, and for the calculated results to be accurate, the pKa shifts in the reactant state versus the product state must be opposite, with a total relative shift of 9 pKa units. This is difficult to understand given the nature of the reaction catalyzed by the adenylate kinase enzyme.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank this reviewer for this question, which made us realize that we cannot compare the free energies of our QM/MD simulations with the experimentally determined ADP and ATP/AMP ratios. In the experiment we determine the entire pool of ADP and AMP/ATP bound to the enzyme, but could not distinguish if the protonated and or nonprotonated states are contributing to the measured observed rate constants Kerns, S. et al.,(2015). In the present study, we now discovered that the nonprotonated forms have a lower activation barrier, but the protonated states also contribute to the overall reaction. Therefore, we removed this paragraph from our discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>The difference in the free energy barrier determined by the MSMD and umbrella sampling is not negligible. Considering that umbrella sampling is commonly used in this type of research, the MSMD method appears to overestimate the barrier by more than 3 kcal/mol. Would the TS geometries obtained by umbrella sampling be comparable to those obtained by MSMD?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent suggestion, since the umbrella sampling is the more accurate method. The TSE from both methods are indeed comparable, and we added new figure panels about this results to Fig. 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5 shows that the enthalpy of activation is similar for reactions with and without Ca2+. Do the authors expect the enthalpy of activation to decrease when Ca2+ is replaced by Mg2+ without a significant change in the entropy of activation? Any justification?</p></disp-quote><p>In Kerns, S. et al.,(2015) we had experimentally determined the dependence of the observed rate of the P-transfer on the nature of the divalent metal, with Mg2+ being by far superior to the other divalent metals. We proposed that this majorly is an effect on the enthalpy of activation, that other divalent metals provide poor orbital overlap, in agreement with published work on P-transfer reactions that show selectivity for a specific metal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please provide proper citations for SHAKE and WHAM.</p></disp-quote><p>The citations were added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>The authors did not really address in the revised manuscript the main points of the previous review, which included examination of non-enzymatic reaction (via simulation, not measurement) and quantification of the connection between the reported wide TS ensemble and the increase in entropy (by additional simulations).

This averaging scheme has a slow convergence, small variance and may overestimate the free energy barrier, specially if the barrier as seen in the absence of Mg is quite high.
