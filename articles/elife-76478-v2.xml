While previous research suggests a role of the molecular clock in regulating skeletal muscle structure and function, no mechanisms have connected the molecular clock to sarcomere filaments. Utilizing inducible, skeletal muscle specific, <italic>Bmal1</italic> knockout (iMS<italic>Bmal1</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) mice, we showed that knocking out skeletal muscle clock function alters titin isoform expression using RNAseq, liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-vertical agarose gel electrophoresis. This alteration in titin’s spring length resulted in sarcomere length heterogeneity. We demonstrate the direct link between altered titin splicing and sarcomere length in vitro using U7 snRNPs that truncate the region of titin altered in iMS<italic>Bmal1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> muscle. We identified a mechanism whereby the skeletal muscle clock regulates titin isoform expression through transcriptional regulation of <italic>Rbm20</italic>, a potent splicing regulator of titin. Lastly, we used an environmental model of circadian rhythm disruption and identified significant downregulation of <italic>Rbm20</italic> expression. Our findings demonstrate the importance of the skeletal muscle circadian clock in maintaining titin isoform through regulation of RBM20 expression. Because circadian rhythm disruption is a feature of many chronic diseases, our results highlight a novel pathway that could be targeted to maintain skeletal muscle structure and function in a range of pathologies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>skeletal muscle</kwd><kwd>circadian clocks</kwd><kwd>titin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP5OD017865</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Eric T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AR066082</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Esser</surname><given-names>Karyn A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Heart Lung and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL157487</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Previs</surname><given-names>Michael J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001674</institution-id><institution>Fondation Leducq</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>13CVD04</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hammers</surname><given-names>David W</given-names></name><name><surname>Labeit</surname><given-names>Siegfried</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31AR070625</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Esser</surname><given-names>Karyn A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AR079220</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Esser</surname><given-names>Karyn A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Wu Tsai Human Performance Alliance</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AGR00023600</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Esser</surname><given-names>Karyn A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The muscle circadian clock regulates RNA-binding motif 20 (<italic>Rbm20</italic>) gene expression, providing a novel mechanism for titin splicing and isoform expression with implications for muscle structure and function.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Circadian rhythms are intrinsically directed patterns seen in behavior and biology with an ~24 hr periodicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bass and Takahashi, 2010</xref>). Underlying circadian rhythms is a transcriptional–translational feedback loop referred to as the molecular clock. The molecular clock exists in virtually every cell in the body and functions to support homeostasis through regulating a daily pattern of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Merrow et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yoo et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>BMAL1 is a PAS/basic helix–loop–helix (bHLH) transcription factor that acts as the only nonredundant component of the core clock mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bunger et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hogenesch et al., 1998</xref>). Beyond its role in cellular time keeping, BMAL1 and its partner, CLOCK, have been described as transcriptional regulators of both rhythmic and nonrhythmic genes important for cell-type-specific functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bass and Takahashi, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bozek et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Miller et al., 2007</xref>). The most well-studied aspect of these functions, particularly in the context of skeletal muscle, is the circadian clock regulation of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Reinke and Asher, 2019</xref>). Our lab has provided evidence suggesting a more expansive role for the skeletal muscle clock through maintenance of skeletal muscle structure and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McCarthy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrews et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schroder et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The first evidence for this role came from microarray analyses showing expression of the myogenic regulatory factor <italic>Myod1</italic> as well as genes encoding contractile proteins are circadian in the hindlimb muscles of C57BL/6J mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McCarthy et al., 2007</xref>). The molecular clock’s proposed role in maintaining muscle function was supported with whole-muscle and single-fiber mechanics data from the <italic>Bmal1</italic> knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrews et al., 2010</xref>). Additionally, electron microscopy studies demonstrated sarcomere irregularities consistent with the diminished force output findings. However, these experiments were performed in systemic <italic>Bmal1</italic> KO mice that exhibit significant behavioral abnormalities, thus, distinguishing the role of skeletal muscle molecular clock from activity patterns requires further study using more refined approaches and animal models.</p><p>Historically, sarcomeres have been studied as a two-filament system; however, a third filament comprised of the giant protein titin is now broadly recognized as having a critical role in both the structure and contractile function of sarcomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Freundt and Linke, 2019</xref>). Titin is the largest known protein and spans the length of the half-sarcomere, from Z-line to M-line, functioning as the structural backbone for the sarcomere and aiding in both active and passive force generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Freundt and Linke, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brynnel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mijailovich et al., 2019</xref>). The I-band region of titin connects the thick filament to the thin filament and acts as a viscoelastic spring. This region is primarily composed of immunoglobulin-like (Ig) repeats and the PEVK region. Titin undergoes a remarkable amount of splicing within this region with inclusion or exclusion of these repeats yielding longer or shorter titin proteins, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2013</xref>). Maintenance of titin splicing, and thus the isoform composition, is needed to maintain muscle function.</p><p>This study utilized inducible, skeletal muscle-specific <italic>Bmal1</italic> (iMS<italic>Bmal1</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) knockout mice to further examine the role of the skeletal muscle molecular clock in regulating titin splicing. Importantly, these mice display muscle weakness defined by ex vivo measures of maximum isometric tetanic force (i.e., specific force) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schroder et al., 2015</xref>). We show that loss of <italic>Bmal1</italic> specifically in adult skeletal muscle alters splicing in titin’s spring region, resulting in sarcomere length disruption. Consistent with changes in splicing, we identify exon-specific protein changes in titin using a methodological approach for analyzing titin isoforms using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Mechanistically, the skeletal muscle molecular clock regulates <italic>Rbm20</italic>, the gene encoding an RNA-binding protein known to regulate titin splicing. Overexpressing RBM20 in iMS<italic>Bmal1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> skeletal muscle is sufficient to restore titin isoform expression. Use of a chronic jet-lag model with wildtype mice confirms that circadian disruption is sufficient to change Rbm20 expression. Our findings establish the role of the skeletal muscle molecular clock in regulating Rbm20 expression and titin splicing and provide a mechanism by which circadian dysregulation might alter skeletal muscle physiology.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Titin splicing is disrupted following <italic>Bmal1</italic> knockout in adult skeletal muscle</title><p>Since titin has been implicated in regulating sarcomere length and plays a prominent role in striated muscle force generation, we asked whether titin protein changes following <italic>Bmal1</italic> knockout in skeletal muscle.

To gain insight into the changes in titin isoform following loss of <italic>Bmal1</italic> in adult skeletal muscle, we performed RNA sequencing to identify exon-specific changes in iMS<italic>Bmal1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schafer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maatz et al., 2014</xref>). iMS<italic>Bmal1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> TA muscle showed increased percent sliced in (PSI) of exons 52–88 of the titin transcript compared to iMS<italic>Bmal1</italic><sup>+/+</sup> control samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These exons code for a portion of titin’s proximal Ig segment, one of titin’s extensible segments within its spring region. Though the ∆PSI across this splicing event was stable, the variability in PSI across this event made statistical analysis difficult. To remedy this, we split this large splicing event into three, smaller splicing events (exons 52–69, 70–79, and 80–88) based on the similarity of PSI values within each sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

A total of 1218 peptides corresponding to the Ensembl ENSMUST00000099981.10 titin transcript were identified in the LC-MS analysis of which 1009 met our minimum threshold for quantification and were used to calculate exon-specific peptide abundance. These peptides corresponded to 225 of the 363 known exons in the <italic>Ttn</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>). We then analyzed differential expression of peptides and identified that those representing exons 52–69 were not detected in iMS<italic>Bmal1</italic><sup>+/+</sup> muscle and only identified in the iMS<italic>Bmal1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> muscle samples. The abundance of peptides from the translation of exons 70–79 and 80–88 were 18 and 16% greater in the iMS<italic>Bmal1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> compared to the iMS<italic>Bmal1</italic><sup>+/+</sup> muscle samples, respectively (p&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Notably, the only other region that displayed significant differences at the protein level is encoded by exons 112–217. This region is lowly expressed in both iMS<italic>Bmal1</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and iMS<italic>Bmal1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> muscle, thus the difference in our measurement may be a result of low read numbers across this region in the RNAseq data. These results demonstrate that the difference in <italic>Ttn</italic> mRNA splicing encoding exons within the proximal Ig region in the iMS<italic>Bmal1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> muscle is translated to titin protein. Our findings from these experiments also provide a unique analytical reference for the titin research community.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>iMS<italic>Bmal1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> muscle displays irregular sarcomere lengths</title><p>We have previously reported that the global <italic>Bmal1</italic> knockout mouse displays sarcomere abnormalities in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrews et al., 2010</xref>); however, these sarcomeric changes could be a result of a loss of skeletal muscle <italic>Bmal1</italic>, a loss of behavioral rhythms, and/or other systemic interactions.

To directly test whether the region of titin that is altered in iMS<italic>Bmal1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> muscle could contribute to changes in sarcomere length independent of clock changes, we used U7 snRNPs to direct titin splicing from the 5′ splice site of titin exon 51 to the 3′ splice site of titin exon 89, resulting in shorter titin protein using an in vitro C2C12 myotube model. To visualize sarcomere length, we used a stable cell line in which α-actinin is labeled with GFP (eGFP-ACTN2-C2C12).

RBM20 is a well-characterized splicing factor known to target titin pre-mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maatz et al., 2014</xref>). RBM20 is an RNA-binding protein that acts as a splicing repressor such that when present at high levels it binds along titin pre-mRNA preventing normal intronic splicing. When bound by many RBM20 proteins, titin pre-mRNA undergoes large exon-skipping events whereby the resultant, processed mRNA is shorter than if RBM20 was not present.

C57BL/6J mice were subjected to 8 weeks of repeated phase advances, a well-established model of circadian disruption most commonly referred to as chronic jet lag. Prior studies using this model demonstrated significant disruption of circadian clock gene expression in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wolff et al., 2013</xref>). For this analysis, we included collections at two time points so that we could capture potential changes during either the rest (CT30) or active (CT42) parts of the day. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, we found that Rbm20 mRNA did exhibit a significant difference in expression in the quadriceps muscles under normal light:dark conditions. In contrast, muscles from the CPA mice exhibit depressed expression of Rbm20, mostly notably at CT30, during the subjective rest phase for the mice. The results for the TA muscle from the same mice follow a similar trend with reduced Rbm20 expression at both time points in the CPA group, but this change was not significant (p=0.09). The observation that Rbm20 mRNA expression was differentially expressed in the rest vs. active period of the quadriceps muscles was not expected but is consistent with the muscle clock regulating Rbm20 expression. In summary, these data indicate that <italic>Rbm20</italic> expression is regulated downstream of the skeletal muscle circadian clock; this regulation is evident in two different muscles, and it provides further evidence that altering the muscle clock, either genetically or physiologically, leads to altered <italic>Rbm20</italic> expression.</p><p>Since skeletal muscle <italic>Bmal1</italic> knockout and physiological disruption of circadian rhythms reduced <italic>Rbm20</italic> expression, we asked whether <italic>Rbm20</italic> is a direct transcriptional target of the core clock factors in skeletal muscle.

We also looked into our skeletal muscle ChIP-seq data set for MYOD1 as we have previously shown with <italic>Tcap</italic> that the clock factors can function synergistically with MYOD1 to transcriptionally regulate gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hodge et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cao et al., 2010</xref>). As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, we detected significant binding of BMAL1, CLOCK, and MYOD1 within a common region of intron 1 of <italic>Rbm20</italic>. Analysis of this region identified a putative regulatory element as defined by the third phase of the ENCODE project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moore et al., 2020</xref>). To confirm binding of these proteins, we performed targeted ChIP-PCR using primers flanking this 88 bp site. We identified significant binding of BMAL1 (p&lt;0.01), CLOCK (p&lt;0.001), and MYOD1 (p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).

Unfortunately, we only had a small amount of tissue remaining, so our sample size is small, but these results are consistent with the levels of the level of exon inclusion in both the RNAseq and LC-MS data,.thus, demonstrating that splicing of titin is modulated downstream of the circadian clock via regulation of Rbm20 expression.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we examined the contribution of the core clock factor <italic>Bmal1</italic> on regulation of titin isoform expression in skeletal muscle. We defined a novel mechanism whereby the skeletal muscle clock regulates titin splicing through modulation of <italic>Rbm20</italic> expression. These findings define that skeletal muscle structure, with implication for function, is regulated in part through a circadian clock-dependent transcriptional mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Miller et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McCarthy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrews et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schroder et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hodge et al., 2019</xref>). The novel link between the muscle circadian clock and RBM20 is of particular importance as our lab recently proposed a mechanism whereby MYOD1 works with BMAL1::CLOCK to cooperatively regulate skeletal muscle-specific, clock-controlled genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hodge et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we identify a novel enhancer element within intron 1 of <italic>Rbm20</italic> and provide evidence that MYOD1 with the core clock factors are significant contributors to <italic>Rbm20</italic> expression. These data confirm that <italic>Rbm20</italic> is a bona fide clock-controlled gene in skeletal muscle. We provide direct evidence that changes to the proximal Ig segment of titin’s spring region can alter sarcomere length and further support titin’s role as a molecular ruler. Further, we provide gain of function transcriptome and proteome data, which confirm that RBM20 is a key mediator of titin splicing downstream of the circadian clock. Our findings expand upon the importance of the molecular clock in maintaining skeletal muscle health by showing that circadian rhythms are not only important for the metabolic function but are also important for maintaining muscle structural integrity.</p><p>Our results identified a new and direct link between the core circadian clock in skeletal muscle with the highly conserved splicing repressor, RBM20. RBM20 is predominantly expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscles. Because most RBM20 research has been in cardiac muscle as RBM20 mutations are linked to cardiomyopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guo et al., 2010</xref>), understanding of its role in skeletal muscle remains limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guo et al., 2010</xref>). Our work has identified a novel enhancer element within intron 1 of <italic>Rbm20</italic> that confers sensitivity to MYOD1 and the core clock factors BMAL1, CLOCK. This region of the <italic>Rbm20</italic> gene is highly conserved and is maintained in the human ENCODE database of putative enhancers (E1499168). It is also important to note that RBM20 is currently linked to splicing of up to 18 mRNAs in the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maatz et al., 2014</xref>), 5 of which have significant changes in exon inclusion in our model. Thus, regulation of RBM20 downstream of the circadian clocks could contribute to other aspects of muscle structure and function independent of titin splicing. It is important to note that there is a lack of overlap between the RBM20-dependent splicing changes in the heart and our model in skeletal muscle, suggesting that RBM20 may have tissue-specific targets. This tissue specificity warrants further study. Since circadian rhythm disruption occurs in aging and many chronic diseases, our findings suggest RBM20 and titin splicing could play a broader role in conditions with known muscle weakness.</p><p>Defining mechanisms to preserve muscle function is important due to the emerging recognition that maintaining muscle strength in chronic disease states and aging is a strong predictor of mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Newman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">García-Hermoso et al., 2018</xref>). Since skeletal muscle function is tightly linked to its structure, we investigated a mechanism that links the molecular clock to sarcomere organization in skeletal muscle. One of the findings of the this study is an increase in sarcomere length heterogeneity following skeletal muscle <italic>Bmal1</italic> knockout. Heterogeneous sarcomere lengths would be disadvantageous at the muscle tissue level as the likelihood that an individual sarcomere would be operating at its optimal length is reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hou, 2018</xref>). While a sarcomere can generate force outside of optimal length, it is well established that when the number of crossbridges between the thin and thick filaments is reduced, the maximum force produced by the muscle is diminished (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Patel et al., 2004</xref>). Additionally, emerging data suggests that changes to overall titin isoform in skeletal muscle result in changes to the number of serial sarcomeres in an apparent effort to reduce the working range of the sarcomere, with functional consequences. However, these data come from models in which the change in titin isoform is a result of large-scale exon deletions, resulting in a homogenous expression of mutant titin. The effects of heterogenous changes in titin isoform expression, as seen in iMS<italic>Bmal1</italic><sup>-/-</sup>, with regard to sarcomere length homogeneity and working range, need further study to understand its functional consequence.</p><p>Lastly, our study used RNAseq analysis to define the titin splicing changes downstream of the muscle clock. We then determined whether the splicing changes were directly linked to changes in the titin protein using LC-MS. To our knowledge, we are the first group to provide direct correlations between titin exon splicing at the RNA level with peptide expression at the protein level for the giant protein. Notably, analysis of titin protein isoforms has historically required the use of vertical agarose gels and antibodies that detect repetitive elements to semi-quantitatively measure changes in alternative splicing. While these methods are useful, they cannot provide a direct, quantitative measurement of exon-level translation. We successfully used LC-MS to confirm that peptides encoded titin exons that undergo differential splicing in iMS<italic>Bmal1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice as measured by RNAseq were similarly changed in titin protein. Our methodology could be used to confirm changes in other conditions where titin splicing is disrupted.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Ideas and speculation</title><p>Why the molecular clock would regulate splicing of a protein as large as titin is puzzling. Estimations of titin turnover have been measured on the order of days, much longer than processes that would predictably be regulated daily by the circadian clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Isaacs et al., 1989</xref>). However, studies in cardiomyocytes suggest that sarcomeric titin exhibits dynamic exchange within ~14 hr independent of protein turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">da Silva Lopes et al., 2011</xref>). If such a mechanism exists in skeletal muscle, this would allow the fiber to modulate titin length on a more frequent, potentially daily basis. Previous studies have identified titin-cap (<italic>Tcap</italic>) as a direct clock-controlled gene that exhibits time-of-day variations in protein amount with highest levels during the active phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gregorio et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hammouda et al., 2012</xref>). TCAP functions to anchor the titin filament at the Z-line by binding titin’s Z1Z2 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gregorio et al., 1998</xref>). These observations suggest a model in which titin protein could be exchanged daily, likely in sync with times at which TCAP protein is lowest. This daily replacement would serve to provide flexibility in the muscle fibers to adjust to patterns of use and disuse. Further, this daily replacement could lead to a vulnerable period for skeletal muscle damage (i.e., when TCAP is low and titin is being replaced). The potential for this period of vulnerability is somewhat supported by studies that measured diurnal variation in muscle damage following maximum performance tests in athletes. In these studies, muscle creatine kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hammouda et al., 2012</xref>) and leukocyte infiltration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hammouda et al., 2011</xref>) increased more substantially following evening exertion compared to morning exertion. In our proposed scenario, sarcomeric replacement during the inactive period would leave skeletal muscle susceptible to damage in the evening (i.e., leading into the inactive period), thus damage markers should increase at this stage. Studies that measure sarcomeric replacement over time of day with differing time of exercise bouts should be performed to directly test this scenario as they could prove useful for prescribing exercise as a therapeutic in cases of circadian rhythm disruption.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study uniquely links the field of circadian rhythms with well-established properties of skeletal muscle structure and function through the RNA-binding protein RBM20. Since maintenance of circadian rhythms and skeletal muscle strength is gaining recognition for their roles in human health, understanding these processes is needed to promote health. Our work provides important new insights into understanding fundamental mechanisms regulating muscle homeostasis and potential new targets through which diseases that modulate the circadian clock could lead to skeletal muscle weakness.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

After 2 weeks of acclimation to individual housing, mice were randomly assigned to either control (12L:12D) conditions or a CPA regimen. The CPA paradigm consisted of a 6 hr advance in lights-on every 4 days for a total of 8 weeks. This protocol was chosen as our lab has previously shown that this protocol disrupts the core molecular clock rhythm in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wolff et al., 2013</xref>). Disruptions in activity rhythms were confirmed using wheel-running activity.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Reviewing Editor Benjamin Prosser and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewing team is enthusiastic about the work and each noted the generally high novelty, significance, and quality of the work. As you will gather from the full reviews below, some additional data, which we hope can be obtained fairly readily and potentially through existing samples, is needed to support key conclusions.</p><p>1) To support a key conclusion (and title of the manuscript), it is important to confirm circadian regulation of titin splicing using an approach orthogonal to Bmal KO. This could be done, for example, by examining whether titin splicing differs in muscle samples collected during the day or at night, or after circadian disruption.</p><p>(2) The restriction of analysis to only the TA muscle was viewed as a significant limitation, and the quantification of sarcomere length dispersion was also viewed as limited. Analysis in additional muscle groups outside the TA, and a more robust interrogation of sarcomere length dispersion across experiments (for example following rescue studies in Figure 6), will significantly strengthen these important aspects of the manuscript.</p><p>We hope that these experiments can be performed in a timely manner and look forward to evaluating a revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The paper can be strengthened by:</p><p>(1) Studying whether titin isoform expression undergoes circadian rhythms, using muscle samples collected at different times of the day,</p><p>(2) By studying sarcomere length dispersion in muscles stretched to different lengths, and</p><p>(3) By discussing (or experimentally addressing) the biological consequence of upregulating more compliant titin isoforms in greater detail.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Provide justification for why using TA muscle, not other muscles.</p><p>2. At least two muscles should be used to test RBM20 expression, Ttn splicing and sarcomere length.</p><p>3. Sarcomere length data are not consistent which need be clarified.</p><p>4. The authors may consider rescuing Bmal1 gene in iMS<italic>Bmal1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> TA muscle to determine RBM20 expression, titin isoform switching and sarcomere length which would provide direct evidence for the link between Bmal1 and ttn splicing.</p><p>5. The authors may also consider making an interrupted circadian rhythms mouse model in wild type mice to prove the authors' claim that circadian clock regulates Ttn splicing through RBM20.</p><p>6. The authors need provide the detailed method about how they measure the proximal Ig length. The a-actinin staining is fuzzy.</p><p>7. RBM20 is a large protein (about 140 KDa) which has low solubility and is relatively hard to extract from muscle tissue. RIPA buffer may not be strong enough to extract all RBM20 proteins. The author may consider using the protein buffer for titin protein extraction described in the method section or using the same protein samples as for titin detection for western blotting.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.76478.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewing team is enthusiastic about the work and each noted the generally high novelty, significance, and quality of the work.

The impact of the circadian clock on cell physiology has been classically viewed through its role in regulating rhythmic gene expression and processes. However, it has become apparent that the core clock factors can modulate expression of non-rhythmic genes and that is the function we have identified in this study.</p><p>Another topic for clarification: We recognize that the titin protein has a half-life significantly longer then 24hrs. We also note that our lab and others report that <italic>Rbm20</italic> mRNA does not oscillate over time of day (Schroder et al., 2015 and Pizarro et al., 2013) so is not easily recognized as a circadian clock-controlled gene. Our work points toward a model in which the muscle clock contributes to maintenance Rbm20 expression and when there are chronic changes to clock function this leads to changes in Rbm20 expression with downstream effects on titin splicing. Accordingly, we have edited our manuscript in several places to clarify this point.</p><p>Lastly, we agree that having a different model is very important. Thus, we have generated new data from a model of circadian disruption using “chronic jet lag” to environmentally disrupt the muscle clock in wildtype mice and ask if this was sufficient to change <italic>Rbm20</italic> expression. Using this model, we found that <italic>Rbm20</italic> expression was disrupted in the quadriceps muscles of the jet lag group supporting our model linking the function and regulation of the muscle clock with <italic>Rbm20</italic> expression. This new data is now added to Figure 5. We also note that with our two time point collection we do see significant differences in Rbm20 mRNA expression in the quadriceps muscles of wildtype mice under normal conditions. This was unexpected as we do not see similar differences in Rbm20 mRNA levels in either the TA or Gastrocnemius muscles. However, this time of day difference is consistent with the muscle clock contributing to Rbm20 gene expression. We note these new findings in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The restriction of analysis to only the TA muscle was viewed as a significant limitation, and the quantification of sarcomere length dispersion was also viewed as limited. Analysis in additional muscle groups outside the TA, and a more robust interrogation of sarcomere length dispersion across experiments (for example following rescue studies in Figure 6), will significantly strengthen these important aspects of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>The TA was chosen for analysis for several reasons, primarily that the predominant titin isoforms are small enough that subtle changes can be assessed using SDS-VAGE and that the pennation angle of this muscle is such that longitudinal sections of the entire muscle could be assessed. We do understand that this is a limitation of our analysis and have since interrogated this mechanism in the gastrocnemius muscle in our model with and without the rescue of <italic>Rbm20</italic> in iMS<italic>Bmal1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> muscle and by including an analysis of the quadriceps muscle and TA in the “jet lag” model. We note that the focus of this work is on the identification of a very novel pathway for regulation of titin splicing in skeletal muscle. This pathway has never been identified or even speculated to date. We provide evidence for this pathway in both TA and Gastrocnemius muscle and feel that more analysis across different muscles, including heart, would be an important topic a future study.</p></body></sub-article></article>
