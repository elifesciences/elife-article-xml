whereby the etioplast transforms into a photosynthesizing chloroplast and the thylakoid rapidly emerges. However, the sequence of events during chloroplast differentiation remains poorly understood. Using Serial Block Face Scanning Electron Microscopy (SBF-SEM), we generated a series of chloroplast 3D reconstructions during differentiation, revealing chloroplast number and volume and the extent of envelope and thylakoid membrane surfaces. Furthermore, we used quantitative lipid and whole proteome data to complement the (ultra)structural data, providing a time-resolved, multi-dimensional description of chloroplast differentiation. This showed two distinct phases of chloroplast biogenesis: an initial photosynthesis-enabling ‘Structure Establishment Phase’ followed by a ‘Chloroplast Proliferation Phase’ during cell expansion. Moreover, these data detail thylakoid membrane expansion during de-etiolation at the seedling level and the relative contribution and differential regulation of proteins and lipids at each developmental stage. Altogether, we establish a roadmap for chloroplast differentiation, a critical process for plant photoautotrophic growth and survival.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>thylakoid</kwd><kwd>chloroplast</kwd><kwd>photosynthesis</kwd><kwd>SBF-SEM</kwd><kwd>proteomics</kwd><kwd>Arabidopsis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>3100A0-112638</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Demarsy</surname><given-names>Emilie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A_156998</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kessler</surname><given-names>Felix</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A_176191</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kessler</surname><given-names>Felix</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Serial-Block-Face Scanning Electron Microscopy (SBF-SEM) associated with biomolecular analysis show that chloroplast differentiation proceeds by distinct ‘structure establishment’ and ‘chloroplast proliferation’ phases, each with differential protein and lipid regulation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Seedling development relies on successful chloroplast biogenesis, ensuring the transition from heterotrophic to autotrophic growth. Light is a crucial factor for chloroplast differentiation. For seeds that germinate in the light, chloroplasts may differentiate directly from proplastids present in cotyledons. However, as seeds most often germinate underneath soil, seedling development typically begins in darkness and follows a skotomorphogenic program called etiolation, characterized by rapid hypocotyl elongation and etioplast development. Light promotes seedling de-etiolation, which involves a series of morphological changes, such as cotyledon expansion, hypocotyl growth inhibition, and greening, that accompanies the onset of photosynthesis in chloroplasts. During de-etiolation, etioplast–chloroplast transition is thereby rapidly triggered by light following seedling emergence at the soil surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jarvis and López-Juez, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Solymosi and Schoefs, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Weier and Brown, 1970</xref>). A hallmark of chloroplast differentiation is the biogenesis of thylakoids, a network of internal membranes where the components of the photosynthetic electron transport chain assemble. Thylakoid biogenesis and the onset of photosynthesis rely on the concerted synthesis and coordinated assembly of chlorophylls, lipids, and proteins in both space and time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jarvis and López-Juez, 2013</xref>).</p><p>The thylakoids harbor the photosynthetic electron transport chain, which is composed of three complexes: photosystem II (PSII), the cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>6</sub><italic>f</italic> complex (Cyt <italic>b</italic><sub>6</sub><italic>f</italic>), and photosystem I (PSI). Electron transfer between these complexes is facilitated by mobile electron carriers, specifically the low-molecular-weight, membrane-soluble plastoquinone (electron transfer from PSII to Cyt <italic>b</italic><sub>6</sub><italic>f</italic>) and the lumenal protein plastocyanin (electron transfer from Cyt <italic>b</italic><sub>6</sub><italic>f</italic> to PSI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Eberhard et al., 2008</xref>). Electron transfer leads to successive reduction and oxidation of electron transport chain components. The final reduction step catalyzed by ferredoxin-NADP(+) reductase (FNR) leads to NADPH production. Oxidation of water by PSII and of plastoquinone by Cyt <italic>b</italic><sub>6</sub><italic>f</italic> releases protons into the lumen, generating a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane that drives the activity of the thylakoid-localized chloroplast ATP synthase complex. Each of the photosynthetic complexes consists of multiple subunits encoded by the plastid or nuclear genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jarvis and López-Juez, 2013</xref>) PSII and PSI have core complexes comprising 25–30 and 15 proteins, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amunts and Nelson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Caffarri et al., 2014</xref>). The antenna proteins from the Light Harvesting Complexes (LHC) surround the PSI and PSII core complexes contributing to the formation of supercomplexes. Cyt <italic>b</italic><sub>6</sub><italic>f</italic> is an eight-subunit dimeric complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Schöttler et al., 2015</xref>). Each complex of the electron transport chain has a specific dimension, orientation, and location within the thylakoid membrane, occupying a defined surface, and their dimensions have been reported in several studies giving congruent results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Caffarri et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kurisu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">van Bezouwen et al., 2017</xref>). During de-etiolation, massive protein synthesis is required for assembly of the highly abundant photosynthetic complexes embedded in thylakoids. The photomorphogenic program is controlled by regulation of gene expression at different levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wu, 2014</xref>). Transcriptome analyses have revealed that upon light exposure, up to one-third of Arabidopsis genes are differentially expressed, with 3/5 being upregulated and 2/5 downregulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ma et al., 2001</xref>). Chloroplast proteins encoded by the nuclear genome must be imported from the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jarvis and López-Juez, 2013</xref>). The general chloroplast protein import machinery is composed of the multimeric complexes Translocon at the Outer membrane of the Chloroplast (TOC) and Translocon at the Inner membrane of the Chloroplast (TIC), and selective import is based on specific recognition of transit peptide sequences by TOC receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agne and Kessler, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Richardson and Schnell, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Reminiscent of their cyanobacterial origin, chloroplast membranes are composed mostly of glycolipids (mono- and di-galactosyldiacylglycerol; MGDG and DGDG) and are poor in phospholipids compared to other membranes in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bastien et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Block et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kobayashi, 2016</xref>). Galactolipids comprise a glycerol backbone esterified to contain a single (MGDG) or double (DGDG) galactose units at the <italic>sn</italic>1 position and two fatty acid chains at the <italic>sn</italic>2 and <italic>sn</italic>3 positions. In addition to the number of galactose units at <italic>sn</italic>1, galactolipids also differ by the length and degrees of saturation of the fatty acid chains. In some species, including Arabidopsis, galactolipid synthesis relies on two different pathways, defined as the eukaryotic and prokaryotic pathways depending on the organellar origin of the diacylglycerol precursor. The eukaryotic pathway requires the import of diacyl-glycerol (DAG) synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) into the plastids and is referred to as the ER pathway, whereas the prokaryotic pathway is entirely restricted to the plastid (PL) and is referred to as the PL pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ohlrogge and Browse, 1995</xref>). As signatures, ER pathway-derived galactolipids harbor an 18-carbon chain, whereas PL pathway–derived galactolipids harbor a 16-carbon chain at the <italic>sn</italic>2 position. In addition to constituting the lipid bilayer, galactolipids are integral components of photosystems and thereby contribute to photochemistry and photoprotection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aronsson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kobayashi, 2016</xref>). Thylakoids also contain neutral lipids such as chlorophyll, carotenoids, tocopherols, and plastoquinone. These may exist freely or be associated with the photosynthetic complexes, having either a direct role in photosynthesis (chlorophyll, carotenoids, plastoquinone) or participating indirectly in the optimization of light usage and/or mitigation of potentially damaging effects (tocopherols in addition to carotenoids and plastoquinone) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hashimoto et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">van Wijk and Kessler, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Past studies used conventional electron microscopy to first describe the architecture of the thylakoid membrane network. Based on these 2D observations, researchers proposed that plant thylakoid membranes are organized as single lamellae connected to appressed multi-lamellar regions called grana. How these lamellae are interconnected was revealed only later following the development of 3D electron microscopic techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Staehelin and Paolillo, 2020</xref>). Tremendous technological progress in the field of electron microscopy has been made recently, leading to improved descriptions of chloroplast ultrastructure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Daum et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Daum and Kühlbrandt, 2011</xref>). Electron tomography substantially improved our comprehension of the 3D organization of the thylakoid network in chloroplasts at different developmental stages and in different photosynthetic organisms, including Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Austin and Staehelin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Liang et al., 2018</xref>), Chlamydomonas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Engel et al., 2015</xref>), runner bean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kowalewska et al., 2016</xref>), and <italic>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Flori et al., 2017</xref>). Electron tomography also provided quantitative information on thylakoid structure such as the thylakoid layer number within the grana stack and the thickness of the stacking repeat distance of grana membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Daum et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kirchhoff et al., 2011</xref>). These quantitative data allowed a greater understanding of the spatial organization of the thylakoid membrane in relation to the embedded photosynthetic complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wietrzynski et al., 2020</xref>). Although electron tomography offers extraordinary resolution at the nanometer level, its main drawback is a limit to the volume of the observation, enabling only a partial 3D reconstruction of a chloroplast. Serial Block Face-Scanning Electron Microscopy (SBF-SEM) is a technique where the embedded specimen is imaged by scanning the face of the block with an electron beam. After imaging, the face of the block is shaved automatically (e.g. 60-nm-thick slices) by an ultramicrotome mounted in the vacuum chamber. The section is discarded and the newly revealed block face is imaged again. Repeated imaging and cutting allows the collection of a tomographic sequence of hundreds of images of the same area. Thereby, a much larger volume can be reconstructed in 3D to show cellular organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Peddie and Collinson, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pinali and Kitmitto, 2014</xref>).</p><p>In combination with electron microscopy, biochemical fractionation of thylakoids has revealed differential lipid and protein compositions of the grana and the stroma lamellae. The grana are enriched in DGDG and PSII, whereas the stroma lamellae are enriched in MGDG, Cyt <italic>b6/f</italic>, and PSI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Demé et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Koochak et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tomizioli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wietrzynski et al., 2020</xref>). Changes in lipid and protein compositions during etioplast–chloroplast transition are tightly linked to the thylakoid architecture. In particular, changes in MGDG to DGDG ratio are correlated with the transition from prolamellar body (PLB) and prothylakoid (PT) structures (tubular membrane) to thylakoid membranes (lamellar structure) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bottier et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Demé et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mazur et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Individual studies have provided much insight regarding specific dynamics of the soluble chloroplast proteome, the chloroplast transcriptome, photosynthesis-related protein accumulation and photosynthetic activity, chloroplast lipids, and changes in thylakoid architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Armarego-Marriott et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dubreuil et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kleffmann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kowalewska et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Liang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rudowska et al., 2012</xref>). However, these studies were mostly qualitative, focused on one or two aspects, and were performed in different model organisms. Therefore, chemical data related to thylakoid biogenesis remain sparse and quantitative information is rare. Here, we present a systems-level study that integrates quantitative information on ultrastructural changes of the thylakoids with lipid and protein composition during de-etiolation of Arabidopsis seedlings.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The photosynthetic machinery is functional after 14 hr of de-etiolation</title><p>We analyzed etioplast–chloroplast transition in Arabidopsis seedlings grown in the absence of exogenous sucrose for 3 days in darkness and then exposed to constant white light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Plastids present in cotyledons of etiolated seedlings displayed the typical etioplast ultrastructure with a paracrystalline PLB and tubular PTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The observed PLBs were constituted of hexagonal units with diameters of 0.8–1 µm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). By T4, the highly structured PLBs progressively disappeared and thylakoid lamellae were formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The lamellae were blurry and their thickness varied between 15 and 70 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). After 24 hr of illumination (T24), the density of lamellae per chloroplast was higher than that at T4 due to an increase in lamellar length and number. Appressed regions corresponding to developing grana stacks also appeared by T24 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and G</xref>). These early grana stacks consisted of 2–6 lamellae with a thickness of 13 nm each (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, starch granules were present at T24, supporting the notion that these chloroplasts are photosynthetically functional and able to assimilate carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>). At T96, thylakoid membrane organization was visually similar to that at T24, but with more layers per grana (up to 10 lamellae per grana; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and H</xref>). In addition, singular lamella thickness at T96 increased by 2–3 nm compared to that at T24 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The major differences observed between T24 and T96 were increases in starch granule size and number and overall chloroplast size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Etioplast average length (estimated by measuring the maximum distance on individual slices) was 2 µm (±0.9, n = 10) in the dark (T0), whereas chloroplast average length was 6 µm (±1.62, n = 10) at T96 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Collectively, these data show that photosynthetically functional thylakoid membranes form rapidly during the first 24 hr of de-etiolation. This implies that there are efficient mechanisms for thylakoid assembly and structural organization. Subsequent changes seem to involve the expansion of pre-existing structures (i.e. lamellae length and grana size) and the initiation of photosynthetic carbon fixation (reflected by starch content).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Qualitative analysis of chloroplast ultrastructure during de-etiolation.</title><p>Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of cotyledon cells of 3-day-old, dark-grown <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (Columbia) seedlings illuminated for 0 hr (T0, A and E), 4 hr (T4, B and F), 24 hr (T24, C and G), and 96 hr (T96, D and H) in continuous white light (40 µmol/m<sup>2</sup>/s).

Underrepresentation of organic acid metabolism, in particular carboxylic acid metabolism, characterized cluster 2, whereas overrepresentation of carboxylic acid biosynthesis and underrepresentation of photosynthetic light reactions were clear features of cluster 3. Protein levels in cluster 3 changed only moderately during de-etiolation in contrast with proteins levels in cluster 2. No biological processes were significantly over- or underrepresented in clusters 1, 4, and 5.</p><p>To analyze the dynamics of proteins related to thylakoid biogenesis, we selected specific proteins and represented their pattern of accumulation during de-etiolation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We included proteins constituting protein complexes located in thylakoids (complexes constituting the electron transport chain and the ATP synthase complex) and proteins involved in chloroplast lipid metabolism, chlorophyll synthesis, and protein import into the chloroplast. In agreement with that depicted in the global heatmap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), all photosynthesis-related proteins increased in abundance during de-etiolation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). However, our hierarchical clustering did not show any particular clustering per complex. Only few chloroplast-localized proteins related to lipid biosynthesis were present in our proteomics data set. Among the eight detected proteins, two appeared differentially regulated; fatty acid binding protein 1 (FAB1) and fatty acid desaturase 7 (FAD7) levels increased only between 72 hr of illumination (T72) and T96, whereas the other proteins gradually accumulated over the course of de-etiolation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Etioplasts initiate synthesis of chlorophyll precursors blocked at the level of protochlorophyllide synthesis, with protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase A (PORA) in its inactive form accumulating to high levels in the etioplast before subsequently decreasing at the protein level upon activation and degradation following light exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Blomqvist et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Runge et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Von Wettstein et al., 1995</xref>). In agreement, illumination resulted in increased amounts of most of all detected proteins of the chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway, except PORA and to a lesser extent PORB, which clearly decreased and were separated from other chlorophyll-related proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). We also selected proteins involved in protein import in chloroplasts, focusing on the TOC-TIC machinery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) that is the major route for plastid protein import and essential for chloroplast biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kessler and Schnell, 2006</xref>). Past studies identified several TOC preprotein receptors that are proposed to display differential specificities for preprotein classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bauer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bischof et al., 2011</xref>). The composition of plastid import complexes varies with developmental stages and in different tissues, thereby adjusting the selectivity of the import apparatus to the demands of the plastid and influencing its proteome composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Demarsy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kubis et al., 2003</xref>). Accordingly, the TOC receptors TOC120 and TOC132, which are important for the import of proteins in non-photosynthetic tissues, were more abundant in etioplasts compared to fully-developed chloroplasts (compare T0 and T96). TOC120 and TOC132 were part of a cluster separated from other components of the plastid machinery, such as the TOC159 receptor associated with large-scale import of proteins in chloroplasts. The general import channel TOC75 (TOC75 III) maintained stable expression levels throughout de-etiolation, reflecting its general role in protein import. All other components clustered with TOC159 and displayed gradual increases in accumulation during de-etiolation. Most of these components have not been reported to confer selectivity to the import machinery, which suggests an overall increase of chloroplast protein import capacity.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Accumulation dynamics of plastid proteins during de-etiolation.</title><p>Three-day-old etiolated seedlings of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> were illuminated for 0 hr (T0), 4 hr (T4), 8 hr (T8), 12 hr (T12), 24 hr (T24), 48 hr (T48), 72 hr (T72), and 96 hr (T96) under white light (40 µmol/m<sup>2</sup>/s).

Accumulation of all galactolipids increased upon de-etiolation; however, clustering analysis identified two distinct kinetic patterns. One group displayed a leap between T8 and T12, whereas the other group increased later during the de-etiolation period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).

We reasoned that the increase in chloroplast proteins and lipids between T24 and T96 could be explained by increased chloroplast number (per cell and thus per seedling) and thus total thylakoid surface per seedling. We therefore determined chloroplast number per cell and the cell number and volume for each developmental stage through SBF-SEM analysis (T0, T4, T24, and T96) and confocal microscopy analysis for intermediary time points (T24–T96) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). The chloroplast number per cell was constant from T4 (25 ± 8) to T24 (26 ± 6); however, in parallel with cell expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and B</xref>), chloroplast number increased sharply (fourfold increase) between T24 (26 ± 6) and T96 (112 ± 29), indicating that two rounds of chloroplast division occurred during this time. Immunoblot analysis of FILAMENTOUS TEMPERATURE-SENSITIVE FtsZ1, FtsZ2-1, and FtsZ2-2 proteins showed that these key components of the chloroplast division machinery were already present during the early time points of de-etiolation. We observed considerably increased accumulation of these proteins between T24 and T48, consistent with the idea that activation of chloroplast division takes place at T24, leading the proliferation of chloroplasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). However, levels of ACCUMULATION AND REPLICATION OF CHLOROPLAST 5 (ARC5) protein, another key component of the chloroplast division machinery, clearly increased during de-etiolation between T8 and T12, presumably reflecting assembly of the chloroplast division machinery before its activation and the proliferation of chloroplasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). To test whether there is a correlation between chloroplast division and either volume or developmental stage, we measured the volume of dividing chloroplasts (selected visually based on the presence of a constriction ring, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>) at T24 and T96 using images acquired by SBF-SEM. The average volume of dividing chloroplasts at T24 and T96 were consistently higher than the average volume of all chloroplasts (96 µm<sup>3</sup> and 136 µm<sup>3</sup> compared to 62 µm<sup>3</sup> and 112 µm<sup>3</sup>, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig8sdata1">Figure 8—source data 1</xref>) indicating that smaller chloroplasts are not dividing.

Remarkably, PSII maximum quantum yield (Fv/Fm) reached the maximal value (0.8) by T14, independent of light intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This shows that PSII assembly, and more globally assembly of the photosynthetic machinery, occurs simultaneously with thylakoid membrane formation and that photosynthesis is operational almost immediately upon greening.</p><p>Our proteomic and lipidomic analyses suggest that chloroplast ultrastructural changes rely on specifically timed molecular changes. Proteomic analysis revealed the accumulation patterns of more than 5000 unique proteins at eight time points during de-etiolation. These data provide information for plastid development and more widely on light-regulated developmental processes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). Our dataset is more exhaustive regarding temporal resolution and the number of unique proteins detected than that of previous reports on chloroplast differentiation and de-etiolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bräutigam and Weber, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Plöscher et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Reiland et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wang et al., 2006</xref>). Overall, the dynamics of the accumulation of proteins revealed by proteomics was similar to the dynamics observed by immunoblots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>), although not totally identical for some proteins (e.g. phyA, HY5). The observed differences may be due to the detection methods of the two approaches (detection and relative quantification of individual peptides in proteomics versus detection of the full-length protein by immunoblot analysis) or other inherent limitations of proteomics when faced with low-abundance proteins like transcription factors.</p><p>Here, we focused on chloroplast-localized proteins, specifically on thylakoid membrane proteins. According to the SUBA4 localization consensus, 1112 proteins were assigned to plastids, which covers about a third of the total plastid proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ferro et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hooper et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kleffmann et al., 2007</xref>). We observed striking changes at the chloroplast ultrastructural levels, and in particular the formation of thylakoids between T0 and T4. However, our proteomic analysis indicated only a few changes in abundance of proteins between these time points, including proteins constituting the photosynthetic machinery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). Also, we did not observe a significant increase in the major galactolipids constituting the lipid bilayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source data 1</xref>). Therefore, our data suggest that the reorganization of pre-existing molecules rather than de novo synthesis is responsible for the major chloroplast ultrastructural changes that occur between T0 and T4. These results are consistent with other studies reporting only minor increases in protein accumulation and translation during initial chloroplast differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dubreuil et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kleffmann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Reiland et al., 2011</xref>). A significant change in the proteome was observed when comparing T24 and T0 but overall this change appeared gradual, indicating that increase of chloroplast associated proteins does not exactly follow the two-step induction of corresponding nuclear encoded transcripts reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dubreuil et al., 2018</xref>). At T96 the abundance of 607 proteins (12% of the identified) was increased which confirm the massive reorganization of the proteome following the reorganization of the transcriptome during photomorphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ma et al., 2001</xref>). Proteins whose transcript levels decreases in response to light exposure were also downregulated at the protein levels (e.g. phyA and PORA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ma et al., 2001</xref>). GO analysis combined with expression pattern–based hierarchical clustering highlighted that most photosynthesis-related proteins are globally coregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, clusters 2 and 6) which correlates as well with the overall increase of their corresponding transcripts upon light exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ma et al., 2001</xref>). However, targeted immunoblot analysis revealed different accumulation dynamics for specific photosystem subunits: PSI subunits were detected at later time points than PSII subunits, but thereafter PSI subunit accumulation was faster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The kinetics of different photosynthetic parameters were consistent with the sequential activation of PSII and PSI, in particular photochemical quenching, which showed increased oxidation of the plastoquinone pool by T14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Early accumulation of proteins such as Lhcb5, −6, and PSBS could be a way to quickly induce photoprotective mechanisms such as non-photochemical quenching to prevent PSII photodamage during initial photosynthetic machinery assembly. Differences in PSI and PSII accumulation dynamics and activity have been consistently observed in other chloroplast development experimental systems, including in Arabidopsis cell cultures, during germination and development of Arabidopsis seedlings in the light, and in tobacco leaves upon reillumination after dark adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Armarego-Marriott et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dubreuil et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Liang et al., 2018</xref>). The molecular mechanisms underlying this differential accumulation are currently unknown; however, it is intriguing to observe that PSII protein abundance is higher at early stages of thylakoid formation when grana have not yet been organized. Preferential localization of the PSI and PSII protein complexes in specific thylakoid membrane domains have been reported (lamellae and grana, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wietrzynski et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, the timing of PSII/PSI relative abundance do not match with their preferential localization. It is possible that the formation of PSI still needs to be delayed until grana formation and PSII relocalization is initiated, which can prevent spillover between the two photosystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson, 1981</xref>).</p><p>Chloroplast membranes have a specific composition that differs from that of other cell membranes. Galactolipids constitute the bulk of the thylakoid membranes, but are mostly absent from other membrane systems under growth conditions where phosphorus nutrient is available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jouhet et al., 2007</xref>). MGDG and DGDG represent around 80% of the thylakoid membrane lipids. The absolute quantification of 12 types of MGDG and DGDG galactolipids (representing the major forms) revealed specific patterns of accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Results showed a gradual accumulation of MGDG and DGDG galactolipids derived from the ER pathway from T8 to T24, whereas galactolipids from the PL pathway started to accumulate after 1 day of light exposure (T24). This illustrates the different galactolipid compositions of etioplasts and chloroplasts: ER-pathway galactolipids are predominant in the etioplast whereas PL-pathway galactolipids are predominant in the chloroplast. As no significant changes in lipid accumulation were observed by T4, it appears likely that the emergence of PTs relies on the existing lipids in the etioplast PLB, as suggested also by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Armarego-Marriott et al., 2019</xref>. At later time points, galactolipids from both the ER and PL pathways constitute the lipid matrix of the thylakoid membrane. How the two galactolipid biosynthesis pathways are regulated during development and/or upon light treatment remains to be elucidated; however, we hypothesize that the PL pathway gains traction after T24 when photosynthetic capacity is fully established.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Chloroplast development: ‘chloroplast proliferation phase’</title><p>Chloroplast development continued between T24 and T96, during which thylakoid membranes acquired grana stacks with more clearly defined organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Thylakoid surface increased by only 41%; however, chloroplasts continued to enlarge at a rate comparable to previous de-etiolation stages (T0–T24). This chloroplast volume expansion may be caused by enlargement of extra-thylakoidal spaces occupied by emerging starch granules. These results suggest that large amounts of lipids and proteins are necessary to build up the thylakoid membrane until T24, whereas increases in lipids and proteins between T24 and T96 enable the expansion of already functional thylakoid membranes in preparation for chloroplast division. Indeed, chloroplast number per cell increased during de-etiolation, a process that depends on the division of pre-existing chloroplasts.</p><p>Both chloroplasts and mitochondria divide through the activity of supramolecular complexes that constitute the organelle division machineries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yoshida, 2018</xref>). As chloroplast proliferation was observed between T24 and T96, chloroplast division may correlate with developmental stage of the organelle. Components of the chloroplast division machinery (e.g. FtsZ and ARC5) were detectable in etioplasts; however, their protein levels accumulated significantly during de-etiolation as chloroplasts proliferated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C and D</xref>). Interestingly, the capacity to divide appeared to correlate with a minimum chloroplast volume of about 100 µm<sup>3</sup>, even at T24 when most chloroplasts were smaller (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). On the other hand, plastid division and volume seem not to correlate with light and chloroplast photosynthetic capacity in monocots, as etioplasts can divide and increase in size with leaf cell development in absence of light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Robertson and Laetsch, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Klein and Mullet, 1986</xref>). Whether and how cell, chloroplast size and developmental stage can be sensed to activate the chloroplast division machinery remains poorly understood and requires further study.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>A model of thylakoid expansion</title><p>Our mathematical model describing the expansion of thylakoid surface per seedling over time considered the surface area occupied by the membrane lipids MGDG and DGDG and the major photosynthetic complexes PSII, PSI, and Cyt <italic>b</italic><sub>6</sub><italic>f</italic>.

The predictions made by our model fit the surface estimated by SBF-SEM at T4 and T24, whereas they do not fit that at T96. This means that compounds used to generate the mathematical model appear to contribute most to changes in thylakoid surface during early stages of de-etiolation (the structure establishment phase). By contrast, during the later stages of de-etiolation (the chloroplast proliferation phase), the contribution of other compounds omitted in our model is obviously required to build up thylakoid surface.</p><p>Our proteomics data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> and Dataset 2) revealed some proteins that increased between T24 and T96, such as the FtsH protease (AT2G30950). FtsH proteases have a critical function during thylakoid biogenesis. In Arabidopsis, they constitute a hetero-hexameric complex of four FtsH subunits, which is integrated in the thylakoid membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kato and Sakamoto, 2018</xref>). Although the FtsH complex surface area is unknown in Arabidopsis, it can be considered as a potential compound contributing to the thylakoid surface changes missing from our mathematical model. Other proteins, such as those involved in carotenoid biosynthesis (AT3G10230) or fatty acid metabolism (AT1G08640), also increased significantly after T24, implying that they contribute to the ‘ɛ’ factor.</p><p>A follow-up study would be to test the model under different conditions to investigate how this biological system responds to internal (perturbing hormone concentrations, genetic modification of thylakoid lipid and protein composition) or external (different qualities of light) factors. This could be instrumental in revealing new potential regulatory mechanisms of thylakoid biogenesis and maintenance.</p><p>Upon de-etiolation, the development of photosynthetic capacity relies on successful chloroplast biogenesis. At the cellular level, this process is expected to be highly coordinated with the metabolism and development of other organelles. Lipid synthesis involves lipid exchanges between chloroplasts and the endoplasmic reticulum. How lipid trafficking is organized remains poorly understood, but could require membrane contact sites between these two organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Michaud and Jouhet, 2019</xref>). Physical interaction between mitochondria and chloroplasts have been reported previously in diatoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bailleul et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Flori et al., 2017</xref>). Whether such contact sites occur and are functional in plants is unknown; however, these mechanisms are hypothesized to exist since it is necessary that chloroplasts exchange metabolites with mitochondria and peroxisomes to ensure activation of photorespiration concomitantly with photosynthesis. The study of membrane contact sites is an emerging field in cell biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Scorrano et al., 2019</xref>). Future work will focus on analysing the dynamics and functionality of contact sites between chloroplast membranes and other organelles, and investigate the general coordination of plant cell metabolism during de-etiolation. These questions could be further addressed using the SBF-SEM stacks and proteomic resource described here.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant material and growth conditions</title><p><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> seeds (Columbia ecotype) were surface-sterilized with 70% (v/v) ethanol with 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100, then washed with 100% ethanol.

For each sample, 2 μL of peptides were loaded on a commercial MZ Symmetry C18 Trap Column (100 Å, 5 µm, 180 µm x 20 mm, Waters) followed by nanoEase MZ C18 HSS T3 Column (100 Å, 1.8 µm, 75 µm x 250 mm, Waters).

After automatic peak picking, precursor ions with charges other than 2+, 3+, or 4+ were discarded. The five highest-ranked MS/MS spectra, at most, for each peptide ion were exported, using the deisotoping and charge deconvolution option and limiting the fragment ion count to 200 peaks per MS/MS. The resulting Mascot generic file (.mgf) was searched with Mascot Server version 2.6.2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.matrixsicence.com">http://www.matrixsicence.com</ext-link>) using the following settings: trypsin digest with up to two missed cleavages allowed; carbamidomethylation of cysteine as fixed modification; N-terminal acetylation and oxidation of methionine residue as variable modifications; precursor ion mass tolerance 10 ppm; fragment ion (MS/MS) tolerance 0.04 kDa. This search was performed against a forward and reverse (decoy) Araport11 database that included common MS contaminants and iRT peptides. The mascot result was imported into Scaffold Q+S (v4.8.9; Proteome Software Inc), where a spectrum report was created using a false discovery rate (FDR) of 10% and 0.5% at the protein and peptide level, respectively, and a minimum of one identified peptide per protein. After loading the spectrum report into ProgenesisQI, samples were normalized using the ‘normalize to all proteins’ default settings (i.e. normalization was performed to all ions with charges 2+, 3+ or 4+). Samples were grouped according to de-etiolation time point in a between-group analysis with four replicates for each condition, except for time point T0 and T48, where n = 3. For these two time points, one replicate each had been discarded it appeared as an outlier in principal component analysis (PCA) of protein abundances between different runs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). Quantification employed the Hi-N method, measuring the three most abundant peptides for each protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Grossmann et al., 2010</xref>). Associated statistics (p-values, PCA etc.) were calculated in ProgenesisQI, except for the q-values, which were calculated from the p-values using the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) method, with FDR-adjustment to enforce monotonicity. Quantification also used protein grouping, which assigns proteins for which only shared but no unique peptides were identified to a ‘lead’ identifier containing all these shared peptides and thus having the greatest coverage among all grouped identifiers or highest score where coverage is equal. Quantification was restricted to protein (groups) with at least two identified peptides among which at least one is unique to the protein (group). Using these requirements, 5082 Arabidopsis proteins (or groups) were identified.

Three respective calibration curves for the three recombinant proteins were created. Concentrations used to generate the PsbA and PetC calibration curves were 1.75, 2.5, 5, and 10 (ng/µL). Concentrations used to generate the PsaC calibration curve were 0.375, 0.75, 1.5, and 3 (ng/µL). Immunodetections were performed using specific antibodies: anti-Actin (Sigma, A0 480) at 1/3000 dilution in 5% (w/v) milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS); anti-Lhcb2 (Agrisera, AS01 003), anti-D1(PsbA) (Agrisera, AS05 084), anti-PsbO (Agrisera, AS14 2825), anti-PsbD (Agrisera, AS06 146), anti-PetC (Agrisera, AS08 330), and anti-AtpC (Agrisera, AS08 312) at 1/5000 dilution in 5% milk/TBS; Anti-PsaD (Agrisera, AS09 461) at 1/2000 in 5% milk/TBS; and anti-PsaC (Agrisera, AS042P) and anti-ARC5 (Agrisera, AS13 2676) at 1/2000 in 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) in TBS.

multifaceted analysis of chloroplast development, which provides a rich resource for plant biologists. The technically challenging 3D characterization of time resolved thylakoid development and its correlation with protein and lipid abundance allows a new level of understanding of chloroplast development and the conceptual division of this process into two phases.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Two distinct phases of chloroplast biogenesis during de-etiolation in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Christian Hardtke as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Thomas Pfannschmidt (Reviewer #1); R. Paul Jarvis (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that few additional experiments and analyses are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts.

Morphological data, focusing in particular on the photosynthetic thylakoid membranes, are derived using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), serial block face scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM), and confocal microscopy, while quantitative molecular data on the abundancies of proteins and lipids are derived using mass spectrometry and western blotting. The various data are acquired over a time course between 0 h and 96 h post illumination, and with a high level of temporal resolution. The data allow the authors to develop a mathematical model for the expansion of the surface area of thylakoids (reaching 500-times the surface area of the cotyledon leaf), which matches well with experimental observations from the SBF-SEM analysis for earlier, but not later, stages of de-etiolation. Moreover, the data point to a two-phase organization of the de-etiolation process, with the first phase (&quot;Structure Establishment&quot;) characterized by thylakoid assembly and photosynthetic establishment, and the second phase (&quot;Chloroplast Proliferation&quot;) characterized by chloroplast division and cell expansion.</p><p>The data are of a high standard, and the depth and breadth of analysis in a single, unified study is unprecedented. While it is arguable that there are few major, completely novel insights reported here (indeed, in the Discussion, the authors very helpfully point out how many of the parameters they have measured are consistent with data reported elsewhere by others), this should not detract from the overall value of the study; a major and unique strength here is that all of the data have been acquired together and so are directly comparable. I have no doubt that this dataset will be extremely interesting to many researchers, and prove to be an invaluable resource for the plant science community. Consequently, I am sure that it will attract many citations.</p><p>I have a few specific comments that I would like the authors to consider carefully, as follows.</p><p>1) Figure 3. The 3D reconstructions are undoubtedly useful for deriving quantitative data, as they enabled the derivation of thylakoid surface area data to verify the mathematical model. However, it is very difficult to see anything clearly in the images shown in the figure. I wonder if the authors can make the images clearer, and then also point to and describe some of the key features. The videos do help a bit, but even these are not that clear.</p><p>2) Subsection “Quantitative analysis of thylakoid surface area per chloroplast during de-etiolation”, second paragraph. It is here that the &quot;two phases&quot; model is first proposed. I really could not see a clear basis for proposing this model here, using the data that had been presented thus far. As I see it (and based on the way the two phases are described in the Discussion), one can't really propose this model until after the chloroplast number and cell size data have been presented.</p><p>Moreover, the description of the second phase here (&quot;and a second phase…&quot;) seems a bit inconsistent with the statement in the paragraph above that thylakoid surface area increases dramatically between T4 and T24, and much less between T24 and T96.</p><p>3) Figure 6, and the related supplementary figure. Loading controls are missing here, and should be added. Also, it is stated that a number of proteins (PsbA, PsbD, PsbO, Lhcb2) are &quot;detectable&quot; at T0. To me, they look UNdetectable.</p><p>4) Dividing chloroplasts. In subsection “Identification of a chloroplast division phase”, it is stated that the volume of dividing chloroplasts was measured, and we are referred to Figures 8E and 4B in support of this statement. However, it is not explained how this was done. More clear and specific explanation is needed. Was it the case that the authors sought out and measured dumbbell-shaped organelles, and quantified those? If so, images are needed to illustrate this point. And, I don't see anything relevant in Figure 4B – this callout apparently belongs in the following sentence. The statement that the average size of dividing chloroplasts was higher than that of all chloroplasts is not really surprising if the authors were measuring organelles just on the point of becoming two organelles.</p><p>5) Subsection “Model of thylakoid surface expansion over time”. The motivation for this section needs to be better introduced. When I first read it, I could not understand why the authors wished to again &quot;determine the thylakoid membrane surface area&quot;, as this had already been discussed earlier in the manuscript.</p><p>Also related to the modelling: Did the authors take into account the existence of appressed membranes when calculating the surface area exposed to the cytosol. And, assuming it is clearly established that there is a 1:1 relationship between these proteins and the relevant complexes, perhaps this should be stated and the relevant literature cited.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This study by Pipitone et al. combines SBF-SEM microscopy with quantitative proteomics and lipidomics to explore chloroplast differentiation. Authors describe that chloroplast biogenesis occurs in a first phase of structure establishment with thylakoid biogenesis, followed by a second phase of chloroplast division. The images and 3D reconstructions are beautiful, the quantitative data are novel, and their integration offers a new perspective into the seedling de-etiolation process, a model system for physiological and molecular studies. However, in my opinion some aspects need to be better explained and significantly improved.</p><p>The authors write: &quot;After 8h of illumination (T8), we observed decreased abundance of only one protein (the photoreceptor cryptochrome 2, consistent with its photolabile property) and increased levels of only three proteins, which belonged to the chlorophyll a/b binding proteins category involved in photoprotection (AT1G44575 = PsbS; AT4G10340 = Lhcb5; AT1G15820 = Lhcb6&quot;). This is striking, as many well studied proteins change in abundance during the first hours of de-etiolation. Actually, looking into the data set with the quantification data for of the ~5,000 proteins, it appears that many proteins do show significant changes between T0 and T8. For example PORA and ELIP, changes that are also reflected in Figure 6A.</p><p>Related to the above, well known proteins for example phyA and HY5, that undergo drastic changes in abundance when etiolated seedlings are first exposed to light, do not show changes in T4,T8 and T12 relative to T0 in the proteomics data set. This raises questions about the proteomic approach (sensitivity of the method?) or the experimental setup. Could authors please comment on this? I feel that validation of the proteomics approach is critical, especially taking into account the central conclusion that &quot;the first 12h of illumination saw very few significant changes in protein abundance&quot;.</p><p>Subsection “Chloroplast development: ‘Structure Establishment Phase’” paragraph three: A reference is needed. Also, it is mentioned that PSII appears later than PSI, which does not seem to match the observation that PSII proteins appear earlier than PSI, or that the surface area occupied at early time points by PSII is greater than the one occupied by PSI. Please check.</p><p>Are the calculations of thylakoid surface expansion over time consistent with previous available data using tomography? Please include.</p><p>In the Introduction, authors could include mention of the massive transcriptional reprogramming that take place during de-etiolation. In addition, I think that comparison of the proteomics data with the transcriptomic changes during de-etiolation (well described in the literature) would allow further understanding of the distinct phases proposed. For the chloroplast proteins already present in the dark, how does this correlate with expression of the corresponding genes?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.62709.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There is a concern about the proteomics analysis, as the low number of proteins changing in abundance upon de-etiolation is unexpected.

The section is discarded and the newly revealed block face is imaged again. Repeated imaging and cutting allows the collection of a tomographic sequence of hundreds of images of the same area.

Similar de-etiolation experiments could be conducted with a starchless mutant (e.g. lacking chloroplastic phosphoglucomutase, pgm). However, care would have to be taken since this mutation is also known to have secondary effects on lipid deposition in the developing seeds (Andriotis et al., Plant Physiol. 2012 Nov; 160(3): 1175–1186), which could indirectly affect the speed/extent of de-etiolation.

We could observe a very fast decrease of phyA protein (starting already after 4 hours of illumination) and transient increased accumulation of HY5 that is consistent with previously published data (e.g. Debrieux et al. 2013, Hardtke et al. 2000, respectively). The observed fast degradation of phyA by western blot is not fully identical to the proteomic data, where we observed a significant phyA decrease not earlier than 72 hours of light exposure. We now propose explanations related to these differences as : “Overall the dynamics of the accumulation of proteins revealed by proteomics was similar to the dynamics observed by immunoblots (Figure 6 ; Figure 6—figure supplement 1 and Figure 5—source data 1), although not totally identical for some proteins (e.g. : phyA, HY5). The observed differences may be due to the detection methods of the two approaches (detection and relative quantification of individual peptides in proteomics versus detection of the full-length protein by immunoblot analysis) or other inherent limitations of proteomics when faced with low-abundance proteins like transcription factors. “</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Chloroplast development: ‘Structure Establishment Phase’” paragraph three: A reference is needed.

Please check.</p></disp-quote><p>That’s indeed a good point and we adapted the Discussion to mention this discrepancy between PSII/PSI ratio at early time points and timing of grana formation, and propose an alternative hypothesis: “however, it is intriguing to observe that PSII protein abundance is higher at early stages of thylakoid formation when grana have not yet been organised. Preferential localization of the PSI and PSII protein complexes in specific thylakoid membrane domains have been reported (lamellae and grana, respectively; (Wietrzynski et al., 2020)). Therefore, the timing of PSII/PSI relative abundance do not match with their preferential localization. It is possible that the formation of PSI still needs to be delayed until grana formation and PSII relocalization is initiated, which can prevent spillover between the two photosystems (Anderson, 1981)”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Are the calculations of thylakoid surface expansion over time consistent with previous available data using tomography? Please include.</p></disp-quote><p>One of the novelties of our work is that we quantified the thylakoid expansion over time of de-etiolation. To our knowledge, this has not been reported previously.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the Introduction, authors could include mention of the massive transcriptional reprogramming that take place during de-etiolation. In addition, I think that comparison of the proteomics data with the transcriptomic changes during de-etiolation (well described in the literature) would allow further understanding of the distinct phases proposed. For the chloroplast proteins already present in the dark, how does this correlate with expression of the corresponding genes?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and we now added this information in the Introduction, which now read as : “ Photomorphogenic program is controlled by regulation of gene expression at different levels (Wu et al., 2014). Transcriptome analyses have revealed that upon light exposure, up to one third of Arabidopsis genes are differentially expressed, with 3/5 being are upregulated and 2/5 downregulated (Ma et al., 2001).”</p><p>We also now further compare our proteomic data with previously published transcriptomic data (see also the answer to the comment of reviewer 1) and added the correlation between mRNA and protein dynamics for some proteins, in the text which now reads : “At T96 the abundance of 607 proteins (12% of the identified) was increased which confirm the massive reorganization of the proteome following the reorganization of the transcriptome during photomorphogenesis (Ma et al., 2001). Proteins whose transcript levels decreases in response to light exposure were also downregulated at the protein levels (e.g. phyA and PORA) (Figure 6) (Ma et al., 2001). GO analysis combined with expression pattern–based hierarchical clustering highlighted that most photosynthesis-related proteins are globally coregulated (Figure 5—figure supplement 1, clusters 2 and 6) which correlates as well with the overall increase of their corresponding transcripts upon light exposure (Ma et al., 2001).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
