(RTT). Conversely, duplication or triplication of Xq28 causes an equally wide-ranging progressive neurological disorder, <italic>MECP2</italic> duplication syndrome, whose features overlap somewhat with RTT. To understand which MeCP2 functions cause toxicity in the duplication syndrome, we generated mouse models expressing endogenous <italic>Mecp2</italic> along with a RTT-causing mutation in either the methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD) or the transcriptional repression domain (TRD). We determined that both the MBD and TRD must function for doubling MeCP2 to be toxic. Mutating the MBD reproduces the null phenotype and expressing the TRD mutant produces milder RTT phenotypes, yet both mutations are harmless when expressed with endogenous <italic>Mecp2</italic>. Surprisingly, mutating the TRD is more detrimental than deleting the entire C-terminus, indicating a dominant-negative effect on MeCP2 function, likely due to the disruption of a basic cluster.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02676.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02676.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02676.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Rett syndrome is a disorder that affects the development of the brain after birth. Infants with this condition develop as normal until they are 6–18 months old, when the development of their language and motor skills stops, or even regresses. Most cases of Rett syndrome are caused by mutations in a gene called <italic>MECP2</italic>.</p><p>If an individual mistakenly inherits an extra copy of the <italic>MECP2</italic> gene, it can cause another developmental disorder called <italic>MECP2</italic> duplication syndrome. This condition, which also affects the brain, gets worse over time and shares many features with Rett syndrome. The extra copy of the <italic>MECP2</italic> gene leads to the production of too much MeCP2 protein. However, how doubling the level of this protein causes the syndrome and, in particular, which parts of the protein are involved are unknown.</p><p>Previously, researchers engineered mice that expressed a copy of the human <italic>MECP2</italic> gene alongside their own version of the gene. These mice developed a condition similar to <italic>MECP2</italic> duplication syndrome and many of these mice suffered from seizures and died within their first year.</p><p>Heckman et al. have now engineered mice that also have an extra human <italic>MECP2</italic> gene but with one of two mutations that cause Rett syndrome in humans. Some mice had a mutation in a part of the MeCP2 protein that binds to DNA that is marked with small chemical tags called methyl groups. Other mice had a mutation in a domain of the protein that works to switch off genes. Heckman et al. found that mice with extra MeCP2 protein with either of these two mutations were as healthy as normal mice and showed none of the signs of <italic>MECP2</italic> duplication syndrome. This indicates that both of these domains must be intact for doubling the levels of the MeCP2 protein to be harmful. Furthermore, Heckman et al. discovered that the mutation in the part of MeCP2 that works to switch genes off also reduces the protein's ability to bind to DNA.</p><p>The next challenge is to understand the mechanism by which doubling the levels of this protein causes harm to the brain. Further work is also needed to uncover why having too much MeCP2 protein or none at all cause syndromes that share many features.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02676.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02676.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>MeCP2</kwd><kwd>Rett syndrome</kwd><kwd>MECP2 duplication syndrome</kwd><kwd>neurobiology</kwd><kwd>genetic</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS057819</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zoghbi</surname><given-names>Huda Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Mouse Neurobehavior Core of the Baylor College of Medicine Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30HD024064</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zoghbi</surname><given-names>Huda Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31NS077621</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heckman</surname><given-names>Laura Dean</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM008307</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heckman</surname><given-names>Laura Dean</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zoghbi</surname><given-names>Huda Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Transgenic mice with Rett-causing mutations in MeCP2 reveal that a basic cluster in the C-terminus of the protein binds DNA and that both the methyl-CpG binding domain and the transcriptional repression domain are necessary to elicit toxicity in MECP2 duplication syndrome.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Rett syndrome (RTT), the most common monogenic cause of intellectual disability in females, is a debilitating, progressive neurological disorder that is caused by mutations in the X-linked gene encoding methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amir et al., 1999</xref>). After a 6- to 18-month period of normal development, head growth slows and affected girls lose acquired speech, dexterity, and social skills; they then develop characteristic hand stereotypies, respiratory dysrhythmias, seizures, and autistic-like features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hagberg et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lam et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Klauck et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carney et al., 2003</xref>). Interestingly, duplications and triplications spanning the <italic>MECP2</italic> region on Xq28 cause a similarly progressive neurological disorder called <italic>MECP2</italic> duplication syndrome, which has some features that overlap with RTT. Children with the duplication syndrome present with infantile hypotonia and develop severe intellectual disability, autistic-like features, recurrent respiratory infections, spasticity, seizures, and premature lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">del Gaudio et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Friez et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lugtenberg et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Meins et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Van Esch et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>MeCP2 was first identified over 20 years ago as a transcriptional repressor that binds to methylated CpG dinucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lewis et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wakefield et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Free et al., 2001</xref>). It binds DNA directly through its N-terminal methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD), whereas its C-terminal transcriptional repression domain (TRD) allows it to interact with corepressors such as Sin3a, HDAC1, and HDAC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nan et al., 1998</xref>). More recent work has revealed that MeCP2 is expressed at higher levels than expected for classical site-specific transcriptional repressors: it binds as abundantly and widely throughout the genome as histone H1, which suggests MeCP2 might have additional functions in chromatin biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Skene et al., 2010</xref>). Further complicating the picture of MeCP2 function are transcriptional studies in mouse brains as well as human embryonic stem cell-derived neurons, which have shown that most genes are actually downregulated in RTT models that lack MeCP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chahrour et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ben-Shachar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2013</xref>). One proposal to explain this is that MeCP2 acts as a ‘transcriptional noise dampener’, such that loss of MeCP2 function results in the diversion of basal transcriptional machinery to repetitive elements, indirectly leading to global transcriptional downregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Skene et al., 2010</xref>). Additional transcriptional studies present a challenge for this hypothesis, however, as the same genes that are downregulated in the RTT models are upregulated in <italic>MECP2</italic> duplication syndrome mouse models with double the MeCP2 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chahrour et al., 2008</xref>). How might doubling MeCP2 levels lead to the upregulation of the very same genes? It may be that, given the abundance of MeCP2 in the normal state, doubling the protein levels, as in the duplication syndrome, exhausts the supply of normal binding partners, thus diverting them from their normal functions, but this possibility has not been formally tested.</p><p>Because most RTT-causing mutations disrupt either the MBD or TRD, we decided to use a genetic approach to determine how these regions might be involved in mediating the toxicity observed in <italic>MECP2</italic> duplication syndrome models. Studying transgenic models with known RTT-causing missense mutations on a <italic>Mecp2</italic> null background would allow us to observe the effect of the mutation when it is the only allele present, as in RTT, whereas studying the effects of the transgene on a wild type (WT) background would enable us to study the importance of each domain to the neurotoxicity caused by <italic>MECP2</italic> duplication syndrome.</p><p>To explore the role of the MBD in RTT and <italic>MECP2</italic> duplication syndrome, we chose a RTT-causing point mutation that replaces an arginine with a glycine at residue 111 (R111G) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Laccone et al., 2001</xref>). R111 is critical for methyl-CpG binding in vitro: when it is mutated (R111G), it completely abolishes binding to methyl-CpGs in vitro without affecting the structure of the MBD or the rest of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Free et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kudo et al., 2003</xref>). We selected this mutation to determine whether MeCP2 retains any functions without a functional MBD, whether the MBD is required for the toxicity observed in duplication models, and whether doubling MeCP2 mediates toxicity by over-titrating its binding partners.</p><p>Much less is known about the TRD, but the importance of the C-terminus is underscored by the clustering of common RTT-causing mutations at the very end of the TRD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Christodoulou et al., 2003</xref>). In fact, the mutation of arginine to cysteine at residue 306 (R306C) is the second most common RTT-causing missense mutation. Although recent studies have shown that the R306C mutation abolishes interaction with the NCoR corepressor complex, a mouse model bearing a truncated form of MeCP2 that lacks the NCoR binding site has a milder phenotype than the published mice carrying the R306C mutation, indicating that R306C has other effects on the function of MeCP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ebert et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lyst et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>To study the functional consequences of these two mutations in vivo, we generated independent transgenic mouse models, each bearing one of these point mutations in the <italic>MECP2</italic> locus. We characterized the behavioral and molecular phenotypes of mice carrying only the mutant allele (and thus modeling RTT) and mice carrying the mutant allele in addition to a WT allele (modeling <italic>MECP2</italic> duplication syndrome) in an effort to determine how each mutation affects the function of the protein in the two diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of transgenic mice carrying MeCP2 with the R111G or the R306C missense mutation</title><p>To generate a modified <italic>MECP2</italic> allele, we used a PAC (P1-derived artificial chromosome, PAC671D9) containing the entire human <italic>MECP2</italic> locus and its essential regulatory elements, but no other genes. This PAC clone was used to create the <italic>MECP2</italic> duplication mouse model and predict the human disease, and on a <italic>Mecp2</italic> null background it rescues loss-of-function phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collins et al., 2004</xref>). We used recombineering to modify the locus to carry either the R111G or the R306C mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Warming et al., 2005</xref>). This PAC has reliably produced founders with protein levels and expression pattern similar to that of endogenous MeCP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collins et al., 2004</xref>). We further modified the PAC to tag MeCP2 with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) at the C-terminus to better identify interactors through immunoprecipitation (IP) and visualize their localization using immunofluorescence (IF) without disrupting MeCP2 function. Arginine 111 (R111) is located in the middle of the MBD, whereas arginine 306 (R306) is in a cluster of basic amino acids at the end of the TRD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). After establishing transgenic lines for each mutation, we characterized the protein levels of two independent lines for each mutation by western blot and found that they expressed transgenic MeCP2 at levels similar to those of endogenous MeCP2, thus doubling the total MeCP2 level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Because doubling MeCP2 consistently causes phenotypes similar to the human syndrome, we chose one line (Line 1) of each mutant for further characterization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collins et al., 2004</xref>). Immunofluorescence using anti-MeCP2 and anti-GFP antibodies on midsagittal sections of the whole brain shows that the distribution pattern of transgenic MeCP2 parallels that of endogenous MeCP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, upper panel). This colocalization also holds true upon closer inspection of the cortex and cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, lower panel).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02676.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Generation of transgenic lines.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of MeCP2-EGFP fusion protein, showing the methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD, blue), transcriptional repression domain (TRD, red), a cluster of basic amino acids (yellow), and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP, green).

We examined overall activity and anxiety using distance traveled in the open field assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), the center-to-total ratio in the open field assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), and time spent in the dark in the light/dark assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We also assayed motor coordination by their ability to stay on a rotating rod in the rotarod assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), footslips per distance traveled in parallel rod footslip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), and nest building after 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). We assessed learning and memory with the contextual and cued conditioned fear test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H–I</xref>). We found no difference between WT and R111G Tg mice in any of these behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–I</xref>), indicating that an intact MBD is necessary to elicit the toxicity seen in the duplication syndrome model. These data also show that the phenotypes of the R111G mice (when the only MeCP2 allele is mutated) are exclusively caused by the mutation, and not insertional effects of the transgene, as the presence of a WT MeCP2 allele (in the R111G Tg mice) displays no phenotypes.</p><p>In vitro, MeCP2-R111G abolishes binding to methyl-CpGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Free et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kudo et al., 2003</xref>). This had never been shown in vivo, however, so we used immunofluorescence (IF) and DAPI staining to visualize the localization of MeCP2 to heterochromatic foci, which are regions of highly compacted chromatin. The localization of a protein to these sites can serve as a proxy for methyl-CpG binding, and WT MeCP2 usually localizes there (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, upper panel). We found that MeCP2-R111G was unable to localize to heterochromatic foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, lower panel), suggesting it is unable to bind methyl-CpGs in vivo. To verify that abolishing methyl-CpG binding has no effect on the ability of MeCP2 to interact with binding partners, we performed in vivo immunoprecipitation (IP) to determine whether MeCP2-R111G can interact with the Sin3a, HDAC1, and HDAC2 of the Sin3a corepressor complex and HDAC3 and Tbl1 of the NCoR corepressor complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nan et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Stancheva et al., 2003</xref>).

Mice with a truncating mutation, G273X, lack the entire region mapped to interact with NCoR, so MeCP2-G273X, like MeCP2-R306C, is unable to bind NCoR. However, the median lifespan of R306C mice (18 weeks, this study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lyst et al., 2013</xref>) is much shorter than that of G273X mice (28 weeks, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2013</xref>). This led us to consider the potential differences between the two alleles. Because MeCP2 shows affinity for specific sequences, we tested whether these mutants differed in their ability to bind these sequences by performing in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments on brain tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chahrour et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Skene et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2013</xref>).

Thus, we focused on the C-terminus of the protein and generated N-terminally GST-tagged C-terminal fragments of MeCP2 (amino acids 274–340) with and without the R306C mutation, which allowed us to uncover more subtle differences without the overwhelming DNA binding of the MBD. We performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) to determine whether the C-terminal basic cluster flanking R306 binds DNA and further test whether the R306C mutation alters this binding. The WT MeCP2 fragment binds to the double-stranded DNA probe with increasing amount of protein, but the R306C mutation completely abolished the ability of the fragment to bind DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, two left panels). We further confirmed the importance of the basic cluster flanking R306 by performing EMSAs with two other RTT-causing point mutations: arginine to histidine at residue 306 (R306H) and lysine to glutamic acid at residue 304 (K304E), both of which remove a basic charge from the cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Christodoulou et al., 2003</xref>). These two mutations also abolish the ability of the fragment to bind DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, two right panels), thus emphasizing the importance of the basic cluster in C-terminal DNA binding. While these experiments were performed using a truncated MeCP2 peptide lacking the MBD (amino acids 274–340), we believe that the loss of this DNA binding is critical. In vivo ChIP analysis supports this notion, as despite the presence of the MBD and two functional AT-hooks in both MeCP2-G273X and MeCP2-R306C, the disruption of the basic cluster in MeCP2-R306C reduces binding to DNA even more than the complete absence of the cluster in MeCP2-G273X (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). R306 therefore has an influence on DNA binding itself in addition to its role in NCoR complex binding, and having a defective C-terminus (R306C) is worse than having no C-terminus at all.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>To gain insight into both RTT and <italic>MECP2</italic> duplication syndrome, we generated transgenic mouse models of MeCP2 carrying the R111G or the R306C missense mutation and compared them to the existing <italic>Mecp2</italic> null mice. Using the transgene on a <italic>Mecp2</italic> null background, we explored how the mutations disrupt normal function in RTT; using the transgene on a wild type background allowed us to explore whether the remaining functions of the mutant alleles can cause <italic>MECP2</italic> duplication syndrome.</p><p>Our investigation of the R111G mutation led to two important conclusions about the function of MeCP2. Since previous NMR studies demonstrated that this mutation abolishes binding to methyl-CpGs without affecting the structure of the MBD or the rest of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Free et al., 2001</xref>), we used this mutation to assess the necessity of methyl-CpG binding in both RTT and <italic>MECP2</italic> duplication syndrome. If excessive MeCP2 disrupts neuronal function by diverting corepressors away from loci they normally repress, then abolishing methyl-CpG binding in an extra copy of MeCP2 that is still capable of interacting with corepressors (as we show in this study) would still produce the duplication phenotype in mice. Instead, the R111G Tg mice were indistinguishable from wild-type mice. Therefore, overabundant MeCP2 does not exert toxic effects because it diverts corepressors away from their normal binding sites: rather, trouble arises when more abundant MeCP2 occupies more methyl-CpGs. The centrality of methyl-CpG binding to MeCP2 function was underscored by the R111G mice, which phenocopied the early lethality of the <italic>Mecp2</italic> null mice. All of this is consistent with studies asserting that lack of methyl-CpG binding leads to RTT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kudo et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Like the R111G Tg mice, the R306C Tg mice were also indistinguishable from WT mice, demonstrating that a functional TRD is as necessary for the toxic effects of MeCP2 duplication as a functional MBD. The R306C mice, though displaying milder phenotypes than <italic>Mecp2</italic> null mice, recapitulated many phenotypes seen in RTT patients, such as increased anxiety, motor dysfunction, and learning and memory deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hagberg et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chahrour and Zoghbi, 2007</xref>). This line is therefore a reliable mouse model for studying RTT and should be particularly useful since this is one of the most common RTT-causing mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Christodoulou et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>The R306C mutation proved most useful for understanding the function of the less well-studied MeCP2 C-terminus. Because the G273X mouse model, which lacks the entire MeCP2 C-terminus, has a median survival of 28 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2013</xref>)—longer than both our R306C transgenic and the recently published R306C knock-in (median survival 18 weeks, this study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lyst et al., 2013</xref>)—we hypothesized that the R306C allele must have an additional compromised function beyond its inability to bind NCoR through its TRD. Indeed, we found that MeCP2-R306C has reduced affinity for MeCP2 binding sequences in vivo, likely due to the disruption of a highly conserved basic cluster of amino acids (304-309) flanking R306, rendering it unable to bind DNA.</p><p>This study has added to our understanding of MeCP2 function by discovering that the basic cluster flanking R306 has an additional function in binding DNA and that this binding is abolished when basic residues in the cluster are mutated to neutral or acidic residues. Moreover, the R306C mutation is even more detrimental than lacking the entire basic cluster. This is reminiscent of a study documenting loss-of-function mutations in <italic>SOB3</italic>, a gene encoding an AT-hook-containing protein. The authors showed that an arginine to histidine disruption of the AT-hook produced a more severely impaired phenotype than a truncating mutation, indicating that the missense mutation has a dominant-negative effect on the function of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Street et al., 2008</xref>). Mutation of R306 to either a cysteine or a histidine could have the same dominant-negative effect. Uncovering a role for this basic cluster adds the region around R306 to the MBD, TRD, and AT-hooks as domains known to be essential for MeCP2 function.</p><p>In sum, comparisons of mouse lines carrying individual disease-causing mutations provide great insights into the function of MeCP2 and the pathogenesis of RTT. In future studies, these and additional mouse models will help us to further investigate the role of MeCP2 and its DNA binding affinity in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Generation of transgenic mice</title><p>The <italic>galK</italic> recombineering system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Warming et al., 2005</xref>) was used to modify a previously described PAC (P1-derived artificial chromosome, PAC671D9) containing the entire <italic>MECP2</italic> locus. In short, <italic>galK</italic>, flanked by 50 base pair (bp) homology arms to facilitate homologous recombination, was electroporated into induced SW102 cells containing the PAC to replace the residue of interest (R111 or R306). The presence of <italic>galK</italic> was selected for by growth at 30°C on minimal media plates containing galactose. Individual colonies were confirmed by streaking onto MacConkey plates followed by DNA sequencing. A single colony was chosen for the second round of electroporation to insert the desired mutation (AGG to GGG for R111G, CGC to TGC for R306C). The replacement of <italic>galK</italic> with the residue of interest was selected for by plating on minimal media plates containing 2-Deoxy-D-galactose. Individual colonies were screened for the correct insert size by PCR. DNA from a single colony was sequence verified, purified, and digested with NotI followed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis to isolate the ∼99 kb <italic>MECP2</italic>-continaing DNA from the backbone. To generate the transgenic mice, 1 ng/µl DNA was used for pronuclear injections into FVB single cell zygotes using standard procedures.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Western blot analysis</title><p>Protein lysates were prepared from whole brains that were dounce homogenized in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl pH 8.0, 180 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP-40, 1 mM EDTA, Roche Complete Protease Inhibitor, Basel, Switzerland) followed by sonication and rotation for 30 min at 4°C.

Rotarod was performed on a new cohort of animals. Briefly, in the open field assay the movements of the mice in a 40 cm × 40 cm box, with 25 cm × 25 cm defined as the center, were tracked for 30 min and analyzed for total distance traveled and duration and distance traveled in the center using AccuScan Fusion software (Omnitech, Columbus, OH). In the light/dark assay, the movements of the mice in a 40 cm × 20 cm box (1/3 dark, 2/3 light) were tracked for 10 min and the time spent in the dark was analyzed using the AccuScan Fusion software. For nesting, mice were singly housed with a nestlet, and their ability to build a nest was assessed after 24 hr on a scale of 0–3 (0 = completely untouched, 3 = completely built nest). For parallel rod footslip, mice were placed in a 20 cm × 20 cm box and tracked for 10 min as they attempted to walk on a series of parallel rods. Footslips were detected by ANY-maze system (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL), and footslips per centimeter traveled were analyzed. Conditioned fear was performed over 2 days using the Actimetrics chamber and FreezeFrame 3 system (Med Associates, St. Albans, VT): the mice received two 1 mA shocks accompanied by ∼85 dB white noise on the first training day, and contextual fear was tested on the second day by placement in the same box with no white noise or shock. After a rest period of at least an hour, cued fear was tested by white noise with no shock in the same box altered by different visual and olfactory cues. FreezeFrame 3 was used to analyze percent freezing during the white noise. For rotarod, mice were placed on an accelerating rotating rod (Ugo Basile, Varese, Italy) for four trials a day for four consecutive days for 10 min per trial, during which the rod accelerated from 4 to 40 rpm in the first 5 min. The time until the mouse fell (or rode around the rod twice in a row) was recorded and averaged for each day. Data were analyzed by an ordinary one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's multiple comparisons test.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 2 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewer discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this article, the authors have generated transgenic mouse models of MeCP2 carrying the R111G or R306C RTT missense mutations (on a null as well as WT background) to investigate the functionality of the methyl CpG- binding domain (MBD) and transcriptional repression domain (TRD). They have characterized the mouse models using behavioral and biochemical techniques and the basic findings include the following: (i) MeCP2-R111G behaves similar to null mice and does not bind methyl-CpGs in vivo, although interaction with Sin3a/NCoR corepressor complexes remains unaffected; (ii) R306C mice show milder phenotypes than MeCP2 null mice and retains ability to bind Methyl-CpG, Sin3A, HDAC1 and HDAC2 but displays reduced interaction with HDAC3 and TbI1 of NCoR corepressor complex; (iii) the C-terminus basic cluster (amino acids 274-340) might have an additional role in DNA binding since R306C reduces binding to DNA in vivo, also indicating a dominant-negative effect on MeCP2 function. The experiments are well done and contribute to our understanding of MeCP2 function in MECP2 duplication syndrome. Generally, the behavioral characterization and various biochemical techniques used in the paper help support the findings and confirm previous studies and provide important insights in the differential disease phenotype of Rett patients with mutations in Mecp2.</p><p>1) The detailed study of R306C adds strength to the paper and shows evidence for the C-terminus basic cluster to have a possible DNA binding role. However, some additional follow-up experiments are desirable but not required to confirm results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>. For example, (i) comparison to other MeCP2 mutations close to the basic cluster would be useful (ii) proof that DNA binding of the full length MeCP2-R306C is also impaired.</p><p>2) Two of the most pronounced phenotypes reported in MeCP2 overexpression in mice are context dependent fear conditioning and motor coordination impairments on the rotating rod (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collins et al., 2004</xref>; Na et al., 2013, which should also be cited). It would strengthen the findings that mutations in either functional domain do not produce phenotypes when expressed with endogenous MeCP2, if the authors examined the R111G-Tg and the R306-Tg mice in these behavioral paradigms. </p><p>3) The authors demonstrated no behavioral effects of R111G-Tg and R306C-Tg mice in comparison to wild type animals. The authors should address the extent of interaction of R306C-Tg and R111G-Tg (those expressing mutant MeCP2 with endogenous MeCP2) with components of the Sin3a and NCoR repressor complexes. In the R306C-Tg and R111G-Tg mice, does MeCP2 interact with the corepressors equally to what is observed in the wild type animals? </p><p>4) The immunofluorescence staining in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> demonstrates nuclear punctuated staining of R306C, indicative of DNA binding to heterochromatin. However, the EMSA data of R306C in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> shows its inability to bind DNA. These two pieces of evidences are somewhat conflicting so the authors should comment on this point.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02676.011</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The detailed study of R306C adds strength to the paper and shows evidence for the C-terminus basic cluster to have a possible DNA binding role.

For example, (i) comparison to other MeCP2 mutations close to the basic cluster would be useful (ii) proof that DNA binding of the full length MeCP2-R306C is also impaired</italic>.</p><p>We have performed additional EMSA experiments to address (i) if other mutations in the basic cluster behave similarly and (ii) if the DNA binding of full-length MeCP2-R306C is impaired. We chose to pursue two particularly interesting RTT-causing mutations within the basic cluster: arginine to histidine at residue 306 (R306H) and lysine to glutamic acid at residue 304 (K304E). Both of these mutations change a positively charged amino acid to a relatively uncharged one (histidine) or negatively charged one (glutamic acid), whereas the other mutations in the cluster retain the positive charge. Additionally, within the cluster, R306H is the second most common RTT-causing missense mutation after R306C, indicating that this residue could be of particular importance. Using the same 274-340 amino acid fragment of MeCP2, we found that neither R306H nor K304E bind DNA, thus supporting our argument that the basic cluster flanking R306 is important for DNA binding. We included these findings in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>.</p><p>In the context of the full-length protein, we examined the binding of WT MeCP2 and MeCP2-R306C and found that both bind DNA with equal affinity in this <italic>in vitro</italic> assay. However, this is expected, as the primary mechanism of MeCP2 binding to DNA is via the methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD), thus making subtle differences in binding affinities extremely difficult to detect <italic>in vitro</italic>. Stronger proof that there is indeed a difference in the DNA binding of full-length MeCP2-R306C comes from the <italic>in vivo</italic> ChIP experiments. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, it is clear that MeCP2-R306C-EGFP binding is decreased <italic>in vivo</italic> when compared to the wild type MeCP2-EGFP. Since the MBD is intact in both proteins and the only difference is the R306C mutation, it is safe to conclude that the mutation affects DNA binding in the context of the full-length protein. We made this point more clearly in the revised text.</p><p><italic>2) Two of the most pronounced phenotypes reported in MeCP2 overexpression in mice are context dependent fear conditioning and motor coordination impairments on the rotating rod (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9"><italic>Collins et al., 2004</italic></xref><italic>; Na et al., 2013, which should also be cited). It would strengthen the findings that mutations in either functional domain do not produce phenotypes when expressed with endogenous MeCP2, if the authors examined the R111G-Tg and the R306-Tg mice in these behavioral paradigms</italic>.<italic> </italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for the suggestion. We added the missing citation and performed the contextual conditioned fear and rotarod assays in the R111G Tg (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,H</xref>) and R306C Tg (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,I,K</xref>) mice. We found that there was no difference in these two lines when compared to WT littermates, thus strengthening our conclusion that both functional domains are necessary to see <italic>MECP2</italic> duplication phenotypes.</p><p><italic>3) The authors demonstrated no behavioral effects of R111G-Tg and R306C-Tg mice in comparison to wild type animals. The authors should address the extent of interaction of R306C-Tg and R111G-Tg (those expressing mutant MeCP2 with endogenous MeCP2) with components of the Sin3a and NCoR repressor complexes. In the R306C-Tg and R111G-Tg mice, does MeCP2 interact with the corepressors equally to what is observed in the wild type animals? </italic></p><p>While we agree with the reviewers that this is an interesting question; the challenge of proving that endogenous MeCP2 interacts with the corepressor complexes in the transgenic animals lies in lack of good commercial MeCP2 antisera. The MeCP2 antibodies are not efficient, hence the reason we added an EGFP tag to our mutant protein. To pull down both WT and mutant MeCP2, it would be necessary to combine the MeCP2-EGFP allele with either the MeCP2-R111G or the MeCP2-R306C allele, on the <italic>Mecp2</italic> null background in one mouse. This will take 8 months or so and yet will not impact conclusions as explained in the next paragraph.</p><p>We can safely conclude that the WT endogenous MeCP2 is functional as it rescues all the R111G or R306C loss of function phenotypes: the transgenic mice behave exactly like WT animals indicating the endogenous protein is fully functional. Lastly our conclusion that both functional domains are necessary to cause phenotypes in the duplication mice would not be impacted by the outcome of endogenous MeCP2 IP. For example, MeCP2-R111G interacts with both corepressor complexes similarly to WT MeCP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), so we would expect the two versions of the protein to interact with corepressors to the same extent in the duplication context. Yet we already know that duplication mice present with phenotypes whereas the R111G Tg mice do not. This indicates that interaction with the corepressors is not sufficient to cause duplication phenotype and requires the methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD).</p><p><italic>4) The immunofluorescence staining in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6A</italic></xref> <italic>demonstrates nuclear punctuated staining of R306C, indicative of DNA binding to heterochromatin. However, the EMSA data of R306C in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7C</italic></xref> <italic>shows its inability to bind DNA. These two pieces of evidences are somewhat conflicting so the authors should comment on this point</italic>.</p><p>MeCP2 predominantly binds DNA via its methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD); what we show in our study is that the basic cluster can also bind DNA. To prove the latter point one has to use a fragment (amino acids 274-340 of MeCP2, thus lacking the MBD) in the <italic>in vitro</italic> EMSA assay. In contrast, the immunofluorescence in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> depicts full-length MeCP2-R306C localizing to heterochromatin <italic>in vivo</italic>. We chose to use the C-terminal fragment for the EMSA assay to uncover more subtle binding differences which would otherwise be obscured by the strong MBD binding. The <italic>in vivo</italic> ChIP assay, which is more quantitative than IF, shows that, on the whole, R306C binds a little less than WT protein in spite of its intact MBD, consistent with our conclusion that the basic cluster contributes some binding. We have clarified the discussion of these data in the text.</p></body></sub-article></article>
