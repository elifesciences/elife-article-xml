These mechanisms, however, can themselves be destabilizing if activated inappropriately or excessively. For example, prolonged activity deprivation can lead to rebound hyperactivity and seizures. While many forms of homeostasis have been described, whether and how the magnitude of homeostatic plasticity is constrained remains unknown. Here, we uncover negative regulation of cortical network homeostasis by the PARbZIP family of transcription factors. In cortical slice cultures made from knockout mice lacking all three of these factors, the network response to prolonged activity withdrawal measured with calcium imaging is much stronger, while baseline activity is unchanged. Whole-cell recordings reveal an exaggerated increase in the frequency of miniature excitatory synaptic currents reflecting enhanced upregulation of recurrent excitatory synaptic transmission. Genetic analyses reveal that two of the factors, <italic>Hlf</italic> and <italic>Tef</italic>, are critical for constraining plasticity and for preventing life-threatening seizures. These data indicate that transcriptional activation is not only required for many forms of homeostatic plasticity but is also involved in restraint of the response to activity deprivation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The human brain is made up of billions of nerve cells called neurons which receive and send signals to one another. To avoid being over- or under-stimulated, neurons can adjust the strength of the inputs they receive by altering how connected they are to other nerve cells.</p><p>This process, known as homeostatic plasticity, is thought to be necessary for normal brain activity as it helps keep the outgoing signals of neurons relatively constant. However, homeostatic plasticity can lead to seizures if it becomes too strong and overcompensates for weak input signals. Regulating this process is therefore central to brain health, but scientists do not understand if or how it is controlled.</p><p>To address this, Valakh et al. analyzed the genes activated in neurons lacking incoming signals to find proteins that regulate homeostatic plasticity. This revealed a class of molecules called transcription factors (which switch genes on or off) that constrain the process. In brain samples from mice without these regulatory proteins, neurons received twice as much input, leading to an increase in brain activity resembling that observed during seizures. Valakh et al. confirmed this finding using live mice, which developed seizures in the absence of these transcription factors.</p><p>These findings suggest that this type of regulation to keep homeostatic plasticity from becoming too strong may be important. This could be especially vital as the brain develops, when the strength of connections between neurons changes rapidly. The discovery of the transcription factors involved provides a potential target for activating or restraining homeostatic plasticity. This control could help researchers better understand how the process stabilizes brain signaling.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>homeostatic plasticity</kwd><kwd>synapse</kwd><kwd>neocortex</kwd><kwd>mouse</kwd><kwd>neuron</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS109916</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nelson</surname><given-names>Sacha B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014370</institution-id><institution>Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>648651</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nelson</surname><given-names>Sacha B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>For the first time, the strength of homeostatic plasticity has been shown to be negatively regulated and the transcription factors responsible for this regulation have been identified.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neuronal networks are equipped with a set of homeostatic plasticity mechanisms that enable them to rebalance activity following perturbations during development, learning, or disease. Homeostatic plasticity can alter the intrinsic excitability of individual neurons, as well as the strength and number of both excitatory and inhibitory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Davis, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Turrigiano and Nelson, 2004</xref>). Synaptic changes can occur post- (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Turrigiano et al., 1998</xref>) or presynaptically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Delvendahl and MÃ¼ller, 2019</xref>) and may scale quantal amplitudes and alter the frequency of quantal events. These changes are homeostatic because they occur in the direction needed to rebalance the network after activity perturbation. Especially during development, homeostatic mechanisms are strong and can be maladaptive if they overshoot or are activated inappropriately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nelson and Valakh, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Despite recognition of the significance of homeostatic plasticity, whether and how its strength is normally constrained has remained unknown. Downregulation of the strength of homeostatic plasticity could potentially provide protection against inappropriate or excessive activation of these mechanisms. However, such negative regulators of homeostatic plasticity have not been previously described.</p><p>Here, we investigate the role of the proline and acidic amino acid-rich basic leucine zipper (PAR bZIP) family of transcription factors (TFs) in homeostatic plasticity. The family consists of hepatic leukemia factor (HLF), thyrotroph embryonic factor (TEF), and albumin D-site-binding protein (DBP) which are thought to act as transcriptional activators, as well as E4 Promoter-Binding Protein 4 (E4BP4, currently known as Nfil3) that acts as a transcriptional repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mitsui et al., 2001</xref>). All four family members share the same DNA binding motif. DBP is a circadian gene controlled by CLOCK and oscillates with circadian rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ripperger et al., 2000</xref>). Other family members are also controlled by CLOCK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2017</xref>). However, while these TFs typically have oscillatory behavior in peripheral tissue, they do not oscillate in the brain outside of the SCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gachon et al., 2004</xref>). Loss of HLF, TEF, and DBP has been associated with epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gachon et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hawkins and Kearney, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rambousek et al., 2020</xref>) suggesting they are important in regulating network activity.</p><p>In order to investigate the role that gene transcription plays in regulating the neuronal response to activity deprivation, we profiled changes in gene expression engaged during homeostatic plasticity and found that prolonged activity deprivation activates a robust transcriptional program involving the PARbZIP TF family members HLF and TEF. Both act to restrain the expression of homeostatic plasticity. While they have limited effects on network function at baseline, they strongly suppress the upregulation of homeostatic changes, mainly by regulating recurrent excitatory synaptic connections, although inhibition is also affected. Taken together, these results indicate that homeostatic plasticity is itself subject to activity-dependent regulation and is transcriptionally restrained by the PARbZIP TFs HLF and TEF.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PARbZIP transcripts increase during activity deprivation</title><p>Certain forms of homeostatic plasticity require transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goold and Nicoll, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ibata et al., 2008</xref>) and activity perturbation results in changes in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schaukowitch et al., 2017</xref>). We hypothesized that among the differentially expressed genes, some induce or regulate homeostatic changes. To identify novel genes involved in the homeostatic response to activity deprivation, we measured gene expression in excitatory and inhibitory neurons in organotypic slice cultures following a global decrease in activity. We cut coronal slices including neocortex at P7 and cultured them for 5 days. During this culture period, the neurons reform connections, and spontaneous bouts of activity, termed upstates, emerge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Johnson and Buonomano, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Koch et al., 2010</xref>). To broadly block activity, we applied the voltage-gated sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin, TTX (0.5 Î¼M), for 5 days during an early developmental period (equivalent postnatal days, EP, 12â17). This manipulation induces a robust homeostatic program and profoundly changes network dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Koch et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schaukowitch et al., 2017</xref>). To characterize the changes in gene expression, we sorted deep layer (L5 and L6) pyramidal and PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons and performed RNA sequencing to look for transcripts that change following prolonged silencing. Inactivity activates a robust transcriptional program of both positively and negatively affected genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) consistent with data from dissociated hippocampal cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schaukowitch et al., 2017</xref>). To identify transcriptional regulators of homeostatic plasticity, we looked for TFs upregulated in the TTX condition. TFs can be classified into families, and in some cases subfamilies, which share a DNA binding domain, and so are expected to bind the same target DNA sequences in the genome and therefore to regulate the same or similar target transcripts. We asked which families or subfamilies were most overrepresented among the TFs differentially expressed during activity blockade. The most overrepresented subfamily or family was the PARbZIP subfamily of TFs, a subtype of the CEBP-related family in the class of Basic leucine zipper factors (classification data from tfclass.bioinf.med.uni-goettingen.de; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wingender et al., 2015</xref>). This subfamily includes three transcriptional activators <italic>Hlf</italic>, <italic>Tef</italic>, and <italic>Dbp,</italic> and a transcriptional repressor, <italic>Nfil3</italic>. Expression levels of <italic>Dbp</italic> are much lower than those of <italic>Hlf</italic> and <italic>Tef</italic> (&lt;3 TPM in excitatory and PV<sup>+</sup> inhibitory neurons), suggesting that this family member may play a more limited role in the neocortex. Both <italic>Hlf</italic> and <italic>Tef</italic> are robustly upregulated after 5 days of activity deprivation in both excitatory (fold change [FC] TTX/control; FC = 2.6, 2.5; adjusted p value; p<sub>adj</sub> = 1.3eâ8, 3.8eâ4,) and inhibitory neurons (FC = 7.0, 2.1; p<sub>adj</sub> = 4.6eâ39, 2.0eâ3), while <italic>Nfil3</italic> and <italic>Dbp</italic> were not (FC = 0.51, 1.9; p<sub>adj</sub> = 0.49, 0.80, excitatory; FC = 1.2, 1.4; p<sub>adj</sub> = 0.84, 0.79 inhibitory).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>RNA-sequencing identifies transcripts affected by activity deprivation including the PARbZIP family of transcription factors.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Volcano plots of bulk RNA-seq from sorted fluorescently labeled pyramidal cells (left) and PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons (right).

On the other hand, loss of function of members of the PARbZIP family of TFs are also associated with epileptic phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hawkins and Kearney, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hawkins and Kearney, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rambousek et al., 2020</xref>). Specifically, triple knockout (TKO) <italic>Hlf<sup>â/â</sup>/Dbp</italic><sup>â/â</sup>/<italic>Tef<sup>â/</sup></italic><sup>â</sup> mice have epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gachon et al., 2004</xref>). One possibility that reconciles this apparent conflict is that instead of driving homeostatic plasticity, <italic>Hlf</italic> and <italic>Tef</italic> are upregulated in the TTX condition to restrain homeostatic responses. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the role that these TFs play in homeostatic plasticity. We induced homeostatic upregulation of network function by 2-day TTX application in organotypic slice cultures and measured network activity after TTX removal.</p><p>As a read-out of network activity, we measured changes in intracellular calcium using virally delivered GCaMP6f in primary somatosensory cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In untreated slices at baseline, the neurons display population activity organized into complex, infrequent upstates which are similar to those observed in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sanchez-Vives and McCormick, 2000</xref>). To quantify network activity, we measured the frequency of Ca<sup>2+</sup> peaks in each recording and the synchrony of calcium transients across cells (see Methods for detailed description of quantitative analysis). After 2 days of TTX treatment, the frequency of the upstates increases. While 2 days of TTX incubation increases the peak frequency 3.6-fold in wild-type (WT) slices (from 0.06 Â± 0.01 to 0.22 Â± 0.04 Hz), the same silencing duration produces a nearly sixfold increase in the TKO slices (from 0.09 Â± 0.02 to 0.5 Â± 0.05 Hz; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). A two-way ANOVA revealed significant effects of treatment (TTX vs. Control; p&lt;0.0001) and genotype (p&lt;0.0001) and a significant interaction between the two (p&lt;0.0001). Post hoc t tests (with Tukey correction for multiple comparisons) revealed that TTX increases in activity were highly significant in both WT (p=0.0007) and TKO (p&lt;0.0001) slices and that TTX produced a significantly stronger increase in the TKO (p&lt;0.0001), while the baseline activity of cells from slices derived from the TKO and WT do not differ significantly (p=0.92). Consistent with this, normalizing the TTX response to the control response revealed a larger relative increase in TKO than WT cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). The TTX condition also increased synchrony (from 0.76 Â± 0.03 to 0.95 Â± 0.01) in WT, and in the TKO (from 0.74 Â± 0.03 to 0.94 Â± 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). While the TTX effects were highly significant (two-way ANOVA; p&lt;0.0001), there was no significant effect of genotype (p=0.43) and no interaction between treatment and genotype (p=0.65), presumably reflecting the fact that synchrony is already saturated by TTX treatment in the WT and cannot further increase in the TKO, but also indicating that baseline synchrony is not altered in the TKO. A power test revealed that with the effect size and variances observed, 95 slice cultures in each group would be needed to detect a significant difference between WT and TKO peak frequency, while for the synchrony measure, the required N would be 1609. These data suggest that the PARbZIP family of TFs normally functions to restrain homeostatic plasticity, and in their absence, the homeostatic response is exaggerated. Moreover, even though the mutation is associated with epilepsy, it does not make cortical neuronal circuits more excitable at baseline.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Calcium imaging reveals exaggerated response to activity deprivation in <italic>Hlf<sup>â/â</sup>/Dbp</italic><sup>â/â</sup>/<italic>Tef<sup>â/</sup></italic><sup>â</sup> triple knockout (TKO) slices.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>).

Reversal involves a homeostatic reduction of abnormally elevated activity. Even when this involves symmetric opposing changes in the same biophysical parameters altered in the response to activity deprivation (such as with downscaling and upscaling of excitatory quantal amplitudes), the mechanisms involved typically differ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stellwagen and Malenka, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sun and Turrigiano, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, changes in activity following rebound from deprivation could reflect either a change in the vigor of the circuitâs attempt to restore activity (i.e., enhanced homeostatic plasticity) or a persistent change in the setpoint to which activity is returned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Styr et al., 2019</xref>), or both. To test whether the transcriptional restraint of homeostasis is required for bidirectional flexibility and to assess whether the setpoint had changed, we asked whether the network is able to return back to baseline activity levels when the activity blockade is removed. We measured network activity immediately after the end of silencing with TTX as well as following two days of recovery in TTX-free media. In WT slices, activity deprivation causes hyperactivity, evident from a twofold rise in the peak frequency of the calcium activity. However, this exuberant activity is restored back to baseline levels within 2 days following restoration of action potential firing. In the TKO slices, even though the initial response to TTX is exaggerated, the network is also able to return to baseline levels following 2 days of recovery, to levels indistinguishable from WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>). These data suggest that the recovery from a high activity state is not diminished in the TKO and suggest that the mutation in fact produces exaggerated homeostatic plasticity rather than a change in activity setpoint.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Frequency, but not amplitude, of mEPSCs is disproportionately upregulated by deprivation in TKO slices</title><p>Network activity is unaltered in the mutant at baseline but the response to activity deprivation is exaggerated. To learn more about the mechanism by which <italic>Hlf</italic> and <italic>Tef</italic> restrain homeostatic plasticity, we probed the effects of TTX on excitatory synaptic transmission. Because of the high levels of spontaneous network activity, it was not feasible to study unitary action potential evoked transmission. Instead, to broadly assay the properties of excitatory synapses, we measured pharmacologically isolated AMPA-receptor driven miniature EPSCs in control and TTX-treated slices. We observed a robust upregulation of mEPSC amplitude following 2 days of activity deprivation, consistent with our understanding of homeostatic synaptic scaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Turrigiano et al., 1998</xref>). We also observed a large increase in mEPSC frequency, which has also been described in this preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Koch et al., 2010</xref>) and in multiple other preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wierenga et al., 2006</xref>).

In WT cultures, measurement of inhibitory input onto L5 pyramidal neurons revealed that both the amplitude and frequency of mIPSCs drop in response to activity deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). When we measured mIPSCs in pyramidal neurons from TKO slices, we saw a similar decrease in frequency following 48 hr TTX treatment, although the amplitude of the change was smaller than in the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). In contrast, the mIPSC amplitude change is abolished: mIPSC amplitude is decreased at baseline compared to WT but did not show a further decrease after TTX treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>). However, the decreased amplitude in the untreated condition does not correlate with the unchanged baseline network activity levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), suggesting that the decrease of mIPSCs amplitude at baseline may be insufficient on its own to cause network hyperexcitability. Thus, both the amplitude and frequency of mIPSCs received by pyramidal neurons after activity deprivation are indistinguishable from the WT in the TKO slices, suggesting that homeostatic plasticity of mIPSCs is not directly driving the changes in the network activity following TTX treatment. We cannot rule out the possibility that although baseline activity is normal, the baseline reduction in mIPSC amplitude contributes to subsequent network plasticity indirectly, by contributing to induction of the changes in EPSCs observed, or by inducing some form of compensation other than the physiological parameters measured.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Inhibitory synaptic currents are not affected by the <italic>Hlf<sup>â/â</sup>/Dbp</italic><sup>â/â</sup>/<italic>Tef<sup>â/</sup></italic><sup>â</sup> mutation in the TTX condition.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative traces of mIPSC recordings from WT control (black), WT TTX-treated (red), TKO control (gray), and TKO TTX-treated (blue) slices.

was that which depended only on the sum of the number of <italic>Hlf</italic> and <italic>Tef</italic> alleles (line 6), we used this model for further post hoc (Tukey) tests to determine the effect of different numbers of alleles on the TTX response. The results of this analysis are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. The most significant differences were between TKO slices (0 alleles; n = 32, mean = 0.48) and the other genotypes tested (1 allele, n = 16, mean = 0.32; 2 alleles, n = 26, mean = 0.35; and 4 alleles, n = 24, mean = 0.23; p &lt; 0.0001â0.0014). Most of the other comparisons were not significant, with the exception of the difference between WT responses and those for animals with only two alleles (p = 0.011). This indicates that most of the difference between TKO (0 alleles of <italic>Hlf</italic> + <italic>Tef</italic>) and WT (4 alleles of <italic>Hlf</italic> + <italic>Tef</italic>) could be restored by a single allele, although there was a small but significant improvement between two and four alleles. The fact that this difference was significant, but the differences between 1 and 2 alleles, and 1 and 4 alleles were not, may reflect a real difference between these groups, or may reflect the imbalanced numbers of animals in each group. The group with two alleles included animals that were WT for <italic>Hlf</italic> but lacked <italic>Tef</italic> (N = 8), animals that were WT for <italic>Tef</italic> and lacked <italic>Hlf</italic> (N = 9), and trans-Het animals that were heterozygous for both <italic>Hlf</italic> and <italic>Tef</italic> (N = 7). A separate analysis of variance of these three subgroups revealed that the means (0.32, 0.41, and 0.33) were not significantly different (p = 0.28), consistent with the hypothesis that alleles of <italic>Hlf</italic> and <italic>Tef</italic> can substitute for one another in their ability to regulate the homeostatic response to activity deprivation.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Presence of one allele of <italic>Hlf</italic> or <italic>Tef</italic> largely restores the WT response to activity deprivation.</title><p>Violin plots show the distribution of peak frequencies measured from TTX-treated (upper, darker colors, filled symbols) and control (lower, lighter colors, open symbols) slice cultures made from animals carrying 0, 1, 2, or 4 alleles of the PARbZIP TFs <italic>Hlf</italic> and <italic>Tef</italic>.

TKO animals develop spontaneous seizures and have a dramatically decreased lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gachon et al., 2004</xref>). While our objective was not to make a detailed study of the seizure phenotype, we also observed, on multiple occasions, TKO animals that experienced spontaneous seizures, even though for most of cases, the instance of death was not directly observed. However, just one allele of either <italic>Hlf</italic> or <italic>Tef</italic> restores the lifespan of the animals to levels not statistically different from WT. Mice with one <italic>Dbp</italic> allele have improved survival compared to TKO animals but still die at a statistically significant higher rate than WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). These results differ from the cortical network activity response to activity deprivation in organotypic slices where the presence of <italic>Dbp</italic> had no effect on the constraint of homeostatic plasticity. This suggests that even though <italic>Dbp</italic> is dispensable for restraining homeostatic plasticity in the cortex, it may play a role in preventing premature death by functioning elsewhere in the brain or peripheral tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stewart et al., 2020</xref>) since these TFs are expressed and play important roles there (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wahlestedt et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2010</xref>).

Although some molecular pathways that are required for the induction of homeostatic plasticity have been identified, whether and how homeostatic plasticity is negatively regulated is unknown. Here, we show that reduced activity, which initiates a compensatory increase in network excitability, also activates a set of TFs that function to restrain homeostasis. Thus, we propose a model in which homeostatic plasticity is negatively regulated through the PARbZIP family of TFs.</p><p>Excitatory neurons respond to a global drop in network activity by upregulating the frequency and amplitude of excitatory synaptic currents, decreasing inhibitory currents, and increasing intrinsic excitability. These changes correlate with dramatically increased network activity immediately following removal of activity blockade that âovershootsâ initial activity levels. Synaptic scaling of excitatory synapses has previously been shown to depend on intact transcription and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DÃ¶rrbaum et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goold and Nicoll, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ibata et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">SchanzenbÃ¤cher et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we demonstrate a second role for transcription in regulating the strength of the network homeostatic response. Loss of <italic>Hlf</italic>, <italic>Tef</italic>, and <italic>Dbp</italic> results in exaggerated homeostatic changes. However, the levels of network activity at baseline are unchanged. This suggests that these TFs are activated to restrain homeostatic signaling rather than downregulating network dynamics directly. While a few other genes have been described that have limited effects on network dynamics, but are required for homeostatic plasticity (Shank3, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tatavarty et al., 2020</xref>; FMRP, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Soden and Chen, 2010</xref>; and Caspr2, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fernandes et al., 2019</xref>), this is, to our knowledge, the first negative regulator of homeostasis to be described.</p><p>Present data implicate mEPSC frequency, but not amplitude, as the site of the restraint of homeostatic plasticity. Although 2 days of activity blockade in dissociated cortical cultures were initially found to produce scaling up of EPSC amplitudes without accompanying changes in mEPSC frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Turrigiano et al., 1998</xref>), multiple subsequent studies have found evidence for changes in both amplitude and frequency as found here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Echegoyen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Koch et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Thiagarajan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wierenga et al., 2006</xref>). Changes in mini frequency are typically interpreted as reflecting increased presynaptic release, either via increases in the numbers of synapses or active release sites, or via changes in the rate at which spontaneous, action potential independent release occurs at each site. Although the increase observed in mEPSC frequency (1.7-fold greater in TKO than WT), was lower than the relative increase in activity levels, measured from the frequency of calcium transients (2.5-fold greater in TKO than WT at 5 days), these two measures need not be linearly related. First, mini frequency can be distinct from action potential evoked release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Crawford et al., 2017</xref>), and second, in a highly recurrent network, the relationship between firing and synaptic strength can be nonlinear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Toyoizumi and Abbott, 2011</xref>). We cannot eliminate the contribution of inhibitory neurons as a contributing factor to homeostatic plasticity restraint, since <italic>Hlf</italic> and <italic>Tef</italic> are expressed in this neuronal type and are also upregulated by inactivity. Interneuron function may also be regulated by <italic>Hlf</italic> and <italic>Tef</italic> and this role may predispose the network to seizures. Dissecting the contribution of different cell types during different developmental windows will require generation of a conditional knockout and selective cell-type-specific disruption of individual TFs at different times in development.</p><p>mIPSCs received by excitatory neurons cannot explain the exaggerated network hyperexcitability caused by TTX incubation in TKO slices since neither the amplitude nor frequency of mIPSCs is different in the TTX condition. We note, however, that the amplitude of mIPSCs is decreased at baseline in the untreated cultures. Such decrease of the strength of inhibitory currents is insufficient on its own to induce network excitability, since baseline network activity was unchanged in the TKO, but it may make the network more vulnerable to future insults.</p><p>It is tempting to imagine a direct relationship between the exaggerated homeostatic plasticity in TKO cortical slices and the increased seizures and spontaneous death of TKO animals. The lack of constraint of homeostatic response can potentially explain, at least in part, the seizure phenotype in animals lacking all three TFs. However, partial genetic compensation of DBP for the survival phenotype but not the homeostatic plasticity phenotype as assayed by calcium imaging, suggests that the propensity to develop seizures and diminished survival have a more complex origin involving other brain regions and perhaps other organs of the body.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gachon et al., 2004</xref> first reported that deletion of the PARbZIP proteins TEF, HLF, and DBP caused spontaneous and audiogenic seizures. They suggested that this may reflect effects on neurotransmitter metabolism caused by a reduction in pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) since pyridoxal kinase, which catalyzes the last step in the conversion of vitamin B6 into PLP is a target of the PARbZIP proteins. PLP is a required cofactor for decarboxylases and other enzymes involved in the synthesis and metabolism of GABA, glutamate, and the biogenic amine neurotransmitters including dopamine, serotonin, and histamine. Using HPLC, they found no changes in GABA or glutamate, but reduced levels of dopamine, serotonin, and histamine in the knockout animals. Although changes in amine transmitters could potentially contribute to phenotypes in vivo, they are unlikely to contribute to plasticity in cortical slice cultures which do not include the brainstem nuclei from which these projections arise. Reduced glutamate decarboxylase action could potentially have contributed to the observed baseline reduction in mIPSCs since heterozygous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lazarus et al., 2015</xref>) and homozygous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lau and Murthy, 2012</xref>) mutants of Gad1, the gene encoding the GAD67 isoform of glutamic acid decarboxylase, have reduced mIPSC amplitudes. However, this does not account for the enhanced homeostatic overshoot following activity blockade, since in the TKO animals, activity blockade did not produce any further reduction in inhibition, but produced robust changes at excitatory synapses.</p><p>HLF and TEF form homo- or heterodimers and recognize similar DNA sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gachon, 2007</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that these TFs can powerfully compensate for the loss of other family members. We varied genotype for all three PARbZip factors and used multiple regression models to show that the peak frequency of calcium transients depends roughly equally on <italic>Hlf</italic> and <italic>Tef</italic> but does not appear to depend on <italic>Dbp</italic>. It also appears that a single allele of either <italic>Hlf</italic> or <italic>Tef</italic> in the complete absence of the other factors is sufficient to preserve the normal restraint of homeostatic plasticity, producing a response to activity deprivation that is not significantly different from WT. However, given the large number of genotypes to be tested, the limited number of animals tested may have led us to miss subtle difference that varies with the number of additional alleles, since activity in the presence of two alleles was significantly different (albeit with a low effect size) from that in WT. We also found, in agreement with prior findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gachon et al., 2004</xref>), that <italic>Tef</italic> and <italic>Hlf</italic> can robustly compensate for loss of each other and completely restore life span. Such robust compensation and functional redundancy of these TFs highlight their importance and may explain why they have not been identified in GWAS studies as risk factors for epilepsy or other neuropsychiatric diseases.</p><p>The mechanisms linking activity deprivation to <italic>Tef</italic> and <italic>Hlf</italic> activation were not directly addressed in this work, but seem likely to depend on reduced calcium influx. Prior studies have suggested alternately that scaling up of mEPSC amplitudes depends upon calcium influx through either T-type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schaukowitch et al., 2017</xref>) or L-type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2020</xref>) calcium channels. The former pathway has also been found to depend on the activity-dependent TFs ELK1 and SRF. Activation of the constraining TFs <italic>Tef</italic> and <italic>Hlf</italic> could be secondary or delayed responses dependent on changes in the transcription and translation of other activity-dependent TFs, or may represent a primary response to activity deprivation, analogous to, but in the opposite direction of the well-studied immediate early genes such as <italic>Fos</italic>, <italic>Arc</italic>, and others.</p><p>Besides their function in early embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gavriouchkina et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wahlestedt et al., 2017</xref>), the PARbZip TFs have been extensively studied for their roles in circadian rhythms in flies, zebrafish, and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cyran et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vatine et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Weger et al., 2021</xref>). The present finding that <italic>Hlf</italic> and <italic>Tef</italic> also act to restrain homeostatic plasticity is consistent with a recent report demonstrating that PARbZIP TFs are differentially expressed in human epileptogenic tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rambousek et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, CLOCK, an upstream regulator of these TFs, is necessary in cortical excitatory neurons for maintaining normal network activity and leads to epilepsy when conditionally deleted in these neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2017</xref>). Multiple components of the molecular clock are robustly expressed in the neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bering et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gachon et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kobayashi et al., 2015</xref>), consistent with the idea that they might have an additional function in the cortex that is distinct from their circadian role in SCN. However, the role of core clock genes in homeostatic plasticity has not yet been explored. In this work, we expand the role of the PARbZIP family of TFs to include the negative regulation of homeostatic plasticity.</p><p>Why should homeostatic plasticity be subject to such dual âpush/pullâ regulation? Perhaps because the changes in drive and excitability which must be buffered vary so widely during development. During the first few weeks of postnatal development in rodents, cortical neurons go from receiving few synapses to receiving thousands. This may require developmental downregulation of the strength of homeostatic plasticity. Neuropsychiatric diseases, such as monogenic causes of ASD, can trigger homeostatic changes in circuit properties which restore overall firing rates, but nonetheless have maladaptive effects on cortical function and flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antoine et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nelson and Valakh, 2015</xref>). Conversely, loss of function of genes giving rise to developmental disorders can cause failures of homeostatic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blackman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">GenÃ§ et al., 2020</xref>). Our findings provide a potential target for enhancing homeostatic plasticity in contexts where it is insufficient, or for downregulating it when it is maladaptive, and therefore provide an avenue for identifying how the positive and negative regulators of homeostasis interact to stabilize network activity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

TKO mice were housed on a 12/12 light/dark cycle in a dedicated, climate-controlled facility. Cages were enriched with huts, chew sticks, and tubes. Food and water were available ad libitum, and animals were housed in groups of 2â4 after weaning at p21. Mice of both sexes were used for experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Organotypic slice culture</title><p>Organotypic slices were dissected from P6 to P8 pups. Animals were anesthetized with a ketamine (20 mg/mL), xylazine (2.5 mg/mL), and acepromazine (0.5 mg/mL) mixture (40 Î¼L, via intraperitoneal injection), the brain was extracted, embedded in 2% agarose, and coronal slices containing primary somatosensory cortex were cut on a compresstome (Precisionary Instruments, Greenville, NC) to 300 Î¼m in ice-chilled ACSF (126 mM NaCl, 25 mM NaHCO3, 3 mM KCl, 1 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 25 mM dextrose, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 315â319 mOsm) with a ceramic blade and placed directly onto six-well Millipore Millicell cell culture inserts (Millipore Sigma PICM0RG50, Burlington, MA) over 1 mL warmed neuronal media (1Ã MEM (Millipore-Sigma), 1Ã GLUTAMAX (Gibco Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 12.9 mM dextrose, 0.08% ascorbic acid, 18 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 35 mM 1 M HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 Âµg/mL insulin and 20% Horse Serum (heat inactivated, Millipore Sigma, Burlington, MA), pH 7.45 and 305 mOsm).

The slices were then grown at 35Â°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Media were changed every other day to 1 mL of fresh media. For TTX treatment, media containing 500 nM TTX was added during the media change at EP 12. For TTX washout experiments, two additional media changes with TTX-free media were performed 5 min apart.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>RNA-sequencing</title><sec id="s4-3-1"><title>Cell sorting</title><p>Slice cultures were converted into a single-cell suspension as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sugino et al., 2006</xref>), with some modifications. Organotypic slice cultures (n = 3 from three separate animals per condition) were placed in ice-cold, oxygenated ACSF with 1% FBS, and 5% Trehalose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Saxena et al., 2012</xref>), that had been 0.4 Î¼m filtered, containing blockers (APV, DNQX, and TTX) to prevent excitotoxicity, and gently removed from the membrane. The cortex was micro-dissected under a Leica MZ 16F fluorescent microscope and the tissue was placed in an oxygenated room temperature bath for 45 min, supplemented with 1 mg/mL type XIV protease (Sigma-Aldrich). Afterward, the tissue was moved back to the ACSF solution (without protease) and triturated with fire-polished Pasteur pipettes of successfully smaller diameters (~600, 300, and 150 Î¼m). Samples were then sorted with a BD FACSAria Flow Cytometer. All isolated material for mRNA sequencing was harvested using the picopure RNA isolation kit (Life Technologies) and subjected to an one column DNAase digestion. mRNA libraries were prepared as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">OâToole et al., 2017</xref>): amplifying with the Ovation RNA-seq system (Nugen), sonicating with a Covaris S 220 Shearing Device, constructing the libraries with the Ovation Rapid DR multiplex System (Nugen), and quantifying library concentration using the Illumina library quantification kit (KAPA biosystems). Samples were sequenced on either the Illumina Nextseq or Hiseq machines to a depth of ~25 million reads. Illumina sequencing adapters were trimmed from reads using cutadapt followed by mapping to the mm10 genome with STAR using the ENCODE Long RNA-Seq pipelineâs parameters. Reads mapping to exons of known genes were quantified using featureCounts in the <italic>Rsubread</italic> package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liao et al., 2019</xref>) and differential expression analysis was conducted using DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Love et al., 2014</xref>). One of the three Emx1-cre TTX replicates was severely contaminated (high levels of nonneuronal genes and low enrichment of neuronal genes) and was excluded.

Slices were transferred to a thermo-regulated recording chamber and continuously perfused with oxygenated ACSF. Neurons were visualized on an Olympus upright epifluorescence microscope with 10Ã air and 40Ã water immersion objectives. Visually guided whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were made using near-infrared differential interference contrast microscopy. Recording pipettes of 3â5 MÎ© resistance contained internal solution with the following concentrations. For excitatory currents and intrinsic excitability: (in mM) 20 KCl, 100 K-gluconate, 10 HEPES, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP, 10 Na-phosphocreatine, and 0.1% biocytin. For inhibitory currents: (in mM) 120 KCl, 10 HEPES, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP, 10 Na-phosphocreatine, and 0.1% biocytin. Recordings were collected using an AxoPatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), filtered at 10 kHz and were not corrected for liquid junction potentials. Data were collected on a Dell computer using custom software running on Igor Pro (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR).</p><sec id="s4-5-1"><title>Intrinsic excitability</title><p>Cells were selected at random from layer 5 in primary somatosensory cortex. Whole-cell recordings were performed with a K-Gluconate-based internal recording solution. Synaptic currents were blocked by adding picrotoxin (PTX) at 25 Î¼M, 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX) 25 Î¼M, and (2R)-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV) at 35 Î¼M to standard ACSF to block Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA), Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA), and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, respectively. Cells were held at â65 mV by injecting a small current. 500 ms current injections ranging from â25 to 275 pA in 25 pA steps increments at random intensity were delivered every 10 s. Adaptation ratio was calculated using custom-written IGOR script as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hattox and Nelson, 2007</xref>). Briefly, we calculated the ratio between the third and last inter-spike interval at two times the threshold current.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-2"><title>Synaptic currents</title><p>To isolated miniature excitatory AMPA-mediated currents 25 ÂµM PTX, 35 ÂµM APV, and 500 nM TTX were added to the extracellular recording solution. To isolate inhibitory currents, 20 ÂµM DNQX, 35 ÂµM APV, and 500 nM TTX were added to the extracellular solution. The slices were incubated in TTX only during active recording, which lasted no more than 30 min for each slice. Cells were clamped at â65 mV with a series resistance of below 20 Mâ¦ with no compensation for the liquid junction potential. Ten 10-s traces were acquired for each cell. Threshold-based detection of mPSCs and action potentials was implemented using custom-written IGOR scripts equipped with routines for baseline subtraction, custom filtering, and measurements of intervals, amplitudes, and kinetic properties.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Calcium imaging</title><p>To visualize calcium dynamics, 24 hr after slice preparation, 1 ÂµL of pAAV.Syn.GCaMP6f.WPRE.SV40 (AAV9 capsid serotype, Addgene 100837) was applied to the somatosensory cortex in each hemisphere. At day EP14, slices were cut out along with the membrane and placed into the perfusion chamber mounted on a spinning disc microscope (Leica DMI 6000B; Leica Microsystems, Inc, Buffalo Grove, IL), with an Andor CSU W1 spinning disc unit, using an Andor Neo sCMOS cameras and Andor IQ3 to run the system (Andor Technology PLC, Belfast, N. Ireland). Slices were allowed to acclimate while being perfused with 33Â°C oxygenated ACSF with no TTX for 10 min. Slices were imaged with a 10Ã objective centered over the primary somatosensory area. For each slice, 10 min of imaging from a 500-Âµm square per slice were acquired at 33 frames per second.</p><sec id="s4-6-1"><title>Calcium imaging analysis</title><p>Cellular somatic ROIs were selected by hand from background using custom MATLAB code (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://github.com/VH-Lab/vhlab-TwoPhoton-matlab">http://github.com/VH-Lab/vhlab-TwoPhoton-matlab</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Van Hooser, 2023</xref>) based on a standard deviation projection of the video (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, bottom panel). Cells were only considered viable if they: were of a characteristic size and shape for neurons; were bright enough to be clearly distinguished from background; were in focus with clear and sharp edges; and had several bouts of firing within the first minute. Active cells (n = 10â100) were selected by the experimenter within our area of imaging. We confirmed by subsampling cells in a subset of WT control experiments with more cells (n = 7 slices with 27â43 cells) that for the lowest sample of cells measured (n = 10), the estimates of peak frequency and synchrony had a coefficient of variation of the mean (SEM/mean calculated across sub-samples within a slice) of 0.05 and 0.01. From these ROIs, mean intensity per cell at each frame was computed. The raw intensity values were transformed to ÎF/F by diving by baseline values obtained either where the coefficient of variation within 50 frames was below 0.3 ÎF/F units/frame, or from the 5th percentile of all frames. Since the distribution of event amplitudes across cells was potentially dependent on other experimental factors such as the amount of calcium indicator expressed as well as optical factors such as the depth of the cell in the slice, we decided not to try to infer the magnitude of firing from the amplitude of events, but only periods of elevated firing from the timing of events. To produce a peak frequency measure, noise was reduced by fitting the ÎF/F data with a smoothing spline, and active periods were defined as those with a slope above 0.30 ÎF/F units/frame that were within 30 frames of other frames with positive slope. The number of active periods reflected the number of times each cell was active, though this measure had no ability to predict the number of action potentials that made up each firing period. We excluded cells that failed to fire at any time during our period of recording. In addition, some of our slices exhibited some dimming of signal due to a combination of drift in the Z-dimension and fluorescent photobleaching. Experiments were discarded if this decrement caused firing peaks to fall and remain below the slope threshold in the selected cells. Synchrony was defined as the cross-correlation at delta T = 0 during upstates computed for all pairs of recorded cells and averaged across cells and across upstates.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Reviewing editor, <italic>eLife</italic></p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Software, Formal analysis, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Visualization, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Brandeis University (Protocol #20002), and conformed to the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-74899-mdarchecklist1-v2.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files, calcium imaging analysis code is available <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/VH-Lab/vhlab-TwoPhoton-matlab">https://github.com/VH-Lab/vhlab-TwoPhoton-matlab</ext-link> (copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Van Hooser, 2023</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Yukiko Goda as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviewers acknowledge that the study provides novel insights into a long-standing question about the mechanisms that constrain homeostatic synaptic plasticity, and the findings are exciting and of broad interest. However, a couple of major concerns have been raised regarding (a) the interpretation of calcium imaging data and (b) data quantification, effect sizes and statistics in a number of experiments.</p><p>(a) The main conclusion that PAR bZIP transcription factors constrain the network activity via regulating excitatory synapses should be further strengthened by addressing the following two points:</p><p>(i) Ruling out the contribution of changes in inhibitory synaptic transmission in TKO neurons. If the authors cannot rule out the contribution, then calcium imaging experiments should be conducted also in excitatory or inhibitory neurons to clarify the relative contributions.</p><p>(ii) In addition, calcium imaging, as the key physiology data, should be performed in WT and TKO cultures for two time points: after 2 days in TTX and after 5 days in TTX. Monitoring the kinetics will help in better relating the physiology data to the RNA-seq data and to clarify whether TKO cultures overshoots or if they show a faster compensation.</p><p>(b) The authors should fully address the concerns regarding data quantification and statistics that are raised by Reviewers 2 and 3.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The initial RNA seq analysis in Figure 1A,B compares control vs. TTX in L5-6 pyramidal and PV+ neurons. How well does the observation of strong upregulation of HFL and TEF extend to pyramidal and PV+ cells for a 2-day TTX treatment that is used for much of the later experiments? Notably, calcium imaging based on synapsin promoter-driven GCaMP6f expression does not specify cortical layers being targeted nor discriminate between excitatory and inhibitory neurons.</p><p>2. Figure 2. It would be informative to monitor calcium dynamics in a cell-type specific manner to decipher the differences in homeostatic response between WT and mutant neurons.</p><p>3. Line 266-269. It seems premature to conclude that homeostatic plasticity of mIPSCs is not driving the TTX-dependent change in network activity based on the fact that the levels of mIPSC amplitude and frequency are indistinguishable between WT and mutant after TTX treatment. In particular, the striking reduction in mIPSC amplitude in the baseline in the mutant prep indicates that already some form of compensation for altered mIPSCs has taken place to keep the network activity level comparable between WT and mutant prior to TTX treatment. In addition, the observed lack of a further change in mIPSCs could be due to saturation of mIPSC-dependent mechanisms.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have concerns, mainly revolving around statistics and effect sizes:</p><p>1. Based on the RNA seq data shown in figure 1, it is unclear why the authors focused their analyses on Hlf, Tef and Dbp, because the data suggest more pronounced regulation of other genes. The authors should explain why these candidates were chosen for further analysis in the Results section.</p><p>2. One of the central findings of this study is that Hlf-/-/Dbp-/-/Tef-/- triple knockout (TKO) slice cultures display a more pronounced increase in calcium peak frequency upon TTX treatment compared to WT controls. In the Results section, it is mentioned that TTX treatment induces a two-fold increase in calcium peak frequency in WT, and a four-fold increase in TKO cultures (l. 142, 143). However, based on the mean data plotted in figure 2D, the increase in WT is around 3-4-fold (15 peaks x s^-1/4 peaks x s^-1=3.5), whereas the one in TKO is around four-fold (30/7.5=4). Could the authors comment on the discrepancy between the text and the data? Furthermore, it is key to test for an interaction between treatment and genotype to support this major conclusion by statistics. Additionally, it would be helpful to plot the relative increase in calcium peak frequency upon TTX treatment in WT and TKO.</p><p>3. On a similar note, although not statistically significant, the mean calcium peak frequency in TKO cultures is around two-fold higher than WT under baseline conditions (Figure 2D). A similar trend can be seen in the data shown in figure 6A (top panel), whereas the baseline calcium peak frequency is similar between TKO and controls in the experiment shown in Figure 2B. Based on the scatter of the data, can the authors exclude that baseline calcium peak frequency is increased in TKO cultures? I suggest running a power analysis for these data to verify if the sample sizes are sufficient to support their conclusions. Otherwise, sample sizes would have to be increased, or the conclusions should be revised/toned down. Alternatively, could additional parameters, such as inter-burst interval, be read out to support the conclusions that baseline network excitability is unchanged in TKO cultures, and that TTX application leads to a more pronounced increase in calcium peak frequency? Another possibility may be to pool the data of the different experiments?</p><p>4. Based on the data shown in figure 6, they conclude that one copy of Tef is sufficient to constrain homeostatic plasticity. Can they rule out that one copy of Hlf is sufficient as well? This would actually fit to the result that one copy of Tef or Hlf rescues lifespan in TKO. The peak frequencies of DKO;Tef +/- and DKO;Hlf +/- after TTX treatment actually look quite similar. Are these two groups statistically different from one another? Only comparing the absolute DKO;Tef +/- or DKO;Hlf +/- data to WT is not very informative. Again, I suggest normalizing the data of each genotype to the respective control, and to test for interactions between treatment and genotype.</p><p>5. Sample sizes (culture number/ if applicable, neuron number) should be clearly specified for each experiment. Are some data sets only based on two cultures (e.g. Figure 6 ctrl.)? Again, a power analysis may be helpful to determine sample sizes.</p><p>6. The major (recorded) effect underlying the increase in network excitability is an increase in mEPSC frequency. Does this indicate that the mechanisms that constrain homeostatic plasticity mainly work on presynaptic mechanisms, or an increase in synapse number? These possibilities should be also discussed.</p><p>7. TTX application increases mEPSC frequency by around two-fold and does not affect other recorded parameters, such as excitability. How could a two-fold increase in mEPSC frequency translate into a four-fold increase in calcium peak frequency? Is there any evidence for a supralinear increase in network activity with regard to miniature frequency? This issue should be discussed.</p><p>8. What is the evidence for 'exaggerated' homeostatic plasticity in TKO cultures? Can they rule out that TKO neurons compensate better? This possibility should be discussed unless they can exclude the possibility that TKO cultures indeed do not retarget set-point activity.</p><p>Other comments:</p><p>1. It would be very helpful if the abstract could contain more specific information (e.g. experimental system, what kind of homeostatic plasticity was studied, some specific results etc.)</p><p>2. The more pronounced increase in mEPSC frequency upon TTX treatment in TKO cultures compared to WT (Figure 3B) appears more robust than the corresponding changes in calcium peak frequency (Figure 2). However, they should also test for an interaction between treatment and genotype to support their conclusion by statistics for the data shown in figure 3B, C.</p><p>3. Similarly, although not statistically significant, the decrease in mIPSC frequency upon TTX treatment seems less pronounced in TKO cultures (Figure 4B, C). Could they run a power analysis and test for treatment-group interaction as well?</p><p>4. mIPSC amplitudes are decreased in TKO cultures, and there is no further decrease upon TTX application (Figure 4D, E). First, the decrease in baseline mIPSC amplitude in TKO is interesting, and may represent a homeostatic response that counteracts a potential increase in excitability/ calcium peak frequency under baseline conditions (Figure 2D, major point 3). This possibility should be discussed in addition to previous work indicating reduced glutamate decarboxylase function in PLP KOs. Second, could the lack of a decrease in mIPSC amplitude after TTX in TKO neurons also oppose increased network excitability? This possibility should be also discussed.</p><p>5. TTX treatment results in a rapid regulation of Hlf and Tef mRNA on the hour time scale (Figure 1C). The mEPSC/IPSC recordings were carried out in the presence of TTX. It is thus crucial to mention the time window during which WT recordings were conducted with regard to the beginning of TTX incubation to assess whether Hlf or Tef transcripts could be increased in the control group.</p><p>6. I suggest using the SI unit Hz instead of peaks/minute for the calcium imaging data.</p><p>7. The figure labels &quot;mutant&quot; could be more specific (e.g., Hlf,Dbp,Tef TKO).</p><p>8. Some figures are not referenced in the text.</p><p>9. It should be briefly described how miniature PSCs and APs were analyzed (e.g. template matching, threshold, or the likesâ¦).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have a few suggestions for the authors that may strengthen the manuscript:</p><p>1. Quantification of the network activity homeostasis (Figure 2 and its supplemental figure): The authors provided quantification of frequency of Ca events (probably associated with spike bursts). It is unclear why the amplitude was not taken into account. Mean firing rate should be better reflected by frequency x amplitude calculation.</p><p>2. What is the mechanism that links spike silencing to activation of PAR-bZIP TFs by inactivity? Is it mediated by the previously described mechanisms related to T-type Ca channels (Schaukowitch et al. Cell Reports 2017) or L-type Ca channels and CaMK4 (Li et al. Cell 2020)? This should be at least discussed.</p><p>3. I am not sure I agree with the interpretation of mIPSC results. The results show that both frequency and amplitude homeostatic down-regulation are disabled by TF deletion. This, in my view, may be a possible compensation to prevent a further increase in the E/I ratio (meaning that without it epilepsy would be even more severe).</p><p>Statistics: I could not find cell numbers (n) in the legends / text for each experiment.</p><p>line 179 â did the authors mean removal of silencing?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.74899.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviewers acknowledge that the study provides novel insights into a long-standing question about the mechanisms that constrain homeostatic synaptic plasticity, and the findings are exciting and of broad interest.

We do not think this will be informative in the TTX condition (in either genotype) because the network activity is so intense and is shared across almost all cells in the network. Both interneurons and pyramids receive both excitation and inhibition, but the recurrent excitation is so powerful that all cells fire near simultaneously. Hence we do not believe we can clarify their relative contributions in this way. Therefore, we think that the more difficult experiment of manipulating HLF and TEF independently in pyramids and interneurons, and/or sparsely in individual cells will be much more informative, but this will take significant additional work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(ii) In addition, calcium imaging, as the key physiology data, should be performed in WT and TKO cultures for two time points: after 2 days in TTX and after 5 days in TTX.

TFs can be classified into families, and in some cases subfamilies, which share a DNA binding domain, and so are expected to bind the same target DNA sequences in the genome and therefore to regulate the same or similar target transcripts. We asked which families or subfamilies were most over-represented amongst the TFs differentially expressed during activity blockade. The most overrepresented subfamily was the PAR bZIP subfamily of TFs, a subtype of the CEBP-related family in the class of Basic leucine zipper factors (classification data from tfclass.bioinf.med.uni-goettingen.de Wingender et al. 2015 ). This subfamily includes 3 transcriptional activators Hlf, Tef, and Dbp, and a transcriptional repressor, Nfil3.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

We performed additional experiments and have re-analyzed the old and new data together. We have fixed the text to reflect the data and have plotted the peak frequency normalized to control (Supplemental Figure 2A) as well as non-normalized frequency in Hz. The combined data and analysis further strengthen our conclusion that there is no change in network activity level at baseline between WT and TKO cultures.</p><p>We tested for interactions and found highly significant (&lt;0.0001) interaction between treatment and genotype. We include the results in the text (line 141).</p><p>âWhile 2 days of TTX incubation increases the peak frequency 3.6-fold in WT slices (from 0.06 +/- 0.01 to 0.22 +/- 0.04 Hz), the same silencing duration produces a nearly six-fold increase in the TKO slices (from 0.09 +/- 0.02 Hz to 0.5 +/- 0.05 Hz; Figure 2, Figure 2âFigure Supplement 1A). A two-way ANOVA revealed significant effects of treatment (TTX vs. Control; p&lt;0.0001) and genotype (p&lt;0.0001) and a significant interaction between the two (p&lt;0.0001). Post hoc T-tests (with Tukey correction for multiple comparisons) revealed that TTX increases in activity were highly significant in both WT (p = 0.0007) and TKO (p&lt;0.0001) slices and that TTX produced a significantly stronger increase in the TKO (p&lt;0.0001), while the baseline activity of cells from slices derived from the TKO and WT do not differ significantly (p=0.92). Consistent with this, normalizing the TTX response to the control response revealed a larger relative increase in TKO than WT cultures (Figure 2âFigure supplement 1A).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. On a similar note, although not statistically significant, the mean calcium peak frequency in TKO cultures is around two-fold higher than WT under baseline conditions (Figure 2D). A similar trend can be seen in the data shown in figure 6A (top panel), whereas the baseline calcium peak frequency is similar between TKO and controls in the experiment shown in Figure 2B.

A small subset of experiments were excluded because the calcium signal was too low to accurately measure changes in firing. We have made the exclusion criteria clear in the methods. The previous trend towards an increase at baseline is no longer present with the additional data (Figure 2D). Additionally, we now report synchrony, a measure of the average cross-correlation at zero lag during network bursts (figure 2 supplement 1B). The synchrony metric saturates in the WT TTX condition, making it unsuitable for detecting further increases in network activity and so we use peak frequency for most of the rest of the manuscript. We also performed a power analysis. The synchrony results and power analysis are described in the following sentences (line 152):</p><p>âThe TTX condition also increased synchrony (from 0.76 +/- 0.03 to 0.95 +/- 0.01) in WT, and in the TKO (from 0.74 +/- 0.03 to 0.94 +/- 0.05; Figure 2âFigure Supplement 1B). While the TTX effects were highly significant (Two-way ANOVA; p&lt;0.0001), there was no significant effect of genotype (p=0.43) and no interaction between treatment and genotype (p=0.65), presumably reflecting the fact that synchrony is already saturated by TTX treatment in the WT and cannot further increase in the TKO, but also indicating that baseline synchrony is not altered in the TKO. A power test revealed that with the effect size and variances observed, 95 slice cultures in each group would be needed to detect a significant difference between WT and TKO peak frequency, while for the synchrony measure, the required N would be 1609.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Based on the data shown in figure 6, they conclude that one copy of Tef is sufficient to constrain homeostatic plasticity. Can they rule out that one copy of Hlf is sufficient as well? This would actually fit to the result that one copy of Tef or Hlf rescues lifespan in TKO. The peak frequencies of DKO;Tef +/- and DKO;Hlf +/- after TTX treatment actually look quite similar. Are these two groups statistically different from one another? Only comparing the absolute DKO;Tef +/- or DKO;Hlf +/- data to WT is not very informative. Again, I suggest normalizing the data of each genotype to the respective control, and to test for interactions between treatment and genotype.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewerâs skepticism of our ability to distinguish the contributions of Hlf and Tef and wrestled with how best to perform this analysis. A key limitation is that there are 27 potential genotypes (Null, Het, wild type) for the three genes considered jointly and so even with a total of 185 experiments (87 Control and 98 TTX) we were almost definitely underpowered for most specific comparisons. Rather than attempt to make all possible pairwise comparisons, we chose to put all of the data together (the 88 experiments shown in figure 2 and figure 2âfigure supplement 1, as well as 97 additional experiments that included those shown in the earlier version of figure 6 as well as some additional experiments we performed in the past year). We then fit these data with a series of linear regression models to determine the relationship between peak frequency and genotype. The same set of six models were used to separately fit the data from control slices and from TTX-treated slices.</p><p>These analyses are described in the following section (line 258):</p><p>âTo test whether Hlf, Tef, and Dbp work together to regulate homeostatic plasticity or if they have unequal contributions to restraining network response to activity deprivation, we measured the homeostatic response while varying gene copy number of each transcription factor. In addition to the WT and TKO data described in Figure 2 and Figure 2âFigure Supplement 1, we measured calcium transients in slice cultures treated with or without TTX from 97 additional animals with various combinations of 0, 1 or 2 alleles of Hlf, Tef and Dbp (full details of each experiment given in associated data file). Rather than attempt to statistically test individual differences between each of 27 potential genotypes (Null, Het, wild type for the three genes considered jointly), we fit a series of multivariate linear models to test the ability of genotype to predict calcium peak frequency. The same six models, described in Table 1, were fit separately to data from control and TTX-treated slices. The models, shown in Table 1, differ in how they depend on the number of alleles of each of the three genes. Model 1 depends on all three genes, models 2-4 depend only on one of the three genes (each in turn) and models 5 and 6 depend only on Hlf and Tef, either independently, or summed together. The ability of each model to account for the data was estimated from the adjusted R<sup>2</sup> which reflects the fraction of the variance in the data predicted by the model variables. Several key points were evident from this analysis:</p><p>1) All of the models produced poor fits (adjusted R<sup>2</sup> of -0.01 to 0.063) to the control data, consistent with the hypothesis that baseline activity does not depend on genotype.</p><p>2) All of the models that included variables for Hlf and/or Tef produced much better fits to the TTX data (adjusted R<sup>2</sup> of 0.198 to 0.296) consistent with the hypothesis that rebound activity is influenced by genotype. In these models, the coefficients (effect size) for Hlf and Tef were similar and T-tests revealed they were highly significantly different from zero.</p><p>3) The model that only depended on Dbp (line 4) provided a poor fit to the TTX data (adjusted R<sup>2</sup> = 0.073) and in the model that included both terms for Dbp and the other two factors (line 1), the Dbp coefficient was small and not significantly different from zero. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that rebound activity does not depend on Dbp and that even in a significant model including Hlf and Tef, Dbp does not add additional explanatory power to the model.</p><p>3) The models that included terms for both Hlf and Tef (line 5) or for their sum (line 6) produced the best fits (adjusted R<sup>2</sup> = 0.291 and 0.296); i.e. better than those that depend on only one of these factors (lines 2,3; adjusted R<sup>2</sup> = 0.198, 0.229). This is consistent with the hypothesis that both genes contribute to constraining cortical homeostatic plasticity.</p><p>Since the model with the highest adjusted R<sup>2</sup> was that which depended only on the sum of the number of Hlf and Tef alleles (line 6), we used this model for further post hoc (Tukey) tests to determine the effect of different numbers of alleles on the TTX response. The results of this analysis are shown in Figure 6. The most significant differences were between TKO slices (0 alleles; n=32, mean=0.48) and the other genotypes tested (1 allele, n=16, mean=0.32; 2 alleles, n=26, mean=0.35; and 4 alleles, n=24, mean=0.23; p &lt;0.0001 to 0.0014). Most of the other comparisons were not significant, with the exception of the difference between WT responses and those for animals with only two alleles (p=0.011). This indicates that most of the difference between TKO (zero alleles of Hlf + Tef) and WT (4 alleles of Hlf + Tef) could be restored by a single allele, although there was a small but significant improvement between 2 and 4 alleles. The fact that this difference was significant, but the differences between 1 and 2 alleles, and 1 and 4 alleles were not, may reflect a real difference between these groups, or may reflect the imbalanced numbers of animals in each group. The group with 2 alleles included animals that were WT for Hlf but lacked Tef (N=8), animals that were WT for Tef and lacked Hlf (N=9), and trans-Het animals that were heterozygous for both Hlf and Tef (N=7). A separate analysis of variance of these three subgroups revealed that the means (0.32, 0.41 and 0.33) were not significantly different (p=0.28), consistent with the hypothesis that alleles of Hlf and Tef can substitute for one another in their ability to regulate the homeostatic response to activity deprivation.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Sample sizes (culture number/ if applicable, neuron number) should be clearly specified for each experiment. Are some data sets only based on two cultures (e.g. Figure 6 ctrl.)?

The major (recorded) effect underlying the increase in network excitability is an increase in mEPSC frequency. Does this indicate that the mechanisms that constrain homeostatic plasticity mainly work on presynaptic mechanisms, or an increase in synapse number? These possibilities should be also discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We add a discussion of potential mechanism underlying this change to the Discussion section of the manuscript:</p><p>âAlthough two days of activity blockade in dissociated cortical cultures were initially found to produce scaling up of EPSC amplitudes without accompanying changes in mEPSC frequency (Turrigiano et al., 1998), multiple subsequent studies have found evidence for changes in both amplitude and frequency as found here (Wierenga et al., 2006; Koch et al., 2010; Echegoyan et al., 2007; Thiagarajan et al., 2005). Changes in mini frequency are typically interpreted as reflecting increased presynaptic release, either via increases in the numbers of synapses or active release sites, or via changes in the rate at which spontaneous, action potential independent release occurs at each site.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. TTX application increases mEPSC frequency by around two-fold and does not affect other recorded parameters, such as excitability. How could a two-fold increase in mEPSC frequency translate into a four-fold increase in calcium peak frequency? Is there any evidence for a supralinear increase in network activity with regard to miniature frequency? This issue should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>With inclusion of additional data, the increase in mEPSC frequency following TTX was 1.7-fold larger in the TKO than in WT (Figure 3B, while the change in network activity measured from calcium peak frequency was 1.6-fold greater Figure 2D) at 2 days and 2.5-fold greater at 5 days. We added discussion of the relationship in the following paragraph:</p><p>âAlthough the increase observed in mEPSC frequency (1.7-fold greater in TKO than WT), was lower than the relative increase in activity levels, measured from the frequency of calcium transients (2.5-fold greater in TKO than WT at 5 days), these two measures need not be linearly related. First, mini frequency can be distinct from action potential evoked release (Crawford et al., 2017) and second, in a highly recurrent network, the relationship between firing and synaptic strength can be nonlinear (Toyoizumi and Abbott, 2011).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. What is the evidence for 'exaggerated' homeostatic plasticity in TKO cultures? Can they rule out that TKO neurons compensate better? This possibility should be discussed unless they can exclude the possibility that TKO cultures indeed do not retarget set-point activity.</p></disp-quote><p>Although we are not positive we understand the point the reviewer is making, we think he/she is suggesting that we do not know whether the genetic manipulation changes rebound activity following activity deprivation because of a change in the vigor or speed with which the network attempts to restore activity (which we refer to as exaggerated homeostatic plasticity) or a change in the set point to which activity is trying to return, or both.</p><p>We directly tested this possibility in the experiment shown in figure 2 supplement 2. We observe that in the TKO, rebound activity is indeed higher, but it returns to the same baseline level after two days of recovery in normal media lacking TTX. We realize that we did not adequately highlight the significance of this result and thank the reviewer for spurring us to make this clearer. We added the following sentences to the Results section of the manuscript (line 174):</p><p>âIn addition, changes in activity following rebound from deprivation could reflect either a change in the vigor of the circuitâs attempt to restore activity (i.e. enhanced homeostatic plasticity) or a persistent change in the setpoint to which activity is returned (Styr et al., 2019), or both. To test whether the transcriptional restraint of homeostasis is required for bidirectional flexibility and to assess whether the setpoint had changed, we asked whether the network is able to return back to baseline activity levels when the activity blockade is removed. We measured network activity immediately after the end of silencing with TTX as well as following two days of recovery in TTX-free media. In WT slices, activity deprivation causes hyperactivity, evident from a two-fold rise in the peak frequency of the calcium activity. However, this exuberant activity is restored back to baseline levels within two days following restoration of action potential firing. In the mutant, even though the initial response to TTX is exaggerated, the network is also able to return to baseline levels following two days of recovery, to levels indistinguishable from WT (Figure 2âFigure Supplement 2). These data suggest that the recovery from a high activity state is not diminished in the TKO and suggests that the mutation in fact produces exaggerated homeostatic plasticity rather than a change in activity setpoint.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other comments:</p><p>1.

The more pronounced increase in mEPSC frequency upon TTX treatment in TKO cultures compared to WT (Figure 3B) appears more robust than the corresponding changes in calcium peak frequency (Figure 2).

Similarly, although not statistically significant, the decrease in mIPSC frequency upon TTX treatment seems less pronounced in TKO cultures (Figure 4B, C). Could they run a power analysis and test for treatment-group interaction as well?</p></disp-quote><p>We now test for interactions between the treatment and the genotype and report the findings in the figure legend along with a power analysis of the sample size that would be required for the observed difference to be significant:</p><p>âTwo-way ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of TTX treatment (p&lt;0.0001) but not genotype (p=0.54). There was no significant interaction between treatment and genotype (p=0.40), N=28 for WT control, N=37 for WT TTX, N=23 for TKO control, N=20 for TKO TTX. TTX treatment decreased mIPSC frequency in WT (p=0.0007, post hoc Tukey test) but not in TKO cells (p=0.14, post hoc Tukey test). mIPSC frequency in TTX-treated cells is not different in TKO slices compared to WT (p=0.72). The normalized change in frequency (TTX normalized to Control) was 0.55 in WT and 0.70 in TKO. We performed a power analysis that revealed that for the observed effect size and variance a sample of 68 neurons per condition would be required for significance.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. mIPSC amplitudes are decreased in TKO cultures, and there is no further decrease upon TTX application (Figure 4D, E). First, the decrease in baseline mIPSC amplitude in TKO is interesting, and may represent a homeostatic response that counteracts a potential increase in excitability/ calcium peak frequency under baseline conditions (Figure 2D, major point 3). This possibility should be discussed in addition to previous work indicating reduced glutamate decarboxylase function in PLP KOs. Second, could the lack of a decrease in mIPSC amplitude after TTX in TKO neurons also oppose increased network excitability? This possibility should be also discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>The decrease in mIPSC amplitude observed would not be expected to represent a homeostatic response counteracting increased excitability/ calcium peak frequency since it would exacerbate the resulting increase in network excitability. Furthermore, as noted above, additional experiments make it clearer that baseline frequency is not altered. The prior work on reduced glutamate decarboxylase function is discussed in the following paragraph:</p><p><italic>â</italic>Gachon et al. (Gachon et al., 2004) first reported that deletion of the PARbZIP proteins TEF, HLF and DBP caused spontaneous and audiogenic seizures. They suggested that this may reflect effects on neurotransmitter metabolism caused by a reduction in pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) since pyridoxal kinase, which catalyzes the last step in the conversion of vitamin B6 into PLP is a target of the PAR bZIP proteins. PLP is a required cofactor for decarboxylases and other enzymes involved in the synthesis and metabolism of GABA, glutamate and the biogenic amine neurotransmitters including dopamine, serotonin and histamine. Using HPLC they found no changes in GABA or glutamate, but reduced levels of dopamine, serotonin and histamine in the knockout animals. Although changes in amine transmitters could potentially contribute to phenotypes in vivo, they are unlikely to contribute to plasticity in cortical slice cultures which do not include the brainstem nuclei from which these projections arise. Reduced glutamate decarboxylase action could potentially have contributed to the observed baseline reduction in mIPSCs since heterozygous (Lazarus et al., 2015) and homozygous (Lau and Murthy, 2012) mutants of Gad1, the gene encoding the GAD67 isoform of glutamic acid decarboxylase, have reduced mIPSC amplitudes. However, this does not account for the enhanced homeostatic overshoot following activity blockade, since in the TKO animals, activity blockade did not produce any further reduction in inhibition but produced robust changes at excitatory synapses.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. TTX treatment results in a rapid regulation of Hlf and Tef mRNA on the hour time scale (Figure 1C). The mEPSC/IPSC recordings were carried out in the presence of TTX.

Quantification of the network activity homeostasis (Figure 2 and its supplemental figure): The authors provided quantification of frequency of Ca events (probably associated with spike bursts). It is unclear why the amplitude was not taken into account. Mean firing rate should be better reflected by frequency x amplitude calculation.</p></disp-quote><p>Although in principle the amplitude of calcium transients may provide additional information about the magnitude of the firing underlying these events, we found that the distribution of event amplitudes were dependent upon other experimental factors such as the amount of calcium indicator expressed as well as optical factors such as the depth of the cell in the slice. Although it may be possible with further calibration experiments to control for some of these factors, we decided instead to simply use the calcium transients as indicative of periods of neuronal firing without attempting to ascertain the precise number of action potentials contributing. We added the following summary of this idea to the methods:</p><p>âSince the distribution of event amplitudes across cells was potentially dependent on other experimental factors such as the amount of calcium indicator expressed as well as optical factors such as the depth of the cell in the slice, we decided not to try to infer the magnitude of firing from the amplitude of events, but only periods of elevated firing from the timing of events.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. What is the mechanism that links spike silencing to activation of PAR-bZIP TFs by inactivity? Is it mediated by the previously described mechanisms related to T-type Ca channels (Schaukowitch et al. Cell Reports 2017) or L-type Ca channels and CaMK4 (Li et al. Cell 2020)? This should be at least discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We added the following speculative paragraph to the discussion:</p><p>âThe mechanisms linking activity deprivation to Tef and Hlf activation were not directly addressed in this work, but seem likely to depend on reduced calcium influx. Prior studies have suggested alternately that scaling up of mEPSC amplitudes depends upon calcium influx through either T-type (Schaukowitch et al., 2017) or L-type (Li et al., 2020) calcium channels. The former pathway has also been found to depend on the activity-dependent transcription factors Elk1 and SRF. Activation of the constraining TFs Tef and Hlf could be secondary or delayed responses dependent on changes in the transcription and translation of other activity-dependent TFs, or may represent a primary response to activity deprivation, analogous to, but in the opposite direction of the well-studied immediate early genes such as Fos, Arc and others.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. I am not sure I agree with the interpretation of mIPSC results. The results show that both frequency and amplitude homeostatic down-regulation are disabled by TF deletion.
