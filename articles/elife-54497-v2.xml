can non-invasively modulate human neural activity. We investigated how different fundamental sonication parameters influence the effects of TUS on the motor cortex (M1) of 16 healthy subjects by probing cortico-cortical excitability and behavior. A low-intensity 500 kHz TUS transducer was coupled to a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) coil. TMS was delivered 10 ms before the end of TUS to the left M1 hotspot of the first dorsal interosseous muscle. Varying acoustic parameters (pulse repetition frequency, duty cycle, and sonication duration) on motor-evoked potential amplitude were examined. Paired-pulse measures of cortical inhibition and facilitation, and performance on a visuomotor task was also assessed. TUS safely suppressed TMS-elicited motor cortical activity, with longer sonication durations and shorter duty cycles when delivered in a blocked paradigm. TUS increased GABA<sub>A</sub>-mediated short-interval intracortical inhibition and decreased reaction time on visuomotor task but not when controlled with TUS at near-somatosensory threshold intensity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>focused ultrasound</kwd><kwd>neuromodulation</kwd><kwd>transcranial ultrasound</kwd><kwd>transcranial magnetic stimulation</kwd><kwd>noninvasive brain stimulation</kwd><kwd>brain stimulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Banting and Best Doctoral Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fomenko</surname><given-names>Anton</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>NSERC</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Discovery Grant RGPIN-2020-04176</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Robert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Foundation Grant FDN 154292</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Robert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010318</institution-id><institution>University of Manitoba</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Clinician Investigator Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fomenko</surname><given-names>Anton</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001804</institution-id><institution>Canada Research Chairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Neuroscience</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lozano</surname><given-names>Andres M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009663</institution-id><institution>University Health Network</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R.R.

Low-intensity transcranial ultrasound (TUS) is a promising noninvasive brain stimulation technique actively being studied for its ability to reversibly modulate mammalian brain activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fomenko et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Naor et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tyler et al., 2008</xref>). By focusing the propagation of acoustic waves through the skull, a higher degree of spatial specificity and deeper targeting can be achieved over other noninvasive stimulation methods such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct-current stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fomenko and Lozano, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pasquinelli et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Proof-of-concept studies using TUS on healthy human volunteers have elicited a broad range of suppressive and inhibitory effects on cortical and subcortical target areas, although it remains unknown how varying the sonication parameters (i.e.: sonication duration, duty cycle, frequency) affects the magnitude and direction of neural activity within human brain circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Legon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sanguinetti et al., 2014</xref>). To date, published human experiments have demonstrated electrophysiological suppression of sensory-evoked potentials, task performance alteration, modulation of cortical oscillatory dynamics, and corresponding activation on fMRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Legon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mueller et al., 2014</xref>). Self-reported outcomes induced by TUS have included mood improvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hameroff et al., 2013</xref>), phosphene detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schimek et al., 2020</xref>), and tactile limb sensations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2016a</xref>), when frontal, somatosensory, and occipital cortices were targeted, respectively. However, each study examined only a single set of stimulation parameters, and it is not known whether human neural circuits are more sensitive to titration of a particular parameter, nor whether a dose-response effect exists. Furthermore, studies reported heterogeneous effects of TUS on targets such as the motor cortex, with some studies showing suppression of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Legon et al., 2018a</xref>), and others demonstrating increased cortical excitability after prolonged sonication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gibson et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Here, we describe the first double-blinded study examining the effects of systematically varying sonication parameters of TUS applied to the primary motor cortex (M1) of healthy human participants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We tested the M1 because measurement of MEPs from TMS provides an objective and readily quantifiable measure of M1 excitability. Using a combined TMS-TUS stimulation approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Legon et al., 2018a</xref>), we hypothesize that some parameters have a linear suppressive dose-response effect, and others may be less important. We then examine the effects of TUS on several intracortical circuits using paired-pulse TMS. Finally, we study the effects of applying TUS to M1 in a visuo-motor behavioral task, to determine whether sonication alone can affect higher order synaptically connected circuits involved in motor initiation and execution.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental setup.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram depicting the primary motor cortex hand knob in coronal section, with the ultrasound transducer coupled to the scalp via compressible hydrogel and held to the underside of a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) coil with a 3D printed plastic holder (not to scale). The transducer and holder measure 10 mm thick, allowing for adequate magnetic stimulation of cortical neuron populations.

We found a dose-response effect of prolonging the sonication duration on the suppression of TMS-induced MEPs, up to a maximum duration of 0.5 s, and show that a lower duty cycle (10%) has the greatest efficacy in suppressing motor cortex potentials. Similar studies with large animals appear to be in line with our data. A recent systematic examination of TUS parameters in sheep showed that low duty cycles (&lt;10%) and long sonication durations (~1 min) yielded suppressive effects on sensory-evoked potentials, while high duty cycles (&gt;30%) and short sonication durations (&lt;500 ms) were excitatory on the motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yoon et al., 2019</xref>) However, unlike our study, suppressive parameters were only applied to the sensory cortex, and the excitatory parameters to the motor cortex, and the animals were de anesthetized during the experiment.</p><p>Interestingly, our initial results show that although a particular combination of parameters can robustly suppress TMS-elicited cortical activity when applied in a sham-controlled block design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), some parameters such as PRF when randomized and varied individually do not have the same robust effect, whereas others such as sonication duration do (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–D</xref>). To address this discrepancy, we conducted follow-up experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) in which we delivered three distinct parameter sets in blocked, and interleaved fashion. We found that sonication at 10% DC consistently results in suppression regardless of experimental design, whereas 30% DC only results in suppression when applied in blocked fashion. A duty cycle of 50% did not show any difference compared to sham regardless of experimental design. In contrast, we observed that sonication at three different pulse repetition frequencies (200, 500, and 1000 Hz) applied in a blocked design resulted in reduced cortical excitability compared to sham, whereas interleaving these parameters yielded no significant difference. These results held whether duty cycle was fixed, or whether the DC was adjusted to maintain an equal burst duration.</p><p>In summary, our findings suggest that when delivered in blocked fashion, longer sonication durations, lower duty cycles, and all three PRFs tested yield effective suppression of TMS-elicited MEPs. The trend toward greater suppression with increasing blocked PRF agree with recent literature, where higher PRF (1500 Hz) in combination with low duty cycles were found to be more effective than lower PRF (300 Hz) in neuromodulation of mouse motor cortex in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">King et al., 2013</xref>) and in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Manuel et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, recent large animal studies reveal a bidirectional neuromodulation effects of varying TUS parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yoon et al., 2019</xref>). As such, interleaving different parameters in short succession may lead to spillover effects, due to the random order of parameter delivery. From animal studies where randomized delivery of TUS parameters was studied, non-linear effects were found, possibly related to non-linear piezoelectric accumulation across the neural membrane capacity under the Neuronal Bilayer Sonophore model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Plaksin et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, excitatory or inhibitory changes in short-term plasticity may occur with repeated TUS stimulation, similar to those observed with repeated magnetic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Watanabe et al., 2014</xref>) and electrical stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Udupa et al., 2016</xref>). These are currently under study in our laboratory and in emerging reports on LITUS short-term plasticity in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yu et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>To test whether a progressive accumulation of inhibition might be responsible for the observed difference in results between the blocked and interleaved study designs, we performed a post-hoc analysis of our blocked experiments, stratifying by trial number across all participants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Within each parameter condition, we did not detect a significant difference between the magnitude of early and late trials and conclude that there is no temporal accumulation of MEP-suppressive effects over blocks of 15 trials, corresponding to a block length of approximately 90 s. Instead, the suppression appears to be instantaneous, with effective parameters increasing the likelihood of generating a lower TMS-elicited MEP, but not potentiating the effect of a subsequent stimulation. Notably, our blocked design features a 20 s pause between each set of 15 replicate stimulations, whereas interleaved delivery of random parameters involves an uninterrupted session of 60 stimulations. We speculate that this 20-s rest period may lead to a resetting of cortical excitability to a more TUS-sensitive state. The lack of resetting could play a role in our observation of less robust effects when certain parameters are randomized in succession.</p><p>Possibly because of these longer term effects and the heterogeneity of experimental methods and sonication parameters used between human studies, conflicting reports have emerged. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Legon et al., 2018a</xref> applied simultaneous 500 kHz TUS and TMS to the M1 of healthy human subjects to examine effects on the MEP, intracortical excitability, and reaction time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Legon et al., 2018b</xref>). TUS was found to attenuate TMS-evoked MEP amplitude, reduce ICF, but with no effect on intracortical inhibition, and improve reaction time. However, another study by Gibson found that application of continuous sonication for 2 min to M1 increased subsequent TMS-induced corticospinal excitability compared to baseline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gibson et al., 2018</xref>). Notably, both studies were single-blinded, used a single set of sonication parameters and used a blocked study design to examine sham and active TUS conditions. The study by Gibson also used an unfocused imaging transducer operating at high fundamental frequencies (2.32 MHz), decreasing the likelihood that the acoustic energy reached the brain due to the lower transmission coefficient of the skull at this frequency range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mueller et al., 2017</xref>). Since Gibson’s study measured motor cortical excitability only <italic>after</italic> ultrasound was applied for several minutes, the potential neuromodulatory mechanisms may have opposing effects on excitability compared to the on-line TUS-TMS paradigm studied herein, and in Legon’s experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gibson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Legon et al., 2018b</xref>).</p><p>Since the piezoelectric element within our ultrasound transducer emits a slightly audible buzzing tone when activated, also reported in other human TUS-TMS studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Legon et al., 2018b</xref>), we implemented a novel method of delivering a masking audio stimulus to reduce potential auditory confounding effects. This is particularly salient because our sham conditions were randomly interleaved with active TUS delivery in order to reduce the effects of time-related fluctuations of cortical excitability and to blind the experimenter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huber et al., 2013</xref>). Recent literature demonstrating potential auditory confounding in rodent TUS cortical neuromodulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Niu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sato et al., 2018</xref>), highlight the importance of strategies aimed at prevent conscious or unconscious auditory contamination in ultrasound neuromodulation experiments. Human TMS studies have shown that pairing TMS with an audible stimulus, especially human speech, can lead to increases in cortical excitability. For instance, TMS to the M1 hand area, concomitant with different auditory stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Flöel et al., 2003</xref> have shown that pure tonal sounds do not alter the magnitude of MEP, while language perception significantly <italic>increases</italic> motor excitability. In agreement, studies examining TMS motor response of the leg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liuzzi et al., 2008</xref>) and tongue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fadiga et al., 2002</xref>) show a motor facilitation with semantic speech stimuli, but not with audible tonal sounds or noise. In our study, we did not find facilitation, but rather <italic>decreased</italic> excitability with application of TUS to the hand area of M1, while controlling for audible tones in all delivered conditions including sham. Furthermore, our audible masking tone was played for the same 0.5 s duration for every experimental condition, including the sham, relative to the TMS pulse, and we therefore expect that any TMS-acoustic pairing would be controlled for.</p><p>A recent report examining masked and unmasked delivery of TUS conditions highlights the electrophysiological basis of potential auditory confounds in human single-transducer TUS experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Braun et al., 2020</xref>). In particular, this report shows that an audio-masked TUS sonication and audio-masked sham evoke <italic>identical</italic> auditory ERP's, whereas TUS alone without a mask evokes a significantly different ERP, and moreover can also be reliably differentiated from sham by participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Braun et al., 2020</xref>). This report appears to corroborate our strategy and highlights the importance of controlling for auditory confounds in future human ultrasound neuromodulation studies.</p><p>The results from our paired-pulse experiments suggest that TUS potentiates short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI). Previous pharmacological and physiological investigations have shown that SICI is a marker of GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor-mediated inhibition and may reflect activity of inhibitory interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stagg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Udupa et al., 2010</xref>). Our finding may suggest that cortical interneurons in layers II/III which are well-encompassed within the acoustic focus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) may be preferentially sensitive to ultrasound applied for long durations and a short duty cycle and confer an overall suppressive effect by increasing GABA<sub>A</sub> activity. Indeed, emerging electrophysiology work in animal models is suggesting that sensitivity to low-intensity TUS is mediated not only by parameter selection but also that excitatory and inhibitory neurons have different sensitivities to sonication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yu et al., 2019</xref>). One possible mechanobiological explanation for the cell-type selective effects of ultrasound is the neuronal intramembrane cavitation excitation (NICE) model. Predictive modeling studies within the NICE framework, corroborated with animal electrophysiological studies are suggesting that inhibitory cortical neurons are hypersensitive to discontinuous pulsed bursts of TUS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Plaksin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Plaksin et al., 2016</xref>). The T-type voltage-gated calcium channels within these neurons predispose to accumulation of electrical charge between short bursts of ultrasound, predisposing to inhibitory neural activation during low duty-cycle sonication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Plaksin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Plaksin et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In Legon’s study, TUS was found to attenuate ICF but did not affect intracortical inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Legon et al., 2018b</xref>). Several methodological differences from our study should be noted, such as time-locking the ultrasound to begin 100 ms prior to the conditioning stimulus, whereas our sonication was time-locked to 490 ms prior to the first TMS pulse. Since sonication duration is a key parameter of TMS-mediated EMG suppression according to our findings, the earlier onset of TUS in our experiment relative to the CS and TS pulses might have potentiated greater GABA<sub>A</sub>-mediated inhibition, despite the total sonication time being the same. In addition, we randomized the TS-alone condition with the paired pulse conditions in our experiment, whereas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Legon et al., 2018b</xref>) compared to a baseline MEP conducted in a temporally discrete block, potentially introducing variability inherent in MEP fluctuations over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ellaway et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>The cortical silent period, thought to be a marker of GABA<sub>B</sub> activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tremblay et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Ziemann et al., 2015</xref>), did not significantly change with application of TUS in our experiments. Likewise, we did not observe an effect of TUS on LICI, another TMS marker of GABA<sub>B</sub>-ergic inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Premoli et al., 2014</xref>). Reports using voltage-clamp and in-vivo experiments are beginning to show that TUS has preferential effects on certain ion channel currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kubanek et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yu et al., 2019</xref>), and our results may suggest that the ligand-gated ionotropic GABA<sub>A</sub> channel may be such a mechanosensitive substrate.</p><p>Similar to prior reports of M1 TUS in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gibson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Legon et al., 2018b</xref>), we were unable to evoke motor potentials or EMG activities by application of TUS alone to the motor cortex. Interestingly, studies in small rodents consistently show EMG activity and frank motor contractions of hindlimbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gulick et al., 2017</xref>), whiskers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mehić et al., 2014</xref>), and tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yoo et al., 2013</xref>) contralateral to the sonicated motor cortex, as well as inducing eye movements and pupillary dilatation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kamimura et al., 2016</xref>). Although the majority of these studies were done under complete or partial anesthesia, recent studies with awake, freely moving rats have also found that TUS alone can also trigger truncal and limb movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). Applying a similar paradigm to larger animals such as sheep failed to trigger visible motor contractions with TUS alone, although time-locked and parameter-dependent EMG activity in the corresponding hindlimbs was seen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2016c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yoon et al., 2019</xref>). In the even larger human brain, we speculate that the narrow acoustic focus of a single transducer targets a small proportion of the entire motor cortex and either recruits insufficient cortical neurons to trigger a contraction, or preferentially recruits an inhibitory ensemble of interneurons thereby having the opposite effect. Moreover, recent studies with deafened rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sato et al., 2018</xref>) have challenged the notion that low-intensity TUS can directly mediate small animal motor cortical activation, instead proposing that an indirect auditory mechanism, or a peripherally mediated startle response due may be involved. The narrow ellipsoid-shaped acoustic focus may also explain why we observed an increase in the stimulator output required to generate a 1 mV MEP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) and reduction in resting MEP amplitude, but found no change in the active motor threshold or active MEP amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), given the active condition is likely associated with larger area of activation in the motor cortex.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Safety</title><p>The healthy participants in this study reported no adverse effects after participating in study visits. Detailed neurological examinations after each visit were normal. The 2017 Federal Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines for adult cephalic ultrasound suggest a maximum I<sub>SPTA</sub> of 94 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, a maximum I<sub>SPPA</sub> of 190 W/cm<sup>2</sup>, and a MI of &lt;1.9 to avoid cavitation and heating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">United States Food and Drug Administration, 2017</xref>). Prior experimental estimates of the attenuation of human skull bone show a −12 db (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deffieux and Konofagou, 2010</xref>) or a 3.7- to 4.1-fold drop in intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Legon et al., 2014</xref>) at the fronto-parietal bone. Based on these attenuation values and our quantification of the transducer in free water, we estimate that our intracranial intensity at the acoustic focus under baseline parameters is I<sub>SPTA</sub> = 0.64 W/cm<sup>2</sup>, a I<sub>SPPA</sub> = 2.32 W/cm<sup>2</sup> and a MI of 0.19 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Despite the I<sub>SPTA</sub> falling above the FDA acoustic exposure guidelines, in Europe, the International Electrotechnical Commission 60601-2-5 standard for low-intensity therapeutic ultrasound equipment suggests a higher limit of 3 W/cm<sup>2</sup> on effective acoustic intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Duck, 2007</xref>). Indeed, computational models have suggested that typical low-intensity TUS parameters delivered for 0.5 s durations lead to negligible increases in brain temperature (4.27 × 10<sup>–3</sup> °C). (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mueller et al., 2016</xref>). Although no human studies have reported any permanent adverse effects from application of low-intensity TUS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Legon et al., 2020</xref>), a single sheep study showed small microhemorrhages at the cortical site of sonication, albeit after prolonged repetitive (&gt;500) trials at intensities (I<sub>SPPA</sub> = 10.5 W/cm<sup>2</sup>) higher than used in our study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gaur et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2016c</xref>). The absence of edema, necrosis, or local inflammatory responses, as well as a lack of control group may implicate postmortem brain extraction as the cause of these findings, rather than sonication itself. Indeed, a follow-up sheep study by the same group using fewer consecutive sonications (&lt;80 trials) and an inter-stimulus interval of 5 s, as in our study, did not yield any abnormalities on histological examination of sonicated brain tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yoon et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Behavior</title><p>We report a reduction in mean motor reaction time with M1 TUS alone applied at basic parameters and intensity compared to sham. This result is consistent with a previous study, where subjects pressed a button when a visual stimulus appeared on the screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Legon et al., 2018b</xref>). Contralateral M1 sonication 100 ms prior to the stimulus resulted in a significantly shortened response time compared to sham, although the magnitude of the difference was only about 10 ms. In our study, sonication was applied 250 ms prior, and the task was more complex; nevertheless, the sonication parameters and cortical location were similar, and we observed a larger effect size , although with higher variability from subject-to-subject. A potential mechanisms for this effect is TUS-mediated enhancement of surround inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beck and Hallett, 2011</xref>). In animal studies, GABA-antagonist drugs applied to M1 cause merging of motor hotspots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schneider et al., 2002</xref>), and in primates, corticospinal pyramidal neurons are known to activate several nearby muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersen et al., 1975</xref>). If M1 TUS has a direct effect on reaction time, a possible mechanism might be potentiation of GABA<sub>A</sub> inhibitory interneuron activity surrounding the FDI hotspot, with a resulting sharpening of corticospinal motor output to the target muscle effectuating the movement. Although the slightly audible sound of the piezoelectric transducer element was masked with an audible tone, we cannot rule out intersensory facilitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Diederich and Colonius, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Forster et al., 2002</xref>) as contributing to the difference in reaction times between conditions. Given that acoustic waves are mechanical in nature, it is possible that a subtle tactile sensation on the scalp at the site of transducer placement might act as an extra sensory cue which is difficult to replicate with a sham protocol that delivers no acoustic energy. In a follow-up control experiment with four participants, the reaction times were not significantly different when a lower near-somatosensory threshold intensity (0.54 W/cm<sup>2</sup>) was used when compared to the 2.32 W/cm<sup>2</sup> intensity used in all other experiments. Since individual somatosensory thresholds differ, and the threshold of transcranial acoustic energy necessary to affect motor tasks is unknown, further experiments are necessary to disentangle the role of somatosensory confounding in this behavioral task.</p><p>We were unable to detect any significant difference in mean trajectory distance, deviation score, or in time taken for each trial. This is consistent with our hypothesis that low-intensity TUS has a mainly in short-term and focal effect on neural circuits. Since sonication was only maintained for a total of 250 ms from the onset of the visual cue, we did not expect to see differences between conditions in the coordination of the relatively long motor task that underlies the full trajectory.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Limitations</title><p>From a technical standpoint, precise targeting of intracranial structures remains challenging with single-element US transducers. Although we did not use on-line neuronavigation, we estimate that the epicenter of the transducer fell directly over the primary motor cortex based on post-hoc subject-specific MR image registration and acoustic simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), inter-participant variability in skull thickness and cortical geometry may distort the geometry and result in a diminished actual intensity at the acoustic focus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McDannold et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mueller et al., 2017</xref>). Because of the complex propagation of ultrasound through intervening tissues of different acoustic impedances (i.e.: gel pad, hair, trapped air bubbles, scalp, skull, dura), the precise proportion of M1 targeted by the acoustic field, nor the precise intensity at the focus cannot be precisely ascertained. In addition, simultaneous sonication of all cortical sublayers with different neural population, as well as underlying white matter may have contributed to the MEP variability we saw in some subjects. Although our acoustic simulations were based on individualized brain imaging and transducer positions were captured by neuronavigation, the simulations are limited to two-dimensions, and the tissues are treated as homogenous layers due to absence of CT-derived density data which limits the fidelity of the estimated focus. In the behavioural task, we did not conduct formal somatosensory threshold testing for individual participants, so intersensory facilitation cannot be ruled out as responsible for the shortened reaction times. Lastly, we did not explicitly characterize the effect of the TMS-induced electromagnetic field on the operation of the ultrasound transducer, nor the effects of the transducer housing on the coil’s induced electrical field. However, such a characterization was rigorously performed in a prior study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Legon et al., 2018b</xref>) using the same TMS coil and a similarly sized custom non-ferromagnetic ultrasound transducer, and found no significant effects in either direction.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Low-intensity TUS stimulation holds appeal for its unique combination of non-invasiveness, safety, high precision, and broad range of neuromodulatory effects. We found that lower duty cycle and longer sonication duration resulted in inhibition of cortical excitability. PRF showed suppression at all three frequencies tested (200, 500, 1000 Hz), but only when delivered in blocked design. In addition, TUS increased SICI, suggesting a possible GABAergic mechanism. Although we have shown that our human M1 TUS sonication scheme is safe and produces suppressive effects, a wider range of parameters and brain regions remain to be systematically tested, and further prospective studies are needed to elucidate region- and neuron-specific sensitivity to focused ultrasound. In addition, many cortical and subcortical cerebral targets have yet to be explored in terms of potential electrophysiological and behavioral responses to ultrasound. Dedicated study designs will be needed to answer the question of both short-term and long-term effects of TUS, as well as its on-line and off-line interaction with TMS. Finally, basic in vitro electrophysiologic experiments will help illuminate potential cellular, synaptic, and ionic mechanisms of ultrasound neuromodulation. Clinical applications are already being foreshadowed with human trials underway using low-intensity sonication for the treatment of epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bystritsky et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stern, 2014</xref>), Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Meng et al., 2017</xref>), Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wagner and Fregni, 2012</xref>), disorders of consciousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Monti et al., 2016</xref>), and stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tsivgoulis and Alexandrov, 2007</xref>).

All patients gave written informed consent, and the protocol was approved by the UHN Research Ethics Board in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki on the use of human subjects in experiments.</p><p>Subjects were studied on four separate visits. The first visit involved a three-dimensional T1-weighted 3T MRI scan of the brain for all subjects, in order to later confirm the stimulated cortical target with individualized neuronavigation (Brainsight, Rogue Research, Montreal, Quebec). MRI acquisition parameters consisted of: 3-D fast spoiled gradient recalled sequence, TR = 7.8 ms, TE = Min, FA = 12, Inversion time = 450 ms, matrix = 256 × 256, FOV = 240 mm, slice thickness = 1.1 mm, no gap, number of slices = 172, acquisition time = 10 min. On the same day, a TMS threshold assessment with a 70 mm figure-eight coil held against the scalp at the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) hotspot was performed. Since a scalp-coil distance of 10 mm is used in all subsequent experiments, two participants requiring very high stimulation intensities (&gt;95% of maximum stimulator output to generate a 1 mV peak-to-peak MEP in the contralateral FDI) were excluded, leaving 16 participants on which to perform data collection. The second visit involved delivery of single-pulse TMS-TUS in blocked design at basic parameters, followed by different sonication parameters in interleaved design, with recording of resting and active motor potentials. The third visit involved paired-pulse TMS-TUS experiments as well as a behavioral task involving application of TUS alone. The fourth visit involved varying selected sonication parameters in blocked, followed by interleaved fashion. For each acoustic parameter of interest (i.e. DC), a block was defined as 15 consecutive sonications of the same parameter value (i.e.: DC of 50%) with an ISI of 5 s.

The transducer was continuously excited at the fundamental frequency (500 kHz) in power steps of 1W, up to a maximum of 20W. The oscilloscope measurements of maximum peak voltages per cycle was multiplied by the hydrophone sensitivity (94.6923 mV/MPa) to derive a corresponding instantaneous pressure (P<sub>i</sub>).

The fundamental frequency, intensity, and other parameters not being varied in each experiment were kept the same as the basic parameters. In the adjusted PRF experiment, the burst duration was held constant, requiring an adjusted DC (10, 25, 50%) for the PRF conditions 200, 500, 1000 Hz, respectively. For all experiments, the TMS pulse was time-locked to 10 ms before the end of sonication. For each parameter of interest, the order of condition delivery was randomized using a custom MATLAB 2019b script controlling both the TMS and TUS delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fomenko, 2019b</xref>; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/swh:1:dir:64b3fed8f456947c0cc81140fb594dc3ed95070c;origin=https://github.com/Synapticplastic/MATLAB-codes;visit=swh:1:snp:2020e984cc226ad176f860991b2ca255386fcd8e;anchor=swh:1:rev:fe4df0a5372942406324efa09ec93fe2192487ea/">swh:1:rev:fe4df0a5372942406324efa09ec93fe2192487ea</ext-link>). For 12 participants, 10 TMS-TUS stimuli per condition were delivered in randomized order with an interstimulus interval of 5 s, and the resultant MEPs were collected for analysis. For four additional subjects, 15 stimuli were collected per condition. Each participant received a cumulative sonication time between 60 and 90 s. For all conditions, the active face of the transducer was coupled to the scalp, and the masking sound was played for 0.5 s on the speaker. For the sham condition, the transducer was not excited, but the masking sound was played identically to verum parameters.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Effects of TUS on active MEP and silent period</title><p>The maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) was acquired by noting the oscilloscope display output, which was connected to the EMG amplifier through a leaky integrator while the subject squeezed a plastic cube between the right thumb and index finger with maximal effort. For the active conditions, we recorded EMG during 20% of MVC of the right FDI while stimulating the left motor cortex at 120% of resting motor threshold (RMT). The RMT was defined as the minimum stimulation intensity that could elicit MEP of no less than 50 μV in 5 out of 10 trials when the participant was fully relaxed. The silent period duration was measured from the onset of MEP to the reoccurrence of any background EMG activity according to previously described methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Farzan et al., 2013</xref>). TMS was delivered 10 ms before the end of sham or active TUS, and the sonication parameters were the same as the <italic>basic parameters</italic> described above. Each participant received 15 trials each of sham and TUS, with a cumulative sonication time of 7.5 s.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Effects of TUS on intracortical inhibition and facilitation tested with paired-pulse TMS</title><p>The outputs of two Magstim 200 stimulators were directed to a Bistim<sup>2</sup> module (Magstim Company, Dyfed, UK), which was connected to the 70 mm TMS coil. The timing of the pulses was controlled by the output features of the A/D converter (Micro 1401, Cambridge Electronics Design, Cambridge, UK). The sonication parameters were the same as the <italic>basic parameters</italic> described above. The first TMS stimulus was delivered 10 ms before the end of TUS. To ensure that any differences in paired-pulse inhibition or facilitation between TUS and sham are not due to a TUS-mediated reduction of test stimulus (TS) MEP amplitude, but rather to differences in susceptibilities of pathways tested by the paired TMS paradigms to TUS, we further measured the RMT when delivering with sham and TUS, and adjusted the stimulator intensity to account for the effects of TUS. For each distinct paired-pulse paradigm (i.e.: SICI), the number of trials per participant were as follows: TS alone: 20 trials (10 TUS, 10 sham); conditioning stimulus (CS)-TS: 20 trials (10 TUS, 10 sham). Each condition block consisted of 20 trials delivered in random order, and each participant received eight paired-pulse blocks, with a cumulative sonication time of 40 s.</p><p>For the SICI and ICF experiments, we delivered a subthreshold CS at 80% RMT and the TS intensity was at the intensity that elicited MEP of ~1 mV. The interval between CS and TS was 2 ms for SICI and 10 ms for ICF. For the LICI, both the CS and TS consisted of an identical suprathreshold intensity able to evoke mean MEPs of ~1 mV. For SICF, the first stimulus intensity was set to generate MEP of ~1 mV. The second stimulus was at RMT. The interval between stimuli was 1.5 ms for the first peak and 2.9 ms for the second peak of SICF.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Effects of TUS on a visuo-motor task</title><p>To measure the effects of TUS on voluntary motor behavior, we used a visuo-motor task similar to one previously used to assess motor performance and reaction time after electrical deep brain stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Almeida Marcelino et al., 2019</xref>). Each participant was seated in a comfortable chair facing a computer screen, with an eye-to-screen distance of 60 cm. A three-axis accelerometer was attached to the dorsal aspect of the distal right index finger and calibrated so that abduction of the FDI triggered a voltage rise in the horizontal plane of the accelerometer. The ultrasound transducer was positioned at the previously-marked FDI hotspot over the left M1, coupled with a gel pad, and secured to the head using a 3D-printed holder with Velcro straps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fomenko, 2019a</xref>).</p><p>Participants were instructed to steer a cursor using their index finger on a digital tablet (Intuos Draw, Wacom) as quickly and accurately as possible to target circles appearing in one of three on-screen positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Participants were asked to only abduct or adduct the index finger, while keeping the hand, arm, and remaining digits still. Trials started with a red circle at the starting location (diameter = 50 pixels) that turned green after 2 s to indicate to the participants that they should move to the target location. The target location was indicated with a blue circle (diameter = 200 pixels) with a white cross at the center, which appeared simultaneously as the start location turned green. The target location appeared at one of three randomized locations with 60 trials for each: (1) close target, 600 pixels away, (2) medium target, 1200 pixels, or (3) far target, 1800 pixels away. On each trial, TUS or sham was applied 250 ms before the blue circular target appeared on the screen for a total sonication duration of 500 ms. TUS was applied either at full intensity (2.32 W/cm<sup>2</sup>), as with the single- and paired-pulse experiments, or at a close to somatosensory threshold acoustic intensity (0.54 W/cm<sup>2</sup>). The near-threshold intensity was chosen to correspond to a lack of subjective scalp tactile sensation in all participants after five test sonications were applied at basic parameters. For both TUS and sham conditions, the masking sound was played over a speaker in a similar fashion as the TMS experiments. Subjects first practiced the task until performance speed plateaued, after which the transducer was positioned on the scalp and 180 trials pseudorandomized across TUS/sham conditions (90 trials each) were performed, with a cumulative sonication time of 45 s. MATLAB 2019b was used to record all finger traces via a modified Psychophysics Toolbox script and Spike2 (Cambridge Electronics Design, Cambridge, UK) was used to record the accelerometer trace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brainard, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fomenko, 2019b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>For the MEP data, a custom script in SIGNAL (Cambridge Electronics Design, Cambridge, UK) was used to extract peak-to-peak MEP amplitudes, and to extract the median amplitude by condition. PRISM 8 (GraphPad Software Inc, San Diego, California) was used for statistical analysis. For the single-pulse basic parameters and active MEP experiments, two-tailed paired t-tests were used to compare means of participant MEP amplitudes between verum TUS and sham conditions. For the interleaved and blocked systematic parameter variation experiments, MEP mean amplitudes were first analyzed using repeated-measures (RM) one-way ANOVA. Post-hoc two-tailed paired t-tests were then used to compare each parameter to its respective sham group, and p-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using Holm’s sequential Bonferroni procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Holm, 1979</xref>), with omnibus significance α = 0.05. Analysis of blocked experiments by trial number was performed with multiple two-tailed paired t-tests, between the means of the first three trials (first 20%) and the last three trials (last 20%) of all participants, for each block of 15 total trials. Paired-pulse experiments were expressed as the ratio of the conditioned (with preceding CS) to the unconditioned (TS alone) MEP amplitudes, for both sham and TUS, and two-tailed paired t-tests were used. For the behavioral task, reaction time was defined as the time from target stimulus presentation to the horizontally-directed accelerometer voltage trace exceeding two standard deviations from baseline. Total path travelled was defined as the number of pixels contained within the path from start to finish, while deviation score was the deviation in pixels from an ideal straight line from start to finish target. Mean values of TUS and sham were analyzed with two-tailed paired t-tests.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Cricia Rinchon and Julianne Baarbé for their help in a piloting the optimal coil-scalp distance for this experiment.

This study is very timely as only a few TUS studies have been published in humans so far. Importantly, they systematically investigated the impact of various TUS parameters and TMS pulses on cortical excitability.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Systematic examination of low-intensity ultrasound parameters on human motor cortex excitability and behaviour&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Richard Ivry as the Senior Editor, Laura Dugué as the Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Wynn Legon (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Fomenko et al., combined transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the primary motor cortex (M1) in humans to measure the effects of TUS on corticospinal excitability changes as assessed by TMS and measures of motor evoked potentials (MEP). They systematically investigated the impact of important TUS parameters, such as pulse repetition frequency, duty cycle, and sonication duration on several single- and paired-pulse TMS related indices for GABA-A- (SICI) and -B-receptor mediated inhibition (LICI, cortical silent period) as well as facilitation (SICF, ICF). They found corticospinal excitability to be generally decreased by TUS, and stronger so for longer sonication and shorter duty cycles, as well as a stronger SICI during TUS. They also observed shorter response times during TUS in a visuomotor task. No impact of TUS was found on any of the other parameters.</p><p>The reviewers and the editors appreciates the need for such methods paper as TUS is a very promising neurostimulation technique that is at the stage of translating from animal to human research. Despite a few (&lt;10) studies being already published in humans, the impact of the most basic TUS parameters on cortical excitability is still unclear, and systematic studies like this one are very much needed.</p><p>That said, there are significant methodological and statistical concerns that need to be addressed before the paper can be published. The following comments highlight the &quot;essential revisions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In general, the data lacks apparent robustness. They authors should collect data from more participants (preferably with more trials) to allow for correction for multiple comparisons across all the tested indices and solve the apparent lack of robustness (failed within-study replications) of the data. The following points describe the different results in which robustness issues have been noticed.</p><p>1a) Given the relatively low number of subjects and a total of ~16 different measurements being investigated, there is a certain risk of false positive results. Do the results survive correction for multiple comparisons?</p><p>1b) Several of the experiments that either vary TUS parameters or investigate paired-pulse effects also contain a single-pulse MEPS with TUS at &quot;basic parameters&quot; for which a clear suppressive effect was found (p = 0.0018) in the beginning. However, in those four experiments, this effect does not seem to replicate: Figure 5C: DC of 30%; Figure 5E: Pulse repetition frequency of 1000 Hz; Figure 7: TS; Figure 7: S1.</p><p>1c) Statistical analyses for more than two conditions seem based on one-way rm-ANOVAs (such as 5 different sonication durations normalized to sham), &quot;and conditional on a significant f-value, Dunnett's multiple comparisons was performed to explore groups with significant differences from sham&quot; (subsection “Statistical analysis”). The Dunnett's tests presumably test something very different (namely the differences between each TUS condition against Sham) than the ANOVA, which testes for differences of the sham-normalized conditions with respect to each other, and not of the conditions relative to sham. (a) The Dunnett's test should thus not be conditional on the f-test, as they simply answer very different questions. This would change if the ANOVA would based on raw MEP values and include the sham condition as level. (b) This also means that there is no post-hoc evaluation of the differences between conditions, which would require e.g., post-hoc paried t-tests. (c) Potentially, some legitimate basic comparisons against sham have not been performed, because the f-test was non-significant, even though it tested something very different.</p><p>2) The MEP analysis and results need to be reported with more details. The following points should be clarified in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><p>2a). It is unclear how many MEPs (for paired-pulse, how many CS+TS and TS alone trials, respectively) were acquired per condition of each of the experiments. It reads like only 10 MEPs were acquired per condition (20 for paired-pulse blocks, so again 10 CS+TS and 10 TS alone). Given the known high variability of the MEP (cf. also subsection “Limitations” &quot;the MEP variability we saw in some subjects&quot;) and the low number of participants (N = 12; which is understandable for TUS in humans but still low) these low MEP numbers are problematic. A larger number (20 or more MEPs) per condition would provide a much more stable estimate and allow the detection of small effects. Although there are quite some clinical neurophysiology papers out there with 10 or 15 MEPs, the kind of results presented here may shape the translation of TUS for human application and are thus too important for the community to suffer from low statistical power. Some of the findings (also of the negative ones) are in contrast to a previous study (Legon et al., 2018), and it is unclear whether this has to be attributed to differences in experimental design or simply noise. Many separate measures were obtained for the same subjects, and the effort of the authors is acknowledged, but maybe less measures and more trials would have been the better choice? Please report to point 1.</p><p>2b) The authors used the procedure of outlier exclusion. Outlier removal is a controversial method for MEP analyses. MEP amplitudes are not normally distributed but rather follow a power law, and removal of extremes is therefore corrupting the data. Was the pre-activation controlled and excluded together with the outliers? How many MEPs were left for the statistical analysis after exclusion? How do the results change when all trials are kept but the median is used per condition (instead of the mean) or the mean of log-transformed MEP values? Given that robustness is key for these kind of results, transformations should be avoided (or outlier removal at least).</p><p>3) Several concerns have been raised regarding M1 targeting and the use of a normalized brain and MNI coordinates. Specifically, in the newly collected data, M1 (or specific parts of it) should be properly targeted by using neuronavigation and individual head models with T1/T2 (instead of a normalized brain and MNI coordinates). Moreover, the following points should be addressed in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><p>3a) Why was a normalized brain used? You have a neuronavigation system and each participants' MRI. Why MNI coordinates? Should you not distinguish based on each participants' anatomy and TMS response to determine location?</p><p>3b) Why was a mark placed on the head when you have a neuronavigation system? Since BrainSight neuronavigation was used to identify the TUS transducer position on the scalp, why was it not used to ensure and maintain correct transducer placement throughout the many measurements and sessions? Given the small diameter of the sonication beam, tiny changes in tilt or position can have a massive effect on the actually stimulated part of cortex.</p><p>3c) Figure 2B: Please also provide sagittal and axial views to allow a better judgement of the targeting of M1. Is it actually targeting M1 or maybe premotor cortex? Which part of the precentral gyrus is actually sonicated?</p><p>3d) According to Fox, 2006 and Geyer, 1996 the motor cortex of human is allocated in the sulcus and at best to a small extent at the crown. In Figure 2B the white matter is targeted as well as in Figure 3A where the pyramidal neurons are allocated in the white matter. Thus, the first part of the following sentence might not be accurate: &quot;Similarly, the individual simulations of ultrasound propagation for each participant confirmed acoustic targeting of a portion of M1, as well as underlying white matter tracts. (Figure 2B).&quot; see also &quot;Our finding may suggest that cortical interneurons in layers II/III which are well-encompassed within the acoustic focus (Figure 4)&quot;</p><p>3e) Without a CT scan and only T1-weighetd images no really reliable simulations can be obtained for the acoustic waves. Figure 2B only shows one &quot;representative&quot; subject. Have simulations been performed for all subjects or was the transducer only placed on top of the TMS M1 hotspot for each subject without modelling the sonication beam individually? This assumes that the relevant motor neurons of M1 are actually directly beneath the coil center, which is not necessarily the case.</p><p>3f) Figure 3A: The location and orientation of corticospinal output neurons in M1 is incorrect and misleading. They are actually located in the anterior bank of the central sulcus and oriented tangentially to the scalp. This should be corrected.</p><p>4) The phrasing &quot;… a portion of M1…&quot; is disconcerting. Because the transducer was concentric with the intersection of the TMS coil, wherever you put the coil is where the US was. Is that accurate? How did you confirm this however in your models if you did not use individual MRI but rather normalized MRI. MNI coordinates are mentioned previously but not given anywhere in the manuscript.

Please provide an acoustic wave modeling of the sonication for each participant.</p><p>5) There is no data on how/if the transducer affected the TMS pulse or vice versa.

The TMS pulses were locked to the end of FUS or sham stimulation and they had an interstimulus interval of 5 seconds. If there was no jitter for TMS pulses it means that rTMS at 0.2 Hz was applied simultaneously with FUS. Repetitive TMS applied at a very low frequency of 0.2 Hz has been shown to be effective in several studies (Urushihara, 2006; Hosono, 2008). For example, rTMS over PMC led to an increase in somatosensory evoked potentials. Could the possible effect of low frequency rTMS on cortical excitability when applied simultaneously with FUS be discussed?</p><p>8a) A further concern is &quot;This sound was triggered every time a FUS or sham condition was delivered to the transducer.&quot; This could mean that the effects reflect acoustic TMS pairing, see e.g. doi: 10.3389/fnhum.2014.00398, other papers are around as well. Can the results in Figure 5D be due to longer acoustic stimulation? I expect the sham condition to be performed with the shortest duration, however not sure? Can this explain the lack of an effect in Figure 5E and F?</p><p>8b) Also: &quot;and the task was more complex; nevertheless, the sonication parameters and cortical location were similar, and we observed an effect size of about 100 ms, though with higher variability.&quot; It may simply be that the start of the sonification sound leads via a kind of pre-triggering to shortened responses. This is discussed by the authors in subsection “Behaviour”. The effect in Figure 8A appears to be implausibly high. Control experiments seem to be reasonable with very light somatosensoric or close to threshold acoustic stimulation. The whole field of TMS-EEG suffers from acoustic and somatosensory contamination.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your article &quot;Systematic examination of low-intensity ultrasound parameters on human motor cortex excitability and behaviour&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

They added four new participants (now N = 16) with more trials (15-20 instead of 10 per condition), as well as more TUS modelling information. While this is not a large increase in sample size, the authors' efforts are appreciated. However, both the reviewers and the editors were concerned by the fact that the effects are robust for the 'block' experiment but not for the 'parameter' (or interleaved) experiment. Consequently, additional data should be collected in a sufficiently large sample (eg. keeping the N = 16 for interleaved and adding N = 16 for a blocked variation of stimulation parameters), targeting specifically the block vs. interleaved question for the duty cycle and pulse repetition frequency parameters.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Regarding the block vs. interleaved question:</p><p>If it makes indeed a difference for single trial MEP modulation whether TUS is applied in a block design with fixed parameters or with trial-by-trial variation of parameters, this would have important implications for TUS application and thus needs additional data collection, as well as detailed discussion. Specifically, for some parameters (sonication duration) the default parameter (0.5s) was effective in the interleaved design. However, for others (duty cycle) it was slightly different (10% instead of 30%), and for yet others (pulse repetition frequency) it was not different from sham anymore at all (but was previously with 1000 Hz). The blocked vs. interleaved interpretation is post-hoc and potentially valid only for duty cycle and pulse repetition frequency.</p><p>2) The authors added 4 subjects to the existing data set (N = 12) but the reviewers fail to see the significance of this. First, data from the original 12 is presented in Figure 4 and the data from the new N = 4 is presented on its own. Could the authors explain the added value of this? It looks from the manuscript that N = 16 was inclusive for the parameter testing but not the 'basic parameter' testing. The authors could either remove Figure 4C or include that data in Figure 4A.</p><p>3) It is still unclear how many MEPs were left for each participant for the statistical analysis after exclusion. It looks like the new data uses 15 trials but the old 10 and the block experiment 20. Furthermore, it is stated in the Materials and methods that MEPs {plus minus} 2SD of mean were excluded. Please include M+/-SD in the Materials and methods.</p><p>4) The following questions still need to be addressed:</p><p>- Was the pre-activation controlled and excluded together with the outliers?</p><p>- How do the results change when all trials are kept but the median is used per condition (instead of the mean) or the mean of log-transformed MEP values? Also, do the results hold when not removing the outliers?</p><p>- Why was the neuronavigation system not used to online maintain coil/transducer position? Coil angle cannot be reliably inferred from a felt pen drawing on the scalp.</p><p>5) Could the authors show the sonication beam model for all three slices (coronal, sagittal, axial)? The axial slices do not seem to be the most helpful ones when determining whether M1 was hit and which portion of it.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your article &quot;Systematic examination of low-intensity ultrasound parameters on human motor cortex excitability and behaviour&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

That is, is there a systematic change over time, indicative of a cumulative effect? (To quote the reviewer who noted this concern, &quot;Specifically, is there a build-up of suppression across trials within a block? This could be tested e.g. by regressing the MEP amplitude based on within-block trial number or by comparing early and late MEPs within a block. It would be a very important outcome to know whether the observed suppression is instantaneous or accumulating across trials.&quot;).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.54497.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In general, the data lacks apparent robustness.

The following points describe the different results in which robustness issues have been noticed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank you for considering our manuscript and recognizing the need for systematic studies examining basic sonication parameters on human neural circuits. We want to thank the reviewers for their insightful suggestions and comments, which have led to a more clear and comprehensive revised manuscript. Our detailed point-by-point replies to the reviewer comments follow below.</p><p>A significant concern the reviewers raise is the limited number of subjects (n=12) in our study, and the small number of trials per condition. We thank the reviewers for giving us sufficient time to recruit 4 new healthy participants, bringing the total sample size to 16, in line with other within-subject human experiments studying TMS-elicited motor excitability and behaviour (doi: 10.1212/WNL.62.1.91, 10.1016/j.clinph.2007.09.062)</p><p>We have conducted additional modified experiments, as per the suggestion in point 2a to “reduce the number of measures and increase the number of trials”. With the 4 new subjects, we have focussed their experimental visit on testing only the five key sonication parameters, with an increase on the number of trials per parameter. Specifically, after obtaining an MRI for the new participants, we conducted the following experiments.</p><p>A) Basic parameters: Inactive Sham/TUS. 20 trials per condition, block design. 40 trials total. (Previously was 10 trials/condition).</p><p>B) Duty Cycle: Sham/10%/30%/50%. 15 trials per condition, randomized. 60 trials total. (previously was 10 trials/condition)</p><p>C) PRF: Sham/300Hz/500Hz/1000Hz. 15 trials per condition, randomized. 60 trials total (previously was 10 trials/condition)</p><p>D) Adjusted PRF: Sham/300hz/500Hz/1000Hz. 15 trials per condition, randomized. 60 trials total. (previously was 10 trials/condition)</p><p>E) Sonication duration: Sham/0.1s/0.2s/0.3s/0.4s/0.5s. 15 trials per condition, randomized. 90 trials total (previously was 10 trials/condition)</p><p>F) Near-threshold behavioural task control (See Essential revision 8b for details)</p><p>As the reviewers pointed out, auditory confounds are increasingly relevant in the TUS-neuromodulation literature, and sham conditions need to be carefully balanced and rationalized.</p><p>Accordingly, the new participants were subjected to a modified experiment A), where we have compared basic US parameters with an inactive audio-masked sham condition. The purpose of this was to validate that the type of sham we use for the rest of the study results in similar effects on the MEP as the active sham used in the original experiment A), which was also used in Legon et al., 2018).</p><p>We have created a new figure (Figure 9) explaining in detail the two types of sham, and the results are summarized in the newly-created Figure 5. For the remainder of the experiments (B-E), the inactive audio-masked sham was used, and the results were pooled with the original 12 participants, since the protocol remained the same (but with more trials).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1a) Given the relatively low number of subjects and a total of ~16 different measurements being investigated, there is a certain risk of false positive results. Do the results survive correction for multiple comparisons?</p></disp-quote><p>In the case of multiple conditions being compared to an independent sham condition (ie: 5 sonication durations versus sham etc.), we now use the Holm-Bonferroni method of multiple-comparison correction to perform post-hoc paired two-tailed t-tests following the ANOVA. Our original results survive correction for multiple comparisons, with the exception of the sonication duration condition “0.3 s”, which becomes non-significant when adjusted.</p><p>Materials and methods</p><p>“MEP means were first analyzed using repeated-measures (RM) one-way ANOVA. Post-hoc two-tailed paired t-tests were then used to compare each parameter to its respective sham group, and p-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using Holm’s sequential Bonferroni procedure (Holm, 1979), with omnibus significance α = 0.05.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1b) Several of the experiments that either vary TUS parameters or investigate paired-pulse effects also contain a single-pulse MEPS with TUS at &quot;basic parameters&quot; for which a clear suppressive effect was found (p = 0.0018) in the beginning. However, in those four experiments, this effect does not seem to replicate: Figure 5C: DC of 30%; Figure 5E: Pulse repetition frequency of 1000 Hz; Figure 7: TS; Figure 7: S1.</p></disp-quote><p>After pooling the single-pulse parameter trials from the 4 additional participants, we show results consistent with the original set of participants (See revised Results and Figure 5, Figure 6). We did not have specific data to draw a conclusion about why although the “basic” combination of US parameters suppressed cortical activity, and while some parameters replicated this result (ie: Sonication Duration), other parameters did not individually replicate when varied individually (notably PRF). We discuss potential reasons in the revised manuscript:</p><p>Discussion</p><p>“Interestingly, our results show that although a particular combination of parameters can robustly suppress TMS-elicited cortical activity when applied in a sham-controlled block design (Figure 5), parameters such as PRF when randomized and varied individually do not have the same robust effect (Figure 6C-D). From animal studies on TUS parameter dependence, PRF may be related to non-linear piezoelectric characters of the neural membrane capacity, while higher duty cycle or longer burst duration do not necessarily elicit neural activation more efficiently than the same parameter with lower magnitude (H. Kim et al., Brain Stimulation 2014). Furthermore, recent large animal studies reveal a bidirectional neuromodulation effects of varying TUS parameters (Yoon et al., 2019). Based on our results, we speculate that some PRFs may provide opposing, and potentially longer-lasting neuromodulation effects, and randomizing these stimulation blocks in succession might lead to spill-over effects from one trial to another. In contrast, the range of sonication durations tested in our experiment may have been those conducive to suppression and resulted in a robust and dose-dependent effect seen in our experiment (Figure 6B). However, this hypothesis needs further investigation.”</p><p>Regarding the TS and S1 results (Figure 8), the apparent lack of suppression seen in the TUS condition compared to sham was because of a stimulator adjustment in the calibration stage of the experiment to compensate for the robust suppressive effects of US. Before adjustment, basic parameters did in fact replicate the suppression previously seen (Figure 8, first panel), and we now add a paired t-test (p=0.016) showing that a significant mean increase of about +1.3% in stimulator intensity is required to elicit the same 1 mV average MEP values. We also now clarify in the caption that the TS/S1 MEP amplitudes were performed after this adjustment.</p><p>In paired-pulse TMS studies (e.g. SICI, SICF), It is known that the MEP amplitude induced by TS affects their inhibitory or facilitatory results (Sanger et al., 2001; Peurala et al., 2008; Ni et al., 2013). We found from our single-pulse experiments, and those of Legon, (2018) that US generally suppresses MEPs.</p><p>Therefore, we needed to ensure that any differences in paired-pulse inhibition/facilitation between FUS/sham are not due to a FUS-mediated reduction of TS/S1 MEP amplitude, but rather to differences in susceptibilities of pathways tested by the paired TMS paradigms to FUS. We clarify this rationale in the revised manuscript in the Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1c) Statistical analyses for more than two conditions seem based on one-way rm-ANOVAs (such as 5 different sonication durations normalized to sham), &quot;and conditional on a significant f-value, Dunnett's multiple comparisons was performed to explore groups with significant differences from sham&quot; (subsection “Statistical analysis”). The Dunnett's tests presumably test something very different (namely the differences between each TUS condition against Sham) than the ANOVA, which testes for differences of the sham-normalized conditions with respect to each other, and not of the conditions relative to sham. (a) The Dunnett's test should thus not be conditional on the f-test, as they simply answer very different questions. This would change if the ANOVA would based on raw MEP values and include the sham condition as level.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have now removed the stipulation that a significant F-test is required to perform post-hoc analysis in the revised manuscript. Based on this and other reviewer comments, we now show raw mean MEP amplitudes instead of sham-normalized ratios, allowing for direct comparison with the sham group.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(b) This also means that there is no post-hoc evaluation of the differences between conditions, which would require e.g., post-hoc paried t-tests. (c) Potentially, some legitimate basic comparisons against sham have not been performed, because the f-test was non-significant, even though it tested something very different.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on this suggestion, we now perform post-hoc paired t-tests for every parameter compared to sham, with an adjusted p-value to account for multiple comparisons using the Holm-Bonferroni method. We perform this test for all parameters, regardless of the outcome of the ANOVA, which can be found in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The MEP analysis and results need to be reported with more details. The following points should be clarified in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><p>2a) It is unclear how many MEPs (for paired-pulse, how many CS+TS and TS alone trials, respectively) were acquired per condition of each of the experiments. It reads like only 10 MEPs were acquired per condition (20 for paired-pulse blocks, so again 10 CS+TS and 10 TS alone). Given the known high variability of the MEP (cf. also subsection “Limitations” &quot;the MEP variability we saw in some subjects&quot;) and the low number of participants (N = 12; which is understandable for TUS in humans but still low) these low MEP numbers are problematic. A larger number (20 or more MEPs) per condition would provide a much more stable estimate and allow the detection of small effects. Although there are quite some clinical neurophysiology papers out there with 10 or 15 MEPs, the kind of results presented here may shape the translation of TUS for human application and are thus too important for the community to suffer from low statistical power. Some of the findings (also of the negative ones) are in contrast to a previous study (Legon et al., 2018), and it is unclear whether this has to be attributed to differences in experimental design or simply noise. Many separate measures were obtained for the same subjects, and the effort of the authors is acknowledged, but maybe less measures and more trials would have been the better choice? Please report to point 1.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for these comments. As detailed in our response to point 1, we recruited an additional 4 new subjects, increasing the sample size to 16 for the whole study. We prioritized their experimental visits on acquiring an anatomical MRI (Visit 1) and testing the five key sonication parameters on single-pulse TMS experiments (visit 2). As suggested by the reviewers, we increased the number of trials per parameter (15-20 trials), as well as performing a supplementary behavioural control experiment (See point 8b). Unfortunately, given the current global halting of research activity for the foreseeable future, we were unable to ask participants to return for a third visit to perform paired-pulse experiments. We also note that the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology (IFCN) recommendation is to use 8 to 10 trials per condition for paired pulse TMS studies (Rossini et al., (2015)).</p><p>We have clarified the paired-pulse methods to clarify the number of trials per condition, total number of trials, and total sonication time per session</p><p>Materials and methods</p><p>“For each distinct paired-pulse paradigm (ie: SICI), the number of trials per participant were as follows: TS alone: 20 trials (10 TUS, 10 sham), CS-TS: 20 trials (10 TUS, 10 Sham). Each condition block consisted of 20 trials delivered in random order, and each participant received 8 paired-pulse blocks, with a cumulative sonication time of 40 seconds.”</p><p>Regarding the differences between our paired-pulse findings and other reports, we detail possible reasons in our Discussion section, which we attribute to two key differences in experimental methodology:</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>“Several methodological differences from our study should be noted, such as a time-locking the ultrasound to begin 100 ms prior to the conditioning stimulus, whereas we applied ultrasound for 490 ms prior to the first TMS pulse. Since sonication duration is a key parameter of TMS-mediated EMG suppression according to our findings, the longer sonication time in our experiment might have produced greater GABAA-mediated inhibition. In addition, we randomized the TS-alone condition with the paired pulse conditions in our experiment, whereas (Legon et al., 2018b) compared to a baseline MEP conducted in a temporally discrete block, potentially introducing variability inherent in MEP fluctuations over time (Ellaway et al., 1998).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2b) The authors used the procedure of outlier exclusion. Outlier removal is a controversial method for MEP analyses. MEP amplitudes are not normally distributed but rather follow a power law, and removal of extremes is therefore corrupting the data. Was the pre-activation controlled and excluded together with the outliers? How many MEPs were left for the statistical analysis after exclusion? How do the results change when all trials are kept but the median is used per condition (instead of the mean) or the mean of log-transformed MEP values? Given that robustness is key for these kind of results, transformations should be avoided (or outlier removal at least).</p></disp-quote><p>The number of trial outliers excluded was small and only encompassed severe outliers (±2 standard deviations); moreover, this was applied equally for all sham and US conditions. For pre-activation, the outlier exclusion was similarly applied. We agree with the reviewer that there is no consensus as to whether outliers should be excluded or not in TMS studies; our methods are consistent with other TMS papers in the literature. Please see: doi: 10.1038/s41598-018-30480-z, 10.1016/j.brs.2019.05.015, 10.1152/jn.00762.2012, among others.</p><p>In our original 12 subjects, in single-pulse parameter experiments, participants received 10 trials per condition; at most 1 trial per condition were excluded, leaving 9 trials for analysis. Out of a total of 180 trials/participant, at most 2 outliers were identified, representing 1% of total trials.</p><p>For paired-pulse experiments, subjects received 10 trials per condition, at most 2 trials per condition were infrequently excluded, leaving 8 for analysis. Out of 160 total trials per participant, at most 3 outliers were identified, representing 2% of the total.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Several concerns have been raised regarding M1 targeting and the use of a normalized brain and MNI coordinates. Specifically, in the newly collected data, M1 (or specific parts of it) should be properly targeted by using neuronavigation and individual head models with T1/T2 (instead of a normalized brain and MNI coordinates). Moreover, the following points should be addressed in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><p>3a) Why was a normalized brain used? You have a neuronavigation system and each participants' MRI. Why MNI coordinates? Should you not distinguish based on each participants' anatomy and TMS response to determine location?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for allowing us to clarify our use of neuronavigation, and to correct the erroneous phrase “normalized brain MRI”. The phrase is now corrected to:</p><p>Materials and methods:</p><p>“We captured the position of the coil in stereotactic space by registering the subject’s individual T1 anatomical MRI with the position of the TMS coil, using a TMS tracker and infrared camera via Brainsight. “</p><p>The method of selecting scalp position should also have been better elaborated, which we have done in the revised manuscript. Normalization to MNI coordinates was only done post-hoc via Brainsight software, solely for the purpose of generating Figure 2A (probabilistic average of electric field over a single standardized brain).</p><p>As the reviewer suggests, we did indeed use each participant’s TMS response to localize the position of the transducer on the scalp, and consequently the position of the TMS coil. As we now describe in the revised Materials and methods:</p><p>Materials and methods:</p><p>“At the beginning of each experimental session, we determined the FDI motor hotspot on the scalp, defined as the location over which TMS evoked MEPs of highest peak-to-peak amplitude in the target muscle at a given suprathreshold stimulator intensity (Bashir et al., 2013). A marker was used to precisely trace outline of the transducer holder on the scalp, to ensure that the angle and position of the wand was captured.”</p><p>In addition, we add:</p><p>“The ultrasound transducer was rigidly fixed to the underside of the figure-8 coil, and held in the centre of the coil, between the two windings. Previous validation studies (Opitz et al., 2015) showed that the measured electromagnetic maxima of a figure-of-8 TMS coil is located between the two coil windings, justifying our central placement of the transducer holder.”</p><p>Please see the individual acoustic simulation for validation (Figure 2—figure supplement 1) – we acknowledge in the limitations that the predicted sonication beam did not always encompass the anatomical location of the M1 cell bodies, which may account for individual variability in response to FUS. Nevertheless, the acoustic simulations show that our beam path targeted the primary motor cortex, and underlying white matter, in the majority of participants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3b) Why was a mark placed on the head when you have a neuronavigation system? Since BrainSight neuronavigation was used to identify the TUS transducer position on the scalp, why was it not used to ensure and maintain correct transducer placement throughout the many measurements and sessions? Given the small diameter of the sonication beam, tiny changes in tilt or position can have a massive effect on the actually stimulated part of cortex.</p></disp-quote><p>Given the long stimulation blocks (e.g. 90 randomized frames with ISI 5s in the sonication duration experiment), our priority was to ensure that the position of the FUS-TMS stimulator results in consistent MEP amplitudes. As such, after locating the FDI motor hotspot, we used a permanent marker to precisely trace outline of the transducer holder on the scalp, to ensure that the angle and position of the transducer/TMS wand was captured. We agree with the reviewer that tiny changes in tilt or position in the transducer can have a massive effect on the actually sonicated part of cortex. Indeed, we found that small changes in tilt/position of the TMS coil can also significantly alter the consistency of generated MEPs, and this is precisely what we wanted to avoid. As such, our priority was to keep the entire TMS-FUS wand in a consistent position on the scalp for all stimulation experiments, since the outcome of interest was MEP amplitude. The Brainsight was used as a confirmatory tool, as well as enabling us to conduct acoustic and electromagnetic simulations post-hoc (ie: Figure 2A-B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3c) Figure 2B: Please also provide sagittal and axial views to allow a better judgement of the targeting of M1. Is it actually targeting M1 or maybe premotor cortex? Which part of the precentral gyrus is actually sonicated?</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised Figure 2, adding both an improved coronal acoustic simulation (2B), as well as the reviewer’s requested axial and sagittal views derived from the neuronavigation targeting software (2C). As can be seen from these views, the transducer is overlying the hand knob of the precentral gyrus, at the location of the primary motor cortex. Please also see Figure 2—figure supplement 1 for individual coronal acoustic simulations which depict the estimated portions of the precentral gyrus sonicated for every individual.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3d) According to Fox, 2006 and Geyer, 1996 the motor cortex of human is allocated in the sulcus and at best to a small extent at the crown. In Figure 2 B the white matter is targeted as well as in Figure 3A where the pyramidal neurons are allocated in the white matter. Thus, the first part of the following sentence might not be accurate: &quot;Similarly, the individual simulations of ultrasound propagation for each participant confirmed acoustic targeting of a portion of M1, as well as underlying white matter tracts. (Figure 2B).&quot; see also &quot;Our finding may suggest that cortical interneurons in layers II/III which are well-encompassed within the acoustic focus (Figure 4)&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide individual acoustic simulations (Figure 2—figure supplement 1), as well as axial, sagittal, and coronal views (Figure 2B-C) of the targeted sulcus of a representative participant. Given the limited fidelity of acoustic simulation software and other limitations such as the lack of CT-derived bone densiometry, these are at best approximations. Furthermore, the wide focal length of the elongated acoustic focus (22.95 mm) predisposes to sonication of not only most cortical layers (including II/III), but also underlying white matter. Nevertheless, as we state in the Discussion, it is reasonable to speculate that based on our SICI results and others:</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>“Indeed, emerging electrophysiology work in animal models is suggesting that sensitivity to low-intensity TUS is mediated not only by parameter selection, but also that excitatory and inhibitory neurons have different sensitivities to sonication (Yu et al., 2019).”</p><p>Further studies are needed to refine the mechanism of action of TUS-mediated cortical effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3e) Without a CT scan and only T1-weighetd images no really reliable simulations can be obtained for the acoustic waves. Figure 2B only shows one &quot;representative&quot; subject. Have simulations been performed for all subjects or was the transducer only placed on top of the TMS M1 hotspot for each subject without modelling the sonication beam individually? This assumes that the relevant motor neurons of M1 are actually directly beneath the coil center, which is not necessarily the case.</p></disp-quote><p>Despite the superiority of CT imaging in calculating skull density and morphology metrics relevant to acoustic simulation, we did not wish to expose our healthy participant volunteers to radiation. We instead acquired anatomical T1 MRIs, which allow us the dual purpose of enabling subject-specific neuronavigation, and provided us with the ability to segment the skin, skull, and brain to estimate the acoustic pressure field. We now cite a validation study (doi: 10.1109/58.764862) showing agreement between hydrophone-acquired and simulated pressure fields using MRI data. We used a similar method to studies simulating trans-skull ultrasound propagation using segmented T1 MRI data (doi: 10.1121/1.5126685), and describe this in the revised methods and newly added Appendix 1. We agree with the reviewer that by simulating the skull as a homogenous tissue, the simulations show an imperfect estimation of the acoustic focus, and have added this to our subsection “Limitations”:</p><p>“Although our acoustic simulations were based on individualized brain imaging and transducer positions were captured by neuronavigation, the simulations are limited to two-dimensions, and the tissues are treated as homogenous layers due to absence of CT-derived density data which limits the fidelity of the estimated focus”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3f) Figure 3A: The location and orientation of corticospinal output neurons in M1 is incorrect and misleading.

Because the transducer was concentric with the intersection of the TMS coil, wherever you put the coil is where the US was. Is that accurate? How did you confirm this however in your models if you did not use individual MRI but rather normalized MRI. MNI coordinates are mentioned previously but not given anywhere in the manuscript. TUS is highly localized and using generalized MNI coordinates is not appropriate.

As mentioned in point 3a, the phrasing “normalized MRI” was misplaced in the manuscript. We only used normalized coordinates to generate the electromagnetic current map in Figure 2A. Individualized locations were used for acoustic simulation, and based on the simulation, a portion of the M1 gray matter, as well as underlying white matter was targeted for each participant with the sonication beam.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) There is no data on how/if the transducer affected the TMS pulse or vice versa.

We also cite Legon et al., 2018’s validation studies, which used the same 70-mm TMS coil as ours, and a custom transducer with similar dimensions and non-ferromagnetic properties. Of note, our transducer is constructed to be MRI-safe, and contains a non-ferromagnetic (brass) housing and is designed with a radiofrequency shield.</p><p>We now add, in our subsection “Limitations”:</p><p>“Lastly, we did not explicitly characterize the effect of the TMS-induced electromagnetic field on the operation of the ultrasound transducer, nor the effects of the transducer housing on the coil’s induced electrical field.

This can be easily detected using imaging mode of your transducer. Was this checked for? Was any other coupling media used?</p></disp-quote><p>Although our custom TUS transducer does not feature the software or hardware to allow image reconstruction, we have performed additional experiments with a dedicated imaging ultrasound system (Hitachi Aloka ProSound Α 7) to validate the lack of air bubbles between two relevant interfaces, using our methodology.</p><p>(Newly added Appendix 2)</p><p>Panel A: Visible air bubble at the TUS transducer-gel interface, indicated by the red arrow (left), and corresponding refraction and shadowing artifact seen when an imaging transducer is placed over the air bubble (right).</p><p>Panel B: Manual smoothing of the gel pad is performed until any small bubbles are extruded, leaving a homogenous black interface (left), and confirmatory imaging with ultrasound probe at the gel pad surface shows no artefact at the TUS transducer-gel interface (right).</p><p>Panel C: Application of gel pad over the frontal bone with the imaging transducer applied over the gel, visualizing the scalp-pad interface (left).

The TMS pulses were locked to the end of FUS or sham stimulation and they had an interstimulus interval of 5 seconds. If there was no jitter for TMS pulses it means that rTMS at 0.2 Hz was applied simultaneously with FUS. Repetitive TMS applied at a very low frequency of 0.2 Hz has been shown to be effective in several studies (Urushihara, 2006; Hosono, 2008). For example, rTMS over PMC led to an increase in somatosensory evoked potentials. Could the possible effect of low frequency rTMS on cortical excitability when applied simultaneously with FUS be discussed?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this important question. We do not believe low-frequency rTMS will affect motor evoked potentials (MEP), as supported by three papers we cited and describe below:</p><p>1) Chen et al., 1997 conducted 0.1 Hz rTMS for 1 hour (360 pulses) and did not find motor cortical excitability changes.</p><p>2) Furukawa et al., 2010 carried out 100 sessions of M1 TMS at the same frequency as our inter-stimulus interval (0.2 Hz), and showed that MEP amplitude were neither enhanced nor reduced.</p><p>3) Cincotta et al.,2003 found that MEP size is not changed after 0.3 Hz rTMS intervention to M1 (total 540 pulses).</p><p>Overall, the rTMS frequency in these studies ranged from 0.1-0.3 Hz, with up to 540 pulses, without significantly altering MEP size. In our study, we tested sham and real FUS interventions with 15-20 frames per condition, with TMS delivered at 0.2Hz, and showed suppression of MEP size under certain condition. The short duration of TMS trains alone should not affect the MEP amplitude.</p><p>The two papers mentioned by the reviewer were done by the same group and show that 0.2 Hz rTMS can enhance the SEP N30 ratio. However, the stimulation target (pre-motor sensory cortex) and readout (SEP) were different from those in our study, which was the M1 and MEPs, respectively</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8a) A further concern is &quot;This sound was triggered every time a FUS or sham condition was delivered to the transducer.&quot; This could mean that the effects reflect acoustic TMS pairing, see e.g. doi: 10.3389/fnhum.2014.00398, other papers are around as well. Can the results in Figure 5D be due to longer acoustic stimulation? I expect the sham condition to be performed with the shortest duration, however not sure? Can this explain the lack of an effect in Figure 5E and F?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the opportunity to clarify our choice of auditory control, and we detail our rationale in the Discussion. We recognize that several studies show that pairing TMS with an audible stimulus, especially human speech, can lead to increases in cortical excitability. Since the piezoelectric element within our ultrasound transducer emits a slightly audible buzzing tone when activated, also reported in other human FUS studies (eg: Legon et al., 2018), it was precisely to control for acoustic-TMS coupling that we decided to implement an audible masking sound in all conditions of the experiment.</p><p>To elaborate, we ensured that the audible masking sound was played for the same duration of time (0.5 seconds) for every experimental condition, including the sham, regardless of the parameters, relative to the TMS pulse. Furthermore, our sound did not consist of speech – rather it was a low-volume continuous high-pitched tone. Studies that have examined the TMS motor response of the hand area to different auditory stimuli (doi: 10.1046/j.1460-9568.2003.02774.x, Figure 3 (bottom) ) have shown that concomitant noise/tonal sounds do not alter the magnitude of MEP, while language perception significantly <italic>increases</italic> motor excitability. In agreement, studies examining TMS motor response of the leg (doi: 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2008.05.015, Figure 3) and tongue (doi: 10.1046/j.0953-816x.2001.01874.x) show a motor facilitation with semantic speech stimuli, but not with audible tonal sounds or noise. In our study, we did not find facilitation, but rather decreased excitability with application of transcranial ultrasound to the hand area of M1, while controlling for audible tones in all delivered conditions including sham.</p><p>The study referenced by the reviewer (doi: 10.3389/fnhum.2014.00398) found that acoustic-TMS pairing elicits significantly larger MEPs relative to a control condition without associated auditory stimulus. In all conditions within our experiments, the TMS pulse was preceded by an auditory stimulus of duration 0.5s, and we therefore expect that any TMS-acoustic pairing would be controlled for.</p><p>Interestingly, while writing these revisions, we came across a relevant preprint which examined audio masked vs. unmasked delivery of FUS/sham conditions (doi:10.1101/2020.03.07.982033). Of particular interest are Figure 1C and Figure 2A, showing that an audio-masked FUS sonication and audio-masked sham evoke <italic>identical</italic> auditory ERP's, whereas FUS alone without a mask evokes a significantly different ERP, and moreover can also be reliably differentiated from sham by participants. We believe this preliminary report corroborates our similar audio masking strategy, and highlights the importance of controlling for auditory confounds in future human ultrasound neuromodulation studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8b) Also: &quot;and the task was more complex; nevertheless, the sonication parameters and cortical location were similar, and we observed an effect size of about 100 ms, though with higher variability.&quot; It may simply be that the start of the sonification sound leads via a kind of pre-triggering to shortened responses. This is discussed by the authors in subsection “Behaviour”. The effect in Figure 8A appears to be implausibly high. Control experiments seem to be reasonable with very light somatosensoric or close to threshold acoustic stimulation. The whole field of TMS-EEG suffers from acoustic and somatosensory contamination.</p></disp-quote><p>Although we control for auditory contamination with a masking sound, we agree with the reviewer that the start of sonication may contribute to a somatosensory pre-triggering, predisposing to shortened responses. We discuss this in Subsection “Behaviour”:</p><p>“Although the slightly audible sound of the piezoelectric transducer element was masked until participants could not distinguish between sham and active condition, we cannot rule out intersensory facilitation (Diederich and Colonius, 1987; Forster et al., 2002) as contributing to the difference in reaction times between conditions. Given that acoustic waves are mechanical in nature, it is conceivable that a subtle tactile sensation on the scalp at the site of transducer placement might act as an extra sensory cue which is difficult to replicate with a sham protocol that delivers no acoustic energy”</p><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have conducted an additional control experiment with the additional 4 participants we recruited during the revision process. The results are seen in revised Figure 8, top panels. We analyze these results with paired t-test in the Results section, and discuss in subsection “Behaviour”:</p><p><bold>“</bold>In a follow-up control experiment with 4 participants, the reaction times were not significantly different when a lower near-somatosensory threshold intensity (0.54 W/cm<sup>2</sup>) was used when compared to the 2.32 W/cm<sup>2</sup> intensity used in all other experiments. Since individual somatosensory thresholds differ, and the threshold of transcranial acoustic energy necessary to affect motor tasks is unknown, further experiments are necessary to disentangle the role of somatosensory confounding in this behavioral task.”</p><p>In light of this control experiment, we have also added to the Abstract: “…and decreased reaction time on a visuomotor task compared to sham but not compared to a near-threshold intensity.”</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>Fomenko et al., have thoroughly revised their manuscript. They added four new participants (now N = 16) with more trials (15-20 instead of 10 per condition), as well as more TUS modelling information. While this is not a large increase in sample size, the authors' efforts are appreciated. However, both the reviewers and the editors were concerned by the fact that the effects are robust for the 'block' experiment but not for the 'parameter' (or interleaved) experiment. Consequently, additional data should be collected in a sufficiently large sample (eg. keeping the N = 16 for interleaved and adding N = 16 for a blocked variation of stimulation parameters), targeting specifically the block vs. interleaved question for the duty cycle and pulse repetition frequency parameters.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the opportunity to revise our manuscript. The reviewer and editor comments were insightful and have resulted in a stronger publication.</p><p>As requested by the reviewers, we have called back 16 healthy participants, in order to address the concern in the original manuscript; namely, that varying some sonication parameters (ie: PRF and DC) in blocked versus interleaved design yielded different effects on TMS-elicited MEP, whereas other parameters (ie: Sonication Duration) yielded robust effects regardless of experimental design.</p><p>For each participant, six new experiments were performed. The parameters examined were Duty Cycle (Sham, 10%, 30%, 50%), PRF constant duty cycle (Sham, 200Hz, 500Hz, 1000Hz), and PRF adjusted duty cycle (Sham, 200Hz, 500Hz, 1000Hz). For each individual parameter including sham, 15 replicate MEPs were acquired either serially in blocked fashion, or randomly interleaved with other parameters. We describe the protocol in detail in the Materials and methods section, and have used a rest period of 20 seconds between blocks, consistent with doi:10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2015.10.001. All parameters including sham were identically masked with a speaker tone lasting 0.5 during sonication. The results are discussed below in response to point 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Regarding the block vs. interleaved question:</p><p>If it makes indeed a difference for single trial MEP modulation whether TUS is applied in a block design with fixed parameters or with trial-by-trial variation of parameters, this would have important implications for TUS application and thus needs additional data collection, as well as detailed discussion. Specifically, for some parameters (sonication duration) the default parameter (0.5s) was effective in the interleaved design. However, for others (duty cycle) it was slightly different (10% instead of 30%), and for yet others (pulse repetition frequency) it was not different from sham anymore at all (but was previously with 1000 Hz). The blocked vs. interleaved interpretation is post-hoc and potentially valid only for duty cycle and pulse repetition frequency.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see additional figure added to the manuscript (Figure 5—figure supplement 1), as well as new results and in the Discussion section, where we write:</p><p>“Interestingly, our initial results show that although a particular combination of parameters can robustly suppress TMS-elicited cortical activity when applied in a sham-controlled block design (Figure 4), some parameters such as PRF when randomized and varied individually do not have the same robust effect, whereas others such as sonication duration do (Figure 5C-D). To address this discrepancy, we conducted follow-up experiments (Figure 5—figure supplement 1) in which we delivered three distinct parameter sets in blocked, and interleaved fashion. We found that sonication at 10% DC consistently results in suppression regardless of experimental design, whereas 30% DC only results in suppression when applied in blocked fashion. A duty cycle of 50% did not show any difference compared to sham regardless of experimental design. In contrast, we observed that sonication at three different pulse repetition frequencies (200, 500, and 1000 Hz) applied in a blocked design resulted in reduced cortical excitability compared to sham, whereas interleaving these parameters yielded no significant difference. These results held whether duty cycle was fixed, or whether the DC was adjusted to maintain an equal burst duration.</p><p>In summary, our findings suggest that when delivered in blocked fashion, longer sonication durations, lower duty cycles, and all three PRFs tested yield effective suppression of TMS-elicited MEPs. The trend towards greater suppression with increasing blocked PRF agree with recent literature, where higher PRF (1500Hz) in combination with low duty cycles were found to be more effective than lower PRF (300Hz) in neuromodulation of mouse motor cortex in vivo (King et al., 2013) and in vitro (Manuel et al., 2020). Furthermore, recent large animal studies reveal a bidirectional neuromodulation effects of varying TUS parameters (Yoon et al., 2019). As such, interleaving different parameters in short succession may lead to spillover effects, due to the random order of parameter delivery. From animal studies where randomized delivery of TUS parameters was studied, nonlinear effects were also found, which may be related to non-linear piezoelectric accumulation across the neural membrane capacity under the Neuronal Bilayer Sonophore model (Kim et al., 2014; Plaksin et al., 2014). In addition, excitatory or inhibitory changes in short-term plasticity may occur with repeated TUS stimulation, similar to those observed with repeated magnetic (Watanabe et al., 2014) and electrical stimulation (Udupa et al., 2016). These are currently under study in our laboratory and in emerging reports on LITUS short-term plasticity in animal models (Yu et al., 2019).”</p><p>Further experiments are ongoing in our lab to investigate the potential longer-term plasticity effects of FUS on the motor cortex, as well as potential nonlinear effects of individual FUS parameters.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors added 4 subjects to the existing data set (N = 12) but the reviewers fail to see the significance of this. First, data from the original 12 is presented in Figure 4 and the data from the new N = 4 is presented on its own. Could the authors explain the added value of this? It looks from the manuscript that N = 16 was inclusive for the parameter testing but not the 'basic parameter' testing. The authors could either remove Figure 4C or include that data in Figure 4A.</p></disp-quote><p>We presented the additional n=4 subjects in a separate panel of Figure 4 because these subjects received a different form of sham (inactive sham, or unpowered transducer facing the scalp) from the original n=12 subjects (active sham, or transducer flipped away from the scalp and powered, as in Legon, 2018). Given the active debate over the role of auditory confounds in the FUS neuromodulation literature as well as the first set of reviewer questions regarding our sham approach, we demonstrated that both forms of sham were able to suppress TMS-elicited MEPs, and then proceeded to use the Inactive sham for the remainder of the experiments, since it was less cumbersome and did not require manually flipping the transducer. We clarify in the revised Figure 4 caption:</p><p>“Effect of baseline ultrasound versus active and inactive sham on TMS-induced resting MEP amplitudes as measured by FDI EMG. A) Baseline parameters suppressed mean MEP amplitude compared to active sham, or powered transducer pointing upwards (p=0.002, paired t-test) N=12. B) Individual MEP values by participant by condition C) Baseline parameters suppressed mean MEP amplitude compared to inactive sham, or unpowered transducer pointing towards the scalp (p=0.012, paired t-test) N=4.&quot;</p><p>The reviewers are also directed to Figure 9, where the two types of sham are illustrated for clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is still unclear how many MEPs were left for each participant for the statistical analysis after exclusion. It looks like the new data uses 15 trials but the old 10 and the block experiment 20. Furthermore, it is stated in the Materials and methods that MEPs {plus minus} 2SD of mean were excluded. Please include M+/-SD in the Materials and methods.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are correct in that new data uses either 15 or 20 trials per parameter, compared to the old data using 10. This was done as per the first revision reviewer request to increase the number of replicate trials per condition, and decrease the number of comparison.</p><p>In light of the reviewer comments regarding outlier exclusion, we have also chosen to now include all data, and use the median as the measure of central tendency for replicate trials in the TMS experiments including the new blocked vs. interleaved trials.

Also, do the results hold when not removing the outliers?</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned in Point 3, we have now decided to include all data and use the median as measure of central tendency; therefore, outliers are now no longer excluded. Please see revised manuscript and figures, where we demonstrate that our results hold.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Why was the neuronavigation system not used to online maintain coil/transducer position? Coil angle cannot be reliably inferred from a felt pen drawing on the scalp.</p></disp-quote><p>We chose not to use online neuronavigation, which we now explicitly mention and discuss in the subsection “Limitations”. Our rationale was that we prioritized positioning the coil/transducer assembly at the TMS motor “hotspot”, to best achieve consistent motor-evoked potentials. We show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> the relevant markings we use on the TMS-TUS stimulator to ensure a precise surface positioning (contour tracing) and angulation (directional marking).

Individual simulations for each participant coronal sections can be found in Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</p><p>Given that our study goal was not computational, and that the beam models are at best a two-dimensional approximation, which we mention in the limitations, we did not choose to pursue sophisticated 3D beam modelling, which we reserve for a future study, and therefore do not include an axial slice model. We also agree with the reviewers that the axial slices are not very helpful with respect to ascertaining which portion of the M1 was targeted. Instead, our 2D simulations serve as a post-hoc validation that our beam paths likely traversed the primary motor cortex and underlying corticospinal tracts.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The new results demonstrate that the effectiveness of TUS parameters does indeed depend on whether TUS parameters are varied across trials or kept constant within a block. These additional findings are important and will be very useful for others using this approach. These results though also point to one important question that we believe should be in the published study: Are the results in the block design condition due to cumulative effects? That is, is there a systematic change over time, indicative of a cumulative effect? (To quote the reviewer who noted this concern, &quot;Specifically, is there a build-up of suppression across trials within a block? This could be tested e.g. by regressing the MEP amplitude based on within-block trial number or by comparing early and late MEPs within a block. It would be a very important outcome to know whether the observed suppression is instantaneous or accumulating across trials.&quot;).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing us toward an interesting analysis which might shed light into the potential mechanisms involved in our findings. In our revised manuscript, we now perform a post-hoc analysis of our blocked experiments, stratifying by trial number across all participants (Please see new Figure 5—figure supplement 2).</p><p>Similar to Volpert-Esmond et al., (2017), and also suggested by the reviewer, we then compare early trials (defined as the first 3 trials, or the first 20%) to late trials (last 3 trials, or last 20% of trials) of each parameter. We add the analytic methods and discussion to the revised manuscript as tracked changes.</p><p>On paired T-tests corrected for multiple comparisons, we do not detect a significant difference between the early and late trials across the three parameter sets. Please see the revised Results section for corrected p-values, which are non-significant.</p><p>We now add to our Discussion:</p><p>“To test whether a progressive accumulation of inhibition might be responsible for the observed difference in results between the blocked and interleaved study designs, we performed a post-hoc analysis of our blocked experiments, stratifying by trial number across all participants (Figure 5 – figure supplement 2). Within each parameter condition, we did not detect a significant difference between the magnitude of early and late trials and conclude that there is no temporal accumulation of MEP suppressive effects over blocks of fifteen trials, corresponding to a block length of approximately 90 seconds. Instead, the suppression appears to be instantaneous, with effective parameters increasing the likelihood of generating a lower TMS-elicited MEP, but not potentiating the effect of a subsequent stimulation. Notably, our blocked design features a 20 second pause between each set of 15 replicate stimulations – whereas interleaved delivery of random parameters involves an uninterrupted session of 60 random stimulations. We speculate that this 20 second rest period may lead to a resetting of cortical excitability to a more TUS-sensitive state. The lack of resetting could play a role in our observation of less robust effects when certain parameters are randomized in succession.”</p><p>Dedicated study designs will be needed to answer the question of both short-term and long-term effects of TUS, as well as its on-line and off-line interaction with TMS. Further questions to be answered include the role of somatosensory confounds/masking, as well as the use of on-line TMS navigation for targeting verification from trial to trial.</p></body></sub-article></article>
