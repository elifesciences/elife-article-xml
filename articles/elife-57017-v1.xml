disorder characterized by motor disturbances. HD pathology is most prominent in the striatum, the central hub of the basal ganglia. The cerebral cortex is the main striatal afferent, and progressive cortico-striatal disconnection characterizes HD. We mapped striatal network dysfunction in HD mice to ultimately modulate the activity of a specific cortico-striatal circuit to ameliorate motor symptoms and recover synaptic plasticity. Multimodal MRI in vivo indicates cortico-striatal and thalamo-striatal functional network deficits and reduced glutamate/glutamine ratio in the striatum of HD mice. Moreover, optogenetically-induced glutamate release from M2 cortex terminals in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) was undetectable in HD mice and striatal neurons show blunted electrophysiological responses. Remarkably, repeated M2-DLS optogenetic stimulation normalized motor behavior in HD mice and evoked a sustained increase of synaptic plasticity. Overall, these results reveal that selective stimulation of the M2-DLS pathway can become an effective therapeutic strategy in HD.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>long-term depression</kwd><kwd>basal ganglia</kwd><kwd>cortico-striatal</kwd><kwd>motor behaviour</kwd><kwd>striatum</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Spanish Ministry of Sciences, Innovation and Universities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SAF2017-88076-R</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alberch</surname><given-names>Jordi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004587</institution-id><institution>Instituto de Salud Carlos III</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RETICS (RD06/0010/0006)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alberch</surname><given-names>Jordi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007601</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020 - Research and Innovation Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant Agreement No. 863214</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Masana</surname><given-names>Mercè</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008666</institution-id><institution>Fundació la Marató de TV3</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alberch</surname><given-names>Jordi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>María de Maeztu Unit of Excellence, Institute of Neurosciences, University of Barcelona, Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MDM-2017-0729</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alberch</surname><given-names>Jordi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>M2 cortex-dorsolateral striatum circuit is functionally altered in Huntington's disease and, by boosting its activity, we reverse symptoms at behavioral, physiological, and morphological level in symptomatic mice.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Huntington’s disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder with symptomatic manifestations, including involuntary movements such as chorea, dystonia, poor motor coordination, psychiatric, and cognitive symptoms. HD is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin (Htt) gene that translates into a polyglutamine tract in the Htt protein. Mutant Htt (mHtt) is expressed throughout the brain and disrupts a wide range of molecular pathways and signaling cascades, yet HD pathology is most prominent in the basal ganglia circuitry.</p><p>The central hub of the basal ganglia is the striatum, which controls movements and behavior through a myriad of inputs and outputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Calabresi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Freeze et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rothwell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rueda-Orozco and Robbe, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tecuapetla et al., 2016</xref>). The striatum receives glutamatergic inputs from all neocortical areas and the thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bolam et al., 2000</xref>). Information flows from the cortex through the basal ganglia and it goes back to the cortex via the thalamus through two main pathways (direct and indirect), which orchestrate the proper execution of movement. Additionally, the specific origin of the cortical inputs to the striatum provides a substrate for information segregation in these circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hintiryan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wall et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In HD, motor symptoms emerge from dysregulated information flow through the basal ganglia circuits. Disturbances of the cortico-striatal communication have a leading role in HD network dysfunction, with alterations appearing in prodromal HD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burgold et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dumas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Unschuld et al., 2012</xref>). Specifically, the caudate nucleus and the premotor cortex are predominantly affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Unschuld et al., 2012</xref>). In HD mouse models, there is abundant evidence of a progressive disconnection between cortex and striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cepeda et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Veldman and Yang, 2018</xref>). Cortico-striatal dysfunction in HD is strongly supported by the impaired cortico-striatal-dependent motor functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Puigdellívol et al., 2015</xref>), altered paired-pulse facilitation at cortico-striatal synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Milnerwood and Raymond, 2007</xref>), reduction of striatal excitatory postsynaptic currents with loss of cortico-striatal synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cepeda et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deng et al., 2013</xref>); and altered glutamate release in the striatum of transgenic R6/1 mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nicniocaill et al., 2001</xref>). Moreover, reducing mHtt in the striatum is not sufficient to revert HD neurodegeneration, while reducing mHtt expression in both striatum and cortex ameliorates behavioral and neuropathological features of HD animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, a progressive disconnection of cortico-striatal pathways alters the information processing in basal ganglia circuitry, leading to motor disturbances. However, we do not know yet if specific cortico-striatal pathways are affected.</p><p>In this study, we aimed to further map cortico-striatal dysfunction in HD by using in vivo multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques in the R6/1 HD mouse model. We took advantage of optogenetic tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>) and high-resolution cortico-striatal maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hintiryan et al., 2016</xref>) to modulate cortico-striatal function in HD mice. More specifically, we modulated the secondary motor (M2) cortex projection to dorsolateral striatum (DLS), whose structural alterations have been previously reported in HD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hintiryan et al., 2016</xref>). Then, we used optogenetics coupled to in vivo microdialysis and to ex vivo multi-electrode arrays (MEAs) to characterize cortico-striatal dysfunction in symptomatic HD mice. With this knowledge, we aimed to test novel therapeutic interventions based on circuit restoration, an approach previously found successful for other basal ganglia disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gradinaru et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kravitz et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Strikingly, selective optogenetic stimulation of the M2-DLS afferent pathway successfully rectified motor learning and coordination deficits in symptomatic HD mice. These effects were associated with improvements in synaptic plasticity such as induced long-term depression (LTD) and normalization of spine density within the striatum of HD mice. Our findings reveal that the function of the M2 cortex-DLS circuit is deeply impaired in the present HD mouse model, and indicate that selective stimulation of this pathway induces long-lasting plasticity effects that significantly ameliorate motor symptoms in HD.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The striatum of HD mice shows decreased functional connectivity with afferent regions during rest</title><p>To evaluate distinct striatal circuit alterations in the transgenic R6/1 mouse model of HD, we studied the functional connectivity using resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) in ~20-week-old R6/1 mice. First, the analysis of the whole–brain network showed reduced strength (p = 0.037) and global efficiency (p = 0.029) in HD mice compared to WT mice, as assessed by the Student's t-test. In a more specific manner, we evaluated functional connectivity using seed-based analysis between the striatum and selected brain regions involved in basal ganglia function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary files 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">2</xref>). We found that the striatum from the left hemisphere in HD mice showed a positive correlation with a smaller brain area (252 ± 77 mm<sup>3</sup>) than the corresponding in WT mice (335 ± 17 mm<sup>3</sup>; p = 0.00016, Student's t-test). Then, to evaluate functional connectivity differences, we measured the mean correlation value for the regions of interest, automatically identified based on a mouse brain atlas, and analyzed genotype differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Two-way ANOVA showed a significant genotype effect (F<sub>(1,22)</sub> = 14.70; p = 0.0009) and brain region effect (F<sub>(7,154)</sub> = 20.67; p &lt; 0.0001) but no region/interaction effect (F<sub>(7,154)</sub> = 0.6326; p = 0.7). Compared to WT, the left striatum of HD mice showed reduced functional connectivity with left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC; p = 0.0399), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC; p = 0.0058), M2 cortex (p = 0.0055), M1 cortex (p = 0.0197), cingulate left (p = 0.006), somatosensory cortex (p = 0.007), and thalamus (p = 0.0436) but not globus pallidus (p = 0.0796), as shown by Bonferroni post hoc test.

Both, WT-YFP and WT-ChR2 mice, presented a significant decrease in the amplitude of evoked fPSC following the LTD protocol that lasted at least 30 min, indicating cortico-striatal LTD induction. LTD was also slightly induced in HD-YFP, but to a less extent than WT-YFP (Student's t-test, p = 0.0150). In the same conditions, stable LTD was induced in HD-ChR2 animals to the same extent as WT mice. Two-way ANOVA showed a mice group/time interaction (F<sub>(273, 4277)</sub> = 1.573; p &lt; 0.0001), time effect (F<sub>(91, 4277)</sub> = 111.9; p &lt; 0.0001) and group effect (F<sub>(3,47)</sub> = 3.312; p = 0.0279) and main group effects showed differences between HD-YFP and HD-ChR2 (p = 0.04), as shown by Bonferroni post hoc test. Indeed, similar results were obtained when analyzing the average of the fPSC amplitude after TBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). Here, two-way ANOVA showed a genotype/stimulation interaction (F<sub>(1,47)</sub> = 5.621; p = 0.0219), and Bonferroni’s post hoc test showed that optogenetic stimulation restored the ability to induce LTD in HD mice.</p><p>To examine whether improved cortico-striatal synaptic function correlated with plasticity changes, we evaluated spine density from Golgi-impregnated striatal MSNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f–g</xref>). Spine density in striatal MSNs from HD mice was reduced compared to WT mice, as previously shown for MSNs from 3-month-old YAC128 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marco et al., 2013</xref>) and for hippocampal apical dendrites from R6/1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miguez et al., 2015</xref>). Repeated optogenetic stimulation increased spine density in HD mice, without altering spine density in WT mice, as indicated by two-way ANOVA with genotype (F<sub>(1,94) </sub>= 56.52; p &lt; 0.001), stimulation (F<sub>(1,94) </sub>= 14.29; p &lt; 0.0003) and interaction effect (F<sub>(1,94) </sub>= 11.77; p &lt; 0.0009).

In particular, cortico-striatal disconnection has a prominent role in disease progression. Here we further characterized cortico-striatal functional alterations in the symptomatic HD mouse. Also, our data highlight that the M2-DLS pathway is profoundly compromised in our R6/1 mouse model of HD. Modulation of brain circuits using optogenetic tools has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy in many neurological disorders, such as Parkinson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gradinaru et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kravitz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Magno et al., 2019</xref>), stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tennant et al., 2017</xref>), and psychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fuchikami et al., 2015</xref>). In this line, we aimed to restore circuit function in HD by increasing selected cortico-striatal activity in symptomatic mice. Indeed, we provide strong evidence that we can ameliorate HD symptoms in symptomatic HD mice by stimulating the M2 cortex-DLS pathway.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Cortico-striatal functional connectivity and glutamate transmission are reduced in HD mice</title><p>Our results indicate general cortico-striatal and thalamo-striatal functional connectivity deficits in HD mice, which are in line with previously described alterations in striatal inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reiner and Deng, 2018</xref>). However, synaptic loss, as well as electrophysiological responses in cortico-striatal or thalamo-striatal circuits, are differentially affected in HD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kolodziejczyk and Raymond, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Parievsky et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reiner and Deng, 2018</xref>). Also, topographically selective changes in the cortex explain the clinical heterogeneity found in HD. For example, larger primary motor cortex degeneration correlates with motor impairments while cingulate cortex degeneration correlates with predominant mood symptomatology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Estrada-Sánchez and Rebec, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rosas et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Thu et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, further understanding how specific inputs to the striatum are altered could help to better understand the progression of HD symptoms.</p><p>Indeed, the cortex comprises the primary source of striatal glutamate, however, whether its total levels are altered in HD remains unclear. Cortical and striatal metabolites, measured by <sup>1</sup>H MRS, are known to be profoundly altered in symptomatic HD models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zacharoff et al., 2012</xref>), and glutamate concentration, measured by GluCEST, is known to be reduced in different brain regions, including most of the basal ganglia nuclei involved in motor behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pépin et al., 2016</xref>). In our R6/1 mouse model, we also obtained divergent results. Brain metabolites, measured using <sup>1</sup>H MRS, showed significant changes in line to the ones observed in KI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pépin et al., 2016</xref>), R6/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tkac et al., 2007</xref>), and in vitro MRS striatal extracts from R6/2 mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jenkins et al., 2000</xref>). However, when evaluating absolute glutamate values by <sup>1</sup>H MRS as well as baseline glutamate levels using microdialysis, we failed to show total glutamate alterations in the striatum of HD mice, in line with the unaltered glutamate levels described in R6/2 mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zacharoff et al., 2012</xref>). Conversely, GluCEST values indicate reduced glutamate concentration in both striatum and cortical regions. While further studies are needed to clarify alterations of total glutamate levels (which includes non-synaptic sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ramadan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van der Zeyden et al., 2008</xref>]); the glutamate/glutamine ratio (whose value is linked to functional/released synaptic glutamate) is consistently reduced in the striatum of HD mice, indicating that glutamatergic neurotransmission is defective in HD.</p><p>We then evaluated glutamate release from cortical terminals. Optogenetic stimulation of cortical afferents in the striatum induced a small glutamate increase in WT mice but failed to detect increases in glutamate (over baseline levels) in HD mice, indicating deficits in glutamate release in symptomatic stages. This effect is further supported by the blunted electrophysiological response to M2 optogenetic acute stimulation observed in the striatum of HD mice. Although previous work described higher glutamate release in R6/1 mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nicniocaill et al., 2001</xref>), these discrepancies could be explained by the different location of the microdialysis probe (dorsomedial striatum [DMS] versus DLS), mice age (16 versus 20 week-old-mice), and strategy to induce glutamate release (application of KCl at high concentration or NMDA versus selective optogenetic stimulation), which makes challenging to evaluate and compare sources of the glutamate measured (cortico-striatal versus thalamic or even astrocytic).</p><p>Moreover, convergent evidence indicates impaired glutamate release in HD, although most of them rely on electrophysiological measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Estrada-Sánchez and Rebec, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Klapstein et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Milnerwood and Raymond, 2007</xref>). Indeed, the monitoring of synaptic changes during the progression of HD in the YAC128 model reported biphasic age-dependent alterations of the cortico-striatal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Joshi et al., 2009</xref>). Asymptomatic HD mice present increased glutamate release, postsynaptic currents, and synaptic responses. However, there is a shift in the three parameters as symptoms appear, which are maintained at late stages. Thus, symptomatic YAC128 mice exhibit reduced glutamate release, postsynaptic currents, and synaptic responses. Altogether, these data indicate that reduced glutamate release from the cortex, at least in late stages of the disease, might lead the basal ganglia network alterations found in HD patients.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Motor alterations in HD involve M2 cortex-DLS cortico-striatal dysfunction</title><p>Motor learning and coordination have been extensively characterized in animal models of HD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Creus-Muncunill et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Puigdellívol et al., 2015</xref>). In this work, we support the idea that M2-DLS activity is necessary for the proper execution of motor learning and coordination tasks, as by manipulating this specific cortico-striatal subcircuit we restore motor defects in pathological HD mice. Indeed, M2 lesions impair acquisition and reversal of a simple sequence consisting of two lever presses, one distal and the other proximal to reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yin, 2009</xref>). Also, there is an extensive functional reorganization in the striatum during different phases of learning during a motor learning task, such as accelerated rotarod (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yin, 2009</xref>) or serial order task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rothwell et al., 2015</xref>). This includes initial predominant activity in DMS during early training, while extensive training engages DLS, indicating that DLS has a crucial role in the completion of a learned sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rothwell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yin, 2009</xref>). Moreover, the activity of MSNs from direct or indirect output pathways in the DLS also experiences divergent firing patterns during a motor learning task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jin et al., 2014</xref>). Action initiation correlates to increased activity in both dMSNs and iMSNs in DLS, and, as the action sequence progress, most iMSNs reduce firing rate while dMSNs exhibit sustained activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rothwell et al., 2015</xref>). Taking this together, we suggest that our M2-DLS optogenetic stimulation might strengthen the ability to complete a motor learning task in HD mice.</p><p>In this line, the proportion of cortico-striatal inputs to the direct or indirect pathways depends on the cortical subregion from where these inputs arise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wall et al., 2013</xref>). For example, the primary motor cortex sends axonal projections to a greater extent to the indirect pathway, while the sensory cortex projects more to the direct pathway, and the secondary motor cortex projects similarly to both striatal output circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wall et al., 2013</xref>). Besides, cortical sparse long-range GABAergic projection neurons also modulate striatal output and motor behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Melzer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rock et al., 2016</xref>). Specifically, somatostatin, but not PV, GABAergic neurons from M2 inhibit movement by both D1 and D2 MSNs inhibition, while somatostatin GABA long-range projections from M1 increase movement by inhibiting cholinergic interneurons in the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Melzer et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, there is an urgent need to precisely map region and cell-specific striatal inputs to understand the functional organization of the cortico-striatal subcircuits and their impact on behavior, both under physiological and pathological conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Repeated M2 cortex-DLS stimulation leads to sustained synaptic plasticity changes and rectifies motor deficits in HD</title><p>Our data demonstrate that selective optogenetic stimulations induce long-lasting effects in neuronal plasticity and behavior, which are fundamental for brain rewiring in pathological conditions. Optogenetic stimulation of the infralimbic prefrontal cortex induces sustained antidepressant behavioral and synaptic effects (i.e. spine density; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fuchikami et al., 2015</xref>), and optogenetic stimulation of the motor cortex promotes functional recovery after stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>). Also, repeated cortico-striatal optogenetic stimulation generates persistent stereotypic behavior in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmari et al., 2013</xref>) that lasts at least 2 weeks, which is specifically dependent on the cortico-striatal subcircuit stimulated (i.e. orbitofrontal cortex [OFC]–ventromedial striatum [VMS]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmari et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast to our results, OFC–VMS stimulation induces grooming behavior in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmari et al., 2013</xref>), pointing out that the specific effects are dependent on the distinct cortico-striatal subcircuits.</p><p>More surprising was the finding that M2-DLS stimulation was able to ameliorate exploratory behavior and stereotypies in HD mice. Our data show a decrease in rearing and an increase in stereotypic grooming time in our R6/1 mice compared to WT, as was previously observed in KI mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pépin et al., 2016</xref>). Also, we were able to induce exploratory activity, measured as rearing time, and reduce stereotypic grooming in already symptomatic mice by M2-DLS optogenetic stimulation. Active exploration and grooming modulate cortico-striatal phase synchrony in R6/2 mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hong et al., 2012</xref>), indicating that cortico-striatal function is involved in these behaviors. Here we further demonstrate that these spontaneous behaviors can be modulated by the M2-DLS pathway, and again, the effects are persistent at least 1 week, as changes are already observed before the light stimulation over the sessions. Therefore, optogenetic manipulations at cortical circuits generate sustained synaptic plasticity changes. However, if the long-lasting effects are specific of cortical circuits or are a general feature of optogenetic stimulation remains to be determined.</p><p>Overall, we highlight cortico-striatal circuits to be deeply altered in symptomatic HD mice. Moreover, by taking advantage of optogenetic techniques, we demonstrated altered glutamate release from M2 cortical projection neurons and deficient response in the striatum in HD. In future studies, the ability to dissect the function of different cortico-striatal subcircuits in physiological and pathological conditions might help to further understand how mHtt alters the information processing in the basal ganglia. Here, we highlight a key role of the M2 cortex-DLS specific subcircuit in the modulation of motor alterations in HD, including exploratory behavior, stereotypies, motor learning, and coordination. In this context, we were able to successfully reestablish physiological, morphological, and behavioral alterations in our symptomatic HD mice by generating persistent synaptic plasticity in selected cortico-striatal circuits. Our successful approach opens new opportunities to design therapeutic strategies to ameliorate HD symptoms based on circuit restoration, which might be useful also for other basal ganglia disorders.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

On the one hand, whole-brain connectivity was evaluated using global network metrics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rubinov and Sporns, 2010</xref>) and on the other hand, a seed-based analysis was performed to evaluate the connectivity of the striatum with the rest of the brain.</p><p>For both approaches, rs-fMRI was preprocessed, including slice timing, motion correction by spatial realignment using SPM8, correction of EPI distortion by elastic registration to the T2-weighted volume using ANTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avants et al., 2008</xref>), detrend, smoothing with a full-width half maximum (FWHM) of 0.6 mm, frequency filtering of the time series between 0.01 and 0.1 Hz and regression by motion parameters. All these steps were performed using NiTime (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nipy.org/nitime">http://nipy.org/nitime</ext-link>).</p><p>The MRI-based atlas of the mouse brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ma, 2008</xref>) was considered for brain parcellation. To obtain more specific regions, the sensorimotor cortex defined in the original atlas was manually divided into somatosensory, orbitofrontal (OFC), motor 1 and 2 (M1, M2), cingulate, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and retrosplenial cortex. The atlas template was elastically registered to each subject T2-weighted volume using ANTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avants et al., 2008</xref>), and the resulting transformation was applied to the label map to obtain the individual brain parcellation.</p><p>Region parcellation was registered from the T2-weighted volume to the preprocessed mean rs-fMRI. The whole-brain functional brain network was estimated considering the gray matter regions obtained by parcellation as the network nodes. Connectivity between each pair of regions was estimated as the Fisher-z transform of the correlation between average time series in each region. Network organization was quantified using graph metrics, namely, strength, global, and local efficiency, and average clustering coefficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rubinov and Sporns, 2010</xref>).</p><p>To perform the seed-based analysis, the striatum was selected from the automatic parcellation. The average time series in the seed was computed and correlated with each voxel time series, resulting in a correlation map describing the connectivity of striatum with the rest of the brain. The following regions of interest were identified from brain parcellation to evaluate their connectivity with the seed region: striatum, globus pallidus, thalamus, and cingulate, somatosensory cortices, M1, M2, mPFC, and OFC cortices. Connectivity was quantified as the mean value of the correlation map in each region, considering only positive correlations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Metabolite quantification</title><p>LC-Model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Provencher, 1993</xref>) was used to quantify the MRS-detectable metabolites in the striatum of mice, fitting a basis set of 19 small metabolites and nine macromolecules. Quality criteria were defined for the whole spectrum as the FWHM lower than 0.06 ppm and the signal-to-noise ratio greater than 5. Also, metabolites quantified with relative Cramér-Rao lower bounds (CRLB) higher than 15% were discarded.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>GluCEST analysis</title><p>To assess glutamate from CEST acquisition, in-home scripts in python were developed to process and quantify GluCEST asymmetry.

For optogenetic modulation, an adeno-associated virus (AAV) containing Channelrhodopsin (ChR2) under CaMKII promotor was injected (AAV1-CaMKIIa-hChR2(H134H)-eYFP-WPRE.hGH; AAV-ChR2) and a control YFP construct (AAV1-CaMKIIa-eYFP-WPRE.hGH; AAV-YFP) was used as control. Virus production, amplification, and purification were performed by University of Pennsylvania-Penn Vector Core (titers: ~1 × 10<sup>12</sup> genomic particles/mL) and a volume of 0.5 μL of corresponding viral constructs was injected bilaterally in M2 cortex at the following coordinates: +2.46 anteroposterior (AP), ±1 mediolateral (L), and −0.8 mm dorsoventral (DV) from bregma and dura mater, using 5 μL Hamilton syringe with a 33 gauge needle at 0.1 μL/min. The injection needle was left for an additional 5 min period to allow diffusion of virus particles and avoid reflux.</p><p>For in vivo optogenetic stimulation, additional fiber-optic cannulas (MFC_200/240–0.22_3.5_ZF1.25_FLT; Doric Lenses) were placed bilaterally in the striatum at AP +0.14, L ± 2.2, DV −3 mm from bregma and dura mater and secured using dental cement. Optogenetic stimulation and behavioral testing were performed 4 weeks later.</p><p>For microdialysis experiments, AAV-YFP or AAV-CHR2 virus constructs were injected in the M2 as described above 4 weeks before the microdialysis procedure. After 4 weeks, one concentric dialysis probe equipped with a Cuprophan membrane (1.5 mm long) was implanted in the dorsal striatum at coordinates (in mm, from bregma and skull): AP −1.1 (with a 20° angle); L 2.2; DV - 4.5 from dura mater, in anesthetized mice (isoflurane, 5% induction and 1.5% maintenance).

Microdialysis experiments were performed in freely moving mice 24 hr (day 1) and 48 hr (day 2) after surgery. The artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) was pumped at 1.65 µL/min and dialysate samples were collected every 6 min in micro vials. Following an initial 3 hr stabilization period, six baseline samples were collected before 1 min optogenetic stimulation (sample 7, day 1) and 5 min stimulation (sample 7, day 2). Glutamate concentration was analyzed by a blind experimenter using an HPLC consisting in a Waters 717plus autosampler and a Waters 600 quaternary gradient pump, and a Phenomenex Gemini 5 μm 100 × 3 mm column. Dialysate samples were pre-column derivatized with OPA reagent by adding 90 μL distilled water to the 10 μL dialysate sample and followed by the addition of 15 μL of the OPA reagent. After 2.5 min reaction, 80 μL of this mixture was injected into the column. Glutamate was detected with a Waters 2475 Fluorescence detector using excitation and emission wavelength of 360 and 450 nm, respectively. Following sample collection, mice were sacrificed, their brains were removed, sectioned, and stained with neutral red to ensure proper probe placement.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Multi-electrode arrays</title><p>Mouse brain sagittal sections were obtained on a vibratome (Microm HM 650 V, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) at 350 μm thickness in oxygenated (95% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) containing (in mM) 124 NaCl, 24 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 13 glucose, 5 HEPES, 2.5 KCl, 2.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.2 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>. 1.3 MgSO<sub>4</sub>.

Electrophysiological data were recorded by a blind experimenter with MEA set-up from Multi Channel Systems MCS GmbH (Reutlingen, Germany) composed of 60 channels USB-MEA60-inv system with a blanking unit from Multi Channel Systems and the STG4004 current and voltage generator. Experiments were carried out with 60MEA200/30iR-ITO MEA dishes consisting of 60 planar electrodes arranged in an 8 × 8 array (200 μm distance between neighboring electrodes and an electrode diameter of 30 μm). The software for stimulation, recording, and signal processing were MC Stimulus and MC Rack from Multi Channel Systems.

For input/output curves, cortico-striatal fibers were stimulated with trains of three positive-negative identical pulses at increasing currents (5 s inter-pulse time; 30 s train intervals; 250–3000 μV currents). Then, the pulse amplitude of subsequent stimuli was set to evoke 40% of the saturating fPSC response in the input/output curve. Long-term depression (LTD) was induced by theta-burst stimulation (TBS) consisting of 10 trains spaced 15 s apart. Each train consisted of 10 bursts at 10.5 Hz (theta), and each burst consisted of four stimuli at 50 Hz. Thus, the whole TBS stimulation period lasted 2.5 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hawes et al., 2013</xref>). In all cases, the amplitude of the evoked fPSC was quantified.

Specifically, they focus on a deficit in frontostriatal connectivity, M2 cortex-dorsolateral striatum, and glutamate release and how this deficit might be rescued by optogenetic stimulation. The study reports decreased overall connectivity between cortex and striatum in the R6/1 mouse model of HD during the symptomatic stage. Specifically, the study implicates changes in structural and synaptic plasticity in the dorsolateral striatum, and that optogenetic stimulation of this circuit reverses those changes. Overall, the study provides new insight into cortical striatal disruption in HD.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) While no new experiments are required it is necessary to reframe the conclusions to support the results and/or provide additional statistical analyses to support some of the conclusions. See specific comments below. Additionally, please adjust the nomenclature when stating &quot;frontal cortex&quot; and contrasting with &quot;motor cortex&quot; and &quot;cingulate cortex.&quot; Use of frontal cortex (as in Figure 1) appears to refer only to M2, but this is unclear and perhaps the authors are also including OFC, PL, IL, etc). Another concern is that the motor cortex is part of the frontal cortex, thus more specific nomenclature should be used.</p><p>2) Please clarify the analyses presented in subsection “Frontal cortex, but not motor cortex, show diminished functional connectivity with the striatum during rest in HD mice”. For example, for the second two-way ANOVA, the authors refer to &quot;correlation values between left motor cortex and the same basal ganglia nuclei.&quot; But then the follow-up refers to frontal cortex, sensorimotor cortices cingulate cortices, and thalamus-not basal ganglia nuclei. Also, although correct, it would be easier to understand if &quot;correlation values&quot; were replaced with &quot;functional connectivity&quot; (since there is a two-way ANOVA to track as well). Finally, the summary focuses on cortico-striatal pathways only, whereas the results up until that point were heavily weighted to cortico-cortical and even cortical-thalamic connectivity.</p><p>3) The authors claim that an imbalance arises in functional BOLD connectivity between frontostriatal and motor-corticostriatal circuits and they state that &quot;different cortico-striatal pathways are distinctly altered in HD mice,&quot;. Although the reduction in motor cortex (M1) in R6/1 mice does not reach significance in Figure 1, it does not appear different than the reduction in frontostriatal connectivity. Further, the correlation between frontal cortex (M2) and striatum just reached significance (p=0.0447). Please provide additional post-hoc analysis to show statistically that the differences (between R6/1 and WT) are significantly different (between frontal-striatal and motor-striatal). This has implications for the M2 vs M1 distinction which should be clarified in the Discussion section. In the current form the results do not support the conclusions.</p><p>4) As the authors mention in the Introduction, the striatum receives glutamatergic inputs from all cortical areas, thus it is likely that other cortical regions outside of the M2 region are involved in the motor deficits. Please provide caution when suggesting that selective stimulation of the frontal cortex (M2)-striatal pathway is what improves, almost exclusively, behavioral, functional and morphological outcomes. In the current form the M2 afferent specificity is presented as a conceptual advance. To support this conclusion the authors would need to demonstrate their optogenetic manipulations are specific for the frontostriatal, rather than motor-corticostriatal circuit, especially since their primary behavioral readout is motor function. Since the selective stimulation of the primary motor cortex (M1)-striatal pathway is not included then the conclusions focused on M2 should be reframed. Additionally, please provide rationale as to why the same optical stimulation protocol to test the effects of the M1-striatal pathway on the HD phenotype, at least as a control to demonstrate differential effects?</p><p>5) Please clarify if the entire cerebral cortex or just the frontal and motor cortices were used in the MRS analysis.</p><p>6) The conclusion of decreased striatal glutamate occurring in R6/1 mice is based on a small difference in the CEST measurements. Further, this finding was not replicated using two other independent techniques (MRS and microdialysis [at baseline]). Thus, in the current form the claim of altered striatal glutamate in R6/1 mice is not supported. Please adjust the conclusions to reflect the present data.</p><p>7) Using microdialysis the authors show that optogenetic stimulation of M2 corticostriatal afferents leads to no detectable glutamate release in R6/1 mice. If optogenetically stimulating of M2 afferents in R6/1 mice does not lead to glutamate release in the striatum, how do the authors propose their optogenetic manipulations are improving striatal function? Clearly some glutamate must be released in order to detect fEPSCs in Figure 3.</p><p>8) Please also clarify why glutamate release and field potential measurements where not performed with M1 stimulation?</p><p>9) In Figure 3A, since the injection was in M2, please add a little syringe going into that region. This will help the reader.</p><p>10) The result in Figure 3C is quite striking. To determine that the M2-DLS pathway was targeted in both WT and R6/1 please provide histological images.</p><p>11) The spread of the injection site and resulting terminal fields and fibers in Figure 4C appears far outside of area M2 into other frontal regions. Please comment on this and the implications this has on the data interpretations.</p><p>12) The authors claim that the effects of optogenetic manipulation on open-field behavior are long-lasting (up to one week), but the analysis to support this conclusion was not performed. Instead, only summary statistics on the full 11-minutes of open-field exploration is reported. Please report comparisons of the effects from the 5-minute period of pre-stimulation across days to exclude the effects of the stimulation and immediate post-stimulation periods. In the post-hoc analysis (S4), none of those time-points are labeled significant.</p><p>13) Please clarify the focus on LTD, when rotarod performance is associated with LTP in the DLS (they do cite Yin, 2009). Moreover, this type of LTD appears to be largely intact in the R6/1 mice. The fact that LTD is modestly improved by optogenetic stimulation here is ambiguous, given there was no significant LTD deficit to begin with.</p><p>14) It is interesting that fiber tracts were not differentially affected, even though the spine density of MSNs showed significant spine loss. If, as the authors contend, the fronto-striatal pathway is more affected than the motor-striatal pathway, one would have expected differences in fiber tracts. Please discuss these conflicting findings.</p><p>15) Please clarify and rephrase the following sentence in the Discussion section as it is not clear in the present form. &quot;Our results indicate that cortical afferences rather than output pathways are predominantly affected during disease progression, highlighting that frontal cortex, rather than primary motor cortex, has a stronger contribution to the basal ganglia network dysfunction in HD&quot;.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your article &quot;M2 Cortex-Dorsolateral striatum stimulation reverses motor symptoms and synaptic deficits in Huntington's Disease&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, Fernandez-Garcia et al., attempted to dissect specific cortico-striatal pathways affected in Huntington's disease (HD). In particular, they examined fronto-striatal and primary motor-striatal connectivity in the R6/1 mouse model during the symptomatic stage (around 17-20 weeks of age). Using a wide array of methodologies, including in vivo functional MRI, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS), optogenetics coupled with in vivo microdialysis, ex vivo multielectrode arrays, GluCEST, Golgi staining, and a number of behavioral tests, they report decreased overall connectivity between cortex and striatum, but the effect was particularly evident in the M2-dorsolateral striatal projection. They also found reduced glutamate release onto the striatum. Notably, repeated optogenetic stimulation of M2 rescued corticostriatal connectivity and ameliorated the HD phenotype including behavior, synaptic plasticity, and spine density. The authors conclude that the selective stimulation of fronto-striatal pathways can become an effective therapeutic strategy in HD.</p><p>While progress was made in the revision there still remain concerns with respect to points 1-4 of the previous reviews and data in Figure 6. Thus, additional revisions are necessary.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The concern with the nomenclature addressed in comment #1 still requires improvement. M2 is split between &quot;frontal&quot; areas and &quot;motor&quot; areas, and these results form the backbone of the claim that it is M2-striatal projections that are affected. Please clarify why the authors did not perform an analysis on M2-striatal vs M1-striatal vs CG-striatal. Additionally, please clarify why they are grouped in this unusual manner when M2 is the focus of the paper. Some further analyses may also help address this concern.</p><p>2) With respect to comment #2 the terminology requires updating in the figures as it was only updated in the text.</p><p>3) With respect to comment #3 the authors have not adequately addressed this criticism. It is insufficient to state that frontal-striatal correlation is higher in WT than HD, but that this does not achieve significance in motor cortex. If the p-value of one reached significance in post-hoc analysis but another did not this does not imply that the two are statistically different (https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.2886). Please show that the difference between WT and HD is significantly greater for frontal than motor cortex. There are a number of ways to achieve this, including showing a significant interaction effect, performing a fisher r to z on the p values, calculating difference scores for each individual and running a paired-samples t-test, etc. Alternatively, the authors could remove Figure 1, de-emphasize this specificity, acknowledge that several brain regions have disrupted functional connectivity and that they looked closer at one of these brain regions.</p><p>4) With respect to comment #4 the Discussion section and Abstract are still problematic on these points. The study lacks evidence that &quot;frontal areas show stronger deficits in functional connectivity with basal ganglia related nuclei in our HD mice,&quot; because that statistical test was not performed. Please amend this further.</p><p>5) One additional point is that the authors should determine why in Figure 6B, there was no reduction in light-evoked EPSPs in HD mice, when this the exact same experiment as in Figure 3E, where the authors claim there is a significant reduction in HD mice? Figure 3E was the strongest evidence the authors had for a deficit in PFC to DLS glutamate transmission, and it is refuted by Figure 6B. Overall, along with the lack of a significant deficit in LTD (Figure 6d) there are concerns with the scientific rigor. Along these same lines, please provide information about experimenter blinding, which could have biased analyses, particularly of small effect sizes on behavior or spine quantification.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;M2 Cortex-Dorsolateral striatum stimulation reverses motor symptoms and synaptic deficits in Huntington's Disease&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

See specific comments below. Additionally, please adjust the nomenclature when stating &quot;frontal cortex&quot; and contrasting with &quot;motor cortex&quot; and &quot;cingulate cortex.&quot; Use of frontal cortex (as in Figure 1) appears to refer only to M2, but this is unclear and perhaps the authors are also including OFC, PL, IL, etc). Another concern is that the motor cortex is part of the frontal cortex, thus more specific nomenclature should be used.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the nomenclature used could lead to misinterpretations. To avoid any confusion, we added the regions of interest obtained by atlas-based parcellation that we used for the analysis in Figure 1. In Figure 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 1, frontal cortex includes OFC, prelimbic, infralimbic, M2 and frontal association areas, while motor cortex include more caudal M1/M2 regions, and this information is now added in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Please clarify the analyses presented in subsection “Frontal cortex, but not motor cortex, show diminished functional connectivity with the striatum during rest in HD mice”. For example, for the second two-way ANOVA, the authors refer to &quot;correlation values between left motor cortex and the same basal ganglia nuclei.&quot; But then the follow-up refers to frontal cortex, sensorimotor cortices cingulate cortices, and thalamus-not basal ganglia nuclei. Also, although correct, it would be easier to understand if &quot;correlation values&quot; were replaced with &quot;functional connectivity&quot; (since there is a two-way ANOVA to track as well). Finally, the summary focuses on cortico-striatal pathways only, whereas the results up until that point were heavily weighted to cortico-cortical and even cortical-thalamic connectivity.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right pointing that thalamus and cortex are not basal ganglia nuclei and we corrected the text in the Results section accordingly. We also changed correlation values to functional connectivity to allow better understanding as suggested.</p><p>Finally, we agree that our data indicate strong cortico-cortical and cortical-thalamic connectivity deficits from both frontal and motor cortices, and we included a new sentence in the Results section and Discussion section with this information. We also added that post hoc analysis failed to show significant differences in functional connectivity between the motor cortex and the striatum in order to highlight the differential alteration of fronto-striatal and motor-striatal functional connectivity in HD.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors claim that an imbalance arises in functional BOLD connectivity between frontostriatal and motor-corticostriatal circuits and they state that &quot;different cortico-striatal pathways are distinctly altered in HD mice,&quot;. Although the reduction in motor cortex (M1) in R6/1 mice does not reach significance in Figure 1, it does not appear different than the reduction in frontostriatal connectivity. Further, the correlation between frontal cortex (M2) and striatum just reached significance (p=0.0447). Please provide additional post-hoc analysis to show statistically that the differences (between R6/1 and WT) are significantly different (between frontal-striatal and motor-striatal). This has implications for the M2 vs M1 distinction which should be clarified in the Discussion section. In the current form the results do not support the conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that in Figure 1 the reduction levels of functional connectivity between frontal or motor cortex and striatum look quite similar and indeed we had previously evaluated different tests to ensure the reported results. Note that with the answer in point 1, we clarified that frontal cortex does not only include M2, and motor cortex includes M1 and M2 cortices.</p><p>We performed 2-way ANOVA and used Sidak post hoc test, which is another strict test counteracting the family wise error rate in multiple comparisons, and according to Graphpad Statistics Guide, has a bit more power. Using the Sidak post hoc test we found similar results as the ones reported: Frontal cortex showed reduced functional connectivity with left motor cortex (p = 0.0186), somatosensory cortex (p = 0.0071), cingulate cortex (p = 0.0003), striatum (p = 0.0438), and with the thalamus (p= 0.0077); while motor cortex showed reduced connectivity with left frontal (p= 0.0175), somatosensory (p= 0.0186) and cingulate cortices (p= 0.0041) and the thalamus (p= 0.0311) but not striatum (p=0.0803) nor globus pallidus (p= 0.75).</p><p>Then, for consistency with the rest of the manuscript, we prefer to leave the Bonferroni post-hoc test.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) As the authors mention in the Introduction, the striatum receives glutamatergic inputs from all cortical areas, thus it is likely that other cortical regions outside of the M2 region are involved in the motor deficits. Please provide caution when suggesting that selective stimulation of the frontal cortex (M2)-striatal pathway is what improves, almost exclusively, behavioral, functional and morphological outcomes. In the current form the M2 afferent specificity is presented as a conceptual advance. To support this conclusion the authors would need to demonstrate their optogenetic manipulations are specific for the frontostriatal, rather than motor-corticostriatal circuit, especially since their primary behavioral readout is motor function. Since the selective stimulation of the primary motor cortex (M1)-striatal pathway is not included then the conclusions focused on M2 should be reframed. Additionally, please provide rationale as to why the same optical stimulation protocol to test the effects of the M1-striatal pathway on the HD phenotype, at least as a control to demonstrate differential effects?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that other cortical regions outside of M2 might be involved in the motor deficits and with the present results we cannot exclude that stimulation of other cortico-striatal circuits could also improve symptoms in HD. Thus, we rephrased the Results section and Discussion section to highlight frontal and particularly M2 cortex-DLS deficits in HD, while not underestimating the role of M1 or other cortical subregions.</p><p>Although the present work did not attempt to decipher the different contribution of M1 and M2 to the HD pathology, in order to compare the effects of M1 or M2 afferent stimulation in the DLS, injection of AAV should be located in M1, while fiberoptic cannula should be placed in same place in the DLS.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Please clarify if the entire cerebral cortex or just the frontal and motor cortices were used in the MRS analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>While MRS study was only performed in the striatum, in the case of GluCEST, measures were performed in the illustrated 2 mm section containing striatum and cortex. We added a new representative section with the regions of interest labelled for clarification this information is added in Figure 2 for clarification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The conclusion of decreased striatal glutamate occurring in R6/1 mice is based on a small difference in the CEST measurements. Further, this finding was not replicated using two other independent techniques (MRS and microdialysis [at baseline]). Thus, in the current form the claim of altered striatal glutamate in R6/1 mice is not supported. Please adjust the conclusions to reflect the present data.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right pointing this out. While we wanted to stress that glutamate transmission is consistently impaired, there is still controversy regarding the total absolute values of glutamate in the striatum, which includes non-synaptic sources (Ramadan et al., 2013; van der Zeyden et al., 2008). Therefore, we corrected the title of the corresponding Results section, and adjusted the discussion with the presented results, as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Using microdialysis the authors show that optogenetic stimulation of M2 corticostriatal afferents leads to no detectable glutamate release in R6/1 mice. If optogenetically stimulating of M2 afferents in R6/1 mice does not lead to glutamate release in the striatum, how do the authors propose their optogenetic manipulations are improving striatal function? Clearly some glutamate must be released in order to detect fEPSCs in Figure 3.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that some glutamate must be released from HD mice upon optogenetic stimulation, but because glutamate baseline levels measured by microdalysis include glutamate from non-synaptic sources, small increases in glutamate release might not be detected. We changed the sentence in results and added this information in the Discussion section accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Please also clarify why glutamate release and field potential measurements where not performed with M1 stimulation?</p></disp-quote><p>From the fronto-striatal pathway shown to be altered in HD, we chose to stimulate the projection from rostral M2 Cortex to DLS based on the structural alterations previously reported (Hintiryan et al., 2016). This information is added in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) In Figure 3A, since the injection was in M2, please add a little syringe going into that region. This will help the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>According to the reviewer’s suggestion, we added the syringe in Figure 3A and also Figure 3D, Figure 4A and Figure 5A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The result in Figure 3C is quite striking. To determine that the M2-DLS pathway was targeted in both WT and R6/1 please provide histological images.</p></disp-quote><p>We added new histological images in Figure 3 where AAV injection is observed in M2, location of optogenetic fiberoptic canula is in the DLS, and microdialysis probe is just below the fiberoptic canula, for both WT and HD mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) The spread of the injection site and resulting terminal fields and fibers in Figure 4C appears far outside of area M2 into other frontal regions. Please comment on this and the implications this has on the data interpretations.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand that YFP expression in Figure 4C could lead to misinterpretation, as both somas and terminal fibers express YFP. For this reason we added in the result section further information to clarify that YFP somas of neurons expressing YFP where located in M2 Cortex injection site and, the presence of fluorescent fiber bundles and axons where found in cortical, striatal and other subcortical projecting areas previously described (Hintiryan et al., 2016; Reiner et al., 2010; Shepherd, 2013) region (Figure 4C; Figure 4—figure supplement 1). Fiberoptic cannulas were placed caudal in the dorsolateral striatum, avoiding direct activation of passing fibers expressing the AAV constructs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) The authors claim that the effects of optogenetic manipulation on open-field behavior are long-lasting (up to one week), but the analysis to support this conclusion was not performed. Instead, only summary statistics on the full 11-minutes of open-field exploration is reported. Please report comparisons of the effects from the 5-minute period of pre-stimulation across days to exclude the effects of the stimulation and immediate post-stimulation periods. In the post-hoc analysis (S4), none of those time-points are labeled significant.</p></disp-quote><p>We added new Figure 4—figure supplement 3 evaluating the effects between groups during the 5 minutes previous and the 5 minutes posterior to the optogenetic stimulation, as suggested. Please also note that in Figure 4—figure supplement 2 only post hoc analysis is shown when there was group and time interaction 2-way ANOVA effects. Because Bonferroni post hoc take into account multiple comparisons, some of the effects might not reach significance here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Please clarify the focus on LTD, when rotarod performance is associated with LTP in the DLS (they do cite Yin, 2009). Moreover, this type of LTD appears to be largely intact in the R6/1 mice. The fact that LTD is modestly improved by optogenetic stimulation here is ambiguous, given there was no significant LTD deficit to begin with.</p></disp-quote><p>Although rotarod performance might also involve LTP as indicated, in the context of Huntington Disease several publications including the ones from our group, showed an impairment in LTD in R6/1 mice. We added new references not from our group to strengthen this point (Cummings et al., 2006; Ghiglieri et al., 2019; Li et al., 2015). Regarding our results here, LTD was induced in R6/1 mice, but to a lesser extent than WT mice. If we performed a Student t-test between WT-YFP and HD-YFP we found statistical significance (p=0.0150). However, because the number of mice and groups evaluated here, this specific comparison did not reach statistical significance after 2-way ANOVA and Bonferroni post hoc comparisons. We added all this information in the Results section for clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) It is interesting that fiber tracts were not differentially affected, even though the spine density of MSNs showed significant spine loss. If, as the authors contend, the fronto-striatal pathway is more affected than the motor-striatal pathway, one would have expected differences in fiber tracts. Please discuss these conflicting findings.</p></disp-quote><p>Fiber tracts obtained from MRI studies relate to thick bundles of axons in the brain (we added a sentence for clarification). Bundles of axons are usually packed together and the water inside diffuse preferentially in one direction (longitudinally) but not transversally to the axon path. While the increase in spine density could be related to an increase in water diffusion in other directions, and therefore a decrease in anisotropy, it is important to note that the MRI resolution is 0.21x0.21x0.5mm³, while the dendritic segments that were traced are in average 37 microns long, and therefore MRI could not be sensitive enough to be influenced by the observed differences in spine density. In addition, since average FA is computed in the whole tract, even in the case that MRI would be sensitive to local spine density loss, this effect might not significantly affect the average FA value.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) Please clarify and rephrase the following sentence in the Discussion section as it is not clear in the present form. &quot;Our results indicate that cortical afferences rather than output pathways are predominantly affected during disease progression, highlighting that frontal cortex, rather than primary motor cortex, has a stronger contribution to the basal ganglia network dysfunction in HD&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the observation, and re-phrased the sentence to:</p><p>“Our results indicate general cortico-cortical and cortico-thalamic functional connectivity deficits in HD mice, suggesting that cortical afferents rather than striatal output pathways are predominantly affected during disease progression. In addition, our data highlight that cortico-striatal pathways are distinctly altered in HD depending on the cortical subregion where they originate. Particularly, frontal areas strongly contribute to the basal ganglia network dysfunction in our HD mice.”</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>While progress was made in the revision there still remain concerns with respect to points 1-4 of the previous reviews and data in Figure 6. Thus, additional revisions are necessary.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for all the additional comment which indeed help to further improve the present manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The concern with the nomenclature addressed in comment #1 still requires improvement. M2 is split between &quot;frontal&quot; areas and &quot;motor&quot; areas, and these results form the backbone of the claim that it is M2-striatal projections that are affected. Please clarify why the authors did not perform an analysis on M2-striatal vs M1-striatal vs CG-striatal. Additionally, please clarify why they are grouped in this unusual manner when M2 is the focus of the paper. Some further analyses may also help address this concern.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we performed further analysis to address this concern. We used a new region parcellation of the cortex according to Paxinos atlas, which allowed us to unify nomenclature throughout the manuscript. New labelled regions can be visualized in new Figure 1. We segmented M1, M2, mPFC, OFC, cingulate and somatosensorial cortices, as well as the Globus pallidus and thalamus, according to Paxinos brain regions.</p><p>In the new analysis, we placed the seed in the striatum and evaluated the differential functional connectivity between genotypes and between the different brain regions analyzed: M1, M2, mPFC, OFC, cingulate and somatosensorial cortices, thalamus and Globus pallidus. In these new generated data, two-way ANOVA showed genotype and region effects but not genotype/region interaction effect. Bonferroni post-hoc test showed significant functional differences between WT and HD mice in all cortical regions and thalamus but not for Globus pallidus.</p><p>We updated Supplementary file 1 and Supplementary file 2 with the new average seed-based BOLD correlation maps from striatum of WT and R6/1 mouse.</p><p>We also re-write the title and text of the corresponding Results section according to the new generated data (subsection “The striatum of HD mice shows decreased functional connectivity with afferent regions during rest.”). We also removed previous Figure 1—figure supplement 1 and corresponding Materials and methods section as they do not apply to data generated with the new labels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) With respect to comment #2 the terminology requires updating in the figures as it was only updated in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the observation, and we updated the new Figure 1 accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) With respect to comment #3 the authors have not adequately addressed this criticism. It is insufficient to state that frontal-striatal correlation is higher in WT than HD, but that this does not achieve significance in motor cortex. If the p-value of one reached significance in post-hoc analysis but another did not this does not imply that the two are statistically different (https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.2886). Please show that the difference between WT and HD is significantly greater for frontal than motor cortex. There are a number of ways to achieve this, including showing a significant interaction effect, performing a fisher r to z on the p values, calculating difference scores for each individual and running a paired-samples t-test, etc. Alternatively, the authors could remove Figure 1, de-emphasize this specificity, acknowledge that several brain regions have disrupted functional connectivity and that they looked closer at one of these brain regions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the clear explanation regarding the statistical analysis and the suggestions of how to interpret and perform it correctly.</p><p>As mentioned in question 1, we performed new analysis with the newly segmented brain regions. Moreover, we placed the seed in the striatum to assess functional connectivity with different brain regions. The statistical analysis of the new generated data showed genotype and region but not interaction effect, as described by two-way ANOVA. Bonferroni post-hoc test showed significant functional differences between WT and HD mice in all regions tested except for Globus pallidus. These new data allows us to conclude that all cortical regions explored showed deficient functional connectivity with the striatum in HD compared to WT (subsection “The striatum of HD mice shows decreased functional connectivity with afferent regions during rest”), and we avoid comparisons/statements about degree of alteration between the different cortico-striatal subcircuits taking into account the reviewer’s comments.</p><p>In detail:</p><p>-We re-wrote the title and Results section according to the new data provided.</p><p>-We removed the emphasis throughout the Discussion section regarding specific cortico-striatal circuits alterations in HD. Specially, we removed the sub-section “fronto striatal circuits show broader functional alterations than motor striatal circuits in HD”, and instead we added a small paragraph indicating that our results indicate general cortico-striatal and thalamo-striatal deficits in functional connectivity under the new subsection “Cortico-striatal transmission is reduced in HD mice”.</p><p>-We modified the discussion about specificity of M2-DLS according with the new data in the first and last paragraph of the Discussion section and also Abstract.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) With respect to comment #4 the Discussion section and Abstract are still problematic on these points. The study lacks evidence that &quot;frontal areas show stronger deficits in functional connectivity with basal ganglia related nuclei in our HD mice,&quot; because that statistical test was not performed. Please amend this further.</p></disp-quote><p>We amended this concern as indicated in previous answers and considering the new generated data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) One additional point is that the authors should determine why in Figure 6B, there was no reduction in light-evoked EPSPs in HD mice, when this the exact same experiment as in Figure 3E, where the authors claim there is a significant reduction in HD mice? Figure 3E was the strongest evidence the authors had for a deficit in PFC to DLS glutamate transmission, and it is refuted by Figure 6B. Overall, along with the lack of a significant deficit in LTD (Figure 6d) there are concerns with the scientific rigor. Along these same lines, please provide information about experimenter blinding, which could have biased analyses, particularly of small effect sizes on behavior or spine quantification.</p></disp-quote><p>We realize it is not clear enough that experiments showed in Figure 3E (light-evoked EPSPs in non-previously stimulated mice) are not equivalent to Figure 6B (light-evoked EPSPs in mice that previously received repetitive corticostriatal stimulation). Thus, we added a scheme in Figure 6 and a sentence (subsection “Repeated cortico-striatal stimulation triggers persistent improvements of synaptic plasticity in symptomatic HD mice”) for clarity. Also, MEA recordings were performed blindly and by a different researcher than the one who performed the optogenetic stimulation and behavioral characterization. Information regarding the blindness of the analysis and experimental performance is now added in the manuscript’s Materials and methods section.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p></disp-quote><p>We are glad that reviewers found that the manuscript has been improved, and thank the reviewers for the additional comments which help to further improve it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please update Figure 1C to include a y-axis and clarify that this figure reflects the strength of the correlation with predefined seed regions and not the number or proportion of voxels within a seed region with significant correlation (as in Figure 1B).</p></disp-quote><p>We added the corresponding axis title in Figure 1C (Functional connectivity) and clarified what Figure 1B and 1C represent in the corresponding Figure legend, as follows:</p><p>“Figure 1.
