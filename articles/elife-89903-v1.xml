In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the microRNA <italic>lin-4</italic> critically regulates developmental timing by post-transcriptionally downregulating the larval-stage-fate controller LIN-14. However, the mechanisms triggering the activation of <italic>lin-4</italic> expression toward the end of the first larval stage remain unknown. We demonstrate that the transmembrane transcription factor MYRF-1 is necessary for <italic>lin-4</italic> activation. MYRF-1 is initially localized on the cell membrane, and its increased cleavage and nuclear accumulation coincide with <italic>lin-4</italic> expression timing. MYRF-1 regulates <italic>lin-4</italic> expression cell-autonomously and hyperactive MYRF-1 can prematurely drive <italic>lin-4</italic> expression in embryos and young first-stage larvae. The tandem <italic>lin-4</italic> promoter DNA recruits MYRF-1<sup>GFP</sup> to form visible loci in the nucleus, suggesting that MYRF-1 directly binds to the <italic>lin-4</italic> promoter. Our findings identify a crucial link in understanding developmental timing regulation and establish MYRF-1 as a key regulator of <italic>lin-4</italic> expression.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>self-cleavage</kwd><kwd>MYRF-2</kwd><kwd>PAN-1</kwd><kwd>DD synaptic rewiring</kwd><kwd>dauer</kwd><kwd>intramolecular chaperone</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012600</institution-id><institution>ShanghaiTech University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qi</surname><given-names>Yingchuan B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31900397</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Lifang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The transcriptional activation of the key developmental timer gene, microRNA <italic>lin-4</italic>, is driven by the transmembrane transcription factor MYRF following its temporally regulated self-cleavage at the cell membrane.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>It is during the embryonic stage that the basic form and pattern of organisms are mostly established. However, the majority of growth in animals occurs during post-embryonic stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wolpert et al., 2019</xref>). Some extreme examples are seen in insects undergoing metamorphosis and vertebrate amphibians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shi, 2013</xref>). In many cases, there is often a considerable increase in body size, but profound transitions take place, such as neural circuitry remodeling throughout juvenile years and sexual maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huttenlocher, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sun and Hobert, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Truman, 1990</xref>). Undoubtedly, the genetic program determines how different species grow to different characteristic sizes and forms, yet such mechanisms remain largely unknown. One key question is how developmental timing is controlled.</p><p>When hatching out of their egg shells, the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic> exhibits a miniature yet grossly similar form to adults, and demonstrates a set of behavioral abilities including sensory response, locomotion, and learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">White et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">White et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wood, 1988</xref>). They go through four larval stages (L1 to L4) before becoming fertile adults, and the transition between two consecutive larval stages is marked by a molting event. Changes in the temporal pattern of development are best exemplified by stage-specific cell division and differentiation of blast cells, as well as stage-specific epidermal cuticle formation fate. Such stage-specific patterns can be skipped or reiterated in so-called heterochronic mutants, and <italic>lin-4</italic> and <italic>lin-14</italic> are the two that have been studied in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ambros and Horvitz, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ambros and Moss, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rougvie and Moss, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ruvkun and Giusto, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Slack and Ruvkun, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wightman et al., 1993</xref>). <italic>lin-4</italic> mutants exhibit complex cell lineage defects, including reiterated larval stage 1-specific cell division in some progenitors, while <italic>lin-14</italic> mutants exhibit precocious patterning where stage-specific events are skipped. The studies of these mutants led to the discovery of the first microRNA regulatory pathway as follows: The ubiquitously expressed nuclear factor LIN-14 promotes L1 patterns and suppresses progression to L2. The microRNA <italic>lin-4</italic> is upregulated during late L1, and suppresses LIN-14 post-transcriptionally, consequently initiating progression to the L2 pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feinbaum and Ambros, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Olsen and Ambros, 1999</xref>). <italic>lin-4</italic> - LIN-14 pair not only controls the division pattern of blast cells but also controls the maturation and plasticity of the neural circuit during L1-L2 transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hallam and Jin, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Howell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sun and Hobert, 2021</xref>); <italic>lin-4</italic> is also involved in other diverse biological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ambros and Ruvkun, 2018</xref>). The vertebrate ortholog of <italic>lin-4</italic>, known as <italic>miR-125</italic>, has been found to promote neuronal differentiation and maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akerblom et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boissart et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>What remains a mystery is the factors that trigger the expression of the <italic>lin-4</italic> microRNA during mid-late L1. It is known that the coding sequence of <italic>lin-4</italic> is embedded within an intron of a host gene, and its transcription uses its own promoter and bound Pol II complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bracht et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feinbaum and Ambros, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 1993</xref>). To date, no essential, positive regulator of <italic>lin-4</italic> transcription has been conclusively identified. However, one significant negative regulator has been reported: FLYWCH transcriptional factors suppress <italic>lin-4</italic> transcription during embryonic stages, a suppression that extends into late embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ow et al., 2008</xref>). Notably, FLYWCH mutants fail to progress to normal hatched larvae, implying that FLYWCH plays a pivotal role and may have additional functions beyond its role in suppressing <italic>lin-4</italic>. This discovery hints at the existence of a poorly understood mechanism governing the transition from embryos to larvae. Equally enigmatic is the process of activating <italic>lin-4</italic> transcription during the transition from L1 to L2.</p><p>The onset of <italic>lin-4</italic> expression in late L1 is likely linked to the nutritional state. <italic>C. elegans</italic> needs to feed to initiate the post-embryonic developmental programs of the L1 stage. When newly hatched animals encounter an environment without food, they enter into a diapause state in which development is suspended, and they become more resistant to environmental stress. In the case of epidermal blast cell division, the cycling inhibitors are promoted by more activated FOXO transcription factor DAF-16 due to starvation, which suppresses the blast’s division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baugh and Hu, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baugh and Sternberg, 2006</xref>). During L1 diapause, <italic>lin-4</italic> expression is suppressed, but this suppression is largely independent of <italic>daf-16</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baugh and Sternberg, 2006</xref>), suggesting that <italic>lin-4</italic> expression onset during mid-late L1 under nutrient-rich environment is not a result of simple attenuation of <italic>daf-16</italic> activity. Given that the <italic>lin-4</italic> expression initiates in late L1, it is reasonable to deduce that merely providing food is inadequate to induce <italic>lin-4</italic> expression. Instead, <italic>lin-4</italic> expression likely results from the interplay between the internal nutritional status and developmental progress.</p><p>Another unique developmental event that occurs at late L1 is the synaptic rewiring of DD motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hallam and Jin, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mizumoto et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">White et al., 1978</xref>). The process enables a structural and functional switch between the dendritic and axonal domains of DDs without an obvious transition in gross neuronal morphology. We previously identified MYRF-1 and MYRF-2, transmembrane transcription factors, as essential positive regulators of synaptic rewiring in DDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meng et al., 2017</xref>). While <italic>myrf-1</italic> null mutants show an arrest at the end of the L1 stage, they only display a mild deficiency in synaptic rewiring. In contrast, <italic>myrf-2</italic> null mutants do not exhibit any notable growth defects, including in synaptic rewiring. However, the <italic>myrf-1; myrf-2</italic> double null mutants demonstrate a significant impairment in synaptic rewiring, indicating that both genes collaboratively drive this process. The gain-of-function analysis by overexpressing either <italic>myrf-1</italic> or <italic>myrf-2</italic> is sufficient to advance the onset timing of synaptic rewiring. Notably, a specific <italic>myrf-1</italic> mutation, <italic>ju1121</italic> G274R, identified in the initial screen, shows a severe deficiency in synaptic rewiring, similar to the <italic>myrf-1; myrf-2</italic> double mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meng et al., 2017</xref>). Molecular analysis suggests that the <italic>ju1121</italic>(G274R) mutation impairs MYRF-1’s DNA binding ability and also interferes with MYRF-2’s function, resulting in a negative interference effect. It is important to note that the synaptic rewiring defect does not directly correlate with larval arrest, as both <italic>myrf-1; myrf-2</italic> double mutants and <italic>myrf-1(ju1121</italic>), despite their significant synaptic rewiring deficiencies, arrest at a later stage (L2) than <italic>myrf-1</italic> single mutants. These findings collectively underscore the predominant role of <italic>myrf-1</italic> in regulating development in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p><p>MYRF is conserved across the metazoan and indispensable for animal development in both invertebrates and vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bujalka et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Emery et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Russel et al., 2011</xref>). In mice, <italic>Myrf</italic> is well-recognized for its role in promoting myelination postnatally and maintaining it in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Emery et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koenning et al., 2012</xref>). Additionally, <italic>Myrf</italic> is essential for early embryonic development in mice, although its specific functions during this stage remain uncharacterized. Haploinsufficiency in human <italic>MYRF</italic> leads to <italic>MYRF</italic>-Related Cardiac Urogenital Syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kaplan et al., 2022</xref>). MYRF exhibits several distinctive domain features that facilitate its intricate processing and activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bujalka et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2013</xref>). The full-length protein initially integrates into the membrane, and undergoes trimerization via its intramolecular chaperone domain, which triggers self-catalyzing cleavage. This process releases the N-terminal MYRF in its trimeric form, allowing it to enter the nucleus for transcriptional regulation. When the catalytic dyad responsible for self-cleavage is mutated, MYRF-1(S483A K488A, GFP) (in <italic>myrf-1(syb1487</italic>)) remains constantly on the cell membrane, leading to mutant animals phenotypically similar to <italic>myrf-1</italic> null mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xia et al., 2021</xref>). Trimerization is not only a prerequisite for self-cleavage but is also essential for the proper functioning of the N-terminal MYRF. When not correctly assembled and processed into a trimer, the N-terminal MYRF, in its monomeric form, lacks functional sufficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Muth et al., 2016</xref>). This is further evidenced by the phenotypic resemblance of mutants expressing the N-terminal alone, such as <italic>myrf-1(syb1491, 1–482, GFP</italic>) and <italic>myrf-1(syb1468, 1–656, GFP</italic>), to <italic>myrf-1</italic> null mutants in terms of larval arrest and synaptic rewiring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xia et al., 2021</xref>). Notably, these mutant MYRF proteins do properly translocate into the nucleus. Despite its pivotal role in animal development, the regulation of MYRF’s processing during development, as well as MYRF’s transcriptional targets (other than myelin-related genes), remains poorly defined.</p><p>In our previous research, we observed that in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the MYRF-1 protein localizes to the cell membrane during early and mid-L1 stages but increasingly undergoes self-cleavage towards late L1, triggered by as-yet-unidentified signaling mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xia et al., 2021</xref>). The trafficking of MYRF to the cell membrane relies on a second transmembrane protein with leucine-rich repeat domains, PAN-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xia et al., 2021</xref>). When PAN-1 is absent, MYRF fails to reach its intended destination and undergoes degradation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It is the extracellular region of MYRF that facilitates its interaction with PAN-1. When this region (701-931) is deleted (in <italic>myrf-1(syb1313</italic>)), truncated MYRF-1 (1–700, GFP) remains trapped in the ER instead of being trafficked to the cell membrane, resulting in deficient processing of MYRF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xia et al., 2021</xref>). This emphasizes the critical importance of the cell membrane location for MYRF’s normal processing. However, the ER-located MYRF-1 (1–700, GFP) (in <italic>myrf-1(syb1313</italic>)) can be processed to a very limited extent. This processing is not governed by developmental timing and leads to discordant, premature development in certain tissues while the whole animal of <italic>myrf-1(syb1313, 1–700, GFP</italic>) arrests during the second larval stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xia et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, it is essential for MYRF to be trafficked to the cell membrane for proper cleavage. This process involves the interactions between the vesicular luminal (or extracellular) regions of MYRF and PAN-1.</p><p>To date, despite the MYRF-1’s essential role in regulating larval development in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the functional targets of MYRF-1 remain elusive. In the course of studying the genetic interaction between <italic>myrf-1</italic> and <italic>lin-14</italic>, we discovered that MYRF-1 is required for <italic>lin-4</italic> expression. We present data demonstrating that MYRF-1 is an essential, cell-autonomous driver of <italic>lin-4</italic> expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Nuclear accumulation of N-MYRF-1 coincides with the activation of <italic>lin-4</italic></title><p>The accumulation of <italic>lin-4</italic> microRNA occurs during mid to late L1, primarily due to the activation of <italic>lin-4</italic> primary RNA transcription, as supported by multiple studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bracht et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ow et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and C</xref>). We confirmed their findings by observing a P<italic>lin-4::GFP</italic> (<italic>maIs134</italic>) reporter generated by the Ambros group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ow et al., 2008</xref>), consisting of 2.4 kb of DNA sequences upstream of the mature <italic>lin-4</italic> fused to GFP. After its on-set, <italic>lin-4</italic> expression appears to be constitutive and ubiquitous throughout the larval stages (see discussion). MYRF-1 is also expressed broadly in larvae, but unlike <italic>lin-4</italic>, MYRF-1 transcription is active in both embryos and early L1, with an increase in transcription observed towards late L1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meng et al., 2017</xref>). However, the activity of MYRF-1 as a transcription factor is determined by the presence of N-MYRF-1 in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xia et al., 2021</xref>). Initially, full-length MYRF-1 localizes to the cell membrane during early L1, and only during mid to late L1 is the processing of MYRF-1 cleavage increased, resulting in an elevated amount of N-MYRF-1 being released and shuttled into the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Therefore, the nuclear accumulation of N-MYRF-1 coincides with the induction of <italic>lin-4</italic> both temporally and spatially.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The nuclear accumulation of N-MYRF-1 coincides with the induction of <italic>lin-4</italic> in developmental timing.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Nuclear localization of GFP::MYRF-1 is increased in late L1, coinciding with the expression of <italic>Plin-4-GFP</italic>.

(<bold>D</bold>) This illustration presents the gene structures of <italic>myrf-1</italic> and <italic>myrf-2</italic>, along with the mutations we investigated. The self-cleavage sites are S483 in <italic>myrf-1</italic> and S500 in <italic>myrf-2</italic>. The <italic>myrf-1(ybq14</italic>) variant involves GFP insertion at Ala171. Both <italic>myrf-1(ybq6</italic>) and <italic>myrf-2(ybq42</italic>) have indel mutations that lead to frameshifts, rendering them functionally null. The <italic>myrf-1(ju1121, G274R</italic>) variant contains a missense mutation and results in a phenotype similar to the <italic>myrf-1; myrf-2</italic> double mutants. The <italic>myrf-1(syb1487, S483A K488A</italic>) variant carries modifications at two catalytic residues that are important for self-cleavage. The variants <italic>myrf-1(syb1491, 1–482</italic>), <italic>myrf-1(syb1468, 1–656</italic>), and <italic>myrf-1(syb1313, 1–700</italic>) represent in-frame deletions, each tagged with GFP at Ala171.E. This model outlines the trafficking pathways, subcellular locations, processing activities, and regulatory roles of MYRF, as well as the impact of dysfunctional MYRF mutants in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Initially, the full-length MYRF protein is situated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it binds with PAN-1, a protein with a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain. This interaction is critical for MYRF’s movement to the cell membrane. Without PAN-1, MYRF is degraded within the ER. The process of MYRF trimerization and its subsequent cleavage at the cell membrane is tightly timed, though the exact mechanisms behind this are yet to be fully understood. Once cleaved, the N-terminal part of MYRF (N-MYRF) moves to the nucleus, playing a key role in specific developmental processes. The diagram also illustrates the functional effects of MYRF variants resulting from genetic modifications. Mutating MYRF-1’s conserved catalytic dyad residues to S483A K488A results in the mutant protein’s persistent retention on cell membranes, causing an arrest phenotype at the end of the first larval stage, similar to null <italic>myrf-1</italic> mutants. Mutants expressing only the N-terminal segment (MYRF-1 (1–481)) or including the ICA domain (MYRF-1 (1–656)) are constantly present in the nucleus. These variants, however, show developmental issues akin to null <italic>myrf-1</italic> mutants. The MYRF-1(G274R) mutation disrupts DNA binding and also inhibits MYRF-2 function through direct interaction, resulting in a phenotype resembling <italic>myrf-1; myrf-2</italic> double mutants. Removing the vesicular luminal regions in MYRF-1 primarily causes the MYRF-1 (1–700) variant to stay in the ER without appropriate processing, although a small portion does undergo cleavage. Animals with the <italic>myrf-1 (1–700</italic>) mutation typically experience developmental arrest during the L1 and L2 stages, showing a combination of both premature and delayed cellular development.</p><p><supplementary-material id="fig1sdata1"><label>Figure 1—source data 1.</label><caption><title>The quantification of animals exhibiting a specific pattern of GFP::MYRF-1 at various stages, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>.</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx" xlink:href="elife-89903-fig1-data1-v1.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></p><p><supplementary-material id="fig1sdata2"><label>Figure 1—source data 2.</label><caption><title>The detailed statistical analysis of the fluorescence intensity for the lin-4 transcriptional reporter, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>.</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx" xlink:href="elife-89903-fig1-data2-v1.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-89903-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>MYRF-1 is required for <italic>lin-4</italic> expression</title><p>We previously reported that two loss-of-function deletion mutants of <italic>myrf-1</italic> (<italic>syb1491</italic> and <italic>syb1468</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>) exhibit phenotypic similarities to putative <italic>myrf-1</italic> null mutants, particularly in their arresting stages (the end of L1) and mild synaptic rewiring deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xia et al., 2021</xref>).

Because of the intricate nature of regulated MYRF-1 cleavage, overexpressing full-length MYRF-1 by transgene does not enhance its transcriptional activity effectively, as excess MYRF-1 is unable to traffic to the cell membrane or undergo adequate cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meng et al., 2017</xref>). Overexpressing N-MYRF-1 alone is also insufficient as it unlikely to forms trimers efficiently. In another study, we have identified elements of the cleavage mechanism, which we will report in another manuscript. Using this information, we created a truncated form of MYRF-1 (deleting 601–650) that is expected to bypass the need for cell-membrane trafficking and circumvent the developmental signals that control cleavage.

In the rescuing transgene <italic>myrf-1</italic><sup>LoxP</sup>(<italic>ybqIs112</italic>) generated in our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meng et al., 2017</xref>), the MYRF-1 protein is observed to increase slightly beyond its endogenous level. We find that <italic>ybqIs112</italic> transgene completely suppresses the slow-growth phenotype in <italic>maIs134</italic>, as well as dauer formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C</xref>). This suggests that the transgene containing <italic>lin-4</italic> promoter DNA negatively interferes with the normal function of MYRF-1 in development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).</p><p>These observations prompted us to investigate whether the transgene array of <italic>lin-4</italic> promoter DNA binds a significant amount of MYRF-1 protein. To test this, we injected the 2.4 kb <italic>lin-4</italic> promoter RFP reporter plasmid or the reporter without RFP into <italic>myrf-1</italic><sup>GFP</sup>(<italic>ybq14</italic>), and remarkably, we detected some puncta of intensified GFP signals in a subset of nuclei in animals carrying transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G–I</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). This suggests that the MYRF-1<sup>GFP</sup> protein is concentrated in discrete nuclear locations, a phenomenon that we never observed in wild-type <italic>myrf-1</italic><sup>GFP</sup>(<italic>ybq14</italic>) animals. To determine the specificity of their interaction, we designed a second plasmid containing 7 x TetO sequence to be bound by TetR. The TetR DNA binding domain with a RFP tag (TetR::RFP) is driven by a ubiquitous promoter, in a form of single copy transgene (<italic>ybqSi233</italic>) to ensure consistent, moderate expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G–I</xref>). The formation of the TetO tandem DNA array indeed led to the appearance of TetR::RFP puncta, demonstrating the effectiveness of the method. With such a method, the presence of RFP puncta can then mark the location of DNA arrays in the nucleus. The formation of the TetO DNA array alone was insufficient to sequester MYRF-1<sup>GFP</sup>, while only the addition of the <italic>lin-4</italic> promoter DNA into the tandem array caused the emergence of the MYRF-1<sup>GFP</sup> puncta, indicating the specificity of the <italic>lin-4</italic> promoter-MYRF-1 interaction. Therefore, the serendipitous observations concerning Daf-C in <italic>maIs134</italic> and the nuclear loci co-labeling in vivo supports the direct regulator role of MYRF-1 in driving <italic>lin-4</italic> transcription.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>MYRF-1 regulates a selective subset of microRNAs during L1-L2 transition</title><p>We wanted to investigate the extent to which MYRF-1’s transcriptional activity might affect the landscape of microRNA expression in genome, as microRNAs often have stronger effects when present in combination with homologous microRNAs or in synergy with other microRNA families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ambros and Ruvkun, 2018</xref>). We performed microRNA-targeted sequencing analysis on <italic>myrf-1(ju1121</italic>) mutants of late L1 (16 hr) compared to controls. The sequencing analysis showed that a small subset of microRNA species was differentially expressed between <italic>myrf-1(ju1121</italic>) and control animals (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). We performed a phylogenetic analysis to analyze the relationships between these microRNA species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Notably, 6 of the 7 microRNAs showing increased expression in <italic>myrf-1(ju1121</italic>) compared to wild-type are clustered on a single phylogenetic branch, distinct from the other two branches. Among the differentially expressed, <italic>lin-4</italic> was the most decreased gene, consistent with our present analysis on <italic>lin-4</italic>. We then selected several candidates of relative abundance and examined their expression using transcriptional reporters. We generated single copy insertion transgenes carrying 2 kb upstream sequences of the candidate microRNA and eventually obtained lines for <italic>mir-48</italic>, <italic>mir-73</italic>, and <italic>mir-230</italic> showing consistent GFP signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref>). The reporter for <italic>mir-48</italic> is primarily detected in the pharynx, <italic>mir-73</italic> is present in both the pharynx and seam cells, whereas <italic>mir-230</italic> is detected in seam cells. The <italic>mir-48</italic> reporter (<italic>ybqSi206</italic>) was decreased, while <italic>mir-73</italic> (<italic>ybqSi208</italic>) and <italic>mir-230</italic> (<italic>ybqSi209</italic>) were increased in <italic>myrf-1(ju1121</italic>) at early L2, thus confirming the microRNA sequencing results. Notably, all three microRNAs were increased from L1 to L2 by transcriptional reporter; among the three, <italic>mir-48</italic> reporter is hardly detected in L1 and shows the most dramatic increase when animals transition to L2. The loss of <italic>myrf-1</italic> significantly decreased <italic>mir-48</italic>’s upregulation, but did not completely block it as it did with <italic>lin-4. mir-48</italic> belongs to the <italic>let-7</italic> microRNA family, and two other family members, <italic>mir-84</italic> and <italic>mir-241</italic>, were also downregulated in <italic>myrf-1(ju1121</italic>), while <italic>let-7</italic>, the founding member, itself was upregulated in <italic>myrf-1(ju1121</italic>). Among the microRNAs upregulated in the <italic>myrf-1</italic> mutants, <italic>mir-42</italic> belongs to the <italic>mir-35</italic> family, which is essential for embryogenesis, and <italic>mir-71</italic> has been extensively studied for its upregulation in adults and regulatory role in aging.

The periodic activation of <italic>lin-4</italic> transcription is likely driven by poorly understood oscillation gene regulatory circuits, some of which include <italic>C. elegans</italic> orthologs of human circadian clock genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hendriks et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McCulloch and Rougvie, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Meeuse et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Perales et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tsiairis and Großhans, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Van Wynsberghe et al., 2014</xref>). Recent work has begun to reveal the regulation mechanisms underlying oscillating <italic>lin-4</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kinney et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Perales et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stec et al., 2021</xref>). BLMP-1/PRDM1 functions as a nutrient-stimulated priming factor to decompact the <italic>lin-4</italic> locus and boost the amplitude of <italic>lin-4</italic> oscillation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stec et al., 2021</xref>). It is worth noting that the expression of BLMP-1 itself does not oscillate. However, two other oscillating nuclear hormone receptors, NHR-85/Rev-Erb, and NHR-23/ROR, promote <italic>lin-4</italic> transcription, ensuring its precise oscillation timing and proper dosage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kinney et al., 2023</xref>). These two receptors are the closest nematode orthologs of human circadian transcription factors Rev-Erb and ROR, respectively. The expression of NHR-85 is downregulated post-transcriptionally by LIN-42/PERIOD, another ortholog of the human circadian factor. LIN-42/PERIOD peaks in each cycle, but lags behind NHR-85 and NHR-23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kinney et al., 2023</xref>). Although the interactions between BLMP-1, NHR-85, and NHR-23 constitute an attractive model for explaining the oscillation of <italic>lin-4</italic> expression, it remains unclear to what extent the activation of <italic>lin-4</italic> expression, particularly during late L1, relies on these factors. For instance, there is a lack of description regarding the impact of BLMP-1, NHR-85, and NHR-23 mutants on endogenous <italic>lin-4</italic> expression. Exploring how MYRF-1 interacts with the three components of <italic>lin-4</italic> oscillation control—BLMP-1, the NHR-85 and NHR-23 pair, and LIN-42—would be an interesting direction for further study.</p><p>Similar to the orthologs of circadian genes, <italic>myrf-1</italic> mRNA exhibits oscillation in each larval stage as part of an oscillation scheme consisting of over 3000 genes oscillating at specific phases in each cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hendriks et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Meeuse et al., 2020</xref>).

Our observations suggest that the tandem array of <italic>lin-4</italic> promoter DNA may sequester a certain amount of MYRF protein. This sequestration could limit the availability of MYRF, potentially leading to a partial dauer-constitutive phenotype. Although we do not fully understand the phenomenon, it points to a link between MYRF-1 activity and nutrient state. Investigating how MYRF-1 responds to nutrient signals, what transcriptional outcome it produces, and its position in the regulatory circuit of oscillation will be important topics for future investigation.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>While the tandem DNA array of the <italic>lin-4</italic> promoter can sequester MYRF-1 proteins in vivo, forming discrete nuclear loci, we have not yet obtained further direct evidence for MYRF-1’s binding to the endogenous <italic>lin-4</italic> promoter.

Briefly, 1 ml of RNAiso Plus was added to each sample, which was homogenized using a pre-cooled grinder. The homogenization buffer was then transferred to a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and allowed to stand at room temperature (15–30 °C) for 5–10 min. The supernatant was discarded, and 200 µl of chloroform was added and shaken for 30 s until the mixture turned milky. The mixture was then centrifuged at 12,000 g at 4 °C for 15 min, and the supernatant was transferred to a new microcentrifuge tube. To the supernatant, 0.5 ml of isoamylol was added and left to stand for 10 min at room temperature, then centrifuged at 12,000 g at 4 °C for 60 min. After discarding the supernatant, the pellet was washed with 75% ethanol at 12,000 g, 4 °C for 60 min, and then dissolved in 20 µl of DEPC-treated water. The concentration of miRNA was determined using Nanodrop, and its quality was assessed through electrophoresis. Each experiment was performed using at least three replicates.</p><p>The TAKARA RNA reverse transcription kit (6110 A) was used to perform RNA reverse transcription following the manufacturer’s instructions. The concentration of the resulting product was measured using Nanodrop, and its quality was evaluated through electrophoresis.</p><p>The Taqman real-time PCR was conducted according to the TaqMan small RNA assay protocol. Initially, the concentration of each sample was diluted to below 10 ng/µl, followed by reverse transcription PCR using the TaqMan microRNA RT kit (4366596). Subsequently, the Taqman real-time PCR mixture was prepared using Taqman small RNA assay (20 X) with lin-4a (21nt) (ID: 000258) and sn2323 (ID: 001760) as the internal control. Each sample was tested using at least three technical replicates and three biological replicates. The TaqMan real-time PCR was carried out using Applied Biosystems QuantStudio 7 Flex Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher), and all the procedures were followed as per the instructions. To determine the relative changes of each sample in each assay, the <italic>lin-4</italic> Ct of technical replicates was averaged and then subtracted by the average sn2323 Ct to obtain the △CT value for each sample. Within each biological replicate and assay, the difference between the △CT of each sample and the △CT of wild-type at Early L1 was calculated to obtain △△CT. The 2 to the power of △△CT was then calculated to obtain the fold change in each sample compared to the wild-type at Early L1. The fold changes were plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>miRNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis</title><p>BLW53 [Phlh-8-GFP(ayIs6)] and BLW1555 [myrf-1(ju1121)/ mIn1; Phlh-8-GFP(ayIs6)] strains were utilized for sample preparation. To isolate myrf-1 mutants, late L1 stage worms were selected based on size and lack of pharyngeal GFP (a balancer mIn1 marker) using Biosorter. Over 10,000 worms were collected for each sample for further experimentation. Three biological replicates for myrf-1 mutants and control animals were included. Total RNA was extracted and assessed for quality and quantity using Nanodrop and Agilent 2100, respectively. Samples with a total quantity of 3–5 µg and high quality (RIN &gt;10) were selected for miRNA library construction. The miRNA libraries were established and sequenced by Novogene Technology Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China).</p><p>In this study, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> Assembly WBcel235/ce11 was used as the reference genome for bioinformatic analysis of the sequencing data. The reference genome and gene annotation database were obtained from the Ensembl database and used for downstream analysis. The sequencing data was initially assessed for quality using the software FASTQ, followed by alignment of each miRNA sequencing dataset independently to the reference genome using HiSAT2. Transcriptome from each RNA-sequencing dataset was then extracted using the StringTie software. Differential miRNA cluster analysis was performed to compare miRNA expression of control and myrf-1(ju1121) mutant using DESeq2. Data normalization was done using the TPM method. A P-value was assigned to each gene and adjusted using the Benjamini and Hochberg method. Genes with P_ adj &lt;0.05 were considered differentially expressed.</p><p>For the analysis and visualization of miRNA expression, read counts (TPM values) were first normalized to account for library size. Subsequently, variance stabilization was performed using the rlog function from DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Love et al., 2014</xref>). The data were then clustered based on a Euclidean distance metric.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Microscopic analyses and quantification</title><p>Live animals were anesthetized using 0.5% 1-Phenoxy-2-propanol in ddH<sub>2</sub>O and mounted on 3% Agar gel pad.

Pairwise distance was then estimated using the default parameters, except for the bootstrap replication number parameter, which was set to 1000, and the substitution model parameter, which was set to P-distance. The phylogenetic tree for our specific miRNAs was generated using the Neighbor-Joining method and default parameters, with branches corresponding to partitions reproduced in less than 0.1 bootstrap replicates filtered out.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Considerations on sample size and randomization</title><p>Determining sample size involves multiple factors. Typically, when testing the difference between two samples using t-tests and ANOVA, which generally require smaller sample sizes, we have found that 20–30 samples can often yield significant differentiation between the two groups. Additionally, we take into account practical constraints such as time, budget, and feasibility to avoid unnecessary costs. It’s important to note that even in synchronized populations with similar starting sizes, there may be size variations over a growth period. We only exclude individuals that are clearly in an inappropriate stage, such as young L1 sizes in late L1 populations, which can occur in both mutant and control animals. The images captured are from randomized animals on slice preparations, and there is no particular order to the images when they were analyzed. Since the intensity from each image was measured using ImageJ and is devoid of human errors, we determined it unnecessary to blind the images across distinct genotypes.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Supervision, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-89903-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>A dataset is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.tqjq2bw71">https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.tqjq2bw71</ext-link>.

The precisely timed onset of <italic>lin-4</italic> expression in the late L1 stage is known to be a critical step in the developmental timing (&quot;heterochronic&quot;) pathway, allowing worms to move from the L1 to the L2 stage of development. Despite the importance of this step of the pathway, the mechanisms that control the onset of <italic>lin-4</italic> expression are not well understood.</p><p>Overall, the paper provides convincing evidence that MYRF factors have a key role in promoting <italic>lin-4</italic> expression in young larvae. Using state-of-the-art techniques (knock-in reporters and conditional alleles), the authors show that MYRF factors are essential for <italic>lin-4</italic> activation and act cell-autonomously. Results using some unusual gain-of-function alleles are supported by consistent results using other approaches. The authors also provide evidence supporting the idea that MYRF factors activate <italic>lin-4</italic> by directly activating its promoter. Because these results are indirect test of this, further experiments will be necessary to conclusively determine whether <italic>lin-4</italic> is indeed a direct target of MYRF factors. myrf-1 and myrf-2 likely function redundantly to activate <italic>lin-4</italic>; potential complex interactions between these two genes will be an interesting area for future work.</p><p>Overall, the paper's results are convincing. The important findings on miRNA regulation and the control of developmental timing will make this work of interest to a broad range of developmental biologists.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89903.4.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors examine how temporal expression of the <italic>lin-4</italic> microRNA is transcriptionally regulated.</p><p>Comments on revised version:</p><p>In the revised manuscript, the authors have suitably addressed my original concerns.</p><p>Aims achieved: The aims of the work are now achieved.</p><p>Impact: This study shows that a single transcription factor (MYRF-1) is important for the regulation of multiple microRNAs that are expressed early in development to control developmental timing.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89903.4.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Zhimin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>ShanghaiTech University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Shanghai</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Zhao</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>ShanghaiTech University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Shanghai</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Lifang</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>ShanghaiTech University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Shanghai</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Qi</surname><given-names>Yingchuan B</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>ShanghaiTech University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Shanghai</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p><p>Thank you for your continued review and for providing insightful suggestions. Below, I share some unpublished new findings related to the MYRF ChIP, comment on the potential interplay between myrf-1 and myrf-2, and describe the modifications we've implemented to address the reviewers' comments.</p><p>(1) MYRF-1 ChIP</p><p>Our collaboration with the modERN (Model Organism Encyclopedia of Regulatory Networks) project has recently yielded MYRF ChIP data. The results demonstrate clear and consistent MYRF binding across samples, notably on the <italic>lin-4</italic> promoter. Given the significant detail and extensive description required to adequately present these findings, we have decided it is impractical to include them in the current paper. These results will be more suitably published in a separate ongoing study focused on MYRF's regulatory targets during larval development.</p><p>(2) Inter-regulation between myrf-1 and myrf-2</p><p>We acknowledge the interpretation that myrf-2 may act as a genetic antagonist to myrf-1, as suggested by the delayed arrest in myrf-1; myrf-2 double mutants and a trend towards increased <italic>lin-4</italic> expression in myrf-2 mutants. Additionally, our unpublished data suggest an elevated myrf-2 expression peak in myrf-1 null mutants during the L1-L2 transition, indicating a potential mutual repressive interaction between myrf1 and myrf-2.</p><p>On the other hand, myrf-1 and myrf-2 exhibit functional redundancy in DD synaptic rewiring and <italic>lin-4</italic> expression. A gain of function in myrf-2 promotes early DD synaptic rewiring. Furthermore, three independent co-immunoprecipitation analyses targeting myrf-1::gfp, myrf-2::gfp, and pan-1::gfp confirm a tight association between myrf-1 and myrf-2 in vivo. These findings challenge the notion of myrf-2 primarily antagonizing myrf-1, or vice versa.</p><p>We propose a model where myrf-1 and myrf-2 collaborate and are functionally redundant, with compensatory elevated expression when one paralog is absent. For instance, the loss of myrf-1 triggers upregulation of myrf-2, which, though insufficient on its own, accelerates the transcriptional program and exacerbates system deterioration, leading to accelerated death. How exactly this takes place is currently unclear. We notice the MYRF binding on both myrf-1 and myrf-2 genes in MYRF-ChIP.</p><p>Given the complexity of these interactions, we have chosen not to delve deeply into this discussion in the paper without more direct evidence, which would require detailed analysis.</p><p>(3) Revisions Addressing Reviewer Suggestions</p><p>(a) We have revised our interpretation of the mScarlet signal changes in myrf-1(ybq6) and myrf-2(ybq42) mutants to reflect a more nuanced understanding of their potential genetic relationship, as highlighted in the main text.</p><p>“The mScarlet signals exhibit a marked reduction in the putative null mutant myrf-1(ybq6) (Figure 1D, E). Intriguingly, in the putative null myrf-2(ybq42) mutants, there is a noticeable trend towards increased mScarlet signals, although this increase does not reach statistical significance (Figure 2C, D).”</p><p>(b) In response to feedback on Figure 2 and the characterization of <italic>lin-4</italic>(umn84) mutants, we've included a new series of images showing <italic>lin-4</italic>(umn84)/+ and <italic>lin-4</italic>(umn84) signals through larval stages, presented as Figure 2 Figure Supplement 2. This addition clarifies the functional status of <italic>lin-4</italic> nulls in our study.</p><p>“Our observations revealed that mScarlet signals were not detected early L1 larvae (Figure 2C-F; Figure 2 Figure Supplement 2).”</p><p>(c) To improve the clarity of Fig 6, we've added indicator arrows in the red, green, and merge channels, enhancing the visualization of the signals.</p><p>We appreciate the opportunity to clarify these points and hope that our revisions and additional data address the concerns raised.</p></body></sub-article></article>
