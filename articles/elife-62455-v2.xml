neurotransmitter co-transmission remains unclear. The glutamatergic ‘KNDy’ neurons co-express kisspeptin, neurokinin B (NKB), and dynorphin and exhibit a highly stereotyped synchronized behavior that reads out to the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neuron dendrons to drive episodic hormone secretion. Using expansion microscopy, we show that KNDy neurons make abundant close, non-synaptic appositions with the GnRH neuron dendron. Electrophysiology and confocal GCaMP6 imaging demonstrated that, despite all three neuropeptides being released from KNDy terminals, only kisspeptin was able to activate the GnRH neuron dendron. Mice with a selective deletion of kisspeptin from KNDy neurons failed to exhibit pulsatile hormone secretion but maintained synchronized episodic KNDy neuron behavior that is thought to depend on recurrent NKB and dynorphin transmission. This indicates that KNDy neurons drive episodic hormone secretion through highly redundant neuropeptide co-transmission orchestrated by differential post-synaptic neuropeptide receptor expression at the GnRH neuron dendron and KNDy neuron.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>kisspeptin</kwd><kwd>GnRH</kwd><kwd>pulse generator</kwd><kwd>NKB</kwd><kwd>Dynorphin</kwd><kwd>GCaMP</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001505</institution-id><institution>Health Research Council of New Zealand</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Herbison</surname><given-names>Allan Edward</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Herbison</surname><given-names>Allan Edward</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The arcuate nucleus kisspeptin neurons express multiple transmitters but use only the neuropeptide kisspeptin to drive the episodic secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Many neurons use the co-transmission of classical small-molecule and neuropeptide neurotransmitters to signal within their networks. Such co-transmission enables a wide dynamic range of signaling through the frequency coding of transmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">van den Pol, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vaaga et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tritsch et al., 2016</xref>). However, the extent and functional significance of co-transmission remains unclear in most forebrain circuits. For example, ‘Dale’s Principle’, as formulated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Eccles, 1976</xref>, posits that all axons of an individual neuron will release the same set of transmitters. The generality of this concept has now been challenged for small-molecule co-transmitters (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tritsch et al., 2016</xref>) but remains untested for neuropeptide co-transmission.</p><p>The kisspeptin neurons located in the arcuate/infundibular nucleus of the mammalian hypothalamus appear to engage in substantial co-transmission being glutamatergic and synthesizing at least four neuropeptides including kisspeptin, NKB, dynorphin, and galanin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lehman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Skrapits et al., 2015</xref>). In a range of mammals, the majority of these arcuate nucleus (ARN) neurons co-express kisspeptin, NKB, and dynorphin resulting in their ‘KNDy’ moniker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lehman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Skrapits et al., 2015</xref>). Immunohistochemical studies have demonstrated that the three neuropeptides are packaged within separate vesicles within KNDy nerve terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lehman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Murakawa et al., 2016</xref>). Although the KNDy neurons project widely throughout the limbic system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Krajewski et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yeo and Herbison, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yip et al., 2015</xref>), they are best characterized as being the ‘GnRH pulse generator’ responsible for episodically activating the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons to drive pulsatile luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Clarkson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Herbison, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Plant, 2019</xref>). The KNDy neurons are proposed to achieve this by providing an episodic stimulatory input to the distal projections of the GnRH neurons close to their secretory zone in the median eminence (ME) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Herbison, 2018</xref>). These distal projections of the GnRH neuron have shared features of dendrites and axons and have been termed ‘dendrons’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Herde et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Herbison, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Moore et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yip et al., 2021</xref>). The nature and functional significance of KNDy co-transmission at the GnRH neuron dendron remains unknown.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>KNDy neurons form abundant close appositions with GnRH neuron distal dendrons</title><p>We first established the anatomical relationship between KNDy fibers and the GnRH neuron distal dendrons in the ventrolateral ARN using confocal immunohistochemistry. Analysis of para-horizontal sections revealed numerous kisspeptin-expressing fibers passing through and around the GnRH neuron dendrons as they turned toward the ME (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We found that 68.5 ± 6.2% of analyzed GnRH dendrons segments had at least one apposition with a kisspeptin fiber (N = 4 female mice). To examine kisspeptin fibers originating from KNDy neurons, we assessed the relationship of GnRH neuron dendrons to fibers co-expressing kisspeptin and NKB. In total, we observed 4.0 ± 0.4 kisspeptin close appositions/100 μm of dendron length and 67.0 ± 7.6% of these co-expressed NKB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; N = 4). Prior work has shown that the GnRH neuron projections are innervated by KNDy neurons in addition to preoptic area kisspeptin neurons that do not express NKB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yip et al., 2015</xref>). On average, each kisspeptin/NKB fiber made close appositions with 4.5 ± 0.7 GnRH neuron dendrons. This arrangement suggests an abundant, divergent innervation of the GnRH neuron distal dendrons by KNDy neurons.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Relationship of KNDy neuron fibers to GnRH neuron distal dendrons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) 3D reconstruction of regular confocal images showing a KNDy fiber expressing kisspeptin (KP) and neurokinin B (NKB) making close appositions with three GnRH neuron dendrons in the ventrolateral ARN of a GnRH-GFP mouse.

Expansion microscopy (ExM) uses isotropic swelling of the tissue specimen to provide ~70 nm spatial resolution that can reliably image synapses in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wassie et al., 2019</xref>). We have previously demonstrated using ExM that a ‘side-plane’ overlap of &gt;0.23 μm (0.95 μm post-expansion) or face-plane (z-stack) overlap &gt;0.42 μm (1.75 μm post-expansion) between a synaptophysin-immunoreactive bouton and the GFP within the cytoplasm of a GnRH neuron represents a bona fide synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). The presence of kisspeptin synapses on distal dendrons was examined by assessing synaptophysin-containing kisspeptin boutons opposed to GFP-expressing dendrons. Surprisingly, we identified no kisspeptin-containing synaptic profiles on 45 individual distal dendrons (&gt;15 µm length each, N = 3 mice) with all kisspeptin/synaptophysin-immunoreactive boutons being outside the criteria for a synapse or indeed quite separate from the GFP-expressing dendron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). The average distance between kisspeptin–synaptophysin boutons and GnRH neuron dendrons was 2.22 ± 0.27 µm (post-expansion). Nevertheless, many synaptophysin-expressing boutons without kisspeptin were identified to make synaptic appositions with GnRH neuron dendrons (density of 2.3 ± 0.1 synaptophysin synapses per 10 µm dendron) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This suggested that kisspeptin inputs to the distal dendron did not make conventional synapses. To verify this, we used the same approach to examine the morphological relationship of kisspeptin inputs to the GnRH neuron soma/proximal dendrites in the rostral preoptic area, where local kisspeptin neurons form conventional synapses with GnRH neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Piet et al., 2018</xref>). We assessed eight 60 μm lengths of GFP soma/dendrite in each of three mice and found many synaptophysin–kisspeptin boutons forming synapses with GFP-expressing dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Overall, 37.9 ± 0.8% of all synaptophysin boutons synapsing on GnRH neuron soma/proximal dendrites (0.81 ± 0.44 per 10 μm) contained kisspeptin.</p><p>These observations indicate that while kisspeptin inputs to the GnRH cell bodies and proximal dendrites exist as classical synapses, this is not the case for the distal dendron where divergent KNDy signaling occurs through short-diffusion volume transmission.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>GnRH neuron dendrons only respond to one of the four KNDy co-transmitters</title><p>We have previously established an acute horizontal brain slice preparation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) in which changes in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] within the thin GnRH neuron distal dendrons can be measured providing a proxy for electrical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Iremonger et al., 2017</xref>). A thick horizontal brain slice containing the ME and adjacent hypothalamic tissue was prepared from adult male and diestrous-stage female <italic>Gnrh1-Cre</italic> mice previously given preoptic area injections of AAV9-CAG-FLEX-GCaMP6s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). To mimic the episodic release of transmitters, multi-barreled pipettes were used to apply candidate neurotransmitters as short 90 s puffs to the region of the GnRH neuron dendrons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), while recording calcium signals from multiple dendrons simultaneously using confocal imaging. In vivo recordings show that KNDy neurons exhibit synchronized episodes of activity for 1–2 min prior to each LH pulse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Han et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">McQuillan et al., 2019</xref>). In controls, where we applied artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) at different distances and pressures from the brain slice, we found that slight movement artifacts were unavoidable. Placing a pipette 30–130 μm above the surface of the brain slice and puffing aCSF resulted in a 4.5 ± 0.5% (mean ± SD) increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] within the dendrons beneath (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). As such, we defined a threshold for a drug-induced change in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] as requiring an increase or decrease greater than the aCSF mean plus two standard deviations from the control change (i.e. &gt;5.5%) and a response that outlasted the time of the puff.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Horizontal brain slice preparation for examining GnRH neuron distal dendrons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) View looking down on a thick horizontal brain slice prepared from a <italic>Gnrh</italic>-GFP mouse showing the laterally positioned GnRH neuron cell bodies in the anterior hypothalamic area (AHA) and the concentrated GnRH neuron projections in the median eminence (ME). 3V, third ventricle.

This is in striking contrast to signaling at the KNDy cell body where the opposite relationship exists with kisspeptin having no effect on excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">de Croft et al., 2013</xref>), while the co-released neuropeptides NKB and dynorphin directly excite and inhibit firing, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">de Croft et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ruka et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Qiu et al., 2016</xref>).

The KNDy neuron provides an example of co-transmission in which its output at recurrent collaterals and its primary efferent target are differentially interpreted by converse patterns of post-synaptic neuropeptide receptor expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Kisspeptin is the only co-transmitter active at the GnRH neuron dendron, whereas the exact opposite situation exists at KNDy neuron recurrent collaterals where all of the co-transmitters, except kisspeptin, are active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Navarro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">de Croft et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ruka et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Qiu et al., 2016</xref>).

While this type of receptor-dependent co-transmission has been reported for small-molecule transmitters, it has not been shown for co-released neuropeptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tritsch et al., 2016</xref>). We demonstrate that this mode of co-transmission is physiologically relevant in vivo as deletion of kisspeptin from the repertoire of transmitters used by KNDy neurons abolishes episodic hormone secretion while maintaining KNDy neuron synchronization behavior.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Schematic diagram depicting the proposed patterns of co-transmission that occur at the KNDy neuron recurrent collaterals (upper inset) and at their non-synaptic projections to the GnRH neuron dendrons where only kisspeptin is active (lower inset).</title><p>NKR, neurokinin receptors; GluR, glutamate receptors.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-62455-fig9-v2.tif"/></fig><p>As a result of their migration from the nose into the brain at mid-gestation, the GnRH neuron cell bodies are scattered throughout the basal forebrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wray, 2010</xref>). The functional difficulties imposed by this topography appear to be solved, in part, by GnRH neurons focusing their blended dendritic/axonal projections on the ME where they can be regulated in a concerted manner by the KNDy pulse generator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Herbison, 2018</xref>). While it is clear that classic synaptic inputs exist on the GnRH neuron dendron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Moore et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang et al., 2020</xref>), we note that this is not the case for the KNDy neuron innervation. Although many close appositions were identified with regular confocal analysis, no evidence was found for these to be synaptic inputs between KNDy fibers and GnRH neuron dendrons using ExM. This was despite the ExM identification of bona fide kisspeptin synapses at the GnRH neuron cell body and proximal dendrites. An electron microscopic investigation in the rat also reported that closely apposed kisspeptin fibers and GnRH neuron nerve terminals in the ME do not form synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Uenoyama et al., 2011</xref>). This morphological relationship is indicative of short-distance volume transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">van den Pol, 2012</xref>). We also note that individual KNDy fibers form appositions with multiple GnRH neuron dendrons. Thus, it seems probable that the synchronous activation of GnRH neuron dendrons is achieved by volume transmission originating from multiple boutons of KNDy neuron axons winding their way through GnRH neuron dendrons.</p><p>The nature of KNDy signaling at the GnRH neuron has been difficult to discern. Studies in the mouse show that KNDy neurons only project to the GnRH neuron distal projections in an around the ME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yip et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Qiu et al., 2016</xref>). Although immunohistochemical studies have indicated that GnRH neurons express receptors for NKB and/or dynorphin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Krajewski et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Weems et al., 2016</xref>), this has not been supported by mRNA profiling and electrophysiological studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mitchell et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sannella and Petersen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Navarro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Qiu et al., 2016</xref>). We find here that NKB had no effects on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in GnRH neuron dendrons, indicating that they are not likely to express NK3R. This is in contrast with the KNDy neurons themselves where NKB evokes a strong activation in the same brain slice preparation. We also found no evidence for dynorphin to modulate either basal or kisspeptin-evoked [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in the GnRH dendron. The latter result does not support the hypothesis that dynorphin signaling is involved in terminating the kisspeptin-evoked GnRH pulse at the level of the GnRH neuron, at least in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Weems et al., 2018</xref>). Notably, a very recent study has shown that nitric oxide can terminate and re-set kisspeptin responses at the GnRH neuron cell body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Constantin et al., 2021</xref>), and it is possible that a similar scenario exists at the level of the GnRH neuron dendron.</p><p>Surprisingly, we observed that glutamate, AMPA, and NMDA had no impact on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in GnRH neuron dendrons. Our initial investigations found that puffs of glutamate to the dendron evoked small but significant responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Herde et al., 2013</xref>). However, in those early studies we were limited technically to examining only the dendrons of the few GnRH neurons that have cell bodies close to the ME. We also noted that glutamate responses were markedly less effective as we puffed along the projection with puffs greater than 350 microns from the cell body being ineffective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Herde et al., 2013</xref>). With the present technical approach, we are able to examine the distal dendrons of the vast majority GnRH neurons that are located in the preoptic area and have their cell bodies located 1000s of microns from the ME. Hence, it seems very likely that there is falling gradient of glutamate receptor expression along the GnRH neuron projections such that, while glutamate will activate those rare dendrons coming from GnRH neuron somata close by the ME, 99% of distal dendrons have no glutamate receptors. Functionally, it is notable that low-frequency KNDy neuron activation, that would be presumed to release only glutamate, has no impact on LH secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Han et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>As KNDy neurons package their individual neurotransmitters into separate vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Murakawa et al., 2016</xref>), they could differentially traffic specific vesicles to distinct axonal projections. However, this does not appear to occur at their two key efferent outputs for regulating pulsatile LH secretion as KNDy neuron recurrent collaterals and their projections to GnRH neuron dendrons all co-express kisspeptin, NKB, and dynorphin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lehman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In agreement, we find evidence that kisspeptin, NKB, and dynorphin are all released from KNDy terminals adjacent to the GnRH neuron dendron, while Qui and colleagues demonstrated that NKB and dynorphin were released at recurrent collaterals innervating the KNDy cell bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Qiu et al., 2016</xref>). Together, these studies indicate that KNDy neurons conform to ‘Dale’s Principle’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Eccles, 1976</xref>) and that differential signaling is achieved at these two key target sites by selective post-synaptic neuropeptide receptor expression.</p><p>These observations also suggest that a population of unidentified neurons located in the ventrolateral ARN may have their activity entrained by the GnRH neuron pulse generator. We found evidence for both NKB- and dynorphin-receptive neurons in this area responding to KNDy neuron activation as well as cells excited in a NK3R-independent manner that may be activated by kisspeptin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fu and van den Pol, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liu and Herbison, 2015</xref>). As yet, there have been no endocrine or behavioral outputs identified that match the abrupt temporal dynamics of pulsatile LH secretion and it will be intriguing to identify the nature of these cells in due course.</p><p>In summary, evidence indicates that the GnRH pulse generator network uses converse patterns of post-synaptic receptor expression at the two main targets of the KNDy neuron required for episodic hormone secretion. This likely solves the problem of signal resolution generated when using neuropeptide volume transmission in the close vicinity of the KNDy somata and GnRH neuron dendrons. Although highly redundant at the level of the post-synaptic space, this novel pattern of co-transmission enables neurons to achieve differential signaling at varied targets without the need for selective trafficking of neuropeptide transmitters throughout their axonal arbor.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">STOCK Tg(Gnrh1-cre)1Dlc/J</td><td valign="top">Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="top">Stock #: 021207 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:IMSR_JAX:021207">IMSR_JAX:021207</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">B6.DBA-Tg(Gnrh1-EGFP)1Phs</td><td valign="top">Spergel et al., doi:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.19-06-02037.1999">10.1523/JNEUROSCI.19-06-02037.1999</ext-link></td><td valign="top">MGI:6158458</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Kiss1<sup>tm2(CreGFP)Coll</sup>:tdTom</td><td valign="top">Yeo et al., doi:org/<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1111/jne.12435%202016">10.1111/jne.12435 2016</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">B6.Cg-<italic>Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm9(CAG-tdTomato)Hze</sup></italic>/J (Ai9)</td><td valign="top">Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="top">Stock #: 07909 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:IMSR_JAX:007909">IMSR_JAX:007909</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">B6J.Cg-<italic>Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm95.1(CAG-GCaMP6f)Hze</sup></italic>/MwarJ (Ai95D)</td><td valign="top">Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="top">Stock #: 028865 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:IMSR_JAX:028865">IMSR_JAX:028865</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transfected construct (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">AAV9-CAG-FLEX-GCaMP6s-WPRE-SV40</td><td valign="top">Penn Vector Core</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:Addgene_100844">Addgene_100844</ext-link></td><td valign="top">1.7 × 10<sup>–13</sup> GC/mL</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transfected construct (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">AAV9-EF1-DIO-hChR2-(H134R)-mCherry-WPRE-hGH</td><td valign="top">Penn Vector Core</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:Addgene_20297">Addgene_20297</ext-link></td><td valign="top">4.4 × 10<sup>13</sup> GC/mL</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-Kisspeptin 10 (polyclonal rabbit)</td><td valign="top">Alain Caraty, INRA, France</td><td valign="top">Cat#: AC566 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2314709">AB_2314709</ext-link></td><td valign="top">(1:2000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-Kisspeptin 10 (polyclonal sheep)</td><td valign="top">Alain Caraty, INRA, France</td><td valign="top">Cat#: AC024</td><td valign="top">(1:8000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-NKB (polyclonal rabbit)</td><td valign="top">Novus Biologicals</td><td valign="top">Cat#: NB300-201 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_10000783">AB_10000783</ext-link></td><td valign="top">(1:5000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-NKB (polyclonal guinea pig)</td><td valign="top">P.

Daily vaginal cytology was used to monitor the estrous cycle stage. All animal experimental protocols were approved by the University of Otago, New Zealand (96/2017) or the University of Cambridge, UK (P174441DE).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Stereotaxic surgery</title><p>Adult mice (2–4 months old) were anaesthetized with 2% isoflurane and placed in a stereotaxic apparatus with prior local Lidocaine (4 mg/kg bodyweight, s.c.) and Carprofen analgesia (5 mg/kg body weight, s.c.). A custom-made bilateral Hamilton syringe apparatus holding two syringes with needles held 0.9 mm apart was used to perform bilateral injections into the preoptic area (AP 0.10 mm, depth 4.3 mm) or ARN (AP −2.00 mm, depth 5.9 mm) of <italic>Gnrh1-Cre</italic> or <italic>Kiss1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Rosa26</italic>-tdT mice, respectively. The needles were lowered into place over 2 min and left in situ for 3 min before the injection was made. For GnRH dendron calcium imaging, 1.5 μL of AAV9-CAG-FLEX-GCaMP6s-WPRE-SV40 (1.7 × 10<sup>−13</sup> GC/mL, University of Pennsylvania Vector Core) was injected bilaterally into the preoptic area at a rate of ~100 nL/min with the needles left in situ for a further 10 min before being withdrawn. For the optogenetic activation of KNDy neurons, 1 μL of AAV9-EF1-DIO-hChR2-(H134R)-mCherry-WPRE-hGH (4.35 × 10<sup>13</sup> GC/mL; Penn Vector Core) was injected into the ARN of <italic>Kiss1<sup>Cre/+</sup>; Rosa26</italic>-tdT mice.

Carprofen (5 mg/kg body weight, s.c.) was administered for post-operative pain relief. Mice were housed individually for the remaining experimental period. A typical post-surgical period of 4–6 weeks was allowed, with daily handling and habituation to the recording appartus.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Immunohistochemistry for expansion microscopy</title><p>Diestrous-stage <italic>Gnrh-GFP</italic> mice aged between 2 and 4 months old were perfused transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Fifty-micron coronal brain sections were cut on a vibratome and kept in cryoprotectant until used. Sections were pre-treated with 0.1% sodium borohydrate (Sigma–Aldrich) in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 15 min at room temperature and then further treated with 0.1% Triton-X-100 (Sigma–Aldrich) and 2% goat serum in TBS overnight at 4°C for improving antibody penetration. Next, sections were washed and incubated for 72 hr at 4°C with a cocktail of chicken anti-GFP (1:8000; Abcam), guinea pig anti-synaptophysin1 (1:800; Synaptic Systems), and rabbit anti-kisspeptin-10 (1:2000; gift from Alain Caraty) antisera added to the incubation solution made up of TBS, 0.3% Triton-X-100, 0.25% bovine serum albumin, and 2% goat serum. All subsequent incubations were performed using the same incubation solution. Sections were rinsed in TBS, followed by incubation with biotinylated goat anti-guinea pig immunoglobulin (Vector Laboratories) mixed with Alexa488-conjugated goat anti-chicken (ThermoFisher Scientific) and ATTO 647N goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulins (Sigma–Aldrich), 1:400 each, for 15 hr at 4°C. Sections were then expanded as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang et al., 2020</xref> eLife). Briefly, sections were stained with 1:1000 Hoechst 33342 dye (Thermo Fisher Scientific), processed for linking with anchoring agent, and trimmed to include the rostral preoptic area or ARN region. Next, sections were incubated in monomer solution, followed by gelling solution in a humidified chamber at 37°C. Gel-embedded sections were digested overnight with proteinase K. Following that, the gels were rinsed in PBS, incubated with 1:1500 Streptavidin-568 at 37°C for 3 hr, and rinsed again with PBS. Lastly, water was added every 20 min, up to five times during the expansion step. Expanded samples were placed in imaging chamber filled with water and cover slipped using #1.5 cover glass.</p><p>Imaging was undertaken using a Nikon A1R upright confocal microscope equipped with a water-immersing lens (25× numerical aperture 1.1; working distance 2 mm). All images were captured using sequential scanning mode using 500–550 nm, 580–620 nm, and 620–660 nm bandpass filters for Alexa Fluor 488, Alexa Fluor 568, and ATTO 647, respectively. All image stacks (frames: 102.51 × 51.25 µm, 1024 × 512 pixels) were acquired at 0.6 μm focus intervals. Images were analyzed using ImageJ to determine the number of kisspeptin terminals containing synaptophysin opposed to GnRH proximal or distal dendrites. For the cell body/proximal dendrite, 250 μm (60 μm pre-expansion) of contiguous primary dendrite arising from the GnRH cell body was randomly selected from three rostral preoptic area sections in each of the three mice. Each apposing synaptophysin–kisspeptin bouton (diameter &gt; 0.4 μm) was examined to establish the side-on view or a z-stack/face-view of the imaged synapse. A line scan was then performed across this plane, and the relative intensity of the Alexa488 and ATTO647 was measured and plotted in Microsoft Excel. For the face-view orientation, a 2 µm × 2 µm (width × length) box was drawn on each of the synaptophysin–kisspeptin boutons to measure the relative intensity of Alexa488 and ATTO647 through the z-stack. An apposition was considered a synapse where the signals overlapped by &gt;0.95 μm (0.23 μm pre-expansion) in the side-on plane or &gt;1.75 μm (0.42 μm pre-expansion) in the z-stack through/face-view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). The same method was used to establish the relationship between synaptophysin–kisspeptin profiles and the distal dendron using 60 μm (15 μm pre-expansion) contiguous lengths of dendron located in the ventrolateral ARN.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Immunohistochemistry for multi-label fluorescence</title><p>Adult diestrous Kiss1<sup>Cre/+</sup> and Kiss1<sup>Cre/Cre</sup> mice (2–3 months old) underwent transcardial perfusion. Coronal brain sections of 40 μm thickness were prepared and incubated in rabbit anti-NKB (1:5000; Novus Biologicals) and sheep anti-Kisspeptin 10 antisera (1:8000; gift of Alain Caraty) followed by biotinylated donkey anti-sheep immunoglobulins (1:1500; Jackson Immunoresearch), donkey anti-rabbit conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (1:1000, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and Streptavidin Alexa Fluor 647 (1:1500, ThermoFisher Scientific). Images were acquired using a Leica SP8 Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope and a 63× oil immersion objective (numerical aperture 1.20; working distance 300 μm) with image stacks collected at 0.6 μm intervals (Cambridge Advanced Imaging Centre).</p><p>Adult <italic>Gnrh-GFP</italic> mice were perfused transcardially and a ventral para-horizontal brain slice prepared by making a single horizontal cut from the base of the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Brain slices were incubated in rabbit anti-kisspeptin 10 (1:2000; gift of Dr. Alain Caraty), guinea pig anti-NKB (1:5000; IS-3/61, gift of Dr. Philippe Ciofi), and chicken anti-GFP (1:2000; AB16901, Chemicon) antisera followed by goat anti-chicken Alexa Fluor 488 (1:200, A-11039, Thermo Fisher), goat anti-guinea pig Alexa Fluor 568 (1:200, A-11075, Invitrogen), and goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 633 (1:200, A-21071, Invitrogen) immunoglobulins. Sections were examined on a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope with a 63×/1.4 Plan Apochromat objective at 1.4× zoom and Nyquist resolution using ZEN software (version 5.5.0.375). Image stacks were acquired at 0.38 µm intervals. The ventrolateral ARN was imaged at 0.38 µm z-step intervals with four image stacks tiled 2 × 2 taken at 1056 × 1056 pixels resolution and stitched using the 3D Stitching plugin in FIJI in linear blend mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Preibisch et al., 2009</xref>). For each animal, 10 regions of &gt;100 µm length of GFP-labeled dendrons selected due to their proximity to the ME and direction of projection toward ME were analyzed. A close apposition was defined as the absence of dark pixels between elements or even a slight overlap of the different channels. For 3D reconstruction, raw data image stacks were isosurface rendered in Amira (version 5.3, Visage Imaging, San Diego, CA) using the neuronal reconstruction plugin by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schmitt et al., 2004</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Confocal imaging of GnRH neuron dendron Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration</title><p>The procedure for making GCaMP6 recordings from GnRH neuron distal dendrons has been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Iremonger et al., 2017</xref>). In brief, the mouse was killed by cervical dislocation, the brain quickly removed, and optic tract peeled off. The dorsal surface of the brain was then glued to a vibratome cutting stage (VT1200s, Leica) and submerged in ice-cold (&lt;2°C) sucrose-containing cutting solution (in mM) (75 NaCl, 75 sucrose, 2.5 KCl, 20 HEPES, 15 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 0.25 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 6 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 25 <sc>d</sc>-glucose, bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>; 320 mOsmol). A single 500 µm thick horizontal slice containing the ME and surrounding tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) was made and incubated in the cutting solution (34 ± 1°C) and then recording aCSF (in mM)(118 NaCl, 3 KCl, 10 HEPES, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 2.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 11 <sc>d</sc>-glucose; 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>; 27 ± 1°C) for at least 1 hr before being transferred to the recording chamber (27 ± 1°C) where the slice was held between two meshes with a perfusion flow rate of 1.5 mL/min. Imaging was performed with an Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope fitted with a 40×, 0.8 NA objective lens and 3× zoom with the aperture fully open. GCaMP was excited with a 488 nm Argon laser and emitted light passed through a 505–605 nm bandpass filter.</p><p>Test compounds were dissolved in aCSF and locally puff-applied with a patch pipette (4–6 MΩ) at low pressure (~1 psi) controlled by a Pneumatic Picopump (PV821, World Precision Instruments, USA) for 20–90 s. Total recording time for each test was 500 s. The tip of the puff pipette was positioned 30–130 µm above the surface of the slice. Initially, GnRH neuron dendrons were tested with 30 s puffs of 20 mM KCl to assess their viability and only those fibers displaying fast Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses were used for experiments. Puffs of aCSF alone could generate small changes in signal with a slow rise and decay that followed the timing of the puff (4.50 ± 0.05%, range of −12% to 12% with a median of 4.44%). Acceptable recordings had to have &lt;5% drift in baseline fluorescence intensity across the time of the experiment. Control aCSF recordings were undertaken throughout the series of experiments, and kisspeptin tests were undertaken as the last challenge. To block action potential-dependent synaptic transmission, TTX (0.5–1 μM; Alamone Labs, Israel) was added to the recording aCSF for the duration of the experiment. For neuropeptide tests, GABAzine (5 μM; Tocris Bioscience, UK), D-AP5 (50 μM, Tocris) or DL-AP5 (25 μM), and CNQX (10 μM, Tocris) were added to the TTX-containing aCSF to eliminate ionotropic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor and glutamate receptor activation. A 0 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> aCSF containing TTX was applied at least 5 min before NMDA (200 μM; Tocris) puffs. Glutamate (600 μM; Tocris), AMPA (80 μM; Tocris), neurokinin B (100 nM; Tocris), dynorphin B (100–200 nM; Tocris), and Kisspeptin (100 nM, Calbiochem, USA) were maintained as frozen stock solutions and dissolved into the recording aCSF.</p><p>Image acquisition was performed with Fluoview 1000 software. Frame scans (512 × 512 pixels) were performed on zoomed regions at 0.9 Hz frame rate with the lowest possible laser power. Image analysis was performed with Fluoview1000 software and ImageJ. Regions of interest (ROI) were drawn around individual GnRH neuron dendrons. The percentage of GCaMP6 fluorescence was calculated as GCaMP6 ∆F% = 100x(F/F0), where F is the average fluorescence of ROI in each consecutive frame and F0 is the average fluorescence of ROI in first 10–20 frames before test drug puffs. Any tissue drift in the x–y axis was corrected by enlarging the ROI or by using Turboreg (ImageJ). All data are presented as mean± SEM. The average calcium traces are shown with lower and upper 95% confidence levels and have a minimum animal number of 4. Statistical analyses were performed with non-parametric paired sample Wilcoxon signed-rank test or repeated-measures tests (Kruskal–Wallis or Friedman test with a post hoc Dunn’s test).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Acute brain slice electrophysiology</title><p>Brain slice electrophysiology was undertaken as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hessler et al., 2020</xref>). In brief, adult male and diestrous-stage female <italic>Kiss1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Rosa26</italic>-tdT mice were killed by cervical dislocation and 250 µm thick coronal brain slices containing the ARN prepared on a vibratome (VT1000S; Leica) in an ice-cold 75 mM sucrose aCSF cutting solution.

Loose-seal cell-attached recordings (10–30 MΩ) were made from tomato-expressing KNDy neurons visualized through an upright BX51 Olympus microscope. Cells were visualized by brief fluorescence illumination and approached using infrared differential interference contrast optics. Loose seals were made using recording electrodes (3.5–5.2 MΩ) filled with aCSF and action currents recorded in the voltage clamp mode with a 0 mV voltage command. Signals were recorded using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) connected to a Digidata 1440A digitizer (Molecular Devices) and low-pass filtered at 3 kHz before being digitized at a rate of 10 kHz. For analysis, spikes were detected using the threshold crossing method. Signal acquisition and analysis was carried out with pClamp 10.7 (Molecular Devices). The effects of NKB on KNDy neurons were assessed by adding 50 nM NKB to the aCSF for 1 min.</p><p>For brain slice optogenetic studies, blue light (473 nm) was delivered using a Grass S88X Stimulator controlled DPSS laser (Ike-Cool, USA) coupled with a 100 μm diameter fiber optic probe that was placed immediately above the surface of slice. Laser intensity at the tip of the glass pipette surrounding the optic fiber was 4 mW. The blue light pulse was 5 ms wide, and a train of pulses at 10 Hz and/or 20 Hz was given for 10 s to each patched cell. The neuropeptide antagonists SB 222200 (20 μM; Tocris) and nor-binaltorphimine (12.5 μM; Tocris) were added to the recording aCSF.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>In vivo GCaMP photometry and LH pulse bleeding</title><p>The GCaMP6 fiber photometry procedure used to detect KNDy neuron SEs has been described in full previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Clarkson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Han et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">McQuillan et al., 2019</xref>). In brief, ~69% of KNDy neurons express GCaMP6 with this AAV approach and 96% of all GCaMP-expressing cells in the ARN are kisspeptin neurons. Freely behaving AAV-injected mice were connected to the fiber photometry system for 4–24 hr using a fiber optic patch cord with fluorescence signals measured using a scheduled mode (5 s on, 15 s off). SEs were defined as abrupt peaks in fluorescence greater than 10% of maximum signal. Processed fluorescence signals were calculated as ∆F/F (%) = 100 × (Fluorescence − basal Fluorescence)/Fluorescence. To examine the relationship between SEs and pulsatile LH secretion, ~1.5 hr of photometry recording was coupled with 3-5 min interval tail-tip blood sampling (4 μL) as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Clarkson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Han et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">McQuillan et al., 2019</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Richard D Palmiter as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Catherine Dulac as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Stephanie Padilla (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The importance of kisspeptin signaling from arcuate KNDy neurons (expressing kisspeptin, neurokinin B, dynorphin and glutamate) for fertility is well established. KNDy neurons are thought to be critical for the episodic release of LH by acting on GnRH-neuron terminals in the median eminence. A question posed here is whether kisspeptin is the only transmitter signaling onto GnRH terminals (referred to here as dendrons) in the median eminence. Some evidence suggests that the KNDy neuropeptides can be packaged into individual vesicles; thus, it is possible that only those vesicles containing kisspeptin travel to the median eminence. Alternatively, it is possible that all peptides and glutamate are released in the median eminence, but only receptors for kisspeptin are present there. To address this issue, the authors express a calcium indicator in GnRH dendrons and determine which transmitters can generate a calcium signal. They show that only kisspeptin can do so and go on to demonstrate that in the absence of kisspeptin (using KO mice), no signal is generated. This is an important result but does not completely distinguish between the two hypotheses.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors show that neither neurokinin, dynorphin nor glutamate can give rise to a calcium signal in the dendrons; however, these authors previously showed (Herde et al., 2013) that puffing glutamate onto GnRH dendrons can elicit action potentials. Resolution of this discrepancy is needed.</p><p>2) While the lack of calcium response argues that the receptors for various transmitters are not functional in GnRH dendrons, that alone does not answer the question of whether kisspeptin is the only transmitter released there. An effort to examine that aspect would make this story more interesting.</p><p>The authors should address the concerns above as well as the editorial issues raised by the reviewers including giving credit to studies from other labs that bear on this topic.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors of this high-quality paper use contemporary viral/genetic technologies to show that KNDy neurons in the ARN regulate GnRH release in median eminence (ME) via kisspeptin signaling only, even though they release all their transmitters there. They monitor GCaMP fluorescence in GnRH dendrons to establish that kisspeptin signals there, but NKB, Dyn and GLU do not, whereas these 3 transmitters signal onto Kiss1-neuron cell bodies, while kisspeptin does not. They also show that loss of kisspeptin signaling in ME prevents LH release.</p><p>1) Figure 6A Authors should compare dF/F trace of Kiss1<sup>Cre -/-</sup> with +/- mice, rather than referring to unpublished results.</p><p>2) The authors say, &quot;As such, it is interesting to consider whether the episodic release of NKB and dynorphin from KNDy varicosities in the region of the ventrolateral ARN may impact on other ARN neuronal cell types.&quot; It is equally interesting to consider the possibility that KNDy neurons release all their neurotransmitters in the ME and NKB, Dyn and Glu may signal to non-GnRH neurons. It would be useful to include references documenting that NKB, Dyn and GLU are released in ME, even if kisspeptin is the only molecule that can signal to GnRH dendrons. If references do not exist, would it be possible to express GCcMP6 non-specifically ME and express ChR2 in Kiss1<sup>Cre-/-</sup> KNDy neurons to show that cells in ME can respond to the other transmitters released by KNDy-neuron activation. Antagonists could then be used to establish which transmitters are released there.</p><p>3) It is also interesting to consider how Kiss1 receptors are trafficked to the dendron but neither neurokinin B receptors nor kappa opioid receptors. Some discussion of this cell trafficking problem is warranted.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript Liu and co-workers use in vitro and in vivo experiments to explore KNDy neuronal input onto GnRH nerve-fibers (called dendrons) in the arcuate nucleus median eminence area. The main strength of this work is the in vivo photometry experiment to activate ARN Kiss1 neurons combined with tail blood sampling for measurements of plasma LH as substitute for GnRH secretion. It is well known that Kiss1 deletion causes infertility. In addition, it is known that in some Kiss1<sup>Cre</sup> mouse models homozygous animals are designed to be infertile, including the mouse model used in the current study.</p><p>1) Using the infertile homozygous Kiss1<sup>Cre</sup> mouse, the authors showed that the lack of kisspeptin eliminates LH pulses following photometry stimulation in vivo of KNDy neurons, indicating that kisspeptin is responsible for LH pulses and is the main output signal from KNDy neurons onto GnRH terminals in the ME area. They also used this animal model to show that the absence of kisspeptin did not affect the synchronous firing of KNDy neurons, illustrating that kisspeptin is not involved in synchronous firing and that synchronous firing alone does not maintain fertility. However, previous studies both in vivo (Wakabayashi et al., 2010) and in vitro (Navarro et al., 2009, Qiu et al., 2016) had already provided substantial evidence for kisspeptin being the main output signal onto GnRH neurons and that NKB and dynorphin are responsible for synchronous firing.</p><p>2) It is interesting that although KNDy neurons release the peptides kisspeptin, NKB and dynorphin as well as the classical neurotransmitter glutamate, only kisspeptin was able to activate GnRH dendrons in the ME area. This is surprising since this group has shown previously (Herde et al., 2013) that both GABA and glutamate can depolarize GnRH distal dendrons. Specifically, they showed that puff application of glutamate (500 µM) on distal dendrons in vitro elicited bursts of action potentials. Currently, the authors used a similar concentration of glutamate applied in vitro and found no effect on Dendron calcium activity. Clearly further experiments are needed to sort out these differences.</p><p>Overall, although this manuscript report some compelling in vivo studies to ascertain the specific role of kisspeptin in the GnRH distal Dendron and confirm the role of NKB and dynorphin on synchronous firing, it is of limited scope and new information and therefore falls short of what one would expect for a Research Article in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Authors aim to test the presence and functional significance of KNDy co-transmission at the GnRH distal dendrites in the ventrolateral ARN. The authors use expansion microscopy to score synaptic connections between KNDy and GnRH distal dendrites. Next, they use ex-vivo slice imaging to report the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients of GnRH distal dendrons during pipette application of candidate neurotransmitters. The authors go on to investigate the functional role of kisspeptin on the pulsatile firing of KNDy neurons and the subsequent release of LH using a combination of fiber photometry and repeated blood sampling. This manuscript is a continuation of a large body of work from this laboratory. Most of the techniques used here have been previously published by this group and are at the cutting edge of this research field. As a reviewer I have two points for the authors to consider in revision:</p><p>1) In 2016 Qi, Nestor et al. evaluated the mechanistic properties of synchronous firing of KNDy neurons. Along with this, they demonstrated that the influence of NKB on GnRH neurons was indirect and mediated by kisspeptin from KNDy neurons. Given this, I think it is important for the authors to more specifically compare and contrast the work from Qui, Nestor et al., 2016. While the authors do cite the manuscript, the findings are not thoroughly compared.</p><p>2) The authors show that NKB was sufficient to induce [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in KNDy neurons, but not in GnRH dendrons. Given this, I found it curious that a delayed, indirect, spike was not observed in (Figure 2 A,B) from KNDy induction. Can the authors clarify this?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.62455.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors show that neither neurokinin, dynorphin nor glutamate can give rise to a calcium signal in the dendrons; however, these authors previously showed (Herde et al., 2013) that puffing glutamate onto GnRH dendrons can elicit action potentials.

With the move to confocal GCaMP6 imaging, as reported here, we can now investigate all dendrons regardless of the location of their cell body. The Herde studies reported that puffs of glutamate around the median eminence evoked membrane depolarization and one or two spikes in GnRH neuron cell bodies close to the median eminence. However, we noted and reported (Figure 6B,F of that paper) a marked gradient in response with glutamate efficacy becoming markedly less as we puffed further and further away from the cell body; in essence, any glutamate puff greater than 350 microns from the cell body failed to evoke a response. Our present observations come from dendrons that will be several 1000s of microns from their cell body. Hence, it seems very likely that there is falling gradient of glutamate receptor expression along the dendron and that, while glutamate will activate those rare dendrons coming from GnRH neuron somata close by the median eminence, 99% of dendrons around the median eminence have no glutamate receptors. We have now noted this in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) While the lack of calcium response argues that the receptors for various transmitters are not functional in GnRH dendrons, that alone does not answer the question of whether kisspeptin is the only transmitter released there.

We find that just over 25% of these neurons respond with either excitation or inhibition to 10-20 Hz KNDy activation and that the majority of responses could be blocked by NK3R or kappa opioid receptor antagonists. This provides key evidence supporting the hypothesis that kisspeptin, NKB and dynorphin are all released from KNDy nerve terminals in the ventral arcuate/median eminence region but that selective receptor expression results in only kisspeptin being active at the GnRH neuron dendron.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should address the concerns above as well as the editorial issues raised by the reviewers including giving credit to studies from other labs that bear on this topic.</p></disp-quote><p>The editorial issues have all been addressed.

The reviewer is correct in that there is very substantial, perhaps even indisputable, evidence that kisspeptin is the main output signal to the GnRH neurons. The present paper was not addressing this issue. Rather, the ability of the co-released neurotransmitters to regulate the activity of the dendron. One current hypothesis is that co-released dynorphin and NKB shape the GnRH neuron response to kisspeptin. We find no evidence for this. We disagree with the view that there is substantial evidence for NKB and dynorphin being responsible for the synchronous firing of the KNDy neurons. Evidence shows that KNDy neurons express functional tachykinin and kappa opioid receptors (de Croft et al.) and that KNDy neurons can signal to one another using these peptides (Qui et al.), however the key question as to whether NKB and dynorphin signalling amongst KNDy neurons generates their synchronous activity remains unanswered. Studies in sheep (Goodman et al.) and goats (Wakabayashi et al) infusing antagonists into the ventricle or even whole brain regions do not address this question with sufficient selectivity or precision. We do not pretend to answer this question in this paper but rather highlight the remarkably different roles of the KNDy peptides at the KNDy cells themselves and GnRH neuron dendrons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Authors aim to test the presence and functional significance of KNDy co-transmission at the GnRH distal dendrites in the ventrolateral ARN.
