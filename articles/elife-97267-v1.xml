Type 2 diabetes, acknowledged as a primary contributor to cardiovascular diseases, plays a vital role in vascular endothelial cell dysfunction due to induced abnormalities of glucolipid metabolism and oxidative stress. In this study, aberrant expression levels of <italic>circHMGCS1</italic> and <italic>MIR4521</italic> were observed in diabetes-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cell dysfunction. Persistent inhibition of <italic>MIR4521</italic> accelerated development and exacerbated vascular endothelial dysfunction in diabetic mice. Mechanistically, <italic>circHMGCS1</italic> upregulated arginase 1 by sponging <italic>MIR4521</italic>, leading to decrease in vascular nitric oxide secretion and inhibition of endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity, and an increase in the expression of adhesion molecules and generation of cellular reactive oxygen species, reduced vasodilation and accelerated the impairment of vascular endothelial function. Collectively, these findings illuminate the physiological role and interacting mechanisms of <italic>circHMGCS1</italic> and <italic>MIR4521</italic> in diabetes-induced cardiovascular diseases, suggesting that modulating the expression of <italic>circHMGCS1</italic> and <italic>MIR4521</italic> could serve as a potential strategy to prevent diabetes-associated cardiovascular diseases. Furthermore, our findings provide a novel technical avenue for unraveling ncRNAs regulatory roles of ncRNAs in diabetes and its associated complications.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>circHMGCS1</kwd><kwd>miR-4521</kwd><kwd>ARG1</kwd><kwd>type 2 diabetes</kwd><kwd>vascular endothelial dysfunction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>The National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32172192</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>The National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021C02018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cardiovascular disease, the top cause of diabetic deaths, progresses via vascular endothelial dysfunction, with circHMGCS1 and miR4521 highlighted as potential markers for the development of this condition.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The incidence of CVD in T2DM individuals was estimated to be at least two to four times higher than that in non-diabetic individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gregg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yun and Ko, 2021</xref>). T2DM gives rise to abnormal metabolic conditions, including chronic hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, inflammation, and oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Roden and Shulman, 2019</xref>). These processes ultimately lead to vascular endothelial damage, which disrupts the maintenance of vascular homeostasis, thereby promoting the development of CVD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lundberg and Weitzberg, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Niemann et al., 2017</xref>). Vascular endothelial dysfunction (VED) is considered the underlying basis for vascular complications at all stages of T2DM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eelen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Meigs et al., 2004</xref>). However, the mechanism by which the key molecules trigger endothelial dysfunction in diabetes-induced vascular impairment remains unknown.</p><p>Endothelial cells form a continuous monolayer lining the arterial, venous, and lymphatic vessels, playing a crucial physiological role in maintaining vascular homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bazzoni and Dejana, 2004</xref>). Moreover, endothelial cells actively regulate vascular tone, preserve endothelial integrity, and modulate platelet activity, contributing to hemostasis and endothelial repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2019</xref>). The leading cause of T2DM is a prolonged high-sugar, high-fat diet (HFHG), commonly known as a Western diet, which inevitably leads to VED, characterized by reduced content of nitric oxide (NO), uncoupling of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (<italic>ENOS</italic>), increased formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and upregulation of endothelial-related adhesion molecules such as intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (<italic>ICAM1</italic>), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (<italic>VCAM1</italic>), and endothelin 1 (<italic>ET-1</italic>). These alterations ultimately lead to elevated blood pressure and impaired vascular arteriolar relaxation, contributing to CVD development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yeh et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>). Despite this understanding, the identification of pivotal regulatory factors governing gene expression in diabetes-induced VED remains a formidable challenge.</p><p>circRNAs are generated through back-splicing of precursor messenger RNAs (pre-mRNAs), exhibiting features such as a covalently closed loop structure, high stability, conservation, and tissue-specific expression. These molecules primarily function as miRNA sponges, regulators of transcription, and interactors with proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kristensen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu and Chen, 2022</xref>). Conversely, miRNAs are single-stranded small RNA molecules of 21–23 nucleotides, characterized by high conservation, temporal and tissue-specific expression, and relatively poor stability. miRNAs—critical regulators of gene expression—control a wide array of cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gebert and MacRae, 2019</xref>). The interplay between miRNAs and circRNAs forms a complex regulatory network, profoundly influencing diverse biological pathways and disease states. miRNAs serve as guides, targeting specific mRNAs to induce their degradation or translational repression, thereby suppressing gene expression post-transcriptionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Treiber et al., 2019</xref>). By contrast, circRNAs contain miRNA binding sites, competitively inhibiting miRNA activity and thereby reducing miRNA binding to other mRNAs. This competitive adsorption effect modulates intracellular miRNA levels, affecting miRNA-mediated regulation of other target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cheng et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zeng et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The expression levels of circRNA in diabetic patients exhibit abnormalities, and its potential as a biomarker for early diagnosis or therapeutic target has been gradually being substantiated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jiang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stoll et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tian et al., 2018</xref>). However, research on circRNA in the context of diabetes-induced VED is scarce. Current research has predominantly focused on the regulatory roles of circRNA in diabetic cardiomyopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yuan et al., 2023</xref>), diabetic nephropathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang and Liu, 2022</xref>), gestational diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Du et al., 2022</xref>), and diabetic retinopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>). Investigations into circRNA regulation of VED have only described the phenomenon and analyzed the correlation of the results, lacking the precision to infer causation accurately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jiang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ma et al., 2023</xref>). Moreover, comprehension of VED induced by the complex multifactorial processes of diabetes pathogenesis remains relatively inadequate. Additionally, the interaction between circRNA and miRNA in diabetes-induced VED remains a subject of research controversy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cheng et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pan et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, a more comprehensive research approach is required to elucidate the specific mechanisms by which circRNA operates in diabetes-related CVDs.</p><p>The present study elucidated the mechanisms underlying the interaction between circRNA and miRNA in regulating diabetes-associated VED. Through the screening strategy, we successfully identified <italic>circHMGCS1</italic>—a circRNA originating from the pre-mRNA of <italic>HMGCS1</italic>. We demonstrated that the upregulation of <italic>circHMGCS1</italic> and downregulation of <italic>MIR4521</italic> significantly promoted diabetes-induced VED. Moreover, in-depth mechanistic investigations revealed that <italic>circHMGCS1</italic> functioned as a <italic>MIR4521</italic> sponge, increasing arginase 1 (<italic>ARG1</italic>) expression in vascular endothelial cells and accelerating VED progression. Furthermore, the expression patterns and interaction mechanisms between <italic>circHMGCS1</italic> and <italic>MIR4521</italic> in endothelial cells were identified for the first time in these findings, which also highlight the <italic>circHMGCS1</italic>/<italic>MIR4521</italic>/<italic>ARG1</italic> axis as a novel therapeutic target for interventions designed to protect patients from diabetes-induced VED.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Global expression analysis of endotheliocyte circRNAs</title><p>To explore the potential role of circRNAs in regulating endotheliocyte function, we characterized the transcriptome of circRNA derived from total RNA in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) stimulated by high palmitate and high glucose (PAHG), which allowed us to investigate the potential role of circRNAs in diabetes-induced VED (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>).

Our findings establish that <italic>circHMGCS1</italic> promotes VED progression, and its overexpression exacerbates endothelial cell dysfunction. Our study highlights the pivotal role of <italic>circHMGCS1</italic> in regulating endothelial cell function during diabetes.</p><p>circRNAs play regulatory roles by acting as microRNA sponges or interacting with proteins to regulate alternative splicing, transcription, and epigenetic modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arcinas et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hansen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Memczak et al., 2013</xref>). To investigate the mechanism of circHMGCS1 in VED regulation, we analyzed miRNA sequencing results and prediction software to identify <italic>MIR4521</italic> as a novel endothelial-expressed miRNA. <italic>MIR4521</italic> was found to possess a stable binding site with <italic>circHMGCS1</italic>, and its expression was significantly decreased in endothelial cells within a diabetic environment. Our functional studies revealed that <italic>MIR4521</italic> mimics attenuated VED development in diabetes, whereas its inhibition exacerbated VED progression. These findings preliminarily demonstrate the regulatory ability of <italic>MIR4521</italic> in VED. The interaction between <italic>circHMGCS1</italic> and <italic>MIR4521</italic> was further characterized through luciferase reporter gene assays, RNA pull-down, and RNA immunoprecipitation. AAV9-mediated <italic>circHMGCS1</italic> overexpression in endothelial cells dampened <italic>MIR4521</italic> expression and accelerated diabetes-induced VED. Conversely, restoring <italic>MIR4521</italic> expression effectively alleviated VED progression, highlighting the critical role of <italic>MIR4521</italic> in counteracting <italic>circHMGCS1</italic>-mediated promotion of diabetes-induced VED. Moreover, the absence of <italic>MIR4521</italic> aggravated diabetes-induced VED, whereas exogenous <italic>circHMGCS1</italic> addition did not affect VED development. Intriguingly, exogenous <italic>MIR4521</italic> significantly restrained diabetes-induced VED exacerbation, which was attenuated upon the subsequent addition of exogenous <italic>circHMGCS1</italic>. These findings underscore the essential regulatory role of the <italic>circHMGCS1</italic> and <italic>MIR4521</italic> interaction in maintaining diabetic vascular homeostasis.</p><p>Finally, we investigated the downstream targets crucial for <italic>circHMGCS1</italic>-mediated endothelial cell function. Arginase is a dual-nucleus manganese metalloenzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of L-arginine, primarily producing L-ornithine and urea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kanyo et al., 1996</xref>). <italic>ARG1</italic> and <italic>ARG2</italic>—two isoforms of arginase—exist in vertebrates, including mammals. Although <italic>ARG1</italic> and <italic>ARG2</italic> share the same catalytic reaction, they are encoded by different genes and exhibit distinct immunological characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hara et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pudlo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Su et al., 2021</xref>). Elevated <italic>ARG1</italic> activity in endothelial cells has been identified as a significant contributor to VED in T2DM individuals. This dysfunction is attributed to the excessive formation of ROS caused by the competition between <italic>ARG1</italic> and <italic>ENOS</italic> for L-arginine. Consequently, oxidases or mitochondrial complexes become overactivated, resulting in reduced NO levels and subsequent VED (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Caldwell et al., 2018</xref>). By contrast, inhibiting arginase has been shown to considerably enhance endothelial function in T2DM patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mahdi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shemyakin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>). Our findings suggest that T2DM enhances <italic>ARG1</italic> activity and expression in vascular endothelial cells. Conversely, <italic>ARG1</italic> inhibition in endothelial cells delayed the onset of diabetes and preserved NO metabolite levels in the aorta. Additionally, Ach-induced vasodilation remains intact in the absence of <italic>ARG1</italic> in the aortic ring, as <italic>ARG1</italic> inhibition promotes <italic>ENOS</italic>-dependent relaxation, thereby preventing VED. Meanwhile, ROS content in the aorta of diabetic mice could be reduced under <italic>ARG1</italic> inhibition, thereby suppressing the occurrence of oxidative stress. AAV9-mediated overexpression of <italic>circHMGCS1</italic> increases <italic>ARG1</italic> expression, which is inhibited by exogenous <italic>MIR4521</italic> intervention. In the absence of <italic>MIR4521</italic>, <italic>circHMGCS1</italic> cannot regulate <italic>ARG1</italic> expression, whereas exogenous <italic>MIR4521</italic> intervention inhibits the diabetes-induced increase in <italic>ARG1</italic> expression in vivo, and this effect is counteracted by <italic>circHMGCS1</italic> overexpression. Both in vitro and in vivo data suggest that the <italic>MIR4521</italic> or <italic>circHMGCS1</italic> fails to regulate the effect of diabetes-induced VED in the absence of <italic>ARG1</italic>. Therefore, <italic>ARG1</italic> may serve as a promising VED biomarker, and <italic>circHMGCS1</italic> and <italic>MIR4521</italic> play a key role in regulating diabetes-induced VED by <italic>ARG1</italic>.</p><p>It would be intriguing to elucidate the mechanisms through which <italic>circHMGCS1</italic> and <italic>MIR4521</italic> exert their regulatory roles in endothelial cell function. The present study elucidated the potential VED-associated mechanisms in diabetes, with a specific focus on the complicated mutual effects between <italic>circHMGCS1</italic> and <italic>MIR4521</italic>. The ceRNA network involving <italic>circHMGCS1-MIR4521-ARG1</italic> can become a novel and significant regulatory pathway for preventing and potentially treating diabetes-induced VED. Our findings suggest that targeted inhibition of circHMGCS1 or the overexpression of <italic>MIR4521</italic> could serve as effective strategies in mitigating diabetes-induced VED. These insights underscore the promising function of ncRNAs in developing therapeutic interventions for diabetes-associated VED.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

To induce diet-induced diabetes, they fed wild-type littermates either a standard chow (Control) or a high fat-high sucrose (HFHG) diet, where the diet composition consisted of 60% fat, 20% protein, and 20% carbohydrate (H10060, Hfkbio, China). The dietary regimen was maintained for 14 weeks. Throughout this period, body weight and fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels were measured on a weekly basis. Although the authors induced diabetes with a diet also rich in fat, the cholesterol concentration or metabolism was not investigated. After the treatment, were the animals with endothelial dysfunction? How was the blood pressure of the animals?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments and kind suggestions. We have conducted a study on the impact of HFHG diet on the serum levels of total cholesterol(T-CHO) in mice over a 14-week period. Our findings indicated that the HFHG diet significantly elevated T-CHO levels in the serum of mice (Supplementary Figure 5E). Additionally, HFHG diet was associated with an increased in blood pressure (Figure 5F) and it exacerbated the progression of endothelial dysfunction in mice (Figure 5H-L).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Strengths:</p><p>To explore the potential role of circHMGCS1 in regulating endothelial cell function, the authors cloned exons 2-7 of HMGCS1 into lentiviral vectors for ectopic overexpression of circHMGCS1 (Figure S2). The authors could use this experiment as a concept proof and investigate the glucose concentration in the cell culture medium. Is the pLV-circ HMGCS1 transduction in HUVEC increasing the glucose release? (Line 163)</p></disp-quote><p>In the manuscript, we utilized a DMEM culture medium containing 4500 mg/L glucose. Given that the HUVEC cell culture is glucose-dependent for its metabolic processes, it was challenging to precisely evaluate the relationship between pLV-circHMGCS1 transduction and the glucose concentration in the medium.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) Pg 20. The cells were transfected with miR-4521 mimics, miR-inhibitor, or miR-NC and incubated for 24 hours. Subsequently, the cells were treated with PAHG for another 24 hours. Were the cells transfected with lipofectanine? The protocol or the lipofectamine kit used should be described. The lipofectamine protocol suggests using an incubation time of 72 hours. Why did the authors incubate for only 24 hours? If the authors did the mimic and inhibitor curves, these should be added to the supplementary figures. Please, describe the miRNA mimic and antagomir concentration used in cell culture.</p></disp-quote><p>For detailed transfection methods of miRNA mimic and its inhibitor, please refer to “Transfection of miRNA mimic or inhibitor” (Line 587) in the revised Experimental Section. We employed the Hieff TranssiRNA/miRNA in vitro transfection reagent (yeason, China, 40806ES03), with a transfection duration of 48h. The miR-4521 content in HUVEC post-transfection was quantified using qRT-PCR. The transfection of the miR-4521 mimic for 48h notably enhanced its expression in HUVEC (Supplementary Figure 3B), whereas the transfection of the miR-4521 inhibitor for the same duration significantly suppressed its expression (Supplementary Figure 3C). The concentration used for both miRNA mimic and inhibitor transfection was 50 nM. In the revised manuscript, we have corrected the transfection time and clarified that we did not utilize miRNA antagomirs in our experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Pg 20, line 507. What was the miR-4521 agomiR used to treatment of the animals?</p></disp-quote><p>miRNA agomir serves as a valuable experimental tool for elucidating miRNA function, used to simulate the overexpression of a specific miRNA. miRNA agomir is a chemically modified RNA molecule identical in sequence to the target miRNA, engineered for enhanced stability and transfection efficacy. Utilizing miRNA agomir enables the overexpression of the target miRNA, facilitating the investigation of miRNA functions and mechanism in vivo. In our study, we have employed miRNA mimic for cellular studies and miRNA agomir in vivo applications to achieve high expression of miRNA (Fu et al, 2019).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Figure 1B. The results are showing the RT-qPCR for only 5 circRNA, however, the results show 48 circRNAs were upregulated, and 18 were downregulated (Figure S1D). Why were the other cicRNAs not confirmed? The circRNAs upregulated with high expression are not necessarily with the best differential expression comparing control vs. PAHG groups. Furthermore, Figure 1A and S1D show circRNAs downregulated also with high expression. Why were these circRNAs not confirmed?</p></disp-quote><p>Our study aims to the identification of potential biomarkers for endothelial dysfunction in type 2 diabetes, To the end, we focused on circRNAs that exhibited significant upregulation following PAHG treatment. In our sequencing data, the p-values for these top upregulated circRNAs were notably below the threshold of 0.001, prompting their selection for further validation. We employed qRT-PCR to ascertain the consistency of their expression levels with the RNA-sequencing findings. Among these, circHMGCS1 was identified as a promising candidate with regulatory potential in endothelial dysfunction. Additionally, circRNAs that were significantly downregulated will be the subject of our ongoing research endeavors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Figure 1B shows the relative circRNAs expression. Were host genes expressed in the same direction?</p></disp-quote><p>circRNAs are generated from specific exons or introns of their host genes, either individually or in combination, and the main function of circRNA depends on its non-coding RNA characteristics. The expression levels of circRNAs is not necessarily correlated with those of their host genes, and similarly, the function of circRNAs do not inherently relate to the functions of the host genes (Kristensen et al, 2019; Liu &amp; Chen, 2022). Consequently, the data presented in Figure 1B were primarily aimed at validating the accuracy of circRNA-seq. Although we did not conduct host gene expression analysis for the identified circRNAs, our subsequent results indicated that the overexpression of circHMGCS1 did not influence the expression levels of HMGCS1 (Figure 2A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Line 128. The circRNA RT-qPCR methodology was not described. The methodology should be described in detail in the Methods Session.</p></disp-quote><p>The only difference between the circRNA RT-qPCR method and other gene detection is that random primers need to be used for reverse transcription during the reverse transcription process. Unlike linear RNAs that possess a 3' polyA tail, which allows for the use of oligo(dT) primers, circRNAs require random primers to initiate the reverse transcription process. Beyond this distinction, the other processes are no different from the common qRT-PCR process. We have revised the Isolation of RNA and miRNA for quantitative Real Time-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis method in the revised version (Line 695).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Line 699. The relative gene expression was calculated using the 2-ΔΔCt method. This is not correct, the expression for miRNA and gene expression are represented in percentage of control.</p></disp-quote><p>We initially employed the 2^-ΔΔCt method to ascertain the relative gene expression levels. Subsequently, we scaled all values by a factor of 100 to amplify the visual representation of the observed variations, thereby enhancing the visualization of the data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Line 630. Detection of ROS for tissue and cells. The methodology for tissue was described, but not for cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the detailed description of the cellular ROS detection methods in the revised manuscript as follows:</p><p>For ROS detection in cells, the treated cells were washed once by PBS, then 20 μM DHE was added, and incubated at 37°C for 30 min away from light, then washed three times by PBS and then colorless DMEM medium was added, followed by fluorescence microscopy for observation (Line 640-643).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Line 796. RNA Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (RNA-FISH). Figure 1F shows that the RNA-Fluorescence in situ hybridization (RNA-FISH) confirmed the robust expression of cytoplasmic circHMGCS1 in HUVECs (Figure 1F). However, in the methods, lines 804 and 805 described the probes targeting circMAP3K5 and miR-4521 were applied to the sections. Hybridization was performed in a humid chamber at 37C overnight. Is it correct?</p></disp-quote><p>We have made a correction in the revised manuscript. The accreted description is &quot;the probes targeting circHMGCS1 and miR-4521 were applied to the sections&quot;(Line816).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Line 14. Fig 1-H. The authors discuss qRT-PCR demonstrated that circHMGCS1 displayed a stable half-life exceeding 24 h, whereas the linear transcript HMGCS1 mRNA had a half-life less than 8 h (Figure 1H). Several of the antibodies may contain trace amounts of RNases that could degrade target RNA and could result in loss of RNA hybridization signal or gene expression. Thus, all of the solutions should contain RNase inhibitors. The HMGCS1 mRNA expression could be degraded over the incubation time (0-24hs) leading to incorrect results. Moreover, in the methods is not mentioned if the RNAse inhibitor was used. Please, could the authors discuss and provide information?</p></disp-quote><p>This experiment was performed in cell culture as described in our Experimental Methods (Line 753), where we added actinomycin D directly into the cell culture well plates, and the cells remained in a healthy state during this treatment. We did not directly extract mRNA from cells for this experiment. Additionally, all solutions utilized throughout the whole experiment were prepared using Rnase-free water, ensuring that the integrity of the mRNA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) Further experiments demonstrated that the overexpression of circHMGCS1 stimulated the expression of adhesion molecules (VCAM1, ICAM1, and ET-1) (Figures 2B and 2C), suggesting that circHMGCS1 is involved in VED. How were these genes expressed in the RNA-seq?</p></disp-quote><p>In the manuscript, we only focused exclusively on circRNA and miRNA sequencing, and not perform mRNA sequencing, Consequently, we employed qRT-PCR and Western blot to assess the expression alterations of ET-1, ICAM1, and VCAM1 at gene and protein level. The findings revealed that the overexpression of circHMGCS1 significantly upregulated the expression of adhesion molecules (VCAM1, ICAM1, and ET-1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) Line 256. By contrast, the combined treatment of circHMGCS1 and miR-4521 agomir did not significantly affect the body weight and blood glucose levels. OGTT and ITT experiments demonstrated that miR-4521 agomir considerably enhanced glucose tolerance and insulin resistance in diabetic mice (Figures 5C, 5D, and Figures S5B and S5C). Why did the miR-4521 agomir treatment considerably enhance glucose tolerance and insulin resistance in diabetic mice, but not the blood glucose levels?</p></disp-quote><p>Our results showed that miR-4521 agomir could effectively suppress the increase of body weight and blood glucose in mice (Figure 5A-B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(12) In the experiments related to pull-down, the authors performed Biotin-coupled miR-4521 or its mutant probe, which was employed for circHMGCS1 pull-down. This result only confirms the Luciferase experiments shown in Figure 4A. The experiment that the authors need to perform is pull-down using a biotin-labeled antisense oligo (ASO) targeting the circHMGCS1 backsplice junction sequence followed by pulldown with streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads to capture the associated miRNAs and RNA binding proteins (RBPs). Also, the ASO pulldown assay can be coupled to miRNA RT-qPCR and western blotting analysis to confirm the association of miRNAs and RBPs predicted to interact with the target circRNA.</p></disp-quote><p>This point is correct. As suggested, we utilized a biotin-labeled circHMGCS1 probe for pull down experiments. Because circRNA-miRNA interactions are mainly mediated by the RNA-induced silencing complex, which includes Argonaute 2 (AGO2), we examined the levels of miR-4521 and AGO2 in the capture meterial. Our results demonstrated that circHMGCS1 significantly captured miR-4521 in the cells, with a concomitant acquisition of AGO2. These findings have been integrated into the revised manuscript (Supplementary Figures 4D and 4E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(13) In Figure 5, the authors showed that the results suggest that miR-4521 can inhibit the occurrence of diabetes, whereas circHMGCS1 specifically dampens the function of miR-4521, weakening its protective effect against diabetes. In this context, what are the endogenous target genes for the miR-4521 that could be regulating diabetes?</p></disp-quote><p>In this study, we focused on the role of miR-4521 in endothelial function. Our animal experiments involving ARG1 knockdown revealed that the reduction of ARG1 expression resulted in the inability of miR-4521 to modulate the progression of type 2 diabetes. Consequently, ARG1 is likely an endogenous target gene of miR-4521, potentially implicated in the regulation of diabetes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(14) In the western blot of Figure 5, the β-actin band appears to be different from the genes analyzed. Was the same membrane used for the four proteins? The Ponceau S membrane should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>As described in our experimental methodology (Western blot analysis), we have utilized PVDF membranes for our Western blot experiments. β-actin, recognized for its high expression and specificity as a housekeeping gene, yields distinct bands with minimal background noise. This property can lead to the migration β-actin from the spot wells to both sides during electrophoresis. So much so that it is not aligned with the lane shown by the target gene. And the other 3 genes can see the phenomenon of obvious lane because their expression is not as high as β-actin. We replaced β-actin with a similar background in the revised manuscript (Figure 5L).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(15) Why did the authors use AAV9, since the AAV9 has a tropism for the liver, heart, skeletal muscle, and not to endothelial vessels?</p></disp-quote><p>AAV9 has garnered significant interest as a gene delivery vector due to its extensive tissue penetration, minimal immunogenicity, and stable gene expression profile. Its application in cardiovascular disease research and therapy has been widely reported (Barbon et al, 2023; Yao et al, 2018; Zincarelli et al, 2008). Meanwhile, we employed AAV9 for gene delivery via the tail vein injection in mice, and as shown in Figure 5J and Figure 7Q, we observed GFP signals carried by AAV9 in the thoracic aorta of mice. These findings suggest that AAV9 possesses the capability to infect endothelial cells effectively.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors observed an aggravated vascular endothelial dysfunction upon overexpressing circHMGCS1 and inhibiting miR-4521.

Therefore, ARG1 may serve as a promising VED biomarker, and circHMGCS1 and miR-4521 play a key role in regulating diabetes-induced VED by ARG1. In this context, they should re-evaluate whether this is the best title. &quot;Circular RNA HMGCS1 sponges miR-4521 to aggravate type 2 diabetes-induced vascular endothelial dysfunction&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>This manuscript initiates its exploration with circRNA as the focal point of study (Figure 1 and Figure 2), It then delves into the miRNAs associated with circRNA and elucidates their interactions (Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 5). Subsequently, the manuscript identifies the target genes of miRNA and validates the regulatory effects of circRNA and miR-4521 on ARG1 (Figure 6). The study culminates with the application of the ceRNA theory to confirm the significance of ARG1 in the functional interplay between circHMGCS1 and miR-4521 (Figure 7). These findings throughout the manuscript are dedicated to uncovering the pivotal roles of circHMGCS1 and miR-4521 in modulating vascular endothelial function. Notably, the interaction between circHMGCS1 and miR-4521 represents a novel discovery of our research. Therefore, we aim to emphasize the critical function of circHMGCS1 and miR-4521 in the regulation of vascular endothelial dysfunction in type 2 diabetes within the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>I have a few suggestions for improving the study further.</p><p>(1) Although the experiments suggest the role of circHMGCS1, miR-4521 in vascular endothelial function, the direct regulation or interaction of circHMGCS1-miR-4521-ARG1 is unclear.

The knockdown of circHMGCS1 significantly reduced the expression of circHMGCS1 in HUVEC without influencing the expression of the host gene HMGCS1. Concurrently, the knockdown of circHMGCS1 resulted in an upregulation of miR-4521 (Supplementary Figure 4B) and a downregulation of ARG1 (Figure 6P and 6Q). In our manuscript, the upregulation in ARG1 expression caused by circHMGCS1 overexpression was reduced by miR-4521, and the downregulation in ARG1 expression caused by miR-4521 overexpression was also reversed by circHMGCS1. When miR-4521 was knocked down, the expression of ARG1 increased, and circHMGCS1 abrogated its regulatory effect on the expression of ARG1.

The pull down of circHMGCS1 followed by qPCR enrichment analysis of all target miRNAs must be performed to select the target miRNA.</p></disp-quote><p>In this manuscript, we identified the expression of miRNA under PAHG treatment through miRNA sequencing, and then further screened out 4 miRNAs with potential binding sites to circHMGCS1 utilizing the miRanda database. Subsequently, we employed qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis to confirm the regulatory influence of miR-4521 on endothelial function (Figure 3). Following this, RIP, RNA pull down, dual luciferase and RNA-FISH experiments were conducted to map the interaction between circHMGCS1 and miR-4521 (Figure 4), the direct interaction between circHMGCS1 and miR-4521 was further substantiated through overexpression and knockdown studies (Figures 5-7). while the reviewer's method may offer a more direct validation, our methodology initially involved a database-driven screening of candidate miRNAs with the potential to target and bind circHMGCS1, followed by experimental validation of these interactions.

These primers are specific for circRNA amplification and do not amplify the corresponding linear RNA, as demonstrated in Figure 2A.

We employed a dual-luciferase assay to confirm the direct interaction between circHMGCS1 and miR-4521.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Since the ceRNA network works efficiently in an equimolar concentration of the regulatory molecules, providing the copy number of circHMGCS1, miR-4521, and target mRNAs would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We employed qRT-PCR to ascertain the absolute quantification of mRNA copy numbers, following established methodologies (Nolan et al, 2006; Wagatsuma et al, 2005; Zhang et al, 2009). Our qRT-PCR data reveal that the circHMGCS1 mRNA copy number is 2343±529. In comparison, the ARG1 mRNA copy number stands at 88±27, while the miR-4521 copy number is significantly higher, recorded at 36277±9407.</p><fig id="sa3fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>The distribution of copy numbers for circHMGCS1, miR-4521 and ARG1 in HUVECs.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-97267-sa3-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The yellow highlighted &quot;cyclization-mediated sequence-F &amp; R&quot; does not seem to be complementary sequences.

This strategic pairing is designed to enhance the circularization efficiency of circRNA while concurrently suppressing mRNA synthesis (Liang &amp; Wilusz, 2014).

Specifically, we have included the full-length nucleic acid electrophoresis diagram of circHMGCS1 in Supplementary Figure 1F, the Sanger sequencing results in Supplementary Figure 1G, and a comparative analysis of the circHMGCS1 sequences obtained from Sanger sequencing with those referenced in the circBase database, presented in Supplementary Figure 1H.</p><p>Reference:</p><p>Barbon, E., C.
