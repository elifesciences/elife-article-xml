Despite comprising only few chemosensory neurons at the periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stocker, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stocker, 2008</xref>), <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae are able to sense a wide range of chemicals but the principles of how a small neuronal population encodes a large sensory space entail unresolved questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Komarov and Sprecher, 2022</xref>). They display behaviors to different gustatory cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gerber and Stocker, 2007</xref>), being repelled by bitter tastants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">El-Keredy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2016</xref>) as possible signals of toxic food, and attracted by sweet, certain amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schipanski et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Croset et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kudow et al., 2017</xref>), or ribonucleosides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mishra et al., 2018</xref>), indicators of a nutritious diet. For <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae, an animal that increases body size up to 200–250-fold in 5 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Robertson, 2009</xref>) and spends the bulk of its time searching for food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Green et al., 1983</xref>), the most important nutritional sources are sugar, such as sucrose and fructose found in fermenting fruits – their natural diet, as well as proteins and fatty acids, taken up from yeast growing on this substrate. As one of the most important macronutrients in the larval diet, sugar is associated with high nutritional values for survival and with proper function of metabolic processes. Nevertheless, larval external taste neurons have not been associated thus far to a role in sugar taste preference.</p><p>In the fruit fly, taste encoding at the periphery has been described in line with segregated hedonic valence logic, attractive and aversive taste being detected through separate cell populations. Accordingly, specific members of the <italic>Gustatory receptors</italic> (<italic>GRs</italic>) family mediate sweet or bitter taste, namely cells expressing Gr5a, Gr61a, or Gr64a-f detect sugars and do not overlap with bitter-taste cells expressing <italic>Gr66a</italic> or <italic>Gr33a</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dahanukar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fujii et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Thorne et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">French et al., 2015</xref>). Additional taste modalities such as salt, fatty acid, carbonation, polyamines, or amino acids partially overlap onto these by means of added-on expression of <italic>Ionotropic receptors</italic> (<italic>IRs</italic>) or <italic>pickpocket</italic> receptors (<italic>Ppk</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hussain et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tauber et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahn et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ganguly et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sánchez-Alcañiz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jaeger et al., 2018</xref>), but maintaining a segregated attraction/aversion quality of taste in the separate cell populations. Contrary to described adult fly taste sensing logic, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva taste of opposed valence can overlap, shown by a single gustatory receptor neuron (GRN) activated by both sugar and bitter tastants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van Giesen et al., 2016a</xref>) and thereby indicating a higher level of taste integration than in the adult fly.</p><p>Chemosensory organs are located at the tip of larval head, and comprise bipolar sensory neurons that extend axonal projections into defined regions of the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Python and Stocker, 2002</xref>). The main external sense organs are the terminal organ ganglion (TOG) with taste primary function and the dorsal organ ganglion (DOG) as olfactory organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stocker, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Klein et al., 2015</xref>). Out of more than 30 GRNs in the TOG only seven neuronal identities (C1–C7) have been mapped and are traceable by means of individual GR-Gal4 lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van Giesen et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kwon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rist and Thum, 2017</xref>). Because of experimental restrictions in probing the system due to the limited availability of individually mapped TOG Gal4 lines, physiological characterization has been thus far tackled in few single GRNs, but a global approach for measuring responses in larval taste sense neurons could prove useful to an overview of peripheral gustatory responses.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Peripheral taste neurons of the fruit fly larva.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The chemosensory system of the larva.

However, sweet sensing neurons or receptors have not been identified in the larval peripheral taste system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kwon et al., 2011</xref>), although larvae can detect and elicit behaviors towards most sugars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rohwedder et al., 2012</xref>). Larval sugar perception has been allotted to <italic>Gr43a</italic> fructose receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mishra et al., 2013</xref>), which, however, is expressed in pharyngeal sensory organs, foregut and in the brain, but absent from external taste neurons, similar to its expression in the adult fly where it acts as main hemolymph fructose sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Miyamoto et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miyamoto and Amrein, 2014</xref>). As one of the most important macronutrients in larval diet, and therefore it seems surprising that external taste organs at direct contact with animal’s environment would not be involved in sugar detection and output behavior, all the more so as sucrose can elicit physiological response in TOG neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van Giesen et al., 2016a</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we probe response profiles of TOG taste neurons by means of whole-organ in-vivo calcium imaging and subsequently pursue to investigate sugar peripheral taste in the larva. Our experimental approach allows an assessment of general tuning of larval GRNs and identification of distinct response dynamics, while revealing a high fraction of calcium response to sucrose. We test larval behavior and tackle the described central role of Gr43a receptor in sugar taste by separating external taste sensing from internal taste. Segregation of internal and external larval taste neurons in behavior has also been recently established for bitter taste (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Choi et al., 2020</xref>). We equally explore the contribution of individual TOG neurons in sugar taste and identify C2 as one neuron participating in peripheral sucrose detection in the larva. Our study reveals a high complexity in taste response at the level of external taste neurons in the fruit fly larva, and we propose that distinct neurons are employed in sugar sensing depending on the dietary substrate.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Whole organ larval taste recordings with cellular resolution</title><p>At the level of the TOG, main larval external taste organ containing around 30 sense neurons, 7 GRNs have been identified based on receptor-Gal4 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van Giesen et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kwon et al., 2011</xref>). To assess their spatial location, we performed immunostainings of the seven individual TOG neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). Although cell positions vary slightly between stainings (n≥3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), 3D locations can be approximated on an illustrative map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Four individual TOG neurons have previously been characterized physiologically, revealing taste multimodality as a characteristic in the larval sensory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van Giesen et al., 2016a</xref>). Considering that molecular mapping for all TOG neurons through single driver lines has not yet been compiled, physiological characterization of the larval external taste organ through labeling individual neurons is not readily achievable. To circumvent this constraint in direction for a response profile overview of larval GRNs in the TOG we implemented a whole-organ imaging approach.</p><p>We performed in-vivo whole-organ calcium imaging recordings by expressing cytoplasmic GCaMP6m (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2013</xref>) and nuclear RFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Egger et al., 2007</xref>) reporters in all neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>). The use of a nuclear reporter was chosen for efficient cellular segmentation and for establishing a reproducible data processing pipeline for whole organ recordings (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1s1sdata1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1—source data 1</xref>). As previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">van Giesen et al., 2016b</xref>), we made use of a customized microfluidic chamber allowing for simultaneous imaging and chemical stimulation. We used a series of chemical compounds belonging to different canonical taste categories in concentrations that have been previously used in similar studies in the fruit fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van Giesen et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Park and Carlson, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ling et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, see Materials and methods).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Whole-organ calcium imaging shows an overview of response tuning of GRNs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative recording of the larval primary taste organ stimulated with citric acid 100 mM.

(<bold>B</bold>) Stimulation with groups of tastants by taste modality, in order: two sugar categories (mono and disaccharides), low and high concentration salts, and four amino acid groups. A response intensity threshold of 20% DF/F was considered and neuronal responses across different preparations were pooled together. Among all neurons responding to sugar group stimulation, a comparable ratio of cells showed activation to either one or the other category and 25.4% to both groups of mono and disaccharides. For salt-responding neurons, a higher proportion of neurons showed activation to high salt than to low salt concentration, and 20% neurons responded to both categories. Amino acids split into four groups gave a rounded 62% of uni-group responses and the rest of 38% neurons responded to two or more amino acid groups per animal. (<bold>C</bold>) Responses in animals stimulated with two groups of bitter compounds or with both sugar and bitter test groups. Within the total number of bitter-responsive neurons, 55% were uniquely activated by the DSoTC group and respectively 30% by QLSC group. In animals stimulated with both modality groups, integration between sweet and bitter taste has been calculated and we observed similar proportions of taste cells responding only to bitter groups (30.3%), cells responding only to sugar (39.4%) and cells responding to groups of both modalities (30.3%). (<bold>D</bold>) GRN responses to series of individual tastants. Taste stimulation was done using a series of five tastants per animal, each belonging to one of the five canonical taste modalities represented by sucrose 500 mM (sweet/red color), denatonium 10 mM or quinine 5 mM (bitter/blue), NaCl 1 M for high salt or NaCl 100 mM for low salt (salt/purple), valine 100 mM or arginine 100 mM (amino acids/brown) and citric acid (CiA) 100 mM (sour/yellow). Seven and respectively eight separate organs were recorded within the two series of stimulation (N=15) and a total of 197 neurons showed responses above 20% DF/F0 and were further analyzed. The table shows illustrative traces for cells responding to one or more tastants in two separate representations, each for one of the two stimulation sets. (<bold>D’</bold>) Total percentages of taste integration in pooled data are represented on the pie chart: 68% of total responding neurons were activated by only one tastant per organ and up to 32% of neurons responded to more than one tastant. Most unimodal responses (uni-taste/cell, left extended pie) were recorded to sucrose and to high salt. Conversely, numerous neurons were activated by different combinations of taste categories, with different frequency of occurrence (multi-taste/cell, right extended pie).

for sweet, bitter, amino acid, and salt taste modalities (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) and pooled all neuronal responses for the ratio of taste modality integration per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). In the sweet taste category, we tested two sugar groups chosen as monosaccharides (fructose, glucose, arabinose, mannose, and galactose) and disaccharides (sucrose, trehalose, maltose, lactose, and cellobiose) and calculated approximately 74% of sugar-responsive neurons to be activated by either monosaccharides (41%) or disaccharides (33%), and approx. 25% by both groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, left panel). For salt taste stimulation, we mixed NaCl and KCl at final concentration of 50 mM for low salt group, and at 1 M for high salt group. We observed a low percentage of cell activation overlap among salt-responding cells with 20% activated by both high and low concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, middle panel) and we recorded more responses to high salt (56%) than to low salt. The 20 proteinogenic amino acids were compiled in four groups (A, B, C, and D) as previously described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Park and Carlson, 2018</xref> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, see Materials and methods). 38% amino acid-responding neurons showed activation to two or more amino acid groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, right panel). Bitter tastants were randomized in two groups of four substances each (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, see Materials and methods): DSoTC group (denatonium benzoate, sucrose octaacetate, theophylline, and coumarin), and respectively QLSC group (quinine, lobeline, strychnine, and caffeine) chosen at previously used concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ling et al., 2014</xref>). Among cells responsive to bitter stimulation, we observed a bigger fraction of cells activated by DSoTC group (55%). In animals tested for sweet and bitter taste response, we identified cells activated by both sugar and bitter groups (30%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, right panel), in agreement with cell integration of opposite valence tastants.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Sucrose elicits neuronal responses in the TOG</title><p>Further, we focused GRN stimulation on few specific compounds representative of the five canonical taste categories: sweet, bitter, salt, amino acids, and sour. Each animal was stimulated with a representative substance from each category, either with sucrose (sweet), denatonium (bitter), NaCl 1 M (high salt), valine (amino acid), and citric acid (sour) or with sucrose (sweet), quinine (bitter), NaCl 100 mM (low salt), arginine (amino acid), and citric acid (sour) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We recorded a 15 total of TOG organs and we selected activation responses calculated above a threshold of 20% DF/F0. Out of all responding neurons (N=197, 15 organs), 68% showed activation to only one tastant per animal and most unimodal responses were recorded to sucrose and to high salt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D’</xref>, left extended pie chart). Up to 32% responding neurons were activated by more than one test substance used for stimulation of the animal. The most frequent taste modalities combinations eliciting response in the same neuron within a given preparation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D’</xref>, right extended pie chart) were: sucrose+ citric acid, sucrose and valine/arginine (sweet+ amino acid, 17%), sucrose and high salt (sweet+ high salt, 19%), sucrose and low salt (10%), sucrose and denatonium/quinine (sweet+ bitter, 9%), sucrose and citric acid (9%), citric acid and high salt (sour+ high salt, 12%), and finally amino acid and low salt (10%). Interestingly, therefore, sucrose was the tastant corresponding to several uni-taste/cell responses but also to most frequent taste combinations that activate the same neuron.</p><p>The above fractions observed across pooled data recapitulate the responses recorded per each organ, as represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, with an average of taste modality integration per cell per organ of 67% multimodality/33% unimodality, for a mean of 19 responses per organ, 13 responding neurons, and 5 sucrose-activated neurons per organ detected in average.</p><p>To test if order of tastant presentation would generally alter neuronal responses within a series of stimulations, we looked into responses of C7 to sucrose 500 mM before or after the denatonium stimulation. C7 is a TOG neuron previously shown to respond to both sugar and bitter substances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van Giesen et al., 2016a</xref>), but we observed no significant difference in sucrose-elicited response in this neuron based on order of sweet and bitter presentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Distinct response temporal dynamics</title><p>The observations described above for grouped or individual series of tastant stimulations refer to canonical recorded calcium signals characterized by a rise in GCaMP fluorescence during stimulus application. However, at a closer look, tastants elicit different types of signals within the TOG organ, besides canonical ON response, neurons also showing OFF responses and late activation or even fluorescence intensity drop upon stimulation, as exemplified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref> for sucrose 500 mM, citric acid 100 mM, or NaCl 100 mM. We proceeded to manually map responses to organ across different larvae and for this purpose, we compiled all activation signals of early/ON responses or late onset/OFF responses with a fluorescence rise above 20% response threshold. Four neurons localized anterior-laterally to the other cells (named Anterior Lateral Neurons [ALNs], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> insets) served as landmark in determining the relative spatial location of a cell.

At 1%, C2 silencing has a lesser effect on sugar preference, suggesting that other mechanisms come into play for behavior on a softer substrate.

Blue coloring of the intestine was observed as early as 2 min on 1% concentration, while on 2.5% animals didn’t seem to be able to eat as easily as indicated by the lack of tint of their abdomen at 2 min and 5 min testing. For longer time points, larvae also start showing food ingestion on 2.5% agarose, but the intestinal blue dye is less prominent than on 1% concentration.

Thus far, our observations reveal partial roles in sucrose and fructose sensing associated to C2 or C5 neurons, and therefore it is probable that several TOG neurons might contribute to the output behavior in sugar response, either through a direct role or indirectly by computing a mixture of sucrose and other tastants as previously shown for C7.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Peripheral taste sensing in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae—contribution to sugar and bitter taste of GRNs at different anatomical levels.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the larval head and the chemosensory system.

We designed an experimental framework for calcium imaging in all GRNs comprised by the larval primary taste-sensing organ, the TOG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>). Our approach complements previous strategies based on targeting single or discrete subpopulations of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Croset et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sánchez-Alcañiz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van Giesen et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kwon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stewart et al., 2015</xref>), allowing for an overview of activation patterns within the organ. As previously shown in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae, concurrent activation of two neurons can differ from their separate activation readout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hernandez-Nunez et al., 2015</xref>) as specific sense neurons firing together might dictate the relevance of a stimulus and ultimately its behavioral output. Coherently, each tastant used here typically elicits response in several GRNs in support of a combinatorial sensing, while also raising the question about the redundancy in contribution of distinct neurons recruited in response to a given taste quality, to be elucidated by future studies.</p><p>For the tested substances at the concentrations chosen within this study, we observed roughly a 60–70% versus 30–40% division of unimodal versus multimodal responding GRNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), comparable with tuning proportions reported for mouse fungiform taste sensing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jisoo Han, 2018</xref>). Taste stimulation with substance-modality groups showed a mixed tuning of responding neurons and, in particular, 30% of neurons stimulated with bitters and sugars were activated by both taste groups, in accord with the integration of opposed valence cues in single larval neurons. As previously shown for one GRN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van Giesen et al., 2016a</xref>), such types of sensory integration might allow the animal to evaluate mixed food sources at the level of the input neuron.</p><p>Interestingly, in animals stimulated with individual substances representative of different taste modalities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), up to 68% of responsive neurons were activated by only one tastant per animal. This could be due to the selected substance concentrations that could elicit weak responses undetectable at the chosen intensity threshold of response or at the imaging resolution used in this study. By varying the number and concentration of tested substances, we expect neuron tuning to be altered, as described on afferent taste neurons in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wu et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>An interesting feature in larval taste physiology revealed by our observations was related to distinct response dynamics elicited by tastants in larval GRNs. Apart from canonical GCaMP fluorescence increase during stimulus, we also identified late neuronal activation that could be characterized as OFF-response with onset after stimulus application, but also GCaMP fluorescence drop during taste stimulus as perhaps deactivation response. Most notable deactivation signals were recorded in CDL2 neuron and most stereotypically to citric acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Interestingly, citric acid elicited concomitant activation in a neighboring cell named CDL1, indicating response patterns of activation-deactivation. The synchronous activation coupled with deactivation responses in adjacent neurons resemble the description of ephaptic signaling which implies that the electrical field of a responding cell generates hyperpolarization in the partner cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jefferys, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Faber and Pereda, 2018</xref>). While ephaptic transmission has been described in the olfactory system of the adult fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Su et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>), it remains to be determined whether such lateral inhibition mechanism also occurs in <italic>Drosophila</italic> taste. Regardless of the underlying molecular mechanisms, deactivation events together with delayed and OFF-responses most probably enter in assembly of spatio-temporal codes as described for taste discrimination in the moth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Reiter et al., 2015</xref>), and remain an open fascinating question in the physiology of larval sensory neurons.</p><p>A large proportion of neurons responsive to one taste substance per animal were activated by sucrose and, interestingly, sucrose also elicited numerous responses in neurons activated by two or more tastants, in combinations such as sucrose+ citric acid, sucrose+ amino acid, sucrose+ high salt, and sucrose+ bitter (denatonium/quinine). It is possible that, at least in part, these neurons integrate sucrose response with other modalities for purposes of evaluating mixed dietary substrates for the purpose of avoiding dangerous food mixtures rather than having a direct role in sucrose sensing and output behavior, as previously indicated for C7 neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van Giesen et al., 2016a</xref>).</p><p>Nevertheless, since a direct participation of TOG neurons in sugar taste behavior has thus far not been shown, we here explored the roles of individual external gustatory cells. We started by testing C2, C6, and C7—neurons that have associated calcium responses to sucrose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van Giesen et al., 2016a</xref>). As expected, C7 has been linked to taste integration of opposed valence of sucrose and denatonium or quinine and we have not observed a defect in direct sucrose behavior in C7-silenced larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Similarly, silencing C6 also did not result in behavioral defects. Known to have a role in CO<sub>2</sub> sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kwon et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jones et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Faucher et al., 2006</xref>), C6 is likely not involved in sucrose behavioral response per se, but prospectively important for integration of this taste in detecting fermenting substrates, and therefore would also have a role in computing mixed tastes, a hypothesis to be confirmed by future work.</p><p>We identified C2 to contribute in the attraction to sucrose. Interestingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hernandez-Nunez et al., 2015</xref> described a ‘weak attractive response’ in larvae when C2 was optogenetically activated alone but when co-activated together with C1 neuron, the C1-dependent repellent behavior was potentiated. This suggests that C2 neuron might be involved in sensing of an attractive cue while also enhancing the aversive behavior in association with a bitter neuron, as a possible mechanism for avoiding risky food mixtures. As silencing C2 does not result in a complete abolishment of sucrose attraction, additional TOG or external sense neurons might participate to sugar behavior. In support of this idea, we tested C5 neuron as a likely sugar-sensing candidate not expressing bitter-implicated receptors <italic>Gr66a</italic>/<italic>Gr33a</italic>, whose silencing also resulted in a trend for preference decrease compared to control larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>The Gr43a receptor expressed in pharyngeal sense neurons and in the brain has a central role in sugar sensing in larval taste (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mishra et al., 2013</xref>). To fit in this context our observations on TOG calcium responses to sugar and a role of C2 neuron in sucrose sensing, we make distinction between external and pharyngeal taste. We compared larval behavior on easily ingestible 1% agarose concentration, as tested by Mishra et al., and on 2.5% substrate that is less accessible for eating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B, B'</xref>). Our results support the hypothesis that C2 neuron in the TOG senses sucrose and contributes to behavior prior to and in absence of eating, whereas Gr43a is the main sugar receptor but requires food ingestion. The overrun of <italic>Gr43a</italic> guided behavior during food ingestion may be due to the lesser need for external sugar sensing when it has already been located and ingested, thus switching to an alternative internally guided pathway for sugar preference behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Also, the reminiscent behavioral defects of <italic>Gr43a</italic> mutant to fructose sensing on 2.5% substrate (impaired ingestion) could be due to <italic>Gr43a</italic> expression in several internal tissues (pharynx, proventriculus, and brain) and to its role as hemolymph fructose sensor. It has been shown that hemolymph carbohydrates influence larval feeding behavior through insulin signaling and SLC5A11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ugrankar et al., 2018</xref>), but it remains to be determined if and how does a <italic>Gr43a</italic> mutant correlate with metabolic pathways and possibly interfere with sugar preference output behavior.</p><p>In the adult, <italic>Gr43a</italic> acts as the main fructose hemolymph sensor but also associates a role in feeding suppression in satiated animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Miyamoto et al., 2012</xref>).

Based on this summary, taste sensing in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva would entail cell multimodality for food mixture processing, combinatorial taste through co-activation of neurons of distinct valence, and anatomical or molecular segregation of specific tastant detection.

We thus identify C2 as contributor to sucrose taste and open directions for further investigations on additional external sugar sense neurons and the query of their redundancy, role in computing substance mixtures, as well as specific molecular mechanisms and receptors involved in sugar detection.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stocks</title><p>We used the following fly strains: <italic>nSyb</italic>-Gal4 (gift from Shanhaz Lone), UAS-<italic>GCaMP6m</italic> (Bloomington #42748), UAS-<italic>H2B:RFP</italic> (gift from Boris Egger), <italic>GMR57BO4</italic>-Gal4 (Bl. #46355), <italic>Gr94a</italic>-gal4 (Bl. #57686), <italic>Gr21a</italic>-Gal4 (Bl. #23890), <italic>Gr22e</italic>-Gal4 (Bl. #57608), <italic>Gr66a</italic>-Gal4 (Bl. #57670), <italic>Gr33a</italic>-Gal4 (Bl. #57623), <italic>Gr59d</italic>-Gal4 (Bl.57653), <italic>Gr32a</italic>-Gal4 (Bl. #57622), <italic>Gr97a</italic>-Gal4 (Bl. #57687), <italic>Gr59e</italic>-Gal4 (Bl. #57655), UAS-<italic>myr:GFP</italic> (Bl. #32198), and UAS-<italic>TNTE</italic> (Bl. #28837).

For correction of drift or animal movement, a 3D drift correction plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Parslow et al., 2014</xref>) was run on the GFP signal before merging the two channels. This software code allows for decent amendment of z-drift of hyper-stacks. Subsequently, the drift-corrected GFP and the original duplicated RFP stack were merged and the misalignment between the two signals was adjusted using an in-house Fiji/ImageJ macro for manually guided realignment on the x-y axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1s1sdata1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1—source data 1</xref>). A final 3D drift correction was performed on the aligned two-channel hyperstack for better stabilization.

Normalization of fluorescence values followed the formula (F<sub>t</sub>−F0)/F0, where F<sub>t</sub> is the intensity at time point t and F0 the baseline calculated as average intensity of 10 frames prior to stimulation. Response amplitude was calculated as the difference between the peak intensity after stimulation (average of 5 frames near the maximal fluorescence value) and F0. All traces were manually validated to exclude false positive responses. Any of the following criteria was sufficient to exclude traces as possibly false positives: the baseline signal was unstable or the baseline variance was higher than the calculated response amplitude; the fluorescence rise upon stimulation could have been caused by an artifact; a delocalized fluorescence signal could have been captured by the cell spot, compromising the measured response. For further analysis, a response threshold was set at 20% DF/F0. To calculate taste integration percentages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), for each data set, we pooled together all neurons eliciting at least one response above 20% in amplitude and determined the fraction activated by one or by multiple tastants/taste groups per animal.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Cellular mapping</title><p>This step was performed entirely manually for recordings with individual tastant stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and D’</xref>).

There were a few points that concerned us, and we list here experiments that will help support the claims made in manuscript better.</p><p>– Functional Imaging</p><p>1. We would like to get a sense of the variability in responses to the tastants – both inter- and intra- individual variability. To illustrate this, we are asking the authors to (1) represent the data as <italic>per neuron, per animal</italic>, and (2) show more traces (as in 2D) for individual cells from individual animals across trials with different tastant stimulations.</p><p>2. To irrefutably assign taste response profiles to each of the neurons, we're also suggesting (1) dose responses to each tastant, and (2) swapping the order of tastant presentation while recording responses.</p><p>3. Central to better describing inter-individual variability will be the unambiguous identification of individual GRNs across individuals. This needs to be shown more definitively and we recommend a uniformed naming system to avoid confusion. One possible way they could do this is by labelling known GRNs in the whole organ imaging. If only a small number of GRNs can be so identified, perhaps the authors could focus on just these for their analyses.</p><p>4. The methods and criteria used for image acquisition and processing needs to be described better.</p><p>– Behaviour</p><p>The authors' central thesis – peripheral sweet neurons&gt;hard food; internal sweet neurons&gt;soft food – hinges on the result that on hard food, despite the absence of 43a from the pharyngeal neurons, larvae still show a preference for sugar. Presumably larvae are not eating during the 2-5 minute window (4B) and so the brain 43a receptors cannot driving this preference for sugar. They reason, it must be peripheral neurons that are responsible for this. We have three issues with this central finding and their interpretations:</p><p>1. <italic>Sugar or Texture?</italic> There's a possibility that mechanosensation (response to texture of the food) might be playing a role in this observation. The authors could demonstrate the specificity of this response by performing a dose response curve with sucrose (we recommend sticking to sucrose as it shows more robust PIs). So, we recommend that they perform the experimental conditions in 4B(bottom) with sucrose at different concentrations.</p><p>2. <italic>The 43a null</italic>: If the peripheral neurons were driving this behaviour, the 43a null mutants should show at least a residual sugar preference, which they don't on either soft or hard food. It's possible that the authors are missing this in the low PIs of 4B. The above experiment should uncover this.</p><p>3. <italic>Peripheral neurons on soft food only?</italic> What keeps the peripheral neurons from driving sugar preference on soft food in the absence of 43a? If the authors are suggesting that the peripheral sugar neurons are gated by both <italic>sugar and texture</italic>, they would need to demonstrate this through functional imaging. And in that case, activating the peripheral-GRNs in the brain-only 43a animal should induce sugar feeding on soft food.</p><p>In the individual reviews below, the authors will find more specific points that pertain to the broad points mentioned here. Could the authors please pay attention to them as they address these points?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors use a very nice microfluidic set-up to monitor neuronal activity in an ex-vivo larval TOG while simultaneously bathing it in a variety of tastants. They show a surprisingly high level of multimodality in the GRNs – &gt;30% respond to 2-4 tastants. On occasion, these overlaps were of opposing hedonic value and so the authors propose a high level of signal integration in the larval taste organ. They seem to suggest that this could occur via temporally distinct responses in the GRNs.</p><p>Subsequently, the authors focus on sugar sensing in this peripheral organ. Interestingly in larvae, the 43a receptor that senses sugars is not expressed in the periphery but in the pharynx (where it can detect sugar in the ingested food) and in the brain (where it can detect haemolymph sugars). Here the authors demonstrate that many of the peripheral GRNs can respond to sugars. They silence 3 GRN classes to find that one of them is necessary/involved in sugar sensing.</p><p>They next turn to addressing the issue of peripheral vs internal sensing of sugar. They perform behavioural experiments to calculate preference for sugars while silencing the peripheral GRN or mutationally inactivating GR43a. They perform these experiments in soft and hard food and suggest that in soft food (when the animal can easily ingest) the internal sugar sensors are utilised. On hard food however, they suggest that the internal sensors are not as important, but that the peripheral GRNs involved in sugar sensing are necessary. This is an interesting idea.</p><p>My primary concern with this manuscript is the section dealing with the internal vs peripheral sensing of sugars. It's possible that some of my concerns arise out of the manner in which these results are reported and discussed, nevertheless, I will list them out here:</p><p>– The preference indices in figure 4B seem very low: 0.2. At such low PIs I wonder if the authors might mistakenly interpret a lower π for a 'no-preference'. In general I did not understand the reasons for using the various sugars at differing concentrations in this section.</p><p>– The whole animal 43a mutant on both hard and soft food shows a complete inability to detect sugar. If this is true, then it suggests that the pheripheral neurons are NOT involved in sugar sensing. Do the authors agree with this interpretation?</p><p>– The brain-only 43a mutant data makes the whole animal mutant data more difficult to interpret. If the difference between soft and hard food is a difference in time taken to ingest the food (as shown in Figure 4B), then there should be no difference in the trends of sugar responsiveness except in the axis of time. I have not understood why the authors think that on soft food the peripheral GRNs don't compensate for the lack of pharynx-43a to drive sugar feeding. Can the authors please comment on this?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Maier et al., investigates neural basis of sugar perception/coding in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae using in vivo calcium imaging and behavior. Authors developed a volumetric imaging method to capture taste responses in all of the TOG neurons in larvae. The whole organ imaging method developed here will be a very useful technique for <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval chemosensory imaging. However, the imaging method and data analysis pipeline to identify cellular identity is not clearly explained in the manuscript. It is important to provide a metric for how effective and reliable cellular identity classifications are and the variations among individual larvae. The volumetric imaging results indicate that TOG neurons can respond to one modality or multiple modalities. The neural response dynamics are also variable. Some neurons show ON responses while some show OFF-responses or inhibition upon tastant stimulation. Furthermore, the authors test the function of TOG neurons in regulating sugar preference and found that the C2- TOG neuron is important for discriminating sugar when food is more viscous and harder to ingest. Overall, I think the volumetric imaging method is promising however, the imaging method and data analysis pipeline is not clearly explained and no metric has been provided to show how effective 3D cellular identity analysis is. The behavioral experiments regarding C2 neurons are not consistent with the previously published functional imaging analysis from the same group. Further functional imaging experiments are necessary to support the claims in the paper.</p><p>1. The whole organ imaging method developed here will be a very useful technique for <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval chemosensory imaging. However, the details of image capture and processing is somewhat vaguely explained in the manuscript. Multiple details and metrics are missing about how imaging is done. What is the laser power used in these experiments? What is the frame rate for each volume scanned? What is the size of each volume, field of view etc. The movement and the drift correction for calcium imaging makes sense, however more detailed explanation about how they process imaging data is necessary. For example, in Figure Supplement 1, the authors are correcting GFP channels using the position information from the RFP channel and their method is able to handle the xy-plane. However, it is not clear how they handle z-drift. Did the post-processing also apply for the movement and drift correction in the Z-axis? What is the error rate for x-y or z correction? It would be good to know how accurate their methods are in identifying the same cell identities across animals. The authors need to expand the methods section and explain clearly how volumetric imaging and data processing was done in the paper. This is key for accurate interpretation of cell identification and the calcium imaging results.</p><p>2. Is figure 2B and 2C showing the percent responsive cells recorded across multiple animals or the percent responsive cells within an animal? I think it is important to clarify this point. What is the variance between individuals? I would like to understand how reliable cell identification and functional imaging analysis is across animals. This can be achieved if authors show data per animal rather than lumping all the data across the animals together. Another reason to visualize individual animal responses is to investigate whether the order of tastant stimulation is a critical factor for larval taste perception: For a neuron that can respond to bitter and sugar, would the sequence of stimulation matter? Will the neuron change activity if it was stimulated first with a bitter compound then a sugar compound? What about the opposite? I strongly encourage authors to show more traces for individual animals across trials with different tastant stimulations as done in Figure 2D. This will help the reader understand what is the variation in taste responses across animals and it will also increase confidence for the consistency of authors' volumetric imaging method.</p><p>3. In figure 3A, the authors show different calcium dynamics upon tastant stimulation in different TOG neurons. They have observed, off responses and inhibition of neural activity in certain neurons upon stimulation. I would like to see what is the percentage of OFF-responses and inhibition observed in these experiments. Are these events frequent or rare? Are they seen in all animals or some of the animals used in the calcium recordings? It is important to understand whether these are biologically relevant neural responses or artifacts seen in some of the animals used in the experiments.</p><p>4. In Figure 3, authors replot the results from Figure2 this time by identifying cellular identity using anatomical position. This is something similar to what I was trying to get to in my previous comment (see comment 2). But even in plots shown in Figure 3C, it is hard to understand how successful authors' methods are in classifying each neuron type in each animal. For example, how many larvae in total have been tested in Figure 3C and in what percentage of the animals they were able to identify each neuron type and what is the variation in neural responses among each animal. I think this is a very critical point that needs to be clarified in the paper variation of taste responses among animals and a metric to show how successful cellular identification is across all the animals tested. If my understanding is correct, the total number of tested organs/animals is 15, however the data plotted in Figure 3C does not correspond to this number. Please explain what is the success rate to define a cell type across animals.</p><p>5. The authors mention that the only known sugar receptor gene Gr43a is not expressed in TOG but TOG neurons can respond to sugars. This is a puzzling finding. Is the expression analysis of Gr43a receptor based on transgenic reporters or single cell sequencing? In other words, is there other evidence that TOG does not express any known sugar receptors in larvae?</p><p>6. In figure 4, authors performed behavioral experiments to test the function TOG sugar sensing in larvae. Inhibiting one of the TOG neurons, C2 causes defects in sucrose preference when agarose ss 2.5 % but not 1%. They claim the external sugar sensing via TOG sensory neurons is critical when food is not soft enough to ingest. These are interesting hypothesis however, in their previous study, authors have shown C2 neurons respond weakly to 500mM sucrose but not to any other sugar. However, in this manuscript the stronger behavior phenotype is seen in 250mM fructose preference upon silencing of C2 neurons. It is not clearly to me what is the mechanism here. Please explain.</p><p>7. In general, I think it will help to use one nomenclature for the paper or provide a table matching C-X identity to cellular identities in Figure 3C and list which compound(s) each neuron responds to and indicate the type of response; ON, OFF or inhibition.</p><p>8. The manipulations for larval GRNs in the manuscript are done chronically by expressing TNT-E. This might impact the development and wiring of the larval chemosensory system and cause problems in sugar detection unrelated to GRN function. I think using a conditional inhibitor of neural activity such as shits or newly developed ontogenetic inhibitors, GtACRs, might be better to use here to show conditional inactivity of the neurons result in similar defects in sugar sensing.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:Drosophila</italic> larvae have been put forth as a good model to study taste because of the simplicity of the system (in terms of the number of organs and neurons) and efficient behavior assays. However, an understanding of taste coding in the larval system lags behind that described for the adult stage, in which most taste sensilla/neurons are accessible for recordings or imaging. Maier et al., seek to address this gap by developing a whole organ calcium imaging approach to assess responses of neurons in the larval terminal organ to sweet, bitter, salt, amino acid, and acid tastants. From imaging 15 organs, the authors describe responses to a set of sweet, bitter, salt, amino acid, and acid tastants, collectively represented in neurons that appear to be tuned to one, two or multiple categories of tastants.Although the new approach has promise, the current study makes a limited conceptual advance and the number of positive responses used to ascribe responses to neurons is small. Overlap of tastant sensitivities has now been described, and more rigorously so, in the adult stage and in the authors' own previous work focusing on genetically labeled subsets of taste neurons. The identification of responsiveness to sucrose, which may be somewhat unexpected given the absence of sweet Gustatory receptors (Grs) in larvae, has also been previously described for a few neurons, one of which is further studied in behavior assays.</p><p>The imaging analysis is followed by investigation of the potential roles of sugar sensing neurons in the periphery. While this analysis provides further support for a previously identified peripheral neuron (C2), it does not convincingly parse contributions of internal and external neurons.</p><p>Specific weaknesses are elaborated via points below and could be addressed either with additional experiments or textual modifications.</p><p>Calcium imaging:</p><p>– Neuron categories were determined by imaging responses to only a single concentration of each tastant; more careful dose response analysis may alter the conclusions. This possibility has not been considered.</p><p>– There is no effort to reconcile the imaging results with predictions from previous studies. For example, the number of bitter-responsive neurons is 1-2 per larva. However, bitter-GAL4 lines have been mapped to many more neurons in the TO.</p><p>– The correspondence between neurons named from previous GAL4 mapping experiments to those named by position in this study is not at all clear. A better comparison between the two could be presented.</p><p>–The criteria that were used to manually exclude false positive responses in calcium imaging experiments (Line 475-476) have not been described.</p><p>– A response was ascribed to an identified neuron if the position was the same in &gt;3 organs. This threshold seems low, considering that 7-8 organs were tested with each stimulus. In the table for Figure 3, for instance, several tastants have n=3. Is this from a higher number of tastant applications? If so, what was observed in the other cases – that a response could not be ascribed to the identified neuron or that there was no response at all?</p><p>Behavior:</p><p>– There are no indications of statistically significant differences between the genotypes in Figure 4B; the legend only mentions that the preference of Gr43a mutants is not significantly different from zero. Finally, data in Figure 4C are compared with Mann-Whitney tests, but ANOVA should be used instead.</p><p>– Whether sucrose response of internal neurons is affected in Gr43a mutants has not been tested (relevant to Figure 4C).</p><p>– In Figure 4B right, assuming that Gr43a mutant controls are not significantly different from zero, whereas Gr43a &quot;brain only&quot; are, I don't know how to interpret a potential role for Gr43a brain neurons in preference for 2.5% agarose food, at 2 minutes when the larvae are not consuming anything.</p><p>– The calcium imaging analysis is at the cellular level, not looking into contributions of receptors. Manipulating cells rather than receptors for behavior experiments would allow for better comparison between the two aims of the study. If the Gr43a mutant is the only way to go, suggested experiments are:</p><p>1. Test if the complementary brain ablated genotype (Gr43a internal taste only) yields the expected phenotypes on 1% and 2.5% agarose.</p><p>2. Test if peripheral sugar responses are affected in Gr43a mutants.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.67844.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The methods used in this manuscript are useful and the findings extremely interesting.

Also, in Figure 3 we are including traces per mapped neuron to a given tastant from three different organs. The previous data representation of Figure 3 was moved to Figure 3-figure supplement 1 with a more stringent threshold for plotted tastant responses per cell. All responses recorded as above 20% in amplitude included in the paper are available in the supporting information (source data excel tables).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. To irrefutably assign taste response profiles to each of the neurons, we're also suggesting (1) dose responses to each tastant, and (2) swapping the order of tastant presentation while recording responses.</p></disp-quote><p>1. This is an excellent suggestion, as proved by the well documented example in <italic>Drosophila</italic> of low vs. high salt concentrations that activate distinct taste cell populations for divergent output behaviors. Nevertheless, manually mapped neurons in response to a given tastant across separate organs are displayed in Figure 3 and Figure 3-Supplement1 as proof of concept and we believe that more ambitious attempts for neuronal mapping and to a range of tastant concentrations should be assisted by tissue registration techniques. We propose that irrefutably assigning response profiles to each neuron does not make the main object of this study, but we present a valuable whole organ analysis tool in assisting future efforts using complementary necessary techniques for neuron labeling towards this purpose. Instead, our data aims at providing a grasp of the variety of recorded responses to 5 tastants from distinct modalities in average in the larval external taste organ.</p><p>We hope that reviewers accept our reasoning, as a dose response analysis on a manually mapping approach of cell identities would be extremely challenging.</p><p>2. The tastant order swapping is an important point and this is included in the protocol design of whole organ recordings, as the order of tastant presentation was randomized for each organ. Also, we have now additionally performed single neuron calcium imaging in C7 – neuron known to respond to both sugar and bitter tastants (van Giesen et al., 2016a) – to exemplify the influence of order presentation on sucrose-elicited responses. We have found no significant difference between sucrose response before or after stimulation with denatonium in this neuron, as shown in Figure 2-Supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

The system employed here for neuronal annotation as proof of concept relies on an estimated neuron location relative to the sagittal plane, anterior-posterior axis and ventral-dorsal axis (CPV = centroposterior-ventral). In Figure 3-Figure Suppl.1 we have plotted mapped neurons using more narrow constraints than previously in Figure 3, in line with the reviewer’s comment for more focused analyses. However, in order to retackle these identities for further characterization and for building a reference retraceable naming system, our tools constitute only one building block and should be complemented by:</p><p>– A working model for cell stamping of known GRNs within a whole organ labeling in physiological recordings,</p><p>– A tissue registration approach of whole organ imaging for automatic cell mapping circumventing manual cell annotation and</p><p>– A higher number of Gal4 transgenic lines mapped alongside the 7 known identities of GR-expressing neurons, such as co-mapping GR lines with IR and Ppk Gal4 lines.</p><p>Also, considering that individual physiological characterizations for the few known GRNs of the larval TOG organ have been tackled previously for 5 out of 7 mapped neurons, the main aim of our study was rather towards an overview of the range of response types per organ, attempted for the first time in larval peripheral taste sensing, to our knowledge. We thus could identify an average cell response multimodality ratio per organ, cell-specific deactivation events and sucrose-evoked responses in the larval TOG. This informed the second part of this manuscript for sugar sensing in the larva and could similarly direct further dissections of larval taste coding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

This hypothesis is supported by the expression of Gr43a receptors, which are present at the level of pharyngeal neurons, brain and other peripheral tissues such as in the foregut, but absent from the TOG external neurons (Kwon et al., 2011, Mishra et al., 2013).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The 43a null: If the peripheral neurons were driving this behaviour, the 43a null mutants should show at least a residual sugar preference, which they don't on either soft or hard food. It's possible that the authors are missing this in the low PIs of 4B. The above experiment should uncover this.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, as the reviewer correctly suggested, the above experiment shows residual preference of the Gr43a mutant to sucrose/fructose at higher concentrations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Peripheral neurons on soft food only? What keeps the peripheral neurons from driving sugar preference on soft food in the absence of 43a? If the authors are suggesting that the peripheral sugar neurons are gated by both sugar and texture, they would need to demonstrate this through functional imaging. And in that case, activating the peripheral-GRNs in the brain-only 43a animal should induce sugar feeding on soft food.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe the above experiment equally addresses this point, as <italic>Gr43a</italic> mutant larvae do not show a complete defect on higher concentrations, including on 1% agarose. This indicates that sugar sensing via C2/TOG neurons contribute to output preference including during food ingestion but that it is overran by <italic>Gr43a</italic>-dependent pathways.</p><p>All in all, we do not believe C2/TOG neurons would be inactivated on soft food, but rather they play a role in a multicomponent system with different leverages for sugar sensing in the larva, as we are illustrating in Figure 5. Also worth noting is that the natural environment the fruit fly larva feeds on often implies the animal is immersed in a soft substrate, with a lesser need for clear taste dissociation between external and internal taste sensing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the individual reviews below, the authors will find more specific points that pertain to the broad points mentioned here. Could the authors please pay attention to them as they address these points?</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…]</p><p>My primary concern with this manuscript is the section dealing with the internal vs peripheral sensing of sugars. It's possible that some of my concerns arise out of the manner in which these results are reported and discussed, nevertheless, I will list them out here:</p><p>– The preference indices in figure 4B seem very low: 0.2. At such low PIs I wonder if the authors might mistakenly interpret a lower π for a 'no-preference'.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, the 100mM Fructose concentration tests yield low preferences in the Gr43a mutant. We have therefore, at the reviewer’s suggestion, included higher tastant concentration in what is now Figure 4 – Figure Suppl.1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In general I did not understand the reasons for using the various sugars at differing concentrations in this section.</p></disp-quote><p>To briefly describe our reasoning:</p><p>1. We have initially focused on sucrose 500mM because this was previously employed in other larval taste studies and in the whole organ imaging in the first part of the manuscript, which informed the behavioral testing in the second part.</p><p>2. Then, having formulated our hypothesis that larvae can sense sucrose despite not being able to readily ingest the food, we wanted to connect our observations with the previous reports for Gr43a sensing. As Mishra et al., 2013, have mainly described Gr43a sensing on fructose 100mM at 1% agarose concentration, we have added this sugar to our analysis to reproduce observations from this study and to compare between agarose concentrations.</p><p>3. Other sucrose and fructose concentrations have been added at the reviewer’s suggestion showing a lesser role of Gr43a at higher concentrations and also, as expected from literature reports, lesser to sucrose and more specific to fructose.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The whole animal 43a mutant on both hard and soft food shows a complete inability to detect sugar. If this is true, then it suggests that the pheripheral neurons are NOT involved in sugar sensing. Do the authors agree with this interpretation?</p></disp-quote><p>At the reviewer’s suggestion we added behavior data in Figure 4-Figure Suppl.1 which show <italic>Gr43a</italic> mutant does not yield a complete defect for fructose 500mM preference, and neither is this the case for sucrose 100mM or 500mM.</p><p>However, we were generally not taken aback by an inability of the <italic>Gr43a</italic> mutant in sugar sensing, be it on soft or hard substrate. Since <italic>Gr43a</italic> is the main internal fructose sensor in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, expressed not only in the DPS, but also in the brain and in the proventriculus of the gastrointestinal system, we propose that a null mutant presents with a more systemic defect, which may be due to metabolic signaling, as shown for hemolymph carbohydrates influencing larval feeding behavior though insulin signaling and SLC5A11 (Ugrankar et al., 2018) or through the inability to gauge the state of satiety. Sugar sensing in the adult also consists of a multicomponent sensing system, with brad sugar sensing receptors on the proboscis distinct from Gr43a expressed internally that acts both as internal nutrient sensor and as feeding suppresor in satiated animals, while other receptors also carry roles in limiting sugar intake (Miyamoto et al., 2012; Joseph et al., 2012).</p><p>Altogether, we propose a model whereby C2 / TOG neurons act to signal the presence of sugar, but Gr43a expressed elsewhere can outweigh the behavioral output, either directly triggered by food ingestion, but also potentially indirectly through internal signaling (Figure 5B). This model for larval sugar-sensing mechanism aligns with, and complements, reports in the adult.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The brain-only 43a mutant data makes the whole animal mutant data more difficult to interpret. If the difference between soft and hard food is a difference in time taken to ingest the food (as shown in Figure 4B), then there should be no difference in the trends of sugar responsiveness except in the axis of time. I have not understood why the authors think that on soft food the peripheral GRNs don't compensate for the lack of pharynx-43a to drive sugar feeding. Can the authors please comment on this?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. These are very interesting points.</p><p>Firstly, does the difference between soft and hard food preference for sugar resume to only time axis? We believe this is not the case because behaviors driven by C2 or Gr43a-neurons seem to not be merely additive in output but rather <italic>Gr43a</italic> internally guided preference would overrun, as proposed and schematized in Figure 5 according to our current understanding.</p><p>If Gr43a-neuron sensing outweighs sugar detection via C2 as we believe to be the case, this could also explain why peripheral GRNs don’t compensate for the lack of Gr43a. Gr43a is also expressed in other peripheral tissues such as the gut and the brain, acting as an internal nutrient sensor in both the larva and the adult (Miyamoto and Amrein 2013, Miyamoto et al., 2012, Mishra et al., 2013). Additionally, Gr43a seems to be more specifically tuned to fructose sensing, as <italic>Gr43a</italic> mutant is less impacting on the preference to sucrose (disaccharide of fructose and glucose), which is likely better compensated for in lack of <italic>Gr43a</italic> by external neurons (Figure 4 B). It’s worth mentioning that in the adult fly Gr43a receptor in the pharynx is also more specifically tuned for fructose sensing while external GR-expressing sweet sensing neurons are more broadly detecting sugars.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Maier et al., investigates neural basis of sugar perception/coding in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae using in vivo calcium imaging and behavior. Authors developed a volumetric imaging method to capture taste responses in all of the TOG neurons in larvae. The whole organ imaging method developed here will be a very useful technique for <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval chemosensory imaging. However, the imaging method and data analysis pipeline to identify cellular identity is not clearly explained in the manuscript. It is important to provide a metric for how effective and reliable cellular identity classifications are and the variations among individual larvae. The volumetric imaging results indicate that TOG neurons can respond to one modality or multiple modalities. The neural response dynamics are also variable. Some neurons show ON responses while some show OFF-responses or inhibition upon tastant stimulation. Furthermore, the authors test the function of TOG neurons in regulating sugar preference and found that the C2- TOG neuron is important for discriminating sugar when food is more viscous and harder to ingest. Overall, I think the volumetric imaging method is promising however, the imaging method and data analysis pipeline is not clearly explained and no metric has been provided to show how effective 3D cellular identity analysis is. The behavioral experiments regarding C2 neurons are not consistent with the previously published functional imaging analysis from the same group. Further functional imaging experiments are necessary to support the claims in the paper.</p><p>1. The whole organ imaging method developed here will be a very useful technique for <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval chemosensory imaging. However, the details of image capture and processing is somewhat vaguely explained in the manuscript. Multiple details and metrics are missing about how imaging is done. What is the laser power used in these experiments? What is the frame rate for each volume scanned? What is the size of each volume, field of view etc. The movement and the drift correction for calcium imaging makes sense, however more detailed explanation about how they process imaging data is necessary. For example, in Figure Supplement 1, the authors are correcting GFP channels using the position information from the RFP channel and their method is able to handle the xy-plane. However, it is not clear how they handle z-drift. Did the post-processing also apply for the movement and drift correction in the Z-axis? What is the error rate for x-y or z correction? It would be good to know how accurate their methods are in identifying the same cell identities across animals. The authors need to expand the methods section and explain clearly how volumetric imaging and data processing was done in the paper. This is key for accurate interpretation of cell identification and the calcium imaging results.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your observation, we now added to the description in the Methods section <italic>Microscopy settings</italic>, lines 619-698.</p><p>3D drift correction explanations and corresponding reference for the drift correction plugin employed are included in Methods and we added additional specifications under Data processing and analysis of whole-organ physiological recordings (from line 744)<italic>.</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Is figure 2B and 2C showing the percent responsive cells recorded across multiple animals or the percent responsive cells within an animal? I think it is important to clarify this point.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out, we recognize the importance for this elucidation and have attempted to describe the data more clearly. Figure 2 shows data pooled across multiple recordings, responding neurons were pooled together and the multimodality percentage was thus calculated over the entire dataset. Figure 2 B and C represent all responsive cells from organs stimulated with mixtures of tastants, while Figure 2 D and D’ represent all responsive cells from organs stimulated with single tastants.</p><p>In Figure 2-figure supplement 1 we have now also illustrated data per animal, as alternative representation of Figure 2 D’. This newly added figure shows the unimodality vs multimodality percentage calculated within each of the 15-recorded organs, giving a total average of 67% unimodality vs 33% multimodality. These numbers are very closely mirroring the 68%/32% fraction from Fig2D’ for all pooled responses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What is the variance between individuals? I would like to understand how reliable cell identification and functional imaging analysis is across animals. This can be achieved if authors show data per animal rather than lumping all the data across the animals together. Another reason to visualize individual animal responses is to investigate whether the order of tastant stimulation is a critical factor for larval taste perception: For a neuron that can respond to bitter and sugar, would the sequence of stimulation matter? Will the neuron change activity if it was stimulated first with a bitter compound then a sugar compound? What about the opposite? I strongly encourage authors to show more traces for individual animals across trials with different tastant stimulations as done in Figure 2D. This will help the reader understand what is the variation in taste responses across animals and it will also increase confidence for the consistency of authors' volumetric imaging method.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, we agree with your observations and with the validity of the raised points.</p><p>We have included more traces in Figure 2 D for 2 separate representations of traces per organ. We have also added in Figure 2-Figure Suppl1 an alternative representation per each recorded organ of the multimodality computations done on pooled data in Figure 2D’ as mentioned under the previous reviewer comment. This will give a feel of how variable the captured neuronal responses were across organs, without taking into account cell identity mapping.</p><p>Regarding order of tastants: this aspect was incorporated in the experimental design through a randomized order of stimulation. We considered through this approach an eventual effect caused by the order of application would be averaged out as noise. To exemplify this, we have now added as Figure 2-Supplement 2 single neuron calcium imaging recordings in C7 (TOG neuron activated by both sugar and bitter modalities – van Giesen, 2016a). The order of presentation of two substances, sucrose and denatonium, yields no significant difference in sucrose responses recorded in this neuron.</p><p>We also replaced Figure 3 to add illustrative traces for some of the mapped neurons. To your comment we would like to add that ease in identifying cell identities equally depends on the nature of recorded tissue. For TOG cells we have observed relatively high variability of cell localization in live imaging as well as in immunostainings due to a supple architecture of the organ. On the other hand, we have found the DOG organ, which does not make the subject of this work, to be more compact with fewer variables in cell position. Similarly, the adult proboscis has a fairly rigid conformation and hair bristles that aid for referencing in cell identification. All in all, consistency of our imaging tools in the TOG can be improved through future efforts by using complementary methods for cell labeling and/or tissue registration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In figure 3A, the authors show different calcium dynamics upon tastant stimulation in different TOG neurons. They have observed, off responses and inhibition of neural activity in certain neurons upon stimulation. I would like to see what is the percentage of OFF-responses and inhibition observed in these experiments. Are these events frequent or rare? Are they seen in all animals or some of the animals used in the calcium recordings? It is important to understand whether these are biologically relevant neural responses or artifacts seen in some of the animals used in the experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>OFF-responses have been assigned when a neuron showed activation after the stimulation, and a deactivation response was considered when a neuron responded with a decrease in florescence during stimulation. It remains to be determined if the 2 types of events are related to distinct cellular mechanisms or if they are coupled, but it is often the case that a neuron responds with both deactivation and a subsequent OFF-response to a tastant.</p><p>In particular, such events have been systematically assigned to the CDL2 neuron as presented in Figure 3-figure supplemental 1 B. Citric acid, employed for stimulation in all 15 organs subjected to individual tastants, yielded a deactivation in an approximated cell location named by us CDL2 in 9 out of 15 recorded organs (plotted in Figure 3-Figure Suppl.1 B). An OFF-response to citric acid in the same neuron was actually captured in 11 out of 15 organs. The two numbers don’t coincide because the amplitude for deactivation or OFF-response didn’t always simultaneously meet the criteria of 20% threshold, but all in all we consider a deactivation/OFF-response to citric acid in CDL2 neuron to be more than merely an artifact.</p><p>Other tastants than citric acid have elicited OFF-responses but less robustly, especially in CDL2 but also in other neuronal locations. Generally, we believe such events are neuron and tastant/concentration specific and that a larger range of tested tastants and concentrations would reveal further such neuron-deactivation pairings. However, CDL2 associated most deactivation signals in our dataset (included in source data supplementary files), indicating this neuron could comport distinctive tuning properties.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In Figure 3, authors replot the results from Figure2 this time by identifying cellular identity using anatomical position. This is something similar to what I was trying to get to in my previous comment (see comment 2). But even in plots shown in Figure 3C, it is hard to understand how successful authors' methods are in classifying each neuron type in each animal. For example, how many larvae in total have been tested in Figure 3C and in what percentage of the animals they were able to identify each neuron type and what is the variation in neural responses among each animal. I think this is a very critical point that needs to be clarified in the paper variation of taste responses among animals and a metric to show how successful cellular identification is across all the animals tested. If my understanding is correct, the total number of tested organs/animals is 15, however the data plotted in Figure 3C does not correspond to this number. Please explain what is the success rate to define a cell type across animals.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe the whole-organ approach described here can serve for future characterizations with more precise neuronal annotation results by using complementary tissue registration or double neuronal labeling techniques. Within the purpose for this study we have manually mapped cells for which a tastant was found to yield a response in at least 3 different instances. Therefore, for some data plotted in the Figure 3-Figure Suppl1 (previously Figure 3) the N was 3, while a given tastant was presented in at least 7 recordings, except for sucrose and citric acid that were used for stimulation in all 15 organs. We have now restricted the threshold to N&gt;=4, being at least half of stimulated organs with a given tastant, except for bitter stimulations for which N&gt;=3 as these responses were more fade and more difficult to map. This threshold does not necessarily mean a given neuron only responded in 3-4 organs out of 7-8 stimulated with a given tastant but it can also mean one of the following:</p><p>1. The response was not picked up above 20% DF/F0 amplitude or</p><p>2. the fluorescent trace was filtered out due to unstable baseline or high variance of signal before stimulation or</p><p>3. The response could not be unambiguously assigned to the given cell location or</p><p>4. the experimenter was not confident about the cell identity even if a response to the given tastant was picked up.</p><p>Therefore we would like to propose Figure 3-Figure Suppl.1 should be interpreted as illustration of cell tuning types that can be picked up in the TOG, rather than a complete cell mapping of the organ.</p><p>Nevertheless, the reproducible mono/multimodality percentages (illustrated per organ in Figure 2-Figure Suppl.1) and the captured deactivation/OFF-responses add to our understanding of the taste sensing range in the larval external organ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The authors mention that the only known sugar receptor gene Gr43a is not expressed in TOG but TOG neurons can respond to sugars. This is a puzzling finding. Is the expression analysis of Gr43a receptor based on transgenic reporters or single cell sequencing? In other words, is there other evidence that TOG does not express any known sugar receptors in larvae?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, indeed, thus far a sugar receptor expression in the larval TOG has not been reported in previous efforts for transgenic lines mapping. Except for a newly identified appetitive taste sensing to ribonucleosides via Gr28a (Mishra et al., 2018) and to certain amino acids via IRs (Croset et al., 2016), not much has been described for attractive behaviors attributed to neurons/receptors in the larval TOG.</p><p>Known sugar receptors (Gr5a, Gr64e-f) rely on description in the adult fly, but these have not been detected in the larval TOG. Conversely, certain Gr receptors are larval specific and incompletely characterized and therefore might cover sugar sensing at this developmental stage.</p><p>According to studies using transgenic reporters, larval Gr43a – similar to adult Gr43a – is expressed in internal tissues (pharyngeal taste neurons, gut, brain) but not in external sensing neurons.</p><p>We are presenting an enticing opportunity to investigate novel sugar receptors based on these results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. In figure 4, authors performed behavioral experiments to test the function TOG sugar sensing in larvae. Inhibiting one of the TOG neurons, C2 causes defects in sucrose preference when agarose ss 2.5 % but not 1%. They claim the external sugar sensing via TOG sensory neurons is critical when food is not soft enough to ingest. These are interesting hypothesis however, in their previous study, authors have shown C2 neurons respond weakly to 500mM sucrose but not to any other sugar. However, in this manuscript the stronger behavior phenotype is seen in 250mM fructose preference upon silencing of C2 neurons. It is not clearly to me what is the mechanism here. Please explain.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, we found C2 to respond physiologically to fructose 100mM with higher amplitudes than to fructose 500mM (data not shown), therefore this neuron’s role in fructose detection might depend to a large extent on concentration. Given that sucrose is a disaccharide constituted by fructose and glucose, we would expect C2 to also respond at least partially to fructose. On the other hand, it seems the Gr43a role in sugar detection is more specific for fructose than for sucrose, as also reported by others (Miyamoto and Amrein 2013, Miyamoto et al., 2012) and as we show in Figure 4-Figure Suppl.1 B.</p><p>Since the phenotype yielded by C2 in sucrose preference is more pronounced, we chose to focus on this sugar and to not include fructose preference indexes or physiological activation responses in C2, for simplicity and overall readability of the data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. In general, I think it will help to use one nomenclature for the paper or provide a table matching C-X identity to cellular identities in Figure 3C and list which compound(s) each neuron responds to and indicate the type of response; ON, OFF or inhibition.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion, a table is included in the supplementary information (corresponding source data excel table).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. The manipulations for larval GRNs in the manuscript are done chronically by expressing TNT-E. This might impact the development and wiring of the larval chemosensory system and cause problems in sugar detection unrelated to GRN function. I think using a conditional inhibitor of neural activity such as shits or newly developed ontogenetic inhibitors, GtACRs, might be better to use here to show conditional inactivity of the neurons result in similar defects in sugar sensing.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent suggestion and we now incorporated in Figure 4 D new data for C2 neuron behavior for temporally controlled silencing with GtACR1. This experiment reproduces a defect to sucrose 500mM on 2.5% substrate, as observed with TNTE silencing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae have been put forth as a good model to study taste because of the simplicity of the system (in terms of the number of organs and neurons) and efficient behavior assays. However, an understanding of taste coding in the larval system lags behind that described for the adult stage, in which most taste sensilla/neurons are accessible for recordings or imaging. Maier et al., seek to address this gap by developing a whole organ calcium imaging approach to assess responses of neurons in the larval terminal organ to sweet, bitter, salt, amino acid, and acid tastants. From imaging 15 organs, the authors describe responses to a set of sweet, bitter, salt, amino acid, and acid tastants, collectively represented in neurons that appear to be tuned to one, two or multiple categories of tastants.</p><p>Although the new approach has promise, the current study makes a limited conceptual advance and the number of positive responses used to ascribe responses to neurons is small. Overlap of tastant sensitivities has now been described, and more rigorously so, in the adult stage and in the authors' own previous work focusing on genetically labeled subsets of taste neurons. The identification of responsiveness to sucrose, which may be somewhat unexpected given the absence of sweet Gustatory receptors (Grs) in larvae, has also been previously described for a few neurons, one of which is further studied in behavior assays.</p><p>The imaging analysis is followed by investigation of the potential roles of sugar sensing neurons in the periphery. While this analysis provides further support for a previously identified peripheral neuron (C2), it does not convincingly parse contributions of internal and external neurons.</p><p>Specific weaknesses are elaborated via points below and could be addressed either with additional experiments or textual modifications.</p><p>Calcium imaging:</p><p>– Neuron categories were determined by imaging responses to only a single concentration of each tastant; more careful dose response analysis may alter the conclusions. This possibility has not been considered.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, this is a valid observation, and we have in fact noticed an important difference in responses to different concentrations of the same tastants, in fact as also exemplified by distinct responding cells and divergent behaviors elicited by low and high salt concentrations. This possibility is also discussed in the <italic>Discussion section</italic>.</p><p>Given the high level of complexity we faced in our analysis, particularly as the cell identity mapping was approached manually in this study, dose response would exponentially add to the complexity rendering manual response annotations impossible, and therefore we have focused on unique concentrations. We judge our tools valuable for future efforts in elucidating this complexity in tuning using various tastant concentrations with complementary methodology for tissue registration or double labeling of neurons that would make room for computerized cell response annotations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– There is no effort to reconcile the imaging results with predictions from previous studies. For example, the number of bitter-responsive neurons is 1-2 per larva. However, bitter-GAL4 lines have been mapped to many more neurons in the TO.</p></disp-quote><p>In effect, our approach comports limitations in cell identification, as mentioned above. However, physiological characterization of bitter neurons in the TOG is relatively limited. Namely, neurons described to comport aversive behavior in the TOG are more or less 3: C1 to a diversity of bitter tastants (Kim et al., 2016, Choi et al., 2020), C3 to quinine (Apostolopoulou et al., 2014) and C7 to denatonium and quinine (van Giesen 2016a) and these are also summarized in Figure 5A. Any other contributions to bitter taste in the larva is inferred based on transgenic expression of GRs characterized as bitter sensing in the adult but not physiologically associated to bitter sensing in the corresponding larval neurons. All considering, bitter responding neurons per organ identified in our study is conform in number to previous physiological characterizations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The correspondence between neurons named from previous GAL4 mapping experiments to those named by position in this study is not at all clear.

This threshold seems low, considering that 7-8 organs were tested with each stimulus. In the table for Figure 3, for instance, several tastants have n=3. Is this from a higher number of tastant applications? If so, what was observed in the other cases – that a response could not be ascribed to the identified neuron or that there was no response at all?</p></disp-quote><p>In other cases (instances where a response could not be ascribed to a given cell) the response was either not picked up / not above the set threshold of 20% amplitude, or the responding cell could not be confidently associated to a given identity.</p><p>Therefore we would like to propose Figure 3-Suppl.1 should be interpreted as illustration of cell tuning types that can be picked up in the TOG, rather than a complete cell map of the organ.

In our hands the <italic>Gr43a</italic> mutant shows a mild defect in sucrose preference (Figure 4 – Figure Suppl.1 B), which is confirmed from observations in the adult system where Gr43a has been described as an internal nutrient sensor (Miyamoto and Amrein 2013, Miyamoto et al., 2012) more specifically tuned to fructose than to other sugars, including sucrose (disaccharide of fructose and glucose).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In Figure 4B right, assuming that Gr43a mutant controls are not significantly different from zero, whereas Gr43a &quot;brain only&quot; are, I don't know how to interpret a potential role for Gr43a brain neurons in preference for 2.5% agarose food, at 2 minutes when the larvae are not consuming anything.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included more data points and proposed a supporting model in Figure 5. Indeed, we suggest that even for immediate preference at 2 min on 2.5% in absence of food ingestion a Gr43a mutant can still weigh on the output behavior. This could be due to Gr43a expression in several internal tissues (pharynx, proventriculus, brain) and to its role as hemolymph fructose sensor. It has been shown that hemolymph carbohydrates influence larval feeding behavior though insulin signaling and SLC5A11 (Ugrankar et al., 2018), but it remains to be determined if and how does a Gr43a mutant correlate with metabolic pathways and possibly interfere with sugar preference output behavior.</p><p>Furthermore, the data added for Gr43a mutant behavior in Figure 4-Figure Suppl.1 shows a lesser defect at higher concentrations and lesser in sucrose preference than fructose, implying a possible systemic effect of Gr43a more specifically to fructose, as mentioned under reviewer’s previous comment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The calcium imaging analysis is at the cellular level, not looking into contributions of receptors.

In the reference study for this test, the brain ablated Gr43a larvae don’t show a defect compared to control but on our hands a deficient preference was calculated for immediate preference on 1% and no defect on 2.5% percent. This difference with the reference paper might be due to laboratory dissimilarities in experimental manipulation, in fly food differences linked to subliminal metabolic state variations between animals or perhaps due to distinct potency of the <italic>UAS-TNT</italic>E line employed. A lack of defect of brain <italic>Gr43a</italic> silencing suggests that internal expression from pharynx and gut tissues is sufficient for internal sugar sensing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Test if peripheral sugar responses are affected in Gr43a mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, we followed your suggestion and found that <italic>Gr43a</italic> mutants associate some defect in sucrose preference but lesser than to fructose on both 1% and 2.5% (Figure 4-Figure Suppl.1 B and B’). This confirms adult fly reports describing Gr43a to have the highest specificity for fructose among sugars (Miyamoto and Amrein 2013, Miyamoto et al., 2012), including compared to sucrose (disaccharide of fructose and glucose).</p></body></sub-article></article>
