Here, we demonstrate that acute systemic inflammation induces the emergent activation of a previously unrecognized system of rapid migration of granulocyte-macrophage progenitors and committed macrophage-dendritic progenitors, but not other progenitors or stem cells, from bone marrow (BM) to regional lymphatic capillaries. The progenitor traffic to the systemic lymphatic circulation is mediated by Ccl19/Ccr7 and is NF-κB independent, Traf6/IκB-kinase/SNAP23 activation dependent, and is responsible for the secretion of pre-stored Ccl19 by a subpopulation of CD205<sup>+</sup>/CD172a<sup>+</sup> conventional dendritic cells type 2 and upregulation of BM myeloid progenitor Ccr7 signaling. Mature myeloid Traf6 signaling is anti-inflammatory and necessary for lymph node myeloid cell development. This report unveils the existence and the mechanistic basis of a very early direct traffic of myeloid progenitors from BM to lymphatics during inflammation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>When the body becomes infected with disease-causing pathogens, such as bacteria, the immune system activates various mechanisms which help to fight off the infection. One of the immune system’s first lines of defense is to launch an inflammatory response that helps remove the pathogen and recruit other immune cells. However, this response can become overactivated, leading to severe inflammatory conditions that damage healthy cells and tissues.</p><p>A second group of cells counteract this over inflammation and are different to the ones involved in the early inflammatory response. Both types of cells – inflammatory and anti-inflammatory – develop from committed progenitors, which, unlike stem cells, are already destined to become a certain type of cell. These committed progenitors reside in the bone marrow and then rapidly travel to secondary lymphoid organs, such as the lymph nodes, where they mature into functioning immune cells. During this journey, committed progenitors pass from the bone marrow to the lymphatic vessels that connect up the different secondary lymphoid organs, and then spread to all tissues in the body. Yet, it is not fully understood what exact route these cells take and what guides them towards these lymphatic tissues during inflammation.</p><p>To investigate this, Serrano-Lopez, Hegde et al. used a combination of techniques to examine the migration of progenitor cells in mice that had been treated with lethal doses of a bacterial product that triggers inflammation. This revealed that as early as one to three hours after the onset of infection, progenitor cells were already starting to travel from the bone marrow towards lymphatic vessels. Serrano-Lopez, Hegde et al. found that a chemical released by an “alarm” immune cell already residing in secondary lymphoid organs attracted these progenitor cells towards the lymphatic tissue.</p><p>Further experiments showed that the progenitor cells travelling to secondary lymphoid organs were already activated by bacterial products. They then follow the chemical released by alarm immune cells ready to respond to the immune challenge and suppress inflammation. These committed progenitors were also found in the inflamed lymph nodes of patients.</p><p>These findings suggest this rapid circulation of progenitors is a mechanism of defense that contributes to the fight against severe inflammation. Altering how these cells migrate from the bone marrow to secondary lymphoid organs could provide a more effective treatment for inflammatory conditions and severe infections. However, these approaches would need to be tested further in the laboratory and in clinical trials.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>endotoxemia</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>myeloid progenitors</kwd><kwd>circulation</kwd><kwd>lymphatics</kwd><kwd>bone marrow</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM110628</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cancelas</surname><given-names>Jose A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK124115</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cancelas</surname><given-names>Jose A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100011011</institution-id><institution>Junta de Andalucía</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Serrano-Lopez</surname><given-names>Juana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Endotoxemia recruits fast-acting anti-inflammatory innate myeloid progenitors from bone marrow into regional lymphatics through release of pre-formed Ccl19 secondary to NF-κB-independent, Traf6/IκB kinase-dependent signaling.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bacterial infections represent one of the major threats for the human immune system and can lead to sepsis and death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Martin et al., 2003</xref>). A functional immune response is a key factor to control the outcome of bacterial infections. Therefore, the human immune system has evolved several effector mechanisms to fight bacterial infections that involve the innate and the adaptive arms of the immune system. Antigen presentation is an essential mechanism of activation that requires crosstalk between the innate and adaptive immune system to fight bacterial infections. Dendritic cells are short-lived professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs), and their life span is further reduced during the inflammatory response to pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kamath et al., 2002</xref>). Upon inflammation, primed APC thus need to be replaced.</p><p>During inflammation, systemic signals alert and activate bone marrow (BM) hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors (HSC/P) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chavakis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mitroulis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nagai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ueda et al., 2005</xref>). Inflamed secondary lymphoid organs such as lymph nodes (LN) recruit antigen-presenting dendritic cells (DCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Legler et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Luther et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Saeki et al., 1999</xref>), while pathogen-associated molecular pattern signals (PAMPs) trigger migration of tissue-resident DC to the LN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kaisho and Akira, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sallusto and Lanzavecchia, 2000</xref>). Circulation of HSC/P that enter the lymphatic vessels from the peripheral blood (PB) with ability to amplify APCs has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Massberg et al., 2007</xref>). However, the circuits used by these HSC/P populations, their characterization, and the cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate this traffic in inflammatory conditions have not been addressed in detail.</p><p>Lymphatics form part of an open circulatory system that drains cells and interstitial fluid from tissues. Recently, bone lymphatic endothelial cells have been shown to arise rapidly from pre-existing regional lymphatics in inducible bone-expressing <italic>Vegfc</italic> transgenic mice through Vegfr3, osteoclast activation, and bone loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hominick et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Monroy et al., 2020</xref>). Acute endotoxemia is associated with osteoclast activation and bone loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hardy and Cooper, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nason et al., 2009</xref>). We postulated the pre-existence of an anatomical and functional patent circuit that communicates BM and lymphatic tissues that can be induced upon severe inflammatory conditions like endotoxemia.</p><p>Our work identifies an emergent traffic of DC-biased myeloid progenitors through direct transit from BM to bone lymphatic capillaries. This traffic is highly activated in endotoxic inflammation. In human reactive lymphadenitis or just after a single immune endotoxic challenge, such as following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation in mice, a massive mobilization of myeloid progenitors from the BM to lymph and retention in the LN takes place. The mobilization is rapid prior to their appearance in PB. LPS simultaneously induces cell-autonomous Ccr7 expression on granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs) and macrophage-dendritic progenitors (MDPs), and a non-cell-autonomous myeloid cell-dependent secretion of Ccl19 in the LN. In vivo blockade of LPS signaling in mature myeloid cells, deletion of hematopoietic Ccl19, or neutralization of Ccr7 completely abrogated the GMP/MDP migration from the BM to the LN. Moreover, genetic and pharmacological approaches revealed that Traf6-Irak1/4-Ubc13-IκB kinase (IKK) signaling mediates NF-κB-independent-SNAP23 phosphorylation and secretion of pre-formed Ccl19 from a specific population of conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), and mature myeloid cell Traf6-dependent signaling is of anti-inflammatory nature. These findings indicate that inflammation results in mobilization of cDC-forming cells directly from the BM to the lymph and LN. As such, emergent myeloid lineage mobilization from the BM to lymph may be important in inflammation by acutely differentiating into antigen-presenting precursors in lymph tissues and associate with an anti-inflammatory response in endotoxemia.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Inflammation associates with emergent migration of myeloid progenitors, but not HSC, from BM to lymphatics</title><p>To determine whether there is a circulation of HSC/P to human LN, we prospectively analyzed the presence of side population (SP) cells in LN biopsies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) obtained from lymphadenitis and lymphoma patients at diagnosis. Human and murine SP cells, with ability to extrude the dye Hoechst 33342 through upregulated activity of multidrug resistance protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhou et al., 2001</xref>) in BM and other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brusnahan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Challen and Little, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goodell et al., 1996</xref>), are enriched in long-term reconstituting HSC and other more committed populations of progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Matsuzaki et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Weksberg et al., 2008</xref>). We found an SP population at a frequency higher than 0.01% in 36 out of 64 LN biopsies (53.12%). However, the content of SP cells in the LN did correlate with the LN histological diagnosis. The elevated frequency of SP cells in LN did correlate with the LN histological diagnosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) but not to the anatomical location of the lymphadenopathy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The accumulation of SP cells was significantly higher in LN from lymphadenitis patients than in lymphoma patients. Further dissection based on histological classifications by independent pathology analysis resulted in the lymphadenitis specimens being sorted into distinct histological categories that corresponded to follicular lymphadenitis with paracortical predominance (FL), granulomatous lymphadenitis (GL), and lymphadenopathies with histological or molecular evidence of viral etiology (viral lymphadenitis [VL]). Interestingly, FL and GL LN contained a median of 0.2% SP cells with a range from &lt;0.01% to ~40%, which was significantly higher than the content of SP cells in VL, Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma LN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The existence of myeloid-committed hematopoietic progenitors was confirmed in myeloid colony-forming cell unit (CFU) assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) performed on samples from patients with FL. These data show that non-viral inflammatory lymphadenitis results in a significantly increased frequency of primitive hematopoietic cells in LN, while it does not reveal the type of progenitor cells. To confirm whether LN SP cells indeed contained HSC/P, we first sorted LN SP cells from patients with reactive lymphadenitis and plated them in methylcellulose cultures containing rhIL-3, rhIL-6, and rhSCF cytokines. CFU analysis demonstrated that SP cells were indeed capable of producing myeloid colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), while non-SP cells were devoid of measurable CFU-forming ability (data not shown). Immunophenotypic analysis of SP-derived progenitors was also consistent with enrichment of a heterocellular population of CD34 and CD133 expressing granulocyte-, granulocyte-macrophage-, and cDC-biased progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bornhäuser et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Görgens et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The vast majority of CD45<sup>+</sup>/CD34<sup>+</sup> cells co-expressed CD133<sup>+</sup>, and the CD45<sup>+</sup>/CD34<sup>-</sup> population was split ~50:50 into CD133<sup>+</sup> and CD133<sup>-</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In combination, these data show the accumulation of a myeloid-committed HSC/P population in human lymphadenitis. Adult inflammatory LN tissues therefore contain an increased number of myeloid-committed HSC/P. This increase can result from either the recruitment of these cells to LN via the bloodstream or the expansion of otherwise rare and already resident myeloid-committed HSC/P in these LN.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Inflammation induces early mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors to lymph organs in humans and mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Content of side population (SP)cells in human lymph node (LN) by flow cytometry.

We postulated that if inflammation is responsible for the recruitment of HSC/P to the LN and possibly other organs, we should be able to recapitulate the process of BM egression, migration, and organ retention in an inflammatory murine model wherein the HSC/P migration process is highly conserved. Since the largest content of HSC/P in human LN was found in biopsies from patients with lymphadenitis, we generated a mouse model of Gram-negative sepsis by injection of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> LPS into C57Bl/6 mice at the early time point of the circadian HSC/P mobilization cycle (<italic>zeitgeber</italic> time [ZT]) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bellet et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and analyzed the rapid migration of HSC/P to different organs. This model has the advantage of requiring one single dose of LPS and provides a relevant approach to the analysis of rapid migration mechanisms deprived of confounding effects of proliferation and/or survival induced by LPS at later time points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nagai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>E. coli</italic> LPS is able to activate a large number of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which result in high-level activation of the inflammatory signaling cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beutler and Rietschel, 2003</xref>). LPS is also a well-known inducer of HSC/P mobilization to PB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cline and Golde, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Velders et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vos et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vos and Wilschut, 1979</xref>). In our experiments, the circadian mobilization pattern of HSC/P in the PB was severely modified by the administration of LPS, with the increase in HSC/P appearing later and peaking at ZT10, 6 hr post-administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), coincident with an increased neutrophil count in the PB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We observed similar kinetics of an increased number of HSC/P in the highly vascularized kidney and liver tissues after LPS administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, F</xref>), suggesting that the presence of HSC/P in these tissues closely paralleled their presence in the PB. Interestingly, LPS did not elicit a significant change in the level of splenic HSC/P within the first 12 hr after inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Esplin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wright et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).</p><p>Notably, when the HSC/P content was reduced in the BM, the kinetics of their subsequent mobilization to the PB was discordant. The BM HSC/P content decreased, which supports the migratory nature of the increased HSC/P in the PB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>); yet the nadir of the BM HSC/P content occurred as early as 3 hr after LPS administration (at ZT7), returning to normal values by 6 hr (ZT10, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). The time lapse between the loss of retention of HSC/P in the BM and their presence in the PB circulation suggested that the migration of HSC/P from the BM to the PB required an intermediate step of circulation through other tissues. Based on an earlier description of a lymphatic circulation of HSC/P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Massberg et al., 2007</xref>), we hypothesized that this delay in the appearance of HSC/P in the PB was due to an intermediate transit of HSC/P through the lymphatic circulation. Indeed, the lymphatic circulation in LPS-treated animals did show a significant increase in the levels of circulating HSC/P in the LN and the thoracic duct compared to controls that closely mirrored the decline of HSC/P in the BM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I, J</xref>).</p><p>We next characterized the type of primitive cell populations migrating into the LN via the lymphatic circulation. We first analyzed whether the content of immunophenotypically identifiable BM HSC populations changed concomitantly with the progenitor population changes previously described. LPS induced expansion of BM Lin<sup>-</sup>/c-kit<sup>+</sup>/Sca-1<sup>+</sup> (LSK) and immunophenotypically identified long-term (LT)-HSC, short-term (ST)-HSC, and multipotential progenitors (MPPs) populations at later time points (Z10–ZT16) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E-K</xref>) with no changes in the BM HSC content by ZT7, suggesting a differential effect of LPS signaling on the HSC population. Interestingly, the reduction in the BM content of progenitors was not homogenous throughout the hematopoietic progenitor populations. Confirming the egress of BM CFU-GM described above, the GMP population was significantly decreased by ZT7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F, K</xref>), while the content of immunophenotypically defined common myeloid progenitors (CMPs) only declined by ZT10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F, L</xref>), and the megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitor (MEP) content was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F, M</xref>), resulting in no significant net changes in the content of BM Lin<sup>-</sup>/c-kit<sup>+</sup>/Sca1<sup>-</sup> (LK) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F, N</xref>).</p><p>Functional in vivo assays of LN cell suspensions obtained at ZT7 demonstrated that the accumulation of progenitors in LN did not contain any significant numbers of long-term or medium-term repopulating HSC. The analysis of competitive repopulating units (CRUs) in the LN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>) demonstrated that inflamed LN did not contain increased levels of repopulating cells by ZT7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). LN contained a transient, ST-myelopoietic progenitor population without medium- or long-term multilineage repopulation ability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Lineage analysis of donor-derived circulating cells demonstrated no significant change in T-cell transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>) and a diminished transfer of B-cells into the lethally irradiated recipients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>), indicating the presence of adoptively transferred lymphoid cells and the absence of mobilization of competent lymphoid progenitors to the inflamed LN. Furthermore, LN SP cells from LPS-treated mice are enriched in LK cells and depleted in LSK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F</xref>). LN SP cells contain exclusively ST-repopulating progenitors with the ability to differentiate into myeloid cells (data not shown) and are depleted from any significant 8–16 weeks engrafting HSC, as assessed using CRU assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F, G</xref>), unlike their BM SP counterparts that are enriched in LSK cells and LT-repopulating activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F, H</xref>). These results confirmed that, similar to human inflammatory LN, the LN myeloid progenitors from mice treated with <italic>E. coli</italic> LPS accumulate in inflamed LN and are depleted of stem cell activity. Altogether, these data indicate that LPS induces a selective lymphatic circulation of myeloid committed progenitors, but not other types of HSC/P populations.</p><p>To explore the nature of the circuit of the myeloid progenitor migration to LN, we first analyzed the ability of HSC/P to seed LN in non-myeloablated mice. For this experiment, we labeled C57Bl/6-BM-derived lineage negative (Lin<sup>-</sup>) cells containing the HSC/P fraction with the lipophilic dye 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) and adoptively transferred them into unmanipulated lymphatic vessel reporter <italic>Lyve1<sup>eGFP</sup></italic> mice. <italic>Lyve1<sup>eGFP</sup></italic> knock-in mice display enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) fluorescence driven by the promoter/enhancer of the lymphatic vessel hyaluronan receptor 1 Lyve-1 identifying lymphatic endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pham et al., 2010</xref>). We analyzed the 17 hr homing of Lin<sup>-</sup> cells to the BM and LN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The homing of cells to the BM in mice treated with LPS was reduced by ~65% compared with their vehicle-treated counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). To determine whether Lin<sup>-</sup>/DiI<sup>+</sup> homed cells leave BM in response to LPS, we first determined the existence of transcortical vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Grüneboom et al., 2019</xref>) and the presence of lymphatic vasculature inside the bone by two-photon microscopy in mice either treated with PBS or LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D, E</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref>). <italic>Lyve1<sup>eGFP</sup></italic> knock-in mice revealed that the bone of LPS-treated animals contains a Lyve1+network, which was only rarely identified in PBS-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), suggesting that LPS-induced inflammation may upregulate the expression of the hyaluronan receptor Lyve1 and render patent a pre-existing network of Lyve1+bone cells. Interestingly, Lin<sup>-</sup>/DiI<sup>+</sup> homed cells were located closer to the endosteum in response to LPS at as early as 1.5 hr after administration of LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Quantification of the distance of Lin<sup>-</sup>/DiI<sup>+</sup> homed cells to endosteum area showed significant differences between PBS and LPS treatment, indicating increased proximity to the endosteum area after LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). We found, albeit at a very low frequency, tiny lymphatics scattered and projected inside the bone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). On the other hand, the seeding of BM-derived Lin<sup>-</sup>/DiI<sup>+</sup> cells into LN increased approximately threefold, which mirrored the decline in BM homing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H–J</xref>). Histological analysis of BM-derived Lin<sup>-</sup>/DiI<sup>+</sup> cells within the LN by confocal microscopy showed that the migrated HSP/C are spatially positioned in the cortex area surrounding primary follicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>), consistent with localization in T-cell zone for antigen presentation. These findings strongly suggest that the rapid egress of hematopoietic progenitors from BM during inflammation may indeed occur through bone lymphatics draining into LN.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Draining of bone marrow (BM)-derived lineage negative cells into lymphatics.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schema for adoptive transfer of BM-derived lineage negative cells (Lin<sup>-</sup>) labeled with 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) dye into lymphatic endothelium reporter <italic>Lyve1<sup>eGFP</sup></italic> mice.

To further test whether the hematopoietic Traf6-dependent response to LPS resulting in mobilization of GMP from the BM to the LN by ZT7 is indeed cell autonomous and not determined by the microenvironment, we used the conditional Traf6-deficiency model and analyzed the in vitro migration of myeloid progenitors toward chemoattractant gradients generated by LPS-stimulated BM or LN cells in assays designed to identify the hematopoietic cell population affected by LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, E, G</xref>). We found that the cell-autonomous deficiency of Traf6 resulted in a relative decrease in migration of ~40% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) of BM myeloid progenitors in the presence of LPS, indicating that <italic>Traf6</italic> is required for LPS-dependent cell-autonomous BM myeloid progenitor migration. Interestingly, analysis of non-cell-autonomous migration of BM myeloid progenitors demonstrated that LN-derived cells generated more potent chemoattractant signals, resulting in a much larger migration of WT BM myeloid progenitors (fivefold higher, ~30%) during the same period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E, F</xref>), which was drastically diminished (~50% reduction) by Traf6-deficiency in LN cells, but not when using control BM cells as chemoattractant source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E, F</xref>). These data indicate that although LPS-mobilized myeloid progenitors depend on both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous Traf6-dependent signals, the chemoattractant gradient generated by LPS on LN cells is the predominant effect responsible for Traf6-dependent myeloid progenitor migration. Interestingly, the non-cell-autonomous effect does not seem to be due to secretion of the chemokine inducer IFN-γ, which was not detectable in LN-derived supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), strongly suggesting that activated LN NK cells may not be responsible for the migration of BM myeloid progenitors. And, similarly, the effect of Traf6 expression on non-cell-autonomous, LN-mediated migration did not depend on the secretion of IL-1α, IL-2, IL-13, IL-4, TNF-α, or IL-10 regulatory cytokines of inflammatory processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C–H</xref>).</p><p>To delineate the resident LN cell population responsible for the migration of GMPs into the LN, we isolated putative effector cell populations representing 1% or more of the cellularity of either BM or LN tissues. We isolated T-cells (CD3e<sup>+</sup>), B-cells (B220<sup>+</sup>), and myeloid cells (CD11b<sup>+</sup>) from LN of WT or Traf6<sup>Δ/Δ</sup> mice and layered input cell equivalents on the bottom of the chamber with LPS, as in the previous experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).

To confirm that a Traf6-dependent signaling in LN CD11b + cells is responsible for myeloid progenitor mobilization and eliminate the possible inflammatory effect of previous treatment with polyI:C in Mx1-Cre transgenic mice, we crossed <italic>Traf6<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> mice with <italic>Lyz2<sup>Cre</sup></italic> transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clausen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cross et al., 1988</xref>) and analyzed the migration to LN after LPS administration in mature myeloid lineage-specific Traf6-deficient <italic>(Lyz2<sup>Cre</sup>;Traf6<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic>) mice. Mature myeloid lineage-specific deletion of <italic>Traf6</italic> abrogated the migration of myeloid progenitors to LN in response to LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). A major consequence of the deficiency of Traf6 in mature myeloid lineage-specific cells was an increase in the endotoxemia-dependent mortality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>), indicating that Traf6 expression in mature myeloid cells is required for both migration of myeloid progenitors to LN and protection of LPS-induced mortality. Altogether, these data indicate that LPS/Traf6 signaling is required for migration of myeloid progenitors through predominantly long-range acting, mature myeloid lineage-dependent chemoattractant signals, and that LPS/Traf6 signaling in Lyz2-expressing cells is protective against endotoxin-induced inflammation.</p><p>Activation of TLRs conserves inflammatory pathways that culminate in the activation of the NF-κB transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Karin and Greten, 2005</xref>). The LPS binds TLR4/MD2 complexes on the cell surface, and through a series of adaptors and kinases recruits Traf6. By an E3 ligase-dependent mechanism, Traf6 activates the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, which initiates IκBα degradation, and our group has demonstrated that its constitutive deficiency results in reduced HSC quiescence and increased progenitor proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fang et al., 2018</xref>). Subsequent nuclear translocation of NF-κB transcription factors results in the expression of cytokine and chemokine genes. To determine whether emergent NF-κB signaling is responsible downstream of LPS/<italic>Traf6</italic> for the LPS-induced LN migratory effect of myeloid progenitors, we overexpressed a degradation-resistant mutant of IκBα (IκBα super-repressor [IκBα<sub>SR</sub>]), in primary murine progenitors, which were then differentiated into macrophages/cDC by macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">O'Keeffe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1I</xref>). Analysis of LPS-driven migration in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1J</xref>) demonstrated that the expression of IκBα<sub>SR</sub> does not reduce the effect of LPS on the migration of myeloid progenitors toward LPS-stimulated macrophages/cDC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1K, L</xref>), indicating that NF-κB transcription factors are dispensable for myeloid progenitor migration. In contrast, inhibition of intracellular protein traffic using monensin dramatically decreased myeloid precursor migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1K, L</xref>), suggesting that intracellular protein trafficking is necessary for the migration phenotype. Collectively, these data indicate that LPS-induced myeloid progenitor migration occurs through an NF-κB-independent, intracellular protein traffic-dependent pathway, and suggests that the progenitor-mobilizing effect of LPS may not require transcriptional activation, depending rather on the intracellular traffic of secreted proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Myeloid progenitors home into LN in a Ccl19/Ccr7-dependent fashion but independently of L-selectin</title><p>The secretome of myeloid cells includes multiple cytokines/chemokines with short- and long-range activities on activation, proliferation, survival, differentiation, and migration of target cells. Specifically, secreted chemokines stimulate migration of target cells following chemokines to the areas of highest concentration.

An array of tests on secreted chemokines and cytokines demonstrated distinct secretome signatures between BM and LN tissues after LPS administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B–N</xref>). As expected, LPS induced upregulation after administration of several myeloid cell cytokines and chemokines with ability to recruit and differentiate macrophages and cDC in the extracellular fluid of LN rather than BM as early as 1 hr after LPS challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C–J</xref>). However, none of these candidate cytokines/chemokines were found to consistently generate a differential tissue concentration in vivo between LN and BM at both ZT5 and ZT7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Similar to Cxcl12, some cytokines/chemokines with potential chemoattractant ability were also found to be upregulated in BM rather than in LN or in both tissues similarly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2K–N</xref>). The lack of in vivo tissue differential levels strongly suggested that these BM-derived cytokines or chemokines, although likely to play a role in the LPS-mediated inflammatory response, were unlikely to be responsible for the attraction of BM myeloid progenitors to the LN.</p><p>The C-C chemokine receptor type 7 (Ccr7) ligand macrophage-inflammatory protein (MIP)-3b/Ccl19 has been reported as a chemoattractant for BM and cord blood CD34<sup>+</sup> cells in vitro, mainly CFU-GM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kim et al., 1998</xref>), and to direct DCs to LNs and elicit an adaptative immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Förster et al., 1999</xref>). Analysis of Ccl19 in the extracellular fluid of the femoral cavity, LN, and plasma demonstrated that in vivo administration of LPS promotes a secretion of Ccl19 in LN when compared with BM and PB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This differential secretion is specific to Ccl19 since Ccl21, a highly related chemokine, did not show the formation of similar differential tissue concentrations in LN after LPS administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Ccl19 is secreted by LN myeloid cells after LPS stimulation and depends on Traf6 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Ccr7-mediated signals control the migration of immune cells to secondary lymphoid organs such as LN, facilitating efficient surveillance and targeted cellular response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Förster et al., 2008</xref>). Also, LPS upregulates membrane Ccr7 expression on cDC and their committed progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schmid et al., 2011</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that LN trafficking of phenotypic GMP/MDP is regulated by Ccr7, and that therefore the Ccl19/Ccr7 axis might explain the coexistence of cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous mechanisms required for GMP migration from the BM to LN in response to LPS. To test our hypothesis, we first analyzed whether the specific deficiency of either Ccl19 or Ccr7 modified the level of progenitor migration to LN. To prevent the interference of long-term deficiencies of Ccl19 and Ccr7 expression described in deficient murine models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Förster et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mori et al., 2001</xref>), we performed short-term in vivo neutralization of Ccl19 ligand or the Ccr7 receptor by using specific antibodies or isotype controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) and determined the content of CFU-GM in LN after LPS challenge or PBS control. We administered an anti-Ccl19 and an anti-Ccr7 neutralizing antibody (or their controls) twice within 15 hr before LPS administration. We found a dramatic reduction (&gt;90%) in the number of CFU-GM in the LN of LPS-, anti-Ccl19-treated animals by ZT7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Also, we confirmed that Ccr7-expressing GMP in BM rapidly decreased in response to LPS and increased in regional draining LN chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>). The abrogation of accumulation of progenitors in LN was reproduced by the administration of anti-Ccr7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Second, we analyzed the membrane expression of Ccr7 on BM-derived GMP, CMP, and MEP from Mx1Cre;WT or Mx1Cre;<italic>Traf6<sup>Δ/Δ</sup></italic> mice, with or without LPS stimulation. Membrane Ccr7 levels were significantly upregulated as early as 1 hr after LPS administration on GMP in LPS-treated WT mice.

Interestingly, the exposure of PS residues was abrogated in Traf6<sup>∆∕∆</sup> LN cDC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Given that Traf6 deficiency does not modify the survival of hematopoietic cells or progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>), our observations on annexin-V binding indicate that Traf6 mediates the process of vesicle exocytosis. Having demonstrated that LPS/<italic>Traf6</italic> signaling is required for chemokine traffic/secretion in LN mature myeloid lineage cells, and NF-κB transcriptional activation is dispensable for LPS-dependent myeloid progenitor migration, we hypothesized that Traf6 acts through non-NF-κB-dependent IKK activity. To determine whether canonical LPS/TLR downstream effectors were involved in the process of myeloid progenitor migration, we analyzed the chemotaxis of BM myeloid progenitors toward a gradient generated by LN cells in the presence of LPS and specific inhibitors for interleukin receptor-associated kinase 1/4 (Irak1/4), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 13 (Ubc13), and IKKβ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Increased myeloid progenitor migration was reversed by all three specific inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), indicating that the integrity of canonical signaling pathway upstream of NF-κB might be required to attract myeloid progenitors from the BM to the LN. The Traf6/IKK-dependent rapid response to LPS strongly suggests that LPS induces secretion of Ccl19 through a mechanism of rapid release from pre-stored pools. The release of pre-formed cytokines in pre-pooled, stored late endosomes depends on IKK activity through the phosphorylation of mediators of cell membrane fusion. SNAP23 is an essential component of the high-affinity receptor that is part of the general membrane fusion machinery and an important regulator of transport vesicle docking and fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Karim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Suzuki and Verma, 2008</xref>). Phospho-SNAP23(Ser95) is significantly upregulated by LPS in LN cDC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Each of the inhibitors for Irak1/4, Ubc13, and IKK abrogated the activation of SNAP23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Altogether, this set of data indicates that the activation through Traf6/Irak1/4/Ubc13 induced by LPS activates vesicular fusion and vesicular cargo release of pre-formed Ccl19 accumulated in late endosomes of LN myeloid cells. Analysis of steady-state LN myeloid cell populations identified a subpopulation of cDC but not pDC or macrophages, containing most of the cytoplasmic expression of Ccl19. Further analysis of the subpopulations of LN cDC2 demonstrated that B220<sup>-</sup>/CD8<sup>-</sup> cDC that expressed the endocytic receptor DEC-205 (CD205<sup>+</sup>) and the mannose receptor signal regulatory protein α (SIRPα, CD172a<sup>+</sup>) distinctly stored high levels of cytosolic Ccl19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>) unlike other DC populations, which expressed low levels of intracellular Ccl19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). These data indicate that a subpopulation of cDC2 stores intracellular Ccl19 and is potentially able to self-regulate the migration of its own progenitors in inflammation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>In vivo analysis of Ccl19/Ccr7 axis during inflammation.</title><p>Pharmacological regulation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway. (<bold>A</bold>) Annexin-V binding to membrane phosphatidylserine (PS) on lymph node (LN) myeloid populations from wild-type (WT) (left mosaic bars) and <italic>Traf6</italic><sup>∆∕∆</sup> (right mosaic bars) (n = 4 mice per group) after PBS or LPS administration.

Careful analysis of serial femoral sections has not unveiled the existence of a communication between lymphatic and blood vessels in BM further, suggesting the lack of communication between both circuits within the BM cavity and thus likely functional regional independence of each circuit. Our data thus also supports the recently described existence of functional lymphatic vessels in the bone. High-resolution confocal and multiphoton microscopy demonstrated the existence of Lyve1 + cells in which their transgenic reporter illuminated upon exposure to high-dose LPS in vivo along with tiny projections of lymphatics penetrating into the bone. Probably, bone processing and cleaning before fixation and decalcification may have deprived us (and other investigators) from a better identification of notable, anatomically identifiable lymphatic vessels within the network of transcortical capillaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Grüneboom et al., 2019</xref>). Although the exact anatomical and functional nature of this lymphatic network in the bone remains poorly defined, our data demonstrate that the lymphatic-mediated traffic from BM is highly activated in endotoxic inflammation and drains into regional LN chains.</p><p>Bone is a dynamic organ in constant remodeling. Upon inflammation, for example, cytokines and microbial LPS are capable of initiating bone absorption by activating osteoclasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hardy and Cooper, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nason et al., 2009</xref>). Systemic inflammation has been associated with osteoclast activation and osteoblast thinning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hardy and Cooper, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nason et al., 2009</xref>), and bone lymphatic endothelial cells have been shown to arise rapidly from pre-existing regional lymphatics upon osteoclast activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hominick et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Monroy et al., 2020</xref>). Osteoclast activation and osteoblast thinning are likely to facilitate transcortical migration of cells and fluid through existing transcortical vessels.</p><p>Our data showed that as early as 90 min after LPS administration myeloid progenitors to or are in closer proximity to the lymphatic endothelium in BM while 1.5 hr later there is an ~70% reduction of myeloid progenitors within the BM and a marked increase of myeloid progenitors in the LN tissue. This observation, along with the need of a longer period of time to detect an increase in the frequency of myeloid progenitors in peripheral blood, suggests that two temporally distinct waves of progenitors take place, a fast one to the lymphatic circulation followed by a slower one into the blood stream.</p><p>In our study, by using transgenic animals, we demonstrated that the administration of a single dose of LPS suffices to induce migration of GMP/MDP while no other types of progenitors or stem cells migrate to lymphatics in this first wave of egression before any significant contribution from or to PB and differentiate into short-lived LN cDCs in a murine acute model of inflammatory signaling by LPS, and that therefore they may modulate the course of infectious diseases and other inflammatory conditions. This traffic is also likely to happen in homeostatic conditions as previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Waskow et al., 2008</xref>) while our analysis provides compelling evidence on its striking activation upon inflammation/LPS administration.</p><p>Our data support the migration of a distinctly immature progenitor population composed of GMP/MDP with ability to generate cDC in LN upon traffic from BM to LN. This traffic of myeloid progenitors from BM to LN is rapid, before LPS induces proliferation and/or apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nagai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>), and can be recapitulated in mice receiving intrafemoral adoptive transfer of GMPs. These GMP/MDP tend to localize in the T-cell areas of LN. Cheong et al. reported that migratory monocyte-derived cDC2 can also localize in T-cell areas of the LN and acquire an inflammatory phenotype DC-SIGN/CD209a<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cheong et al., 2010</xref>). No significant mobilization of M-CSF-responding monocyte progenitors (CFU-M) can be found as early as 3 hr after LPS administration before any significant effect of LPS on proliferation may take place. Interestingly, the interference of this traffic by blocking Traf6-dependent signaling in Lyz2-expressing myeloid cells results in increased animal death. Ccr7<sup>+</sup> GMP/MDP, but not other myeloid or lymphoid progenitors, egress BM. Such egress follows differential tissue levels of Ccl19 resulting from activation of the secretion of the pre-formed chemokine by LN Lyz2-expressing mature myeloid cells, specifically a subpopulation of cDC expressing CD205 and CD172a. This process seems to be independent of Cxcl12 levels since no changes in Cxcl12 levels in LN, PB, or BM were observed, and this effect seems to be exclusively dependent on activation of non-canonical Traft6/IKK activity without need for transcriptional activation.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schmid et al., 2011</xref> demonstrated that a population of common dendritic progenitors, a non-GMP-derived population of progenitors, can also migrate from the BM to lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues in response to TLR agonists and generate both cDCs and pDCs (pDCs). The type of migration though depended on combined downregulation of Cxcr4 and upregulation of Ccr7, which seem to imitate the mechanism of GMP migration. Interestingly, Ccl21, which is expressed by lymphatic endothelial and stromal cells but not by myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eberlein et al., 2010</xref>), does not induce any differential gradient of secretion between LN and BM or blood, suggesting that Ccl21 may not be a primary mediator of the myeloid progenitor migration from BM to LN upon LPS challenge, while the hematopoietic deficiency of Ccl19 suffices to completely abrogate the mobilization of myeloid progenitors to LN induced by LPS.</p><p>Our data support the existence of a steady-state LN population of cDC that co-expresses the maturation antigens CD205 and CD172a and stores high levels of Ccl19 in their cytoplasm. An interesting possibility is, as our data indicate, that upon bacterial antigen challenge, differentiated myeloid cells of LN like cDCs, which respond to LPS by secreting chemokine-containing pre-formed exosomes, accelerate a positive feedback activation loop to recruit cDC progenitors to the lymphatic tissue. cDC in LNs might thus act as sensors for the presence of bacterial products and release Ccl19 within minutes. Individual DCs have a short half-life (1.5–2.9 days) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kamath et al., 2002</xref>), and DC precursors have a short half-life in blood circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Breton et al., 2015</xref>). We posit that the migration of DC progenitors through the lymph tissues provides a direct afferent communication between the LN mature cDC population responsible for the secretion of the chemokine Ccl19 and at the same time allows the emergent migration of functional cDC progenitors from the BM to differentiate into lymphatic APCs.</p><p>Finally, our data also support the key role of an alternative inflammatory signaling pathway elicited by coordination of Traf6/IKK responsible for SNAP23 phosphorylation and Ccl19 secretion, before resulting in transcriptional regulation by their downstream effector NF-κB. Traf6 has been identified as a signaling molecule that can regulate splicing of downstream targets without affecting NF-κB in hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fang et al., 2017</xref>). Our data further identifies non-canonical signaling pathways elicited by Traf6 in differentiated myeloid cells to modulate the migration of hematopoietic progenitors. Traf6-dependent, cytosolic-mediated IKK signaling allows a fast Ccl19 secretory response before inflammatory transcriptional and post-transcriptional signatures are expressed.</p><p>In summary, we describe, upon inflammation, a rapid trafficking of cDC-biased myeloid progenitors from the BM, via lymphatic vessels, directly to lymphatic tissues that bypasses the blood stream. This GMP/MDP migration represents a mechanism for fast replenishment of cDCs in lymphatic tissues. Rapid replenishment of a reserve of cDC-biased progenitors in LN may represent a major homeostatic function of this novel lymphatic circuit and may explain why the circulation of myeloid progenitors is conserved during the postnatal life.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>CD57Bl/6 (CD45.2<sup>+</sup>) mice were used between 8–10 weeks of age and were purchased from Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME; Harlan Laboratories, Frederick, MD.

The merged images of GFP/DiI or DAPI/DiI are presented, and the total cell number of labeled Lin<sup>-</sup> cells was counted manually. Finally, harvested femurs were decalcified for 14 days with 10% of EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS and embedded in paraffin. Longitudinal sections of bone were cut to 4 μm thickness and were then de-paraffinized and broke the protein crosslink before stain by antigen retrieval treatment with citrate buffer pH 6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cancelas et al., 2005</xref>). Then bone sections were permeabilized with 0.2% of Triton X-100 for 15 min and blocked with 5% of BSA for 1 hr. Slides were stained with primary antibodies anti-GFP (chicken polyclonal, Abcam Inc, Cambridge, MA) and rat anti-mouse panendothelial cell antigen (clone, MECA-32, BD Biosciences, Pharmingen) at 4°C overnight. Then we stained with secondary antibodies, goat anti-rat Alexa Fluor-488 and goat anti-chicken Alexa Fluor-568, all from Invitrogen at 1:1000 v/v concentration for 1 hr at room temperature. Blood and lymphatic vessels were scanned by confocal microscopy (Nikon A1R GaAsP) through multidimensional acquisition to construct 3D representation.</p><p>To further characterize lymphatic system in bone tissue and BM cavity and to image the close proximity of homed Lin<sup>-</sup>/DiI<sup>+</sup> to lymphatic vessels into <italic>Lyve1<sup>eGFP</sup></italic> mice, we utilized multiphoton IVM as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gonzalez-Nieto et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Köhler et al., 2009</xref>). After LPS/PBS injections, long bones were harvested and muscle were carefully cleaned. Further, bone tissues were cautiously trimmed with an electric drill (Dremel) to get better access of the BM cavity for imaging by leaving a very thin (~30–40 μm) layer of bone tissue. Bones were mounted in 2% low- melting agarose to minimize movements during imaging and covered with PBS. Multiphoton microscopy on the long bones (femur and tibia) was subsequently performed using a Nikon A1R Multiphoton Upright Confocal Microscope equipped with Coherent Chameleon II TiSapphire IR laser, tunable from 700 to 1000 nm, and signal was detected by low-noise Hamamatsu photomultiplier (PMT) tubes. Bone tissue was identified as second-harmonic (SHG) signal (PMT). Bones were images in PBS using a 25× Apo 1.1 NA LWD water Immersion objective and NIS image software. For initial standardization, bones were scanned at wavelength of 800, 850, and 900 nm detecting GFP (530 nm) and DiI red (580 nm). For imaging, a 500 × 500 μm area was scanned in ~35 steps of 4 μm down to 120–150 μm depth using an illumination wavelength of 800 nm detecting SHG signal (480 nm), green (530 nm), and red (580 nm) fluorescence. Control C57BL/6 mice were used as a negative control for <italic>Lyve1<sup>eGFP</sup></italic> mice to detect specific signal for GFP-lymphatic system in bone tissue and BM cavity. Lymphatic vessels were well detected in the bone tissue using <italic>Lyve1<sup>eGFP</sup></italic> mice with DiI-labeled Lin<sup>-</sup> cells in the BM cavity. For quantification of proximity of Lin<sup>-</sup>/DiI<sup>+</sup> with lymphatic system, Imaris software was used to measure distance between DiI-labeled cells and GFP-positive lymphatic vessels using 3D images.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Analysis of L-selectin dependence of femoral GMP/MDP migration to regional LN</title><p>C57Bl6 mice received single intraperitoneal injections of MEL14 (CD62L) antibody (BioXcell) 200 μg. Control mice received the same amount of Rat IgG2a. Post 3 days of MEL14 antibody treatment, LDBM cells from ß-actin eGFP mice were injected intrafemorally. LPS (30 mg/kg, BW) was injected post 1 hr of interfemoral injections. Mice were sacrificed at 3 hr post-administration, and ipsilateral and contralateral regional and distant LNs (inguinal, popliteal, axillary, and cervical) were isolated for analysis. LN cells were stained for granulocyte-macrophage progenitor (GMP) markers and anti-CD19-PECy7 (Cat# 552854, BD Biosciences) and analyzed by flow cytometry and quantified the GFP<sup>+</sup> GMP and B lymphocyte populations migrating to LN.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Femoral GFP<sup>+</sup> progenitor migration in WT and Ccl19<sup>-/-</sup> hematopoietic chimeras</title><p>Hematopoietic chimeras of WT and Ccl19<sup>-/-</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Link et al., 2007</xref>) BM cells were generated by transplantation into CD45.1 + mice, similarly to Mx1Cre;<italic>d</italic> hematopoietic chimeras. Mice were followed for 8 weeks and found to have &gt;95% chimera of CD45.2+ cells in peripheral blood. After 8 weeks, femoral LDBM cells from donor congenic-actin transgenic, CD45.2+ mice were injected (5 × 10<sup>5</sup> per mouse) intrafemorally to both WT and Ccl19 hematopoietic chimeric mice. PBS or LPS (30 mg/kg, b.w.) were injected at 1 hr post-intrafemoral injections and sacrificed at 3 hr post-administration of LPS. At that time, ipsilateral LN from inguinal and popliteal regions was isolated.

After 4 hr, cells were resuspended and those adhered to the bottom layer were collected using an enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer (Cell Dissociation Buffer, enzyme free, PBS, Thermo Fisher–Gibco). Progenitor responses toward migratory gradient were analyzed by flow cytometry analysis of LK cells. The percentage of migration was calculated by dividing the number of LK in the outputs by the number of LK in the inputs and multiplied by 100. PBS was included as negative control.

This type of trafficking is highly activated in endotoxic inflammation. Giving LPS to mice results in massive mobilization of myeloid progenitors from the BM to lymph and retention in LN takes place. This happens rapidly and before the appearance of these cells in PB. This type pf LPS challenge induces Ccr7 expression on GMPs as well as secretion of CcL9 in the LN.

This rapid response is directed via chemokines and dependent on TLR-Traf6-dependent, NFkB-independent signaling. This is a very interesting study and reveals an underappreciated role for the lymphatics in responding to acute inflammatory stress and highlights a novel route of trafficking for hematopoietic progenitors that may be important in a variety of settings. These data represent a very thorough investigation of a novel biological phenomenon and therefore will likely be highly impactful to the fields of hematopoiesis and immunology. However, these studies also raise several questions and require additional experiments/data to validate the findings. At the same time, while a strength of this manuscript is the combination of both murine and human data, the arrangement of the data is somewhat confusing and raises some additional questions that need to be addressed.</p><p>1. Data presented in Figure 1 and Supplemental Figure 1 are intriguing, but also a bit confusing. The human data begs a number of questions: first, are there differences in absolute numbers (per LN sample) as the frequency may be influenced by the abundance of mature cells, particularly in lymphoma patients. Additional discussion is required. Second, the combined human and murine data in these figures is disorganized; the blood PMN (supplemental data) seems relevant to what is known about G-CSF-induced mobilization, and should be shown in the main figures. Third, while the starting point for these studies seems to have stemmed from observations in humans, these findings are the least robust. One suggestion is to incorporate the human data at the end of the manuscript to suggest translational relevance, and begin with the most intriguing observation (which is found in Figure 1 H and I). This seems like an excellent starting point for the whole manuscript.</p><p>2. One aspect of HSC/HSPC function that was not addressed but may be very important is that of proliferation, especially because TRAF6-dependent Akt activation can regulate cell proliferation. Mobilization of progenitors due to G-CSF is associated with progenitor and HSC proliferation, and therefore, could be an important contributor to the numbers of cells observed. First, does proliferation change in the absence of TRAF6? Second, is the number of HSPCs in the blood different in these (TRAF6-deficient) mice? The second question stems from wondering whether the trafficking pattern is different when migration to the lymph/LNs is mitigated (ie, do they all get mobilized to the blood by default?). As TRAF6-deficient cells have baseline differences (ie, CCR7 expression S5.G) it seems there may be a variety of dysfunctional elements in these cells. Is this known and can this be commented on? If it is not feasible to look at proliferation or if these data haven't been generated it seems raising this as a potential caveat would be good.</p><p>3. The mechanisms accounting for the early death in models where myeloid progenitor accumulation in the LNs are not carefully investigated and therefore the conclusion the authors make regarding the role of myeloid progenitor differentiation in LNs as an anti-inflammatory response to prevent death, seems premature.</p><p>a. Specifically, CCR7 blockade may impact a variety of cells, including lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) in the LNs. CCR7 signaling is critical for maintaining normal T cell trafficking and T regulatory cell populations in the lymph nodes which very well could contribute to outcomes in this model. Have these lymphocytes been evaluated? Is it known if there are decreases in factors such as IL-10 or TGFb, anti-inflammatory factors?</p><p>b. Dendritic cell function is not analyzed and the phenotype described is not sufficient to define anti-inflammatory DCs. At the same time it is unclear how DC numbers change in these models where migration is blocked. CFU assays are reported, but do the numbers of mature cells differ?</p><p>c. Even without the conclusion on death, the observations of the described trafficking pattern and replenishment of the lymph node DC populations is novel and incredibly interesting, so the suggestion is to simply soften these conclusions and discuss other possible outcomes.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.66190.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>While it would be challenging to strengthen the human data, the murine studies are already the major component of the manuscript, allow for a thorough analysis of mechanism, and could be strengthened as suggested especially by Reviewer 2 (see specific comments below).
