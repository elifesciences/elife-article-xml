To dissect Pol II dynamics in mouse ES cells, we inhibited Pol II transcription at either initiation or promoter-proximal pause escape with Triptolide or Flavopiridol, and tracked Pol II kinetically using GRO-seq. Both inhibitors block transcription of more than 95% of genes, showing that pause escape, like initiation, is a ubiquitous and crucial step within the transcription cycle. Moreover, paused Pol II is relatively stable, as evidenced from half-life measurements at ∼3200 genes. Finally, tracking the progression of Pol II after drug treatment establishes Pol II elongation rates at over 1000 genes. Notably, Pol II accelerates dramatically while transcribing through genes, but slows at exons. Furthermore, intergenic variance in elongation rates is substantial, and is influenced by a positive effect of H3K79me2 and negative effects of exon density and CG content within genes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02407.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02407.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02407.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many different factors determine how quickly the DNA in genes is transcribed to produce molecules of messenger RNA. The start of the transcription process features two milestones: first, an enzyme called RNA Polymerase II starts the process; shortly afterwards, however, the process pauses and only starts again when other proteins are recruited. This provides two levels of control over the production of messenger RNA and, it also allows the transcription process to be interrupted in order to study the rate of transcription.</p><p>Here, Jonkers, Kwak and Lis used two drugs to block either the start of transcription or the release from the paused state in mouse cells. Both drugs prevented new transcription and disrupted about 95% of the total number of genes. However, RNA Polymerase II that was already copying DNA could continue to copy, and did so at an average rate of 2000 bases per minute. Transcription rates were, however, shown to vary between different genes—highly active genes are transcribed faster. Transcription rates also varied within individual genes, with the enzyme accelerating as it moves along the gene. This suggests that the transcription machinery, including other proteins that improve the enzyme’s efficiency, are recruited or modified after transcription has already started, and that these proteins help the enzyme to reach its maximum transcription speed.</p><p>Other factors also affected the transcription rate: the genetic code is written in four letters—A, C, G and T—and genes that contained more Cs and Gs were transcribed slower than those with lots of As and Ts. Genes also contain regions called exons that code for proteins, and regions called introns that do not: Jonkers, Kwak and Lis found that genes with lots of exons were transcribed slower. Furthermore, DNA is wrapped around proteins into a compacted structure, and genes that had certain chemical markings added to these proteins were transcribed faster.</p><p>The work of Jonkers, Kwak and Lis is the first in-depth look at how transcription is affected by gene structure, and leads the way to uncovering how transcription rates throughout genes are regulated to influence production of messenger RNA.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02407.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02407.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>pausing</kwd><kwd>P-TEFb</kwd><kwd>GRO-seq</kwd><kwd>elongation rate</kwd><kwd>RNA polymerase II</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM25232</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lis</surname><given-names>John T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005237</institution-id><institution>Helen Hay Whitney Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jonkers</surname><given-names>Iris</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kwak</surname><given-names>Hojoong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The elongation rate of RNA Polymerase II varies greatly between and along genes, as this enzyme accelerates from stable pausing to rapid elongation within genes, and is influenced by CG-content, exons and chromatin.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Many steps throughout the transcription cycle of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) can be regulated, and modulation of any step has the potential to alter the timing and output of mRNA production. After initiation of Pol II, transcription regulation is mediated mostly by the dynamics of Pol II elongation. For example, +20 to 100 nts downstream of the transcription start site (TSS), Pol II can be slowed down and paused by negative elongation factor (NELF), DRB-sensitivity inducing factor (DSIF) and core promoter components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adelman and Lis, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kwak et al., 2013</xref>). The escape of Pol II from the paused state into productive elongation can be rate-limiting, and is dependent on the positive elongation factor P-TEFb, which consists of the Cdk9 kinase and CyclinT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marshall et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lis et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ni et al., 2008</xref>). P-TEFb is recruited directly or indirectly to the paused Pol II complex by transcription activators, where it phosphorylates the C-Terminal domain (CTD), as well as DSIF and NELF, transforming DSIF into a positive elongation factor and evicting NELF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Peterlin and Price, 2006</xref>). P-TEFb appears to be both necessary and sufficient for paused Pol II escape into productive elongation; blocking P-TEFb kinase activity with the drug flavopiridol (FP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chao and Price, 2001</xref>) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> causes an increase of promoter proximal Pol II at the majority of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Henriques et al., 2013</xref>). The accumulation of paused Pol II has been proposed to be the result of rapid rounds of termination and re-initiation, creating a highly dynamic Pol II peak at the promoter proximal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brannan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Davidson et al., 2012</xref>). However, paused Pol II in <italic>Drosophila</italic> seems remarkably stable as shown by extensive kinetic and in vivo analysis at the <italic>Drosophila Hsp70</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buckley et al., 2014</xref>) and by estimation of decay rates of over a dozen <italic>Drosophila</italic> genes by blocking TFIIH helicase activity, and thereby initiation, with the drug triptolide (Trp) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Henriques et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, <italic>Drosophila</italic> Pol II transcription can be regulated by the promoter proximal, stable pausing and by transcription factor-controlled entry of paused Pol II into productive elongation in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p>In mammals, promoter proximal pausing also seems to be a P-TEFb dependent and rate-limiting step during early elongation for many genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Core et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rahl et al., 2010</xref>). Expressed genes without a peak of paused Pol II in one cell type, may acquire pausing in another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Min et al., 2011</xref>), indicating that genes have the potential of becoming regulated by promoter proximal pausing even when a promoter proximal Pol II peak is absent. However, it is unclear if all genes undergo this P-TEFb dependent step in mammals, and how stable the paused Pol II is.</p><p>Downstream of the promoter proximal region, the rate of Pol II elongation has been proposed to influence (co-)transcriptional processes such as splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Howe et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de la Mata et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shukla and Oberdoerffer, 2012</xref>), 3′ end processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nag et al., 2007</xref>), termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hazelbaker et al., 2012</xref>), and overall levels of mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Danko et al., 2013</xref>). Genic features that could potentially influence elongation rates are often, but not exclusively, associated with exons. Examples are histone modifications around exons and within the gene body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kolasinska-Zwierz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schor et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schwartz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Saint-André et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schor et al., 2013</xref>), nucleosome occupancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schwartz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tilgner et al., 2009</xref>), GC content of both intronic and exonic DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schwartz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amit et al., 2012</xref>), and DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maunakea et al., 2013</xref>). Many exonic chromatin features have been implicated in regulation of splicing as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kolasinska-Zwierz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schor et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shukla et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, Pol II has been shown to accumulate preferentially at spliced exons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brodsky et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chodavarapu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kwak et al., 2013</xref>), leading to the hypothesis that reduction of Pol II elongation rate facilitates splice site recognition and spliceosome assembly, and thus, splicing of the associated intron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shukla and Oberdoerffer, 2012</xref>). Indeed, transcription with a slow mutant of Pol II promotes alternative splicing in human and yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Howe et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de la Mata et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">de la Mata et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The relationship of elongation rates, exons and other features of transcription units is still in dispute. Despite observations of Pol II accumulation at exons, three studies that directly measured elongation rates at multiple genes could not clearly demonstrate a correlation between exons and elongation rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Singh and Padgett, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brody et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Danko et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, although in vitro studies clearly show the effect of nucleosomes and histone modifications on elongation rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Orphanides et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hodges et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bintu et al., 2012</xref>), the in vivo consequences of chromatin on elongation rate are less understood, primarily because of the inability to measure elongation rates at many genes simultaneously. Previous studies have measured elongation rates ranging from 1 to 4 kb/min at individual genes in various organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ardehali and Lis, 2009</xref>). Recently, elongation rates for over 160 genes were measured simultaneously by following the induction wave of Pol II after estradiol or TNF-alpha treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Danko et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, this study showed a broad range of elongation rates between and within cell types, suggesting that the control of elongation rate may be used to regulate transcription and co-transcriptional processes. Thus far, elongation rates have only been measured in rapidly inducible genes, which limits the analytical power to reveal the associations to various features of transcription. Therefore, it is critical to expand the number of elongation rates measured simultaneously in vivo, to allow systematic analysis of the correlation between exons, chromatin and elongation rate.</p><p>In this study, we use Trp and FP, two highly specific drugs to block initiation or pause escape, in combination with the sensitive GRO-seq assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Core et al., 2008</xref>) to examine the drug-induced kinetic changes in Pol II distribution over promoter proximal regions and in the gene body. While FP blocks escape of paused Pol II, elongating Pol II can still clear the gene, and both changes can easily be followed by the sensitive and transcription orientation specific GRO-seq assay. We definitively show that P-TEFb is required for paused Pol II to escape into a productive elongation, providing a platform for transcription regulatory input on the early elongation rate, even for genes not previously known to be paused, confirming and extending earlier results using ChIP-seq of Pol II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rahl et al., 2010</xref>). Similarly, use of Trp to block Pol II initiation and entry to the pause, allows kinetic analysis of paused Pol II stability on nearly 3200 genes, showing that paused Pol II has a relatively long half-life and excluding rapid termination mechanisms as a major factor of Pol II regulation at the promoter. Furthermore, inhibition of Pol II gene body entry causes a ‘wave’ of elongating Pol II that, when assayed as a function of time after FP or Trp addition, allows measurement of elongation rates at over 1000 genes simultaneously, and over different regions within genes. We show that Pol II elongation rates increase within the gene body, suggesting a gradual maturation of the elongation complex as it progresses through the gene. In addition, we analyzed elongation rate variation as a function of a large number of genic and chromatin characteristics. Elongation rates correlate negatively with exon density and CpG content and methylation, and positively with active transcription mark H3K79me2. Overall, we can explain ∼30% of the gene-by-gene variation in elongation rates. Our study of the dynamics of Pol II shows that elongation rate is highly dynamic at all genes, both at the promoter proximal region and within the gene body.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of GRO-seq libraries treated with FP and Trp</title><p>When a gene is activated, P-TEFb kinase is recruited to promoters and phosphorylates the paused Pol II·NELF·DISF complex, allowing paused Pol II to more rapidly escape into productive elongation. To identify all genes dependent on P-TEFb, we inhibited P-TEFb kinase activity with the drug FP. For comparison, we also inhibited pre-initiation complex formation with Trp. We isolated replicates of nuclei from untreated mESCs and cells treated for 2, 5, 12.5, 25 and 50 min with 300 nM FP, as well as nuclei treated for 12.5, 25, and 50 min with 500 nM Trp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and performed GRO-seq with these nuclei (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).

Chromatin bound Pol II is reduced after treatment with either FP or Trp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, phosphorylation of the CTD of chromatin bound Pol II was reduced only after FP treatment, but not Trp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Overall, these results indicate that FP and Trp exert the intended effects on the phosphorylation of the Pol II CTD.</p><p>Two long genes, Pkp4 and Ppp2r5e (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), and composite profiles of all genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>) illustrate the effects of P-TEFb inhibition by FP (pause escape) and TFIIH inhibition by Trp (initiation) on Pol II distribution. Both drugs work rapidly, as gene body density near the TSS approaches background levels within 12.5 min. The rapid drug action and immediate measurements thereafter minimize the possibility of major secondary effects within the short timeframe of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). Furthermore, as the FP and Trp dependent block of Pol II entry into the gene persists, elongating Pol II forms ‘inhibition waves’ that are very similar between treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>, lower panels). Downstream of these inhibition waves, Pol II density levels remain equal throughout the time course, indicating that elongating Pol II in the gene body is not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). Conversely, the two drugs have opposite effects at the promoter proximal region. The composite paused Pol II peak increases after FP treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,D</xref>), but disappears after Trp treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). These results confirm that Trp blocks transcription initiation and causes the time dependent clearing of Pol II from the promoter and gene body, while FP’s prominent effect is to block escape from the pause, causing a time dependent gene body clearance but enhanced promoter proximal Pol II pausing.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>P-TEFb dependent escape from the pause occurs at all active TSSs</title><p>Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Henriques et al.

Fast Pol II will spend less time in an intron, reaching the 3′ SS and subsequent splicing and degradation of intronic RNA faster, resulting in a flatter intronic read pattern and a lower slope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>Because the saw tooth pattern was more clearly distinguishable in larger introns and because intronic reads are much less abundant than exonic reads in typical RNA-seq datasets, we grouped introns and used pooled intronic read counts on all introns longer than 10 kb.

To verify the observed gene-to-gene variation in elongation rates of these genes, we split the 938 mid elongation rates genes into quartiles.

Moreover, elongation rates derived from multiple regions within the same gene were significantly greater further downstream in the gene body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>), showing that this acceleration occurs within most genes and is not a consequence of elongation rate variation between genes. Also, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Danko et al.

The slope of intron read density as a function of distance to the 3′ SS is higher in the upstream region compared to the downstream region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), indicative of slower elongation rates upstream in genes, and acceleration as Pol II travels within the gene body.</p><p>The acceleration is not constant, but decreases as transcription proceeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B,C</xref>), suggesting that the Pol II elongation complex ‘matures’ and reaches its maximum speed while transcribing a gene. The maturation could be caused by the stochastic accumulation of elongation factors to the Pol II complex, or by gradual stochastic loss of pausing factors. Indeed, pausing negatively correlates with mid elongation rates, while late elongation rates are not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3D</xref>), suggesting that pausing delays the maturation of Pol II. Furthermore, ChIP-seq composite profiles of total Pol II and of Ser5 or Ser2 phosphorylated CTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rahl et al., 2010</xref>) show that Pol II Ser2 phosphorylation, which is a product of P-TEFb activity and other kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bartkowiak et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Devaiah et al., 2012</xref>) and presumably coincides with the loss of NELF and DSIF pausing activity, increases gradually within the gene body within the same region as the acceleration of the elongation complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3E,F</xref>).

Therefore, we plotted the mean elongation rates of genes based on the number of exons within the average region that Pol II travels between 12.5 and 25 min FP (7.5–30 kb) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, left). Interestingly, the striking negative linear correlation between the number of exons and the elongation rates suggests that Pol II slows whenever it encounters an exon. To quantify the delay per exon, we plotted the exon density within the transition region of each gene against the elongation rate, and added a direct linear regression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, right, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Addition of an exon within the three regions, in which early, mid, and late elongation rates were derived, results in average delays of 37, 31 or 23 s respectively. Thus, the co-transcriptional delay of Pol II at exons is striking and might be linked to coupled splicing events. Interestingly, the delay is somewhat less in downstream regions of the gene body when Pol II is more fully phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3F</xref>) and is generally elongating faster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-9-3"><title>Promoter structure</title><p>Somewhat surprisingly, promoter architecture seems to have an effect on downstream elongation rates. We found a striking positive correlation between CG content at promoters, that is CpG islands, and the downstream mid elongation rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, left). Unmethylated CpG islands are often associated with broad transcription initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Core et al., 2008</xref>), likely because CpG islands deter nucleosome binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ramirez-Carrozzi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fenouil et al., 2012</xref>).

Therefore we explored the nucleosome occupancy as a function of elongation rates, and found that the nucleosome free region (NFR) is wider in genes with faster elongation rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, right); the fastest gene group is shifted approximately 2 nucleosomes downstream compared to the slowest genes. This shows that a more nucleosome-free promoter architecture correlates positively with elongation rates, and implicates an intrinsic component of Pol II rate is determined in the earliest stages of transcription.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9-4"><title>DNA sequence</title><p>To assess if CG content within the gene body has an effect on elongation, we examined the DNA sequences in the average mid elongation rate 7.5–30 kb region by searching for differences in all possible 6-mer DNA sequences between the fastest and the slowest groups of genes. Interestingly, the top 20 6-mer sequences associated with slower elongation rates were enriched for repeats of CG dinucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, left). Moreover, we found a modest negative correlation between the CG density and the elongation rates in individual genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>), opposite of the effect CG content has at the promoter. Interestingly, while elongation rates seems to be positively related to the NFR and GC content at promoters, elongation rate correlates negatively with CG content within the gene body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, right panel) and is unaffected by nucleosome occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

The increased melting temperature of GC-rich DNA may explain this general reduction of elongation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nechaev et al., 2010</xref>), but the methylation status of the CG dinucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) may also lead to differential regulation of Pol II elongation rates.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9-5"><title>General model for the elongation rates</title><p>As described above, gene-to-gene differences of the elongation rates are associated with various features of genes. Many of these are tightly linked to each other; the first intron length is related to H3K79me2 mark and directly linked to the exon density; CpG methylation and H3K36me3 is enriched specifically in exons. To ascertain the primary from secondary determinants of the elongation rates, we used a multivariate regression analysis. For individual genes, each feature was scaled to a rank-order based z-score to assume a Gaussian distribution, making different metric types comparable. We then iteratively assessed how combinations of the features fit to the linear model, and determined the association network with our elongation rate measurements.</p><p>Out of many features associated with the gene body and promoters of mid elongation rate genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), we examined further those features that correlated most with elongation rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). All of these features are significantly associated with the elongation rates, the exon density having the strongest correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). To find which of the features can have an independent effect on elongation rates, we examined how much of the correlation between each feature and the elongation rates could be explained by another feature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). For example, the correlation between elongation rates and intron 1 length, gene body H3K36me3, and H3K4me1 can be explained almost entirely by the exon density alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), since they do not show correlation with the residual of the elongation rates after fitting to the exon density model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, gene body H3K79me2 and gene body CpG features cannot be explained mostly by exon density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Likewise, H3K79me2 and CpG content have independent components from each other, while CpG methylation is tightly associated with CpG content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). These tight associations between exon density and intron 1 lengths, and between CpG count and methylation are also shown by principal component analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>), which also reveals the contribution of less major factors such as cohesin and the promoter architecture characterized by unmethylated CpG islands and the NFR. Therefore, the multivariate model progressively explains more of the variances and shows better fits when CpG content, exon density, and H3K79me2 are combined to explain elongation rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Addition of more factors only slightly increases the variance explained by the model of elongation rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, right panel), indicating that CpG content, exon density and H3K79me2 are the main modulators of elongation rate. While CpG content is likely to exert effects throughout the gene, H3K79me2 is mostly enriched within exon and intron 1, indicating that this histone modification is beneficial to elongation early in the gene, while the elongation complex is still accelerating.

While transcription elongation rates often seem to be taken for granted, we show that elongation rates are surprisingly diverse, both at the promoter proximal region, within the gene body, and between genes. We definitively show that all genes have the potential of being regulated at the promoter proximal pause site, as all initiated Pol II undergoes a P-TEFb dependent step of escape into productive elongation. Furthermore, we find that the average half-life of paused Pol II is 7 min, indicating that Pol II pausing is remarkably stable, and not the consequence of fast, repeated rounds of initiation and termination. Finally, we measured elongation rates ranging from 0.5 to 4 kb/min at ∼1000 genes and within different regions of genes. Strikingly, Pol II accelerates as it transcribes through the gene body, and a large amount of variation in elongation rates occurs between genes, and is associated with chromatin and exon density. Overall, we are able to predict ∼30% of the intergenic variation in elongation rates with just three features, exon density, CpG content and methylation, and H3K79me2, providing a first quantitative assessment of how elongation rates are affected by gene structure.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Promoter proximal pausing and P-TEFb dependent escape are integral parts of the transcription cycle</title><p>Inhibition of P-TEFb, like inhibition of initiation, affects &gt;95% of actively transcribed genes, showing that escape from pause is an integral step in the transcription cycle. However, not all active genes show signs of promoter proximal accumulation of paused Pol II in mES cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Min et al., 2011</xref>, this study). Clearly, this accumulation of Pol II depends on both the rate with which pause complex is formed (the transcription initiation rate) and its rate of escape to elongation. Some transcription factors stimulate the formation of paused Pol II, others recruit P-TEFb directly or indirectly to facilitate the escape of paused Pol II, while others do both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blau et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rahl et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Danko et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li and Gilmour, 2013</xref>). The balance of these factors at promoters, together with pausing factors that stabilize Pol II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yamaguchi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kwak et al., 2013</xref>) determine the relative accumulation paused Pol II. As we (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Henriques et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buckley et al., 2014</xref>) have shown, pausing of Pol II is remarkably stable at many genes, indicating that termination does not have a great effect on promoter proximal Pol II levels. This stably-paused Pol II may help maintain accessibility of the promoter to regulatory factors that tune transcriptional output by simply changing the escape rate of paused Pol II into the body of the gene. Indeed, heat shock has recently been shown both optically and biochemically to increase the escape of paused Pol II into the gene body at the <italic>Drosophila Hsp70</italic> locus without decreasing termination of paused Pol II, arguing against a role for termination in the regulation of the accumulation and escape of paused Pol II.</p><p>If Pol II undergoes a pausing step in the transcription cycle at all genes, then blocking P-TEFb kinase activity should lead to an increase of paused Pol II. Indeed, this is what we observe for the majority of genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). However, a small fraction of poorly expressed and weakly paused genes show a reduction in paused Pol II after FP treatment. We speculate that transcription initiation, Pol II pausing, and escape into productive elongation are not necessarily uncoupled processes for all genes. Instead, disruption of pausing dynamics by FP may feed back on transcription initiation and decrease the formation of paused Pol II. Other observations support a cross-talk of pausing and initiation. Depletion of Nelf can decrease expression of a subset of genes, indicative of a dependency of initiation on pausing, in this case through the maintenance of nucleosome free promoters by paused Pol II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gilchrist et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, precise mapping of Pol II reveals that core promoter elements appear to contribute to stronger and more promoter proximal pausing in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kwak et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Venters and Pugh, 2013</xref>). Overall, the specific inhibitors used in this manuscript inhibit either initiation or pause escape seemingly with few secondary effects, as the Pol II inhibition profile within gene bodies is remarkably similar after either drug treatment. Nonetheless, perturbations of one process could possibly have effects on the other, at least for some genes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Causes and consequences of elongation rate variation between cells</title><p>Because P-TEFb inhibition affects all active genes, we could determine over 1300 individual elongation rates of Pol II, often at multiple regions within the same gene. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Danko et al. (2013)</xref> has used GRO-seq following rapid induction of transcription to examine the rate of the Pol II induction wave front. Our elongation rates derived after inhibition of P-TEFb were slightly lower in comparison to the elongation rates derived after induction which may point to a model in which lagging Pol II pushes leading Pol II thereby increasing overall elongation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Saeki and Svejstrup, 2009</xref>). Indeed, elongation rates in highly expressed genes, where elongating Pol II is more tightly packed, are faster compared to rates in poorly expressed genes in both studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Danko et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, we have shown that chromatin composition, specifically H3K79me2 and CpG content, of genes influences elongation rates. Interestingly, mouse ESCs have high levels of DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stadler et al., 2011</xref>). DNA methylation and CG content negatively influence elongation rate, and could partially explain the difference between mESC and differentiated cell line derived elongation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Danko et al., 2013</xref>). Finally, repression of H3K79me2 has recently been observed to increase reprogramming efficiency of fibroblasts to iPSCs, by reducing expression of lineage specific genes in the first stages of reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Onder et al., 2012</xref>). We have shown that elongation rates can influence steady state mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), and that H3K79me2 positively influences elongation rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). We therefore argue that reprogramming efficiency by reducing H3K79me2 levels could be a result of elongation rate modulation.</p><p>Finally, we emphasize that the variation of elongation rates revealed in this study have enormous potential in timing of mRNA production. Mammalian genes of over 200 kb and twofold differences in elongation rates between genes are not uncommon, leading to variation in response time of mRNA production of an hour or more. This timing can be very relevant in development and the stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Thummel, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Swinburne and Silver, 2008</xref>), and could not only be dependent on intron length, but also be regulated by elongation rate modulation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Elongation rates and splicing</title><p>The hypothesis that Pol II elongation rate regulates splicing is longstanding (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shukla and Oberdoerffer 2012</xref>). Here, we show directly that exon density is the greatest predictor of elongation rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), strongly suggesting that Pol II slows down at each exon. Exonic features such as CpG methylation, H3K36me3 and H3K4me1 could work synergistically to establish a transient slow down at exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Although we demonstrate that Pol II slows down at exons, presumably to facilitate splicing, we could not determine whether a slowly transcribing Pol II increases inclusion of exons. Although rates of elongation have been shown to influence splicing outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Howe et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de la Mata et al., 2003</xref>), the effects on specific genes, we suggest, will be governed by competing processes such as rates of splicing complex assembly, RNA secondary and tertiary structure formation, and regulatory factor binding. While our data cannot on its own assess the outcomes on alternative splicing of such competing and cooperating processes, our observed slow down of transcription at exons supports the general view that Pol II elongation rates are coupled to splicing at all exons.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture, nuclei isolation and GRO-seq library preparation</title><p>Cell culturing of the V6.5 mES cell line was done as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Monkhorst et al.

To establish which genes were active above background with a Fisher exact p-value of &lt;0.05, we mapped reads from control datasets to gene-poor regions, took 10 × the average read density of these two datasets as a safe threshold for background (5 × 10<sup>−4</sup> reads/bp). The genes for analysis of FP and Trp sensitivity are the top 75% active genes larger than 3.5 kb present in both the FP as the Trp control dataset, without genes that have an annotated TSS within 1000 bp on the opposite strand (bidirectional genes) and genes that have an annotated polyA site upstream of its TSS within 10 kb (tandem genes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>, n = 6380). Pause and divergent peak locations were found by searching for maximum sense or antisense strand read density in 10 bp windows from ±500 bp or −1000 to +500 around the annotated TSS of the 6380 selected genes, respectively. The peak was defined as a 250 bp region centered on the maximum 10 bp window. The pausing index is the ratio of the pause peak density and the annotated gene body region density (+1 kb from the TSS to polyA site). To calculate the fold change after FP or Trp treatment for each timepoint, we added a pseudo-count to the divergent, pause or gene body region close to the TSS (+1 kb to +3.5 kb only), calculated the density in the mappable region of each and took the ratio of the read densities.

Also, genes that have premature termination before the annotated 3′ ends and/or the 60 kb/150 kb mark are removed using a regional transcription unit calling algorithm (described below in this section). After filtering, the number of selected genes are n = 4461, 2769 and 571 for genes longer than 30 kb, 60 kb, and 150 kb, respectively. The transition points from the drug affected (inhibited) region to the drug unaffected (uninhibited) region of the gene body were determined by a regional transition point calling algorithm (described below in this section) for each replicate of FP or Trp GRO-seq time courses. The following is the description of the custom made HMM algorithms in c++.</p><sec id="s4-3-1"><title>Regional transition point calling algorithm</title><p>For the selected genes, GRO-seq read counts from the TSS to 60 kb or 150 kb positions are binned for each time-point, and were divided by the untreated read counts at the same bins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The bins sizes are 500 bp, 1 kb, 2 kb, and 5 kb respectively for analyzing 5 min, 12.5 min, 25 min and 50 min time points. These sizes were selected so that each gene will have approximately 30–40 bins throughout the gene body regions, which was the optimal number for the HMM results. For each gene, the ratios in individual bins were internally normalized, by dividing by the average ratios of the last five bins at the 3′ ends. These bins are considered as the Markov process as the observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). For efficient HMM calculation, the normalized ratios were digitized, ranging from 0 to 2.0, with a step size of 0.05. Therefore, each binned position can have 40 observed states of the read ratio, and the probability of each state follows a binominal distribution of <italic>B</italic>(<italic>n</italic>, <italic>e</italic>), where <italic>n</italic> = 20 and <italic>e</italic> is the emission probability. We assumed two hidden states, ‘inhibition affected’ and ‘inhibition unaffected’, with two emission probabilities <italic>e</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>e</italic><sub>2</sub>. The transition probabilities between the ‘affected’ and ‘unaffected’ states are <italic>p</italic><sub>11</sub>, <italic>p</italic><sub>12</sub>, and <italic>p</italic><sub>21</sub>, and are unidirectional. The Baum-Welch algorithm is used to estimate the transition and emission probabilities, by iterative calculations until the probabilities converge. If the iteration is over 200 cycles without convergence, we dropped the gene from further analysis. The transition point is calculated from these probabilities.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2"><title>Genome-wide transcription unit calling algorithm</title><p>The untreated GRO-seq data is used similarly as the regional transition point calling algorithm with some modifications. First, instead of using ratios relative to the reference dataset, we used binary observation values for each 200 bp bin of the Markov process; 1 if there is a GRO-seq read within the bin and 0 if there are no reads. In this case, the binomial distribution becomes <italic>B</italic>(2, <italic>e</italic>). Second, the full length of each chromosome was used rather than individual genes. Third, the Baum-Welch algorithm was allowed to run up to 1000 iterations. Finally, a Viterbi path was calculated to define transcriptionally active regions.</p><p>Using this de novo transcription unit (TU) calling, we selected TUs that have both sense and divergent pairs starting within 2 kb from each other. These paired TUs can indicate annotated TSSs, unannotated TSSs, or other regulatory transcription activities such as lncRNA or enhancer transcripts. We compared these TUs to the annotated long genes and removed the genes that did not have paired TUs near the annotated TSS (&lt;2 kb). Also, we dropped genes that contain divergent TUs within the gene body, since these paired sense TUs can indicate alternative start sites that may interfere with detection of the inhibition wave by the regional transition point calling algorithm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-3"><title>Regional transcription unit calling algorithm</title><p>Using untreated GRO-seq data, we generated binary bins from TSSs defined by the genome-wide transcription unit calling algorithm to 50 kb downstream of the annotated 3′ end in each individual gene, and used these values to estimate the probability parameters of the HMM. This is similar to the genome-wide transcription unit calling algorithm in that it uses binary observation values, but also similar to the regional transition point calling in that it is done in individual genes. One difference is that it starts from the active region and detects the transition point into the inactive region or in other words the end of the TU, which is opposite of the regional transition point calling algorithm. Genes that have the transition point before the 60 kb/150 kb point are dropped, as this may interfere with detection of the inhibition wave by the regional transition point calling.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Relative elongation rate estimate using nascent RNA-seq</title><p>We analyzed relative elongation rates with methods described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ameur et al.

Intronic reads are sparse, so we pooled multiple genes to assess the relative elongation rate. First, introns longer than 10 kb are selected. Introns containing annotated alternative exons were split in a 5′ and 3′ intron to exclude the interference from exonic RNA-seq reads. Second, selected introns are subgrouped by length in 10 kb bins; <italic>that is</italic> 10–20 kb, 20–30 kb, 30–40 kb groups, <italic>etc</italic>. We used up to 50 kb for the estimation of elongation rates (up to 80 kb are plotted). Third, introns are aligned at the 3′ splicing sites (3′SS), and intronic reads are counted in 100 bp windows in each intron length subgroup. To normalize for differences in the transcription level in each group, the read counts in windows are normalized to the read density 1 kb upstream of the 3′ SS to the 3’SS in each group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>).

If the slow population terminates prematurely leaving the fast Pol IIs, then the overall apparent elongation rate would increase as transcription proceeds in the gene body. To differentiate between the termination, acceleration and mixed model, we used a Monte Carlo simulation describing the dynamics of Pol II movement through the gene body. In short, we simulated the time course of the inhibition wave of Pol II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and used the regional transition point calling algorithm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>) to define the transition points of inhibition waves and elongation rates. The relationship between the simulated Pol II density and the inverse of average elongation rates of 1000 simulated experiments shows a clear difference between the models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B,C,D</xref>).

The termination constant (<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub>) and the elongation rate (<italic>v</italic>) are the functions dependent on the activity (<italic>A)</italic> as well as the position (<italic>x</italic>) within the gene body of the Pol II molecule.

In a termination model, intrinsically active Pol II molecules elongate faster while less active ones elongate at a slower rate and terminate more frequently. In this case, <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> is a decreasing function of <italic>A</italic>, and <italic>v</italic> is an increasing function of <italic>A</italic> regardless of <italic>x</italic>.</p><p>When running a simulation, the entry, termination, and progression events are assessed after each time increment of <italic>Δt</italic>.

The interpretation of this is that termination takes place at some preferred positions along the gene. We adjusted the shape of the function so that slower Pol II is relatively stable near the 5′ side of the gene to make the apparent elongation rate slower at the beginning. The increased termination at more downstream position leaves only the faster polymerase populations and the apparent elongation rates are higher.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Acceleration constants of intrinsically accelerating Pol II</title><p>We calculated the intrinsic acceleration constant <italic>a</italic> of Pol II with <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>end</italic></sub> <italic>= v</italic><sub><italic>start</italic></sub> <italic>× a Δt</italic> for corrected elongation rates between 5 to 12.5 min and 12.5 to 25 min FP treatment, and for 12.5 to 25 min and 25 to 50 min FP treatment. Elongation rates were corrected for exon density within the transition region where the rate was measured by using the linear regression formulas in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>. For the linear regressions the elongation rates over transition regions that had an exon density &gt;0 were taken into account to assess the additive time delay per exon.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>ChIP-seq analysis and linear modeling of the genomic features</title><p>ChIPseq datasets listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Figure 5—source data 1</xref> were downloaded and aligned to the mm9 genome when necessary. Read density was derived in the mappable promoter region or the average 12.5–25 min or 25—50 min transition regions. We correlated read density of ChIPseq factors in the promoter or transition regions with elongation rates. For factors that correlated with elongation rates, we made additional density profiles from −2 to 30 kb from the TSS in 25 bp windows in the 12.5–25 min mid elongation rate genes, ordered by mid elongation rate from slow to fast. Also, we looked at the elongation rates in quartiles of correlating factors in the promoter or transition regions.</p><p>To apply the linear modeling methods, we converted individual genomic features to fit the Gaussian distributions using rank ordered z-statistics (R statistics package). Briefly, the percentile rank of a gene’s specific genomic feature is converted to a z-score through the inverse cumulative Gaussian distribution function. This conversion enables the comparison of different non-linear features, yet also allows us to use the linear modeling tools such as least square methods and principal component analysis. Genes with tied rank orders are randomly assigned to have different ranks. The major features taken into account have a p-value&lt;0.01 from the simple linear regression (function lm() in R). The z-score distribution between the elongation rate and a major feature is plotted in a [−4,4] × [−4,4] range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The principal component analysis (function princomp() in R) between the two features was used to identify the eigenvector that shows the direction of correlation, and a red arrow was depicted to represent the direction as well as the magnitude of the correlation coefficient.</p><p>For the iterative linear modeling, we took the residual elongation rates after fitting to the linear modeling using a 1° feature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>, first row), and the residuals are again converted using the rank order z-statistics. The converted residuals are fitted to a 2° feature linear modeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>, second row). The correlation coefficient of the iterative linear modeling was compared to the correlation coefficient of a single linear modeling using the 2° feature alone, and the percent reduction of the R<sup>2</sup> by the 1° feature was color scaled in a combinatorial manner to produce the heatmap in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>. The predicted values from the linear models using one or multiple features are plotted against the actual z-scores of the measured elongation rates to show the convergence of the prediction to the observation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Protein fractionation and western blot analysis</title><p>Chromatin bound and nucleoplasmic/cytoplasmic free proteins were extracted after treatment of pre-plated mES cells for 50 min with 300 nM FP, 500 nM Trp or 0.0125% DMSO as no Trp control.

In addition to the original reviews (see below), Reviewer 2 added the following comment:</p><p>Was there any evidence for premature termination (in addition to pausing) at any genes? 7-8' retention of RNAPII is a stable pause, but how short-lived would RNAPII be at prematurely terminated genes? The authors see little evidence for this, but have HERV-H gene transcripts (which are reportedly high in ESCs and make lots of long noncoding RNAs) been checked and show any evidence of termination? Benkirane's Cell paper found that there is termination and Drosha-mediated cleavage at those genes (but in HeLa cells). Cramer also saw little evidence of premature termination in yeast in his Nrd1 paper, but HIV-1 LTR and HERV genes are thought to do this. The existing data should be checked for HERV-H genes, but obviously for the authors to reach their conclusions it is not essential to do this.</p><p><italic>Reviewer</italic> <italic>1:</italic></p><p>This is a superb paper that should be published in <italic>eLife</italic>. In essence, the paper is simple, using GRO-seq to map Pol II on a genome-wide scale under conditions where transcriptional initiation or Pol II pausing are blocked by drugs (triptolide and flavopiridol, respectively). Of course, the validity of the study hinges on the specificity of the drugs, but both appear quite specific. Many conclusions of this paper have essentially been made previously; e.g., pausing as a general feature of Pol II transcription in mammals and other (but not all) organisms; stability of paused Pol II; gene-specific elongation rates; increased elongation speed at more distal position; effect of exons. However, what is particularly important about this paper is that it addresses all these fundamentally important issues in the most comprehensive, genome-wide form, and it doesn't use unusual inducing conditions. In addition, the use of the intronic RNA-seq data as a way of obtaining drug-independent data to support the conclusions is clever. Some of these important issues have been controversial or unclear in the literature, and the results here are as definitive as one could expect. So, while one could question whether the paper is truly novel, it represents a significant advance on a very important subject. The paper is generally well written, although some of the specific results and figures take some time to understand what has been really done.</p><p>1) The authors make the interesting observation that the decrease in Pol II association at downstream positions may be due to increased elongation rate as opposed to defective processivity due to low levels of premature termination. While I believe this conclusion for the physiological situations tested, the authors should mention that conditions that decrease elongation rate <italic>can</italic> cause the same effect; e.g., a slow Pol II, 6-AU, or inactivation of an elongation factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mason and Struhl, 2005</xref>).</p><p>2) The term “transition point” needs to be defined. I got the general idea, but not the definition.</p><p><italic>Reviewer</italic> <italic>2:</italic></p><p>This study provides a high-quality and quantitative assessment of transcription elongation rates in self-renewing mESCs from the Lis lab, inventors of the GRO-Seq technique. As generally is the case from this lab, the findings are interesting and conclusively supported, and should be of significant interest to the many investigators in this field. The main results provide strong support for numerous earlier studies arguing that elongation rates can vary significantly between genes, slow down through exonic regions, and correlates with CpG content and chromatin modifications like H3K79 methylation, while contradicting the idea that paused RNAPII complexes are rapidly terminated and replaced. The application of this technique to mouse stem cells is novel and well justified and will enrich existing datasets that for further studies seeking to correlate elongation rates with specific genic and epigenetic features.</p><p>One obvious limitation is the reliance on chemical inhibitors (FP and Trp) as surrogates for inactivation of Cdk9/P-TEFb and TFIIH, respectively. The authors should more fully acknowledge in the text that FP eliminates the expression of many short-lived proteins, including other transcription factors, which could affect these results, and that all of the conclusions are subject to potential off-targets effects of either drug. FP has a potent effect on histone modifications, not all of which have attributed to P-TEFb, and the authors should also address whether these changes would influence the elongation rates, which obviously had to be measured in the presence of the drugs.</p><p>In transformed cells FP induces cell cycle arrest and in some cases apoptosis – was there any effect on the cell cycle of these drugs in mESCs?</p><p>Kindly address how increased elongation rates correlate with increased H3K79me2 within long first exon, yet the highest elongation rates are measured at the 3' end of the genes, which are relatively lacking for H3K79me2?</p><p>The conclusion that paused RNAPII complexes are stable derives from their persistence for 7-8' after treatment with Trp, and leads the authors to conclude that premature termination is rare or undetectable in these cells – but it would be much more helpful to compare directly with a prematurely terminated gene – what did the paused complex look like at the highly active HERV-H element-containing, Drosha-sensitive, linkRNAs in these cells?</p><p>Because developmental lineage-specific genes in mESCs are not regulated by TFIIH, they may have distinct patterns of elongation, as may many signaling genes, and so the authors may want to stress that the 'universality' of their findings applies only to self-renewing ESCs.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02407.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Was there any evidence for premature termination (in addition to pausing) at any genes? 7-8' retention of RNAPII is a stable pause, but how short-lived would RNAPII be at prematurely terminated genes?

The existing data should be checked for HERV-H genes, but obviously for the authors to reach their conclusions it is not essential to do this</italic>.</p><p>We have addressed this interesting phenomenon in the mESC GRO-seq data we generated by looking at the specific genes found to have Drosha mediated cleavage and termination in HeLa cells by Wagschal et al. We have also looked at GRO-seq density profiles at HERV-H-like LTR repeats genome-wide to investigate the role of microprocessor and Xrn2 mediated termination within gene bodies in mESCs. The results of our additional analysis are discussed below in our response to the comments made by Reviewer 2.</p><p>Reviewer 1:</p><p><italic>1) The authors make the interesting observation that the decrease in Pol II association at downstream positions may be due to increased elongation rate as opposed to defective processivity due to low levels of premature termination. While I believe this conclusion for the physiological situations tested, the authors should mention that conditions that decrease elongation rate can cause the same effect; e.g., a slow Pol II, 6-AU, or inactivation of an elongation factor (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37"><italic>Mason and Struhl, 2005</italic></xref><italic>)</italic>.</p><p>We agree that this careful study by Mason &amp; Struhl should be acknowledged in this paper and have included references and a model comprising this work to the main text. We would like to point out that we looked at a model that fits the observations made by Mason &amp; Struhl in our Monte Carlo simulation. The mixed model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1C</xref> takes into account parameters that predict that elongation rates and processivity are both low near the 5’ end of genes, while both processivity and elongation rate increase as Pol II progresses into the gene body. The elongation rate acceleration pattern and Pol II density profile that we predict from this model does not fit well with the actual measurements we made of the density profile and elongation rates throughout the gene body, indicating that this model is not the best description of genic transcription in normal cells. However, as the Mason &amp; Struhl paper suggests, perturbation of either elongation rate or processivity by treating with 6-AU, or inactivation of an elongation factor could result in patterns of elongation rate and Pol II density as proposed by the mixed model.</p><p>Textual changes related to this comment: sentence beginning “The decreasing pattern of gene body Pol II density…” in the Results section entitled “Poll II stably elongates in the gene body, while termination is negligible”.</p><p><italic>2) The term “transition point” needs to be defined. I got the general idea, but not the definition</italic>.</p><p>We apologize for not clearly defining what transition points are in the text. The transition point is the middle of the inhibition wave from the affected to unaffected region within the gene body after Trp or FP treatment. We changed the text to make this clear in the manuscript as well (Results section entitled “Measuring the speed of elongating Pol II in the gene body”:</p><p>Reviewer 2:</p><p><italic>One obvious limitation is the reliance on chemical inhibitors (FP and Trp) as surrogates for inactivation of Cdk9/P-TEFb and TFIIH, respectively. The authors should more fully acknowledge in the text that FP eliminates the expression of many short-lived proteins, including other transcription factors, which could affect these results, and that all of the conclusions are subject to potential off-targets effects of either drug. FP has a potent effect on histone modifications, not all of which have attributed to P-TEFb, and the authors should also address whether these changes would influence the elongation rates, which obviously had to be measured in the presence of the drugs</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that this study relies on the specificity of the drugs FP and Trp. Therefore, when we set out to do the GRO-seq experiments we ensured that we were using the minimal effective concentration of each of these drugs by doing western blots on the fractions of chromatin bound and free Pol II before and after drug addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2</xref>), as well as ChIP-qPCR on the <italic>ActB</italic> gene to see what concentrations of FP and Trp clears Pol II from the gene body in a time dependent manner (not shown). We stress that both the concentration used for FP and Trp are at the lower spectrum of what is generally used for these drugs in the literature, reducing the risk of off-target effects. Furthermore, we use the drugs for short periods of time, 50 minutes is our longest timepoint, thereby minimizing secondary effects.</p><p>Even though we have taken considerable steps to perform the experiments at the minimal drug concentration possible, and measure within a relatively short period of time, we agree that the FP off-target effects may interfere with elongation, and therefore could hamper our elongation rate measurements. However, we would like to point out that we also measure elongation rates after Trp treatment. Trp blocks XPB helicase function, which is a vastly different mechanism of transcription inhibition compared to FP inhibition, and not likely to have similar potential off-target effects of FP. Although we could measure fewer transition points and elongation rates after treatment with Trp, the 683 transition points shared between the FP and Trp experiments did not differ significantly from one another, emphasizing that if there are off-target effects of FP that affect elongation rates, they are minor and within the error margins of our assay.</p><p>To address the reviewers concerns, we have made textual changes regarding the specificity of the drugs within the Results and Discussion sections:</p><p><italic>In transformed cells FP induces cell cycle arrest and in some cases apoptosis – was there any effect on the cell cycle</italic> <italic>of these drugs in mESCs?</italic></p><p>Although we did not specifically look for the effects of FP or Trp on the cell cycle or cell death, we imagine that they are significant upon prolonged treatment with either drug, considering that both shut down virtually all Pol II transcription. However, within the 50 minutes of our assay, the ES cells were morphologically indistinguishable from the untreated samples. Moreover, other studies have used FP as a drug to block Cdk9 function for an hour or more, and at higher concentrations, without reporting major problems with the cells such as apoptosis.</p><p>We added a sentence to the Results section clarifying this (“Furthermore, we ensured that drug treated mESCs were morphologically indistinguishable from untreated cells”).</p><p><italic>Kindly address how increased elongation rates correlate with increased H3K79me2 within long first exon, yet the highest elongation rates are measured</italic> <italic>at the 3' end of the genes, which are relatively lacking for H3K79me2?</italic></p><p>Based on our results we propose that both intrinsic and extrinsic factors determine Pol II elongation rate throughout the gene body. Intrinsic factors may consist of pausing factors that interact with the Pol II complex near the TSS and need to be removed or altered before the elongation complex reaches its full speed. This happens near the TSS, mostly within the first 15 kb of the gene body, based on the Pol II composite profiles and acceleration of Pol II within this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Extrinsic factors comprise the genic features within the gene body that don’t directly interact with Pol II, but that do exert an effect on its elongation rate, such as histone modifications and exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>To investigate what extrinsic features of DNA and chromatin could influence elongation rate we used the 938 mid elongation rates that were derived from the 12.5 to 25 min FP treatments. We used these elongation rates for two reasons: 1. This is the biggest group of elongation rates, providing the greatest statistical power, and 2. We only used elongation rates measured between these two timepoints for all genes to minimize the variation of intrinsic acceleration of Pol II in these genes. The average transition points after 12.5 or 25 min drug treatment are 7 and 30 kb respectively, which often coincides with the H3K79me2 enrichment with the first exon and intron. After exon 2, we saw a significant drop in H3K79me2 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), but this is often outside the region were elongation rates are measured. Therefore, H3K79me2 has a positive effect on elongation rate early in the gene independently of the intrinsic acceleration. Downstream of the 25 min transition point, the intrinsic acceleration of Pol II has completed, and additional positive effects on elongation rate by H3K79me2 may no longer be needed.</p><p>To clarify this in the text we made the following changes: “…to increase statistical power, and to rule out major effects of intrinsic acceleration in the comparison between elongation rates. Existing genome-wide data of transcription factors, chromatin modifiers, and chromatin modifications were used to detect determinants of elongation rate (see for full list of features <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref>)” was added to the Results section “Determinants of the elongation rates”.</p><p>“While CpG content is likely to exert effects throughout the gene, H3K79me2 is mostly enriched within exon and intron 1, indicating that this histone modification is beneficial to elongation early in the gene, while the elongation complex is still accelerating” was added to the last paragraph of the Results.</p><p><italic>The conclusion that paused RNAPII complexes are stable derives from their persistence for 7-8' after treatment with Trp, and leads the authors to conclude that premature termination is rare or undetectable in these cells – but it would be much more helpful to compare directly with a prematurely terminated</italic> <italic>gene – what did the paused complex look like at the highly active HERV-H element-containing, Drosha-sensitive, linkRNAs in these cells?</italic></p><p>We agree and investigated the examples of genes and the proposed LTR dependent termination within gene bodies reported in the literature independently. The Wagschal et al. paper concludes two major points. First, microprocessor directly targets Pol II on HIV and HERV-H at their promoter region. Second, endogenous genes containing HERV-H elements in the gene body can also be affected by microprocessor targeting the elongating nascent RNA and causing premature termination in the gene body.</p><p>Although this study was carried out in human cells, it is possible that the same mechanism govern in the mouse ES cells. But currently, Drosha target sites have not been identified genome-wide in mouse ES-cells. This made it difficult for us to decide which sites to examine for premature termination. However, one study has previously shown that mouse endogenous retrovirus can trigger premature Pol II termination in the gene body (Jingfeng Li et al. 2012). Therefore, we made use of this information to answer two questions. First we asked whether the dynamics of promoter proximal Pol II is influenced on the potential Drosha target genes. Second is whether the Pol II termination is a general mechanism, taking place on sites with endogenous retrovirus sequences.</p><p>For the first question, we looked at the genes that are proposed to be regulated by termination in HeLa cells by Wagschal et al. (Yif1B, Tex14, Ptp4a1, Pde4B, Hhla1 (HERV-H) and Dlgap1). We found that 3 out of 6 genes were actively transcribed in mESCs, and calculated decay rates and half times for the promoter proximal Pol II in these genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1A</xref>). Each decay rate of the actively transcribed putative Drosha target genes was within the normal distribution of decay rates reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> (half times for Yif1B, Tex14, and Ptp4a1 were 6.6, 6.7 and 5.5 min, respectively), making a model in which pausing is affected by Microprocessor and Xrn2 dependent termination unlikely in these genes. Therefore, we do not find evidence of rapid rounds of Pol II termination at these promoters.</p><p>For the second question, we identified the IAP LTR endogenous retrovirus elements proposed to trigger Pol II termination in the Li et al. paper, and examined the average GRO-seq profile relative to these sites. If there were general Pol II termination occurring, we expect to see a drop of GRO-seq density downstream of these sites. We did not find such a drop significantly different from the alignment bias pattern (‘mappability’) of the regions, suggesting that Pol II termination is not generally occurring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1B</xref>).</p><p>However, in the Polr1a gene discussed in the Li et al. paper, we observed the GRO-seq pattern indicative of premature nascent RNA cleavage and post-cleavage Pol II accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1C</xref>, black filled triangles) immediately downstream of the IAP LTR element (blue filled triangles). This is similar to the post poly-A accumulation of Pol II (black empty triangles). One possibility is that this Pol II accumulation originates from novel transcription initiation at the highly repeated region of the IAP LTR element. However, the fact that the accumulation of Pol II at this region is not resolved by FP treatment shows that the initiation site is distant, likely the promoter of the Polr1a gene, not a site inside the IAP LTR element. Although the precise mechanism cannot be determined for now, we believe this could be a case of microprocessor dependent Pol II termination specifically happening at this site.</p><p>Overall, we conclude that premature termination in the gene body is not a general mechanism, but rather an exceptional case depending on sequence specific sites that can recruit microprocessor complex to the nascent RNA. Because this one possible case of termination that we uncovered does not change our conclusions, we prefer not to address this complicated site-directed phenomenon in this already lengthy manuscript.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>LTR.</title><p>A.

In this paper, Tee et al. find, among other interesting results, that Erk2 kinase activity replaces TFIIH function at a number of developmental lineage genes, as tested by looking in mESCs at the effects of 30 min of 1 µM Trp treatment on developmental and mESC specific genes with ChIP-qPCR on the Ser5 phosphorylated CTD of Pol II. Interestingly, developmental genes were unaffected by Trp treatment, indicating a TFIIH independent initiation mechanism. We were unable to find the datasets generated for this paper (the reported SRA accession number SPR028688 did not retrieve any data in various databases), making it difficult to assess the Erk kinase, Ercc3 and Ser5 and total Pol II ChIP-seq data ourselves. Therefore, we used the Ser5, Ser2 and N-terminal Pol II ChIP-seq datasets generated by Rahl et al. (Cell, 2010), as well as our own GRO-seq datasets, before and after 25 min Trp treatment to best mimic the 30 min Trp treatment used by Tee et al., to look at the patterns of expression of the genes insensitive to Trp. Surprisingly, we could not reproduce the results reported by Tee et al. All actively transcribed genes reported as being insensitive to Trp treatment by Tee et al. were clearly inhibited by 25 min Trp treatment in our study, or not actively transcribed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 2</xref> and data not shown).</p><p>To understand the discrepancy between the two studies, we considered a number of differences between the Tee et al. experiments and our own. Firstly, the genetic background and growth conditions for the cell lines used in both papers may not be identical (we used V6.5 whereas the mESCs strain used in Tee et al. was not clearly stated). Thus, strain and growth condition differences could result in variation in gene expression. Indicative of this potential difference in gene expression, in our study and that of the Young lab, the Trp insensitive developmental genes were far less transcribed in V6.5 mESCs compared to the control genes Klf2 and Trim28 (transcribed ∼10 x higher as measured by ChIP- and GRO-seq, note the y-axes for each browser shot). In contrast, the level of transcription for these genes as measured by Pol II-Ser5 ChIP-qPCR in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> of Tee et al. appears within the same order of magnitude for both control and Trp insensitive developmental genes, indicating that these genes are similarly active in the mESCs used in their experiment.</p><p>Alternatively, the antibody used in the Tee et al. study may target a different form of Pol II than detected in the GRO- and ChIP-seq data shown in the figure describing TFIIH sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 2</xref>, below). This also is suggested by the Pol II-Ser5 ChIP-seq pattern of the browser shots shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> of the Tee et al. paper. The Ser5-Pol II signal looks strikingly different than total Pol II patterns, while these forms of Pol II tend to overlap in other studies, and with GRO-seq patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 2</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rahl et al. 2010</xref>; Hintermair et al. 2012)), indicating that there may be an alternative form of Pol II detected in the Tee et al. paper. Regardless of the form of Pol II detected by Tee et al., the active and engaged Pol II that is detected by GRO-seq at these poorly transcribed developmental genes is susceptible to TFIIH inhibition and block of initiation by 25 min Trp treatment in V6.5 mESCs.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>TFIIH sensitivity.</title><p>The genes assayed by ChIP-qPCR of Ser5 phosphorylated Pol II in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> of Tee et al.

The y-axis for the GRO-seq data is in red and blue also and identical for both GRO-seq datasets, but different from the ChIP-seq y-axis due to different normalization done with Spike-in control instead of total reads as with ChIP-seq.

Note that the Trp sensitive control genes Klf2 and Trim28 are over ∼10x higher expressed than the Trp “insensitive” developmental genes. The expression as measured by both GRO- and ChIP-seq of the HoxC5 and T genes was negligible.
