size have been reported. Here, we investigated how a satellite from <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>, phage-inducible chromosomal island-like element (PLE), remodels the capsid it has been predicted to steal from the phage ICP1 (Netter et al., 2021). We identified that a PLE-encoded protein, TcaP, is both necessary and sufficient to form small capsids during ICP1 infection. Interestingly, we found that PLE is dependent on small capsids for efficient transduction of its genome, making it the first satellite to have this requirement. ICP1 isolates that escaped TcaP-mediated remodeling acquired substitutions in the coat protein, suggesting an interaction between these two proteins. With a procapsid-like particle (PLP) assembly platform in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, we demonstrated that TcaP is a bona fide scaffold that regulates the assembly of small capsids. Further, we studied the structure of PLE PLPs using cryogenic electron microscopy and found that TcaP is an external scaffold that is functionally and somewhat structurally similar to the external scaffold, Sid, encoded by the unrelated satellite P4 (Kizziah et al., 2020). Finally, we showed that TcaP is largely conserved across PLEs. Together, these data support a model in which TcaP directs the assembly of small capsids comprised of ICP1 coat proteins, which inhibits the complete packaging of the ICP1 genome and permits more efficient packaging of replicated PLE genomes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>phage</kwd><kwd>satellite</kwd><kwd>capsid</kwd><kwd>scaffold</kwd><kwd>transduction</kwd><kwd><italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Viruses</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI127652</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Seed</surname><given-names>Kimberley D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM110185</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Parent</surname><given-names>Kristin N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM140803</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Parent</surname><given-names>Kristin N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM116789</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Parent</surname><given-names>Kristin N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM132022</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boyd</surname><given-names>Caroline M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018257700</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dunham</surname><given-names>Drew T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1750125</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Parent</surname><given-names>Kristin N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A phage parasite encodes an external scaffolding protein to pirate and rearrange phage-encoded coat proteins to more efficiently transfer the phage parasite genome to new hosts and limit phage production.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Like the parasitism of bacteria by the phages that infect them, phages are parasitized by mobile genetic elements termed phage satellites. Satellites continue to be discovered across bacterial species and, despite the independent evolution of these elements, common themes have emerged (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Sousa et al., 2022</xref>). Universally, satellites are integrated genetic elements that are dependent on infection by a helper phage for their lifecycle. Helper phage infection triggers satellitesâ genome excision and replication. Following genome replication, satellites parasitize the helper phagesâ structural components and selectively package satellite genomes into proteinaceous shells comprised of coat proteins, called capsids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Christie and Dokland, 2012</xref>). The piracy of essential phage structural proteins affords the phage satellites the luxury of reducing their coding capacity and, therefore, their genome size. As such, satellitesâ genomes can be packaged into smaller capsids compared to their helper phages. In all documented cases, the satellite encodes a strategy to direct the assembly of small capsids, a mechanism that excludes the complete packaging of the larger helper phage genome but permits the complete packaging of the smaller phage satellite genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shore et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Damle et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hawkins et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alqurainy et al., 2022</xref>). After the attachment of tails, also pirated from the helper phage, the mature virions harboring the satellite genome are released from the cell. Here, they transduce and integrate the satellite genome into neighboring susceptible bacteria.</p><p>Phage-inducible chromosomal island-like elements (PLEs) are satellites of the lytic <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> phage ICP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">OâHara et al., 2017</xref>). PLEs are one of four families of phage satellites that have been identified to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Sousa et al., 2022</xref>). In addition to their specificity to <italic>V. cholerae</italic> and unique complete inhibition of their helper phage, PLEs stand apart from other satellites in their genetic composition. They encode genes with similar functions, but without sequence identity, to those in other satellites. To date, 10 genetically distinct but related PLEs have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angermeyer et al., 2021</xref>), with PLE1 being the most well studied. PLEs, like other satellites, have a smaller genome (~18 kb) than the phage they parasitize, ICP1 (~125 kb), and are dependent on their helper for excision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McKitterick and Seed, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nguyen et al., 2022</xref>), replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barth et al., 2020</xref>), and virion production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Netter et al., 2021</xref>). PLE1 has been shown to produce virions with small ~50-nm-wide capsids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), while ICP1 produces virions with large ~80-nm-wide capsids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Based on similarities to other capsid-remodeling satellites and the evidence that depletion of ICP1âs coat protein by CRISPRi during infection results in reduced PLE transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Netter et al., 2021</xref>), it is hypothesized that PLE capsids are comprised of ICP1 coat proteins. However, the mechanism that PLE1 uses to achieve this capsid remodeling has yet to be explored.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Phage-inducible chromosomal island-like element (PLE) encodes an inhibitory protein, TcaP, which modifies ICP1âs capsid assembly process to produce small capsids.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Representative transmission electron micrographs (TEMs) from three independent biological replicates show (<bold>A</bold>) PLE virions have small, ~50-nm-wide capsids and long contractile tails while.

Procapsids are the empty shell capsid precursors into which DNA is packaged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Steven et al., 2005</xref>). Procapsid size, referred to by a T number (which corresponds to the number of triangular structural units within a face of an icosahedron and largely represents the size of the capsid), and assembly are regulated by scaffolding proteins that guide coat proteins into their correct orientation around the pre-formed portal complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">King and Casjens, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dokland, 1999</xref>). These capsid scaffolds can either be separately encoded proteins or contained within a domain of the coat protein, as is seen in the phage HK97 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Prevelige et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Duda et al., 1995</xref>). So, to alter the size of the capsids, satellites must regulate the size of the procapsid.</p><p>Highlighting the convergent evolution across unique satellite families, four distinct strategies to produce small capsids have been characterized. Two representatives from different families of satellites exploit the role of scaffolds in the capsid assembly process to promote the formation of smaller capsids. First, some of the <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> pathogenicity islands (SaPIs) encode an alternative internal scaffold, CpmB, that binds to the helper phageâs coat proteins inside of the assembling procapsid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dearborn et al., 2017</xref>). CpmB increases procapsid curvature, resulting in the smaller procapsid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dearborn et al., 2017</xref>). The second example of capsid remodeling was described in the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> phage satellite, P4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shore et al., 1978</xref>). Analogous to the satellite-encoded scaffold from SaPIs, P4 encodes an alternative scaffold, Sid, that functions to regulate assembly of the smaller procapsid; however, Sid binds to the outside of the procapsid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kizziah et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Marvik et al., 1995</xref>). Sid proteins form an external cage around the helper phageâs coat proteins which promotes the assembly of the small procapsids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kizziah et al., 2020</xref>). An alternative strategy to redirect capsid size is found in a subfamily of SaPIs, including SaPIbov5, which encodes a homolog of their helper phageâs coat protein that exclusively forms the pentamers while the helper phageâs coat proteins form the hexamers of the small capsid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hawkins et al., 2021</xref>). These coat proteins encode their scaffolds within a domain of the coat, like HK97 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hawkins et al., 2021</xref>). Exactly how the satellite-derived coat pentamers promote the assembly of small icosahedral capsids instead of the larger prolate capsid of the helper is not fully understood. The last characterized strategy used by satellites to make small capsids was recently discovered in the aptly named capsid-forming phage-inducible chromosomal islands (cfPICIs), which avoid altering the assembly of their helper phage capsids by instead encoding their own structural components of the capsid and stealing only the phage tails to construct satellite virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alqurainy et al., 2022</xref>). Interestingly, despite the divergence in capsid remodeling strategies, there is convergence on capsid size where each satellite assembles icosahedral capsids with 240 subunits, or T = 4 capsids. PLEâs small capsids are similar in size to these T = 4 capsids but PLE does not encode obvious homologs of CpmB or Sid nor capsid homologs, making it unclear how capsid remodeling is achieved in this divergent satellite. Notably, other helper phages have similar genome sizes, ~30â45 kb, while ICP1 has a significantly larger genome, ~125 kb and is the only known helper packaged into T = 13 capsids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boyd et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Depelteau et al., 2022</xref>). This may suggest that PLE uses a unique mechanism to remodel the ICP1 coat proteins into the smaller ~50-nm-wide PLE-sized capsids made from a considerably smaller number of subunits.</p><p>Here, we studied how PLE remodels the ICP1 capsid. We found a PLE-encoded protein that has an essential role in making small capsids, named TcaP for its <italic>t</italic>iny <italic>cap</italic>sid phenotype. TcaPâs activity was necessary and sufficient to make small capsids, which inhibited the production of infectious ICP1 virions and increased the efficiency of PLE transduction. We studied TcaPâs mechanism of capsid remodeling using a heterologous procapsid-like particle (PLP) assembly platform in <italic>E. coli</italic> and cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). These data revealed TcaP as an external scaffolding protein that directs the assembly of ICP1 coat proteins into small, PLE-sized capsids. Finally, we analyzed the known PLE variants and found TcaP is largely conserved in PLEs. Our work uncovered the mechanism of capsid remodeling in the phage satellite PLE and provides the first example of small capsid production benefiting satellite transduction.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PLE encodes a single gene product, TcaP, that is necessary and sufficient to direct the assembly of small capsids</title><p>Given the observation that PLE virions have smaller capsids than ICP1 virions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>), we hypothesized that PLE encodes a single protein responsible for assembling these smaller capsids. The generation of small capsids would limit the amount of DNA that could be accommodated within the capsids and block the complete packaging of the larger ICP1 genome, reducing ICP1 plaquing. In line with this prediction, other satellitesâ proteins that redirect capsid assembly are inhibitory to their helper phages for this reason (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shore et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Damle et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carpena et al., 2016</xref>). Using this logic and PLE1 as the representative PLE, we identified one candidate PLE protein, TcaP (previously Orf17 (AGG09411.1)), as a putative capsid remodeling protein.</p><p>First, we used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to evaluate the morphology of virions produced after a single round of ICP1 infection in a PLE(-) <italic>V. cholerae</italic> strain expressing <italic>tcaP</italic> from a plasmid (p<italic>tcaP</italic>). Lysates collected from the p<italic>tcaP</italic> host showed an abundance of small, ~50-nm-round particles reminiscent of PLE-sized procapsids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Rarer particles in these samples resembled virions produced from a PLE(+) infection with small capsids and attached tails, though apparently lacking DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). In comparison, many virions produced from the empty vector control were ICP1-sized virions with large capsids, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Other particles observed in the control samples were full ICP1 capsids without tails, empty ICP1 procapsids, or empty expanded capsids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Importantly, these data demonstrate that <italic>tcaP</italic> expression during ICP1 infection, in the absence of other PLE-encoded products, results in the production of small capsids.</p><p>In agreement with the expectation that small capsid formation would be inhibitory to ICP1, p<italic>tcaP</italic> inhibited ICP1 plaque formation by 100-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Rare plaques isolated on the p<italic>tcaP</italic> strain were picked and serially propagated on the restrictive strain. Two escape phages were whole-genome sequenced, and each harbored a single nonsynonymous mutation in the gene encoding the coat protein, resulting in substitutions R223H or E234K (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Substitutions at unique but proximal positions in coat protein from independent escape phages suggest that TcaP interacts with the coat protein, an expected feature of TcaPâs predicted role as a capsid remodeling protein. Collectively, these genetic escapes, coupled with TcaPâs inhibition of ICP1 plaquing, which is accompanied by the production of small capsids, strongly support that TcaP is a capsid remodeling protein.</p><p>Expression of TcaP during ICP1 infection was sufficient to redirect capsid size, but other capsid remodeling satellites have been shown to use either a single protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shore et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carpena et al., 2016</xref>) or two proteins that act in concert to direct small capsid assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Damle et al., 2012</xref>).

Importantly, <italic>tcaP</italic> is dispensable for PLE-mediated inhibition of ICP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hays and Seed, 2020</xref>), indicating that the increase in capsid size in the absence of TcaP is specific to its role in capsid-size redirection and not a result of ICP1 escaping PLE. These data demonstrate that TcaP is necessary for PLEâs redirection of ICP1 coat protein into small capsids and that PLE does not encode a redundant mechanism for capsid remodeling.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>TcaP is the only phage-inducible chromosomal island-like element (PLE)-encoded factor necessary for directing small capsid assembly, which is required for efficient PLE transduction.</title><p>(<bold>AâC</bold>) Representative transmission electron micrographs (TEMs) from three independent biological replicates of lysate from ICP1-infected strains of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> with wild type PLE or PLEâ<italic>tcaP,</italic> as indicated, carrying either the empty vector (EV) or a vector expressing TcaP (<italic>tcaP</italic>).

TcaP expression results in the formation of small capsids during ICP1 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), which suggests that it has scaffolding activity. However, it is possible that TcaP does not act directly on the coat proteins as a scaffold, but rather interferes with ICP1âs capsid morphogenesis pathway in some way that decreases capsid size. To directly address if TcaP is a scaffold, we set up a heterologous PLP assembly platform in <italic>E. coli</italic> similar to those previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Spilman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cerritelli and Studier, 1996</xref>). Briefly, we co-expressed ICP1âs coat and putative scaffolds from either ICP1 or PLE and monitored the production of PLPs. By adding a C-terminal six-histidine (6xHis) tag to the coat protein, we were able to purify coat-containing complexes by affinity chromatography, examine their protein content by SDS-PAGE/Coomassie staining, and their morphology by TEM. First, as a control, coat::6xHis (referred to as âcoatâ for simplicity) was expressed and purified. The coat proteins eluted as complexes, but they were irregular in size and shape, often forming spirals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>), as is expected for coat proteins in the absence of scaffolds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dokland, 1999</xref>). As a second control, we confirmed that ICP1âs putative scaffold could assemble coat proteins into uniform, ICP1-sized PLPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The presence of scaffold in these PLPs was supported by SDS-PAGE analysis in which we observed a band corresponding to the predicted size of the scaffold (39.3 kDa), indicating, as expected, that the scaffold co-eluted with coat-containing complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A2</xref>). Interestingly, two smaller bands of approximately 23 and 17 kDa also appeared in these samples. The size of these bands is consistent with the cleavage of the scaffold resulting in two fragments. As scaffolds are generally not a part of the mature capsid, they are removed from the procapsid by self-cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Robertson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang et al., 2008</xref>) or cleavage by a protease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Duda et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huet et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, in the presence of protease inhibitors during purification, these bands were not observed, but the same-sized particles were produced, suggesting that scaffold cleavage is not a prerequisite for assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). Analysis of ICP1 PLPs by mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) further supported the presence of ICP1âs putative scaffold (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

To test whether TcaP requires ICP1âs scaffold to produce small PLPs, we co-expressed coat with either just TcaP or with both TcaP and ICP1âs scaffold simultaneously. First, analysis of the stained SDS-PAGE gel following co-expression of coat and TcaP showed that TcaP bound to coat and was co-eluted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A3</xref>). TEMs showed that TcaP was sufficient to assemble ICP1âs coat into PLPs that were homogenously PLE-sized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). These data demonstrate that TcaP has scaffolding activity for ICP1âs coat protein and that it does not require additional factors to assemble small PLPs. Next, we constructed a plasmid expressing the scaffold and the coat as they occur natively in ICP1âs genome downstream of one of the promoters. Here, the gene <italic>gp123</italic> is present between the scaffold and coat and predicted to encode for the decoration protein. The putative decoration protein was not expected to be incorporated into the PLPs as decoration proteins are typically added after genome packaging, and capsid expansion exposes their binding site, as has been shown for phage Lambda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lander et al., 2012</xref>). In line with this, the stained gel of the resulting purified ICP1-sized PLPs indicated that while the ICP1 scaffold co-eluted with coat-containing complexes as expected, the decoration protein was produced but not incorporated into the assembled particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, when we co-expressed ICP1 coat, decoration, and scaffold along with TcaP, we did not observe any large particles, suggesting that TcaP is dominant over ICP1âs scaffold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). SDS-PAGE analyses of particles produced in the presence of ICP1âs scaffold and TcaP confirmed the presence of TcaP as well as the phage-encoded scaffold and its cleavage products, suggesting that TcaP does not block the incorporation of ICP1âs scaffold into procapsids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A5</xref>). This experiment was repeated in the presence of protease inhibitors which eliminated the ICP1 scaffold cleavage products but reproduced the small particle morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2B</xref>). Collectively, these data demonstrate scaffolding activity for both ICP1âs scaffold and PLEâs TcaP and show that TcaP can assemble small PLPs in the absence or presence of ICP1âs scaffold.</p><p>Having observed that TcaP is sufficient to make small PLPs in the heterologous assembly platform as well as when expressed from a plasmid during ICP1 infection, we next tested coat<sup>R223H</sup> and coat<sup>E234K</sup>, the previously identified in vivo genetic escapes of TcaP activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), in the assembly platform. The coat<sup>E234K</sup> variant was not assembly competent in our heterologous assembly platform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3âfigure supplement 4</xref>), so we only continued with the coat<sup>R223H</sup> variant. As expected, in the absence of any scaffolding proteins, coat<sup>R223H</sup> formed similar spiral complexes as those observed with the wild type coat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). These data demonstrate that the R223H substitution does not compromise the proteinâs ability to bind to itself, nor does the substitution provide a means for the coat to form PLPs independent of a scaffold. Next, we expressed coat<sup>R223H</sup> with TcaP, anticipating we would observe the formation of large ICP1-sized PLPs because this substitution was sufficient for ICP1 to avoid TcaPâs inhibitory activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Unexpectedly, TcaP still directed the assembly of small PLPs comprised of coat<sup>R223H</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). However, TcaP was not robustly evident in the purified complexes as assessed by SDS-PAGE, and some particles were spirals, similar to those seen when the coat is expressed without a scaffold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). These data suggest that TcaPâs scaffolding activity was partially compromised when the coat protein carried the R223H substitution. We hypothesized that with ICP1âs scaffold the coat<sup>R223H</sup> proteins could be assembled into ICP1-sized PLPs. Leveraging the dual expression from a single promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A4</xref>), we confirmed that the ICP1 scaffold alone directed the assembly of ICP1-sized PLPs with coat<sup>R223H</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>), but we observed a mix of PLE and ICP1-sized PLPs following addition of TcaP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). We can attribute this phenotype to the substitution in the coat and not to the presence of protease inhibitors used during the purification as the addition of protease inhibitors during purification of the coat<sup>wild type</sup> co-expressed with the ICP1 scaffold and TcaP resulted in only small PLPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2B</xref>). These data suggest that the R223H substitution in ICP1âs coat can only partially escape TcaP-mediated small capsid formation, but in vivo this level of escape is sufficient to allow for approximately equal levels of viable progeny production as is seen in the absence of TcaP.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Cryo-EM reveals TcaP is an external scaffold</title><p>The data obtained from the assembly of PLPs in <italic>E. coli</italic> demonstrate that TcaP has scaffolding activity; however, these data do not distinguish between TcaP acting as an internal or an external scaffold. Therefore, we validated the protein content of PLE PLPs produced from co-expression of TcaP and coat by LC-MS/MS and subjected them to cryo-EM. As anticipated, LC-MS/MS confirmed PLE PLPs were comprised of coat and TcaP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Representative micrographs from negatively stained samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and vitrified particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) show a distinctly bumpy surface on the PLE PLPs, suggestive of external proteins. A total of 379,643 particles were used for icosahedral reconstruction of the PLE PLP particle, with a final resolution of 3.4 Ã (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The external density of the PLPs corresponded to TcaP, demonstrating that it functions as an external scaffold. Internal density was assigned to coat proteins with a canonical HK97-like fold, which exist as pentamers and hexamers within the 48 nm, T = 4 icosahedral PLP. We used AlphaFold2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>) to predict the structures of the coat protein and TcaP, which were fitted into density from the cryo-EM and aided in modeling nearly all of the coat protein and approximately half of TcaP (residues 34â172) for which only a few side chains could be modeled. As expected, the A-domains of the coat proteins were centered in both pentamers and hexamers. TcaP dimers meet and form trimeric interactions at the threefold axes between hexamers. Broadly, the reconstruction of PLE PLPs shows TcaP functions as an external scaffold and provides context for how TcaPâs higher-order structure regulates the number of coat proteins that can be accommodated within the assembling PLP.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) reveals TcaP is an external scaffold.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Representative micrographs from three independent biological replicates from (<bold>A</bold>) transmission electron and (<bold>B</bold>) cryo-electron microscopy of phage-inducible chromosomal island-like element (PLE) procapsid-like particle (PLPs) produced from co-expression of ICP1âs coat and PLEâs TcaP.

Both residues are found in the A-domain which is oriented near the center of the hexamer where TcaP binds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The arginines at position 223 were clearly visible in the map. Due to the twofold symmetry in the hexamer, there are identical interactions between each half of the hexamer and the TcaP dimer. Importantly, there are three distinct interactions between TcaP and R223 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). First, R223 from coat<sub>D</sub> is in proximity to TcaPâs residues 87â93, while coat<sub>B</sub> has R223 positioned near TcaPâs residues 63â70, and R223 from coat<sub>C</sub> lies close to the second TcaP subunit. In this third interaction, the negatively charged aspartic acid at position 218 from the coat coordinates with the positive charges from the arginine residues from coat (R223) and TcaP (R133) and creates a salt bridge with residues measuring less than 4 Ã apart.

The side chain for the other residue substituted in the escape phage, E234, could not be confidently modeled, but its localization within the capsid is outside of the TcaP binding region. The exact nature of E234 is not yet clear, but perhaps it has a role in stabilizing the A-domain. Together, these data support the conclusion that ICP1 escapes TcaPâs scaffolding activity by altering the coat to affect TcaPâs binding site.</p><p>If ICP1 is under selective pressure to escape PLE-mediated capsid remodeling in nature, ICP1 isolates could be expected to harbor these coat substitutions.

Given the conservation of full-length <italic>tcaP</italic> alleles in other PLEs, and the structural data highlighting interactions between the TcaP<sup>PLE1</sup> with ICP1âs coat proteins, we assessed if the truncated TcaP<sup>PLE5</sup> was functional to redirect ICP1 virion assembly.</p><p>To start, we generated PLE particles from the wild type PLE5 strain carrying an empty vector and assessed their morphology by TEM. We found the PLE5 virions did not have small capsids, but rather they had large, ICP1-size capsids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), similar to virions from the PLE1â<italic>tcaP</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Consistent with this, when we directly addressed the scaffolding activity of the truncated allele by expressing it <italic>in trans</italic> during ICP1 infection and assessing plaque formation, we found that unlike p<italic>tcaP</italic><sup>PLE1</sup>, which inhibited ICP1 plaquing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), p<italic>tcaP</italic><sup>PLE5</sup> did not inhibit ICP1 plaque formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), supporting the conclusion that TcaP<sup>PLE5</sup> is not a functional scaffold. The reconstruction of the PLE1 PLPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) revealed residues 63â70 in TcaP<sup>PLE1</sup> that specifically contact coat<sub>B</sub>. That region is notably lacking from the truncated TcaP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). Further, we predict that a TcaP protein missing 79 amino acids would not be long enough to form the scaffolding cage around an assembling T = 4 procapsid explaining the lack of scaffolding activity for this TcaP variant.</p><p>Next, we addressed the transduction efficiency of PLE5 since the efficiency of PLE1âs transduction decreased in the absence of TcaP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), demonstrating an advantage to packaging the PLE genome into smaller capsids. Previous work reported similar transduction efficiency for PLEs1-5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">OâHara et al., 2017</xref>), and we recapitulated those results here, showing that PLE5 has only a subtle, approximately twofold decrease in transduction efficiency relative to PLE1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). As this seemed in conflict with the PLE1â<italic>tcaP</italic> data, where there was over a tenfold decrease in PLE1 transduction without TcaP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), we directly examined the effect of small capsid production on PLE5 transduction by expressing TcaP<sup>PLE1</sup> <italic>in trans</italic>. First, we confirmed that p<italic>tcaP</italic><sup>PLE1</sup> in PLE5(+) <italic>V. cholerae</italic> during ICP1 infection directed the assembly of small capsids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), which supported our hypothesis that the unmodified capsids produced by PLE5 are the result of this PLE encoding a nonfunctional TcaP allele. Next, we found that PLE5 transduction increased with p<italic>tcaP</italic><sup>PLE1</sup>, exceeding the transduction efficiency of PLE5 and PLE1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). This result suggests that the capacity for transduction is different for PLE1 and PLE5, but still nonetheless demonstrates that small capsids promote PLE transduction.</p><p>Since both PLE1 and PLE5 transduction efficiency was higher when small capsids were made, this raised the question of PLE5âs maintenance in the <italic>V. cholerae</italic> population while lacking a functional scaffold. A recent analysis of sequenced <italic>V. cholerae</italic> isolates outlined a pattern where a PLE variant emerges, often rises to dominance, then is replaced by a different variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angermeyer et al., 2021</xref>). This pattern revealed that after its dominance from before 1960 until its disappearance in 1991 (for which there are 21 <italic>V</italic>. <italic>cholerae</italic> isolates harboring identical PLE5 sequences), PLE5 re-emerged in 2016 and 2017. Genetic drift within a given PLE variant appears to be very rare: a particular PLE variant is typically 100% conserved at the nucleotide level across the entire mobile genetic element despite residing in different isolates of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">OâHara et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McKitterick et al., 2019</xref>). However, on rare occasions, single-nucleotide polymorphisms between the same PLE variant are found in different <italic>V. cholerae</italic> isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barth et al., 2021</xref>). Strikingly, the <italic>tcaP</italic><sup>PLE5</sup> sequence from 2017 showed a 14-nucleotide insertion which restored a full-length <italic>tcaP</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). The re-establishment of the full-length <italic>tcaP</italic> allele in the contemporary PLE5, along with the preservation of full-length alleles in other PLEs, supports conservation of TcaP for its role in capsid remodeling to promote PLE transduction and inhibit ICP1.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this work, we characterized the mechanism of capsid remodeling in the phage-satellite system ICP1-PLE. We identified a PLE-encoded scaffold, TcaP, and demonstrated its necessity and sufficiency to redirect the assembly of ICP1âs coat proteins into small capsids. Using a heterologous assembly system and cryo-EM, we discovered that TcaP functions as an external scaffold that assembles into a cage-like structure around the procapsid, favoring the smaller T = 4 morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We found that TcaP is conserved in all PLEs. Further, TcaP-mediated small capsid assembly is advantageous to PLE as the production of small capsids leads to more efficient transduction of PLEâs genome, a unique feature not seen in other headful packaging capsid-remodeling satellites. The data presented here further highlight similarities between PLE and other satellites while underscoring features that make PLE unique.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model of TcaP-mediated small capsid assembly.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A cartoon model of ICP1 infecting a PLE(+) <italic>V. cholerae</italic> cell.

However, the structure of PLE PLPs showed molecular details of the TcaP-coat interactions and revealed a striking resemblance to that of PLPs formed by the <italic>E. coli</italic> phage P2 coat protein (GpN), scaffold (GpO), and satellite P4 external scaffold (Sid) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kizziah et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Despite the low sequence conservation between the ICP1 and P2 coat proteins (20% identity), both have an HK97-like fold and are assembled into T = 4 icosahedral procapsids measuring ~45 nm in diameter in the presence of their satellite-encoded external scaffolds. TcaP and Sid also share ~20% amino acid identity; however, TcaP is 53 amino acids longer than Sid. TcaP, like Sid, assembles into long filaments that form dimers that span the twofold axes and trimers of dimers meeting at the threefold axes of the procapsid. Given how TcaP and Sid interact with themselves to form dimers and trimers wherein hexamers are linked to each other by the length of TcaP or Sid dimers, it is not surprising how the resulting scaffold cage accommodates only procapsids with T = 4 symmetry. Additional hexamers would not be accommodated within the cage formed by the external scaffolds, and thus the capsid is blocked from forming higher T number structures. Despite their similarities, TcaP and Sid differ in their specific interactions with the coat proteins. Unlike Sid, which only contacts two proteins in the hexamer (both GpN<sub>B</sub> subunits), both TcaP monomers form interactions with three coat subunits, thus contacting all six coat subunits. TcaP and Sid also differ in their tertiary structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>), further demonstrating the convergent evolution of the external scaffold capsid-remodeling strategy in divergent satellites.</p><p>Few external scaffolds have been described in viruses, and thus there are open questions about their role in capsid assembly, especially in relation to internal scaffolds. Outside of P4 and PLE, the only other identified external scaffolds are those in the ssDNA phages of the Microviridae family. A representative phage, Î¦X174, requires an external scaffold (protein D) to form procapsids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dokland et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hafenstein and Fane, 2002</xref>); however, the structure of this protein is different from TcaP and Sid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cherwa et al., 2011</xref>). Unlike the trimers formed by the satellite scaffolds, protein D seems to form tetramers in solution and directs the assembly of the coat proteins into an ~27-nm-wide procapsid, despite the lack of direct coatâscaffold interactions. Notably, the small Î¦X174 capsids still require an internal scaffold for assembly. Similarly, P4 is dependent on P2âs internal scaffold (GpO) to form viable progeny virions, likely because the internal scaffold is important for the incorporation of the portal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang et al., 2008</xref>). Curiously, SaPIbov1, a satellite which uses an alternative internal scaffold to direct assembly of small capsids, also requires 80Î±âs internal scaffold (Gp46) for viable satellite virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Spilman et al., 2012</xref>), likely for a similar reason. PLEs do not appear to encode portal proteins and thus we anticipate that PLE would similarly be dependent on ICP1 portal incorporation for progeny production. In the heterologous assembly assay, we show that TcaPâs scaffolding activity is dominant over ICP1âs scaffold, such that the resulting particles are satellite-sized in the presence of both scaffolds. These data suggest that if PLE depended on ICP1âs scaffold for portal incorporation, TcaPâs scaffolding activity would still be sufficient to direct the assembly of small capsids. As the portal was not included in the PLP assays here, it will be useful for future studies to directly address this requirement and to assess the complete protein makeup of PLE procapsids produced during ICP1 infection of PLE(+) <italic>V. cholerae</italic> to validate what PLE and ICP1 components comprise the procapsids.</p><p>Like ICP1 escaping TcaP activity, P2 can escape Sid-mediated capsid remodeling through point substitutions in the coat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kizziah et al., 2020</xref>). Both of the two escape substitutions we identified in ICP1 lies in the A-domain, in the center of the hexamer across the twofold axis of symmetry where TcaP binds and one residue directly contacts TcaP. The A-domain has been implicated in regulating capsid size and assembly in many viral systems (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Suhanovsky and Teschke, 2015</xref>). Similarly, the five suppressor substitutions that have been identified in P2âs coat protein lie in the hexamer along Sidâs binding site, but they lie slightly outside of the A-domain and are instead at the end of the P-loop. Three substitutions are in residues that directly contact Sid, like R223 in TcaP. The other two residues in P2âs coat likely function through other means to disrupt the interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kizziah et al., 2020</xref>), as is probably the case for the second substitution seen in ICP1, E234K. Curiously, the PLP assembly data showed that the coat<sup>R223H</sup> only partially escaped TcaP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) while this substitution was sufficient in vivo to escape TcaPâs inhibition of plaque formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). These inconsistencies can likely be explained by the lack of the additional components that comprise PLE native procapsids in our assembly platform, as well as the relative protein concentrations and dynamic regulation that occurs during infection. However, despite the selection for phages that escape TcaP-mediated remodeling in the laboratory, no mutations in the A-domain exist in the current collection of 67 sequenced isolates of ICP1. Perhaps the mutations are not selected for in nature because the biophysical properties of these coat variants are incompatible with assembly in the natural conditions of the human gut or in estuaries where <italic>V. cholerae</italic> and ICP1 reside. In line with this hypothesis, one of the coat mutants we tested, coat<sup>E234K</sup>, was not assembly competent in the heterologous assembly system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3âfigure supplement 4</xref>), likely due to its predicted role in stabilizing the coat protein. Moreover, PLE is severely inhibitory to ICP1, employing several redundant strategies that independently restrict phage production, and thus <italic>tcaP</italic> is dispensable for phage inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hays and Seed, 2020</xref>). Instead of selecting for mutations that individually escape PLEâs inhibitory proteins, ICP1 encodes broader strategies that degrade the PLE genome, such as the phage-encoded CRISPR-Cas system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Seed et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McKitterick et al., 2019</xref>), Odn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barth et al., 2021</xref>), or Adi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nguyen et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The inhibitory effects on the helper phage resulting from the production of small capsids from hijacked coat proteins are comparable between PLEs and other satellites that depend on helper coat proteins for virion production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Damle et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carpena et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim et al., 2001</xref>). PLE, like other satellites, has a genome size of ~15â20 kb, which is compatible with the satellite-modified T = 4 capsid size. However, the ICP1 genome does not follow the pattern seen in other helper phages, which typically are ~30â40 kb and packaged into similarly sized capsids (icosahedral T = 7 or prolate T<sub>end</sub> = 4, T<sub>mid</sub> = 14). ICP1 has a large ~125 kb genome packaged into a T = 13 capsid. Therefore, PLE and ICP1 have the most dramatic size difference between satellite and helper phage. The consistent level of inhibition is likely explained by the fact that regardless of how much smaller the capsid is, packaging anything less than the full length of the genome results in non-infectious virions. However, the effect of capsid size on the satellite packaging can be different. Phages and satellites that use <italic>cos</italic> site packaging strategies specifically cleave the genome only at those sites and thus package unit lengths of their genomes into a capsid. For <italic>cos</italic> packaging satellites that depend on helper phage coat proteins, if their genome is proportional to two or three lengths of their helper phages, they can package their genome into helper-sized capsids with no or reportedly little reduction in efficiency; however, genomes that are not proportional suffer from slight reductions in transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shore et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carpena et al., 2016</xref>). On the other hand, with headful packaging systems, which have been predicted for ICP1 and PLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barth et al., 2020</xref>), replicated genome concatemers will be threaded into the capsid until the capsid is full, signaling the terminase to stop packaging and cut the genome. Most phageâs capsids accommodate 103â110% of their genome length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rao and Feiss, 2015</xref>). While the SaPIs that use headful packaging are unaffected by packaging their genomes into large capsids, PLEâs transduction is severely reduced when packaged into ICP1-size capsids. The difference in capsid size between the SaPI helper, 80Î± (T = 7), and PLEâs helper, ICP1 (T = 13), explains this result. Approximately two SaPI genomes would need to be packaged to fill the larger, T = 7 capsid produced in the absence of its remodeling proteins CpmB and CpmA. Meanwhile, 6â7 PLE genomes would need to be packaged into ICP1âs large, T = 13 capsids in the absence of TcaP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This larger difference in genome copies per capsid supports why PLE is the only satellite to suffer a transduction defect in the absence of capsid remodeling. The negative effect on PLE transduction in the absence of capsid remodeling suggests that PLEs benefit from TcaPâs activity, explaining why it is largely conserved in all PLEs discovered to date.</p><p>By packaging each of its replicated genomes into capsids proportional to its size, PLE makes more transducing particles and increases the odds of horizontal transfer of its genome. Theoretically, high transduction efficiency would be advantageous and selected for in PLEs. If this is the case, the expectation would be that all PLEs encode a functional TcaP that directs the assembly of small capsids. However, older isolates of PLE5 lack such an allele and consequently package their genomes into large capsids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). If the loss of TcaP decreased PLE5âs fitness by decreasing its ability to spread horizontally, it could be expected that this PLE would quickly be replaced by more fit PLEs in the population. Surveillance data show that PLE5 was detected in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> genomes from as early as 1931 until 1991 and again in 2016 and 2017 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angermeyer et al., 2021</xref>), suggesting PLE5 was maintained in the population for relatively long periods of time. Curiously, in an isogeneic background and under lab conditions, PLE5 transduces nearly as efficiently as PLE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">OâHara et al., 2017</xref>), though transduction efficiency is increased by the formation of small capsids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and F</xref>). These data suggest that PLE5 encodes other factors that contribute to its transduction and promote its maintenance in the population. It is unclear at what frequency and/or efficiency PLE transduction occurs in native conditions in estuaries or in the human intestinal tract where ICP1 preys on <italic>V. cholerae</italic>. It may be that low levels of transduction are sufficient to maintain a PLE in the population. Alternatively, PLEs could be maintained primarily through vertical transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angermeyer et al., 2021</xref>). The arsenal of anti-ICP1 factors encoded by PLE, even in the absence of TcaP activity, seem beneficial for <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, supporting vertical transmission of PLE5 as a means for its maintenance in the population. However, the emergence of a restored full-length allele of <italic>tcaP</italic> in PLE5 in 2017, paired with the conservation of TcaP in other PLEs and evidence of horizontal PLE transfer in some clinical isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angermeyer et al., 2021</xref>), suggests capsid remodeling is advantageous due to its role in transduction and is selected for in PLEs in nature.</p><p>PLE is a unique satellite and its helper phage ICP1 is also dissimilar from other helper phages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Sousa et al., 2022</xref>). In addition to its large capsid size, ICP1 is different from other documented helper phages in that it is an obligate lytic phage. This raises questions about whether the characteristics of the ICP1-PLE parasitism are specifically due to the lytic nature of ICP1. For example, PLEâs anti-phage activity is the most potent of any satellite where ICP1 progeny production is completely blocked by PLE. Perhaps this more severe phage restriction is important for the protection of neighboring <italic>V. cholerae</italic> cells from lethal infection. In the case of temperate phages, the presence of many phage kin may promote lysogeny, and the infected cell would survive. As this is not a possibility for <italic>V. cholerae</italic> infected by ICP1, PLEâs reduction of ICP1 in the environment may be a necessary means of protection for the bacterial population. In support of the selection for phage inhibition, PLEs encode multiple redundant mechanisms to block ICP1. It will be interesting to see if other lytic phages are parasitized by satellites and if there is conservation of distinct inhibitory mechanisms. Recent work has highlighted distantly related elements in other <italic>Vibrio</italic> species that may be elements with similarities to PLEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">LeGault et al., 2022</xref>), but putative helper phages have not been identified. A recent study described a density separation and sequencing technique to identify novel satellites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eppley et al., 2022</xref>) that may help illuminate the diversity in phage-satellite pairings. As this work has highlighted, the convergent evolution of satellite strategies to hijack aspects of a helper phageâs lifecycle may not be obvious at the sequence level, and the characterization of novel satellites can reveal features that unite or separate different families of satellites.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>V. cholerae</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">p<italic>tcaP</italic><sup>PLE1</sup></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CMB2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>V. cholerae</italic> E7946 pKL06 P<italic><sub>tac</sub></italic>RiboE<sup>4</sup>-<italic>tcaP</italic> (PLE1);

It is remarkable how different satellites use conserved strategies of parasitism, utilising unrelated proteins that perform similar roles in their cognate elements. In the current manuscript, Dr. Seed and coworkers elucidated the mechanism used by one family of satellites, the PLEs, to produce small capsids, a process that inhibits phage reproduction while increasing PLE transmission. The work is presented beautifully, and the results are astonishing. The authors identified the gene responsible for generating the small capsids, characterised its role in the PLE transfer and phage inhibition, and determined the structure of the PLE-sized small capsids. It is a truly impressive piece of work.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.87611.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The manuscript by Boyd and co-authors &quot;A <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> viral satellite maximizes its spread and inhibits phage by remodelling hijacked phage coat proteins into small capsids&quot; reports important results related to self-defending mechanisms that bacteria are used against phages that infect them. It has been shown previously that bacteria produce phage-inducible chromosomal island-like elements (PLE) that encode proteins that are integrated into bacterial genome. These proteins are used by bacteria to amend the phage capsids and to create phage-like particles (satellites) that move between cells and transfer the genetic material of PLE to another bacteria. That study highlights the interactions between a PLE-encoded protein, TcaP, and capsid proteins of the phage ICP1.</p><p>The manuscript is well written, provides a lot of new information and the results are supported by biochemical analysis.</p></body></sub-article></article>
