However, how alternative splicing regulates spermatogenesis remains largely unknown. Here, using a germ cell-specific knockout mouse model, we demonstrated that the splicing factor <italic>Srsf10</italic> is essential for spermatogenesis and male fertility. In the absence of SRSF10, spermatogonial stem cells can be formed, but the expansion of Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger (PLZF)-positive undifferentiated progenitors was impaired, followed by the failure of spermatogonia differentiation (marked by KIT expression) and meiosis initiation. This was further evidenced by the decreased expression of progenitor cell markers in bulk RNA-seq, and much less progenitor and differentiating spermatogonia in single-cell RNA-seq data. Notably, SRSF10 directly binds thousands of genes in isolated THY<sup>+</sup> spermatogonia, and <italic>Srsf10</italic> depletion disturbed the alternative splicing of genes that are preferentially associated with germ cell development, cell cycle, and chromosome segregation, including <italic>Nasp</italic>, <italic>Bclaf1</italic>, <italic>Rif1</italic>, <italic>Dazl</italic>, <italic>Kit</italic>, <italic>Ret,</italic> and <italic>Sycp1</italic>.

The balance of self-renewal and differentiation of SSCs is fundamental for the maintenance of spermatogenesis throughout life. Over-self-renewal of SSCs will lead to stem cell accumulation and impair spermatogenesis, and even induce tumor. Conversely, overdifferentiation will lead to SSC exhaustion, and thus progressive loss of germ cells and Sertoli cell-only syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Rooij, 2001</xref>). Around embryonic day 15 (E15) in mice, male germ cells do not enter meiosis but are arrested at the G0/G1 phase and are referred to as prospermatogonia. The prospermatogonia resume mitotic proliferation after birth and migrate from the center to the peripheral basement membrane, entering the appropriate environment (stem cell niche) to develop into SSCs. SSCs can self-renew to sustain the stem cell pool or differentiate to generate progenitor cells destined for differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Oatley and Brinster, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Rooij, 2017</xref>). The stem cells and progenitor spermatogonia are collectively called undifferentiated spermatogonia which include A-single (As, single cells), A-paired (Apr, 2 cells interconnected by cytoplasmic bridges), and A-aligned (Aal, 4, 8, or 16 cells interconnected by cytoplasmic bridges) spermatogonia. Then, Aal spermatogonia transform into type A1 spermatogonia and further differentiate into A2, A3, A4, intermediate (In), and B spermatogonia. All these cell types are identified as differentiating spermatogonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Song and Wilkinson, 2014</xref>). Then, type B spermatogonia will divide into pre-leptotene spermatocytes which are the last stage of the mitotic phase and have the competence to enter meiosis. After two rounds of meiotic divisions, haploid spermatids are formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Subash and Kumar, 2021</xref>). A large number of genes and multiple regulatory layers of gene expression, including transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation are reported to be involved in such a complex process to ensure successful spermatogenesis. However, much remains to be understood regarding the homeostasis of SSCs in this intricate process.</p><p>Alternative splicing (AS) is a very important and universal post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism to expand the diversity of transcripts and proteins from a limited number of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maniatis and Tasic, 2002</xref>). Importantly, AS occurs more frequently in higher mammals (90–95% of human genes) and complex organs (brain, heart, and testes; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Merkin et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that AS contributes to the complexity of the organism. Large-scale analysis based on expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and deep sequencing reveals that AS is at an unusually high level in testes, where the transcription of the genome is substantially more widespread than in other organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yeo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Soumillon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ramsköld et al., 2009</xref>), indicating the regulatory functions of AS in the development of testes. Recently, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) reveals that the gene ontology (GO) terms of mRNA splicing and mRNA processing are enriched in the spermatogonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Green et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, many RNA splicing proteins are more highly expressed in type A spermatogonia and in pachytene spermatocyte cell clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schmid et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gan et al., 2013</xref>). AS isoform regulation impacts greatly on the germ cell transcriptome as cells transit from the mitotic to meiotic stages of spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hannigan et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting that AS may be very effective for the mitotic division of spermatogonia. Recently, the RNA helicase DDX5 is shown to play essential post-transcriptional roles in the maintenance and function of spermatogonia via regulating the splicing of functional genes in spermatogonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Legrand et al., 2019</xref>). <italic>Mettl3</italic>-mediated m6A regulates the AS of genes functioning in spermatogenesis and is critical for spermatogonial differentiation and meiosis initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 2017</xref>). Our previous study has also revealed that <italic>Bcas2</italic> regulates AS in spermatogonia and is involved in meiosis initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). Despite these encouraging findings, our knowledge of the principle and mechanistic regulation of spermatogenesis by AS, such as why mRNA splicing and processing are robust in spermatogonia, how the alternatively spliced mRNAs are controlled developmentally, and what the roles of different RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are in this complicated process is still very limited.</p><p>SRSF10 is an atypical SR protein, and it contains an RNA recognition motif in the N-terminus and arginine/serine amino acid sequences (RS domain) in the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shin and Manley, 2002</xref>). Numerous in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate that the phosphorylation status of SRSF10 is importance for its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shin and Manley, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feng et al., 2008</xref>), and SRSF10 is critical for many physiological processes by regulating the correct functional AS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhou et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wei et al., 2015</xref>). SRSF10 is highly expressed in neural and testes tissues, and its expression is significantly increased during mouse testes development. It is mostly phosphorylated and cytosolic expressed in germ cells and promotes the exon 5-included splicing of CREB transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xiao et al., 2007</xref>) However, in the cryptorchid testes, the dephosphorylated SRSF10 was significantly increased, and the exon 5-included CREB transcripts were increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xiao et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, phosphorylated SRSF10 is increased during sperm maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xiao et al., 2011</xref>). These data imply the potential importance of SRSF10 functioning as a regulator of AS in testes development and spermatogenesis, which warrants further elucidation.</p><p>In this study, we generated germ cell conditional <italic>Srsf10</italic> knockout mice and found that <italic>Srsf10</italic> was essential for spermatogenesis and male fertility. Depletion of <italic>Srsf10</italic> in germ cells impeded the expansion of PLZF-positive (PLZF<sup>+</sup>) progenitors, followed by the failure of efficient differentiation of spermatogonia (marked by KIT expression) and meiosis initiation. Single-cell RNA-seq data confirmed that progenitors and differentiating spermatogonia were seriously lost in the <italic>Srsf10</italic> knockout testes at P8. The cell cycle, proliferation, and survival were impaired in the residual <italic>Srsf10</italic>-depleted PLZF<sup>+</sup> undifferentiated progenitors. Further analysis showed that SRSF10 directly bound thousands of genes and was involved in the AS of genes functioning in the cell cycle and germ cell development in spermatogonia.

Therefore, we analyzed the distribution and the number of both undifferentiated and differentiating spermatogonia in control and <italic>Srsf10</italic>-cKO testes at P8 and P6, when only spermatogonia and Sertoli cells can be observed in the seminiferous tubules. At P8, co-staining for MVH and PLZF showed that numerous differentiating spermatogonia (MVH<sup>+</sup>PLZF<sup>−</sup>) could be detected at the basement of seminiferous tubules in control. However, MVH and PLZF were largely co-localized in <italic>Srsf10</italic>-cKO testes, indicative of few differentiating spermatogonia (MVH<sup>+</sup>PLZF<sup>−</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Statistical analysis showed that differentiating spermatogonia (MVH<sup>+</sup>PLZF<sup>−</sup>) were nearly absent, and the number of undifferentiated spermatogonia (MVH<sup>+</sup>PLZF<sup>+</sup>) was significantly reduced in <italic>Srsf10</italic>-cKO testes compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

The number of KIT<sup>+</sup> cells was obviously reduced in <italic>Srsf10</italic>-cKO testes compared to the control at P8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), further confirming the lack of differentiating spermatogonia. At P6, co-staining for MVH and PLZF showed that most of the germ cells were undifferentiated spermatogonia (MVH<sup>+</sup>PLZF<sup>+</sup>) in both control and <italic>Srsf10</italic>-cKO testes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).

PLZF is a broader marker of all undifferentiated spermatogonia including As, Apr, and Aal spermatogonia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

The remaining 562 differentially spliced genes were not detectably bound by SRSF10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), suggesting their altered splicing might be an indirect effect of SRSF10 depletion, for example, a secondary result of altered splicing of other splicing factors (e.g. RBM5, RBM19, and HNRNPC) in the absence of SRSF10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Some genes involved in important spermatogonia-related processes, including cell cycle and germ cell development were also successfully verified.

This might be due to the faster proliferation rate of progenitor spermatogonia than SSCs which are normally quiescent and exhibit a very slow cell cycle rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Rooij and Russell, 2000</xref>). Additionally, the PLZF<sup>+</sup> spermatogonia gradually increased, but at a slower pace, in <italic>Srsf10</italic>-cKO testes from P3 to P12, and the expression of genes involved in the expansion and early differentiation of progenitor spermatogonia was also somewhat upregulated from P6 to P8 <italic>Srsf10</italic>-cKO testes.

These targets are involved in many fundamental biological processes, such as regulation of double-strand break repair, chromosome segregation, and mitotic spindle organization. Importantly, aberrant splicing of some functional genes can be successfully verified experimentally at both the mRNA and protein levels. For example, <italic>Nasp</italic>, which encodes a histone chaperone that preferentially transports H1 histones into nuclei and exchanges H1 histones with DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Richardson et al., 2006</xref>), preferentially skips exon 7 in the absence of SRSF10 in the spermatogonia. This leads to a dramatic decrease of the long isoform (also known as testicular NASP or tNASP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Richardson et al., 2000</xref>) and an increase of a shorter isoform. Notably, depletion of tNASP reportedly inhibits proliferation in prostate cancer PC-3 cells and renal cell carcinoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alekseev et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fang et al., 2015</xref>), echoing the cell cycle defects of <italic>Srsf10</italic>-cKO spermatogonia. <italic>Bclaf1</italic> is a known target of SRSF10, and the inclusion of <italic>Bclaf1</italic> exon5a was directly regulated by SRSF10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhou et al., 2014a</xref>). In colorectal cancer cells, knockdown of the BCLAF1-L isoform (exon 5 a included) inhibited growth, and overexpression of the BCLAF1-L isoform increased tumorigenic potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhou et al., 2014a</xref>). In <italic>Srsf10</italic>-cKO-enriched spermatogonia, the inclusion of <italic>Bclaf1</italic> exon5a was decreased at both the RNA and protein levels, leading to downregulation of BCLAF1-L isoform and thus proliferation defects. Therefore, the negative effects on cell proliferation of <italic>Srsf10</italic>-depleted spermatogonia might be due to abnormal AS of abundant functional genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).

Finally, the sections were washed with PBS two times and mounted with Fluoromount-G medium (Southern Biotech, 0100–01). The immunoﬂuorescence staining was imaged with a laser scanning confocal microscope LSM880 (Carl Zeiss, Germany).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Testes digestion and generation of cell suspensions</title><p>Testes from P6 mice were used to generate single-cell suspensions following enzymatic digestion as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Oatley and Brinster, 2006</xref>). In brief, testes were collected from P6 or P8 control and <italic>Srsf10</italic>-cKO mice in Hanks’ balanced salt solution, and the tunica albuginea was removed. Then, the testes were digested with 4.5 ml 0.25% trypsin/EDTA and 0.5 ml 7 mg/ml DNase I solution (Sigma, d5025) for 6 min at 37°C. After gently pipetting, another 0.5 ml DNase I solution was added to the cell suspension to digest for another 2–3 min at 37°C and followed by the addition of 1 ml 10% FBS. Single-cell suspensions were made by gently repeated pipetting and passed through a 40-μm pore size cell strainer. The cells are centrifugated at 600 g for 7 min at 4°C and resuspended with 180 μl running buffer (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-091-221) for MACS selection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>THY1<sup>+</sup> spermatogonia isolation</title><p>We added 20 μl THY1 antibody-conjugated microbeads (anti-mouse CD90.2 [Thy1.2] MicroBeads; Miltenyi Biotech, 130-121-278) to the single-cell suspensions and mixed well, then incubated for 20 min at 4°C. After incubation, 2 ml running buffer was added to the cells and centrifugated at 600 g for 7 min at 4°C. The pellet was then resuspended in 500 μl of running buffer for magnetic cell separation. The LS columns (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-042-401) were placed in the magnetic field of the MACS Separator and prewashed with 0.5 ml of running buffer followed by the addition of the THY1-labeled cell suspension. Wash the LS columns three times with 3 ml running buffer, and the unlabeled THY1<sup>−</sup> cells were eluted. Then, the LS columns were removed from the separator and placed on new 15 ml centrifuge tubes. The THY1<sup>+</sup> cells were eluted from the LS columns in a 5-ml running buffer and centrifuged at 600 g for 7 min at 4°C. After centrifugation, the supernatant is removed, and the pellet of THY1<sup>+</sup> cells was stored at –80°C for subsequent sequencing analysis and validation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing</title><p>THY1<sup>+</sup> KIT<sup>-</sup>, KIT<sup>+</sup> THY1<sup>−</sup>, and THY1<sup>+</sup>KIT<sup>+</sup> spermatogonia collection: Testes collected from P8 control and <italic>Srsf10</italic>-cKO mice were digested, and the single-cell suspensions were generated following the protocol described above. We added 20 μl THY1 antibody-conjugated microbeads (anti-mouse CD90 [Thy1.2] MicroBeads; Miltenyi Biotech, 130-121-278) and 40-μl KIT antibody-conjugated microbeads (anti-mouse CD117 MicroBeads; Miltenyi Biotech, 130-091-224) to the single-cell suspensions for 20 min at 4°C, and followed the protocol described above to get the THY1<sup>+</sup> KIT<sup>−</sup>, KIT<sup>+</sup> THY1<sup>−</sup>, and THY1<sup>+</sup>KIT<sup>+</sup> spermatogonia.</p><p>The single-cell RNA-seq experiment was performed with one replicate of control that was collected from three mice, and two replications of <italic>Srsf10</italic>-cKO that were collected from six mice, respectively. Single cells were suspended in PBS containing 0.04% BSA and loaded onto the Chromium 3' v3 platform (10× Genomics) to generate single-cell libraries according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, single cells were partitioned into Gel Bead-In-EMulsions (GEMs) in the 10× Chromium Controller instrument followed by cell lysis and barcoded reverse transcription using a unique molecular identifier (UMI). The cDNA was generated and then amplified, and the libraries were finally sequenced using an Illumina Novaseq 6000 sequencer with a sequencing depth of at least 100,000 reads per cell with a pair-end 150 bp (PE150) reading strategy (performed by CapitalBio Technology, Beijing).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Data processing of scRNA-seq</title><p>Raw data were processed using the Cell Ranger Software (version 4.0.0). Briefly, the raw files were converted to demultiplexed fastq files through the Cell Ranger mkfastq pipeline. The fastq files were then aligned to the mouse reference genome (mm 10) using the STAR aligner. Next, the reads were further filtered for valid cell barcodes and UMIs to produce a count matrix. Finally, the count matrix was imported into the R package Seurat, and quality control was performed to remove outlier cells and genes. Cells with 200–4000 detected genes were retained. Genes were retained in the data if they were expressed in ≥3 cells. After applying these quality control criteria, 1923 cells and 23,310 genes remained for further analysis. Additional normalization was performed in Seurat on the filtered matrix to obtain the normalized count. Highly variable genes across single cells were identified, and principal components analysis was performed to reduce the dimensionality. Then the top 16 principal components were used for cluster/subtype identification and UMAP visualization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Becht et al., 2018</xref>). Known cell type-specific markers were used to match each cell type.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Pseudotime analysis of single-cell transcriptomes</title><p>Germ cell lineage trajectories were constructed according to the procedure recommended in the Monocle3 documentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Trapnell et al., 2014</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/monocle3/docs/starting/">https://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/monocle3/docs/starting/</ext-link>). Briefly, the top differentially expressed genes were selected as ‘ordering genes’ to recover lineage trajectories in Monocle3 using default parameters. After pseudotime was determined, differentially expressed genes were clustered to verify the fidelity of lineage trajectories.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Linear amplification of complementary DNA ends and sequencing</title><p>SRSF10 LACE-seq was performed based on a previously described protocol with some modifications. Briefly, THY1<sup>+</sup> cells were collected into 1.5 ml LoBind microcentrifuge tubes (Eppendorf, 022431021) with 5 µl of 1×PBS (pH 7.4). The cells were irradiated twice with 0.40 J cm−2 UV light (254 nm) in a CL-1000 ultraviolet crosslinker (UVP). 10 µl of protein A/G magnetic beads (per sample, Thermo Scientific, 26162) were washed twice with BSA/PBS solution (0.1% BSA in 1×PBS) and incubated with 200 µl blocking buffer (1×PBS, 0.2 mg/ml glycogen, 0.2 mg/ml BSA) at RT for 1 hr. The blocked beads were then washed once with 0.1 M Na-phosphate buffer (93.2 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 6.8 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 0.05% tween 20, pH 8.0) and then resuspended in 40 µl of 0.1 M Na-phosphate buffer containing 5 µg SRSF10 antibody (Cat No.) or IgG (Cat No.), incubating at RT for 1 hr. The antibody-coupled beads were washed twice with wash buffer (1×PBS, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) and resuspended in 10 µl of wash buffer per sample. The cross-linked samples were lysed on ice with 50 µl of wash buffer for 10 min. After removal of genomic DNA with 4 µl of RQ1 DNase (Promega, M6101) in the presence of 1 µl of RNase inhibitor (Thermo Scientific, EO0381), 10 µl of antibody-coupled beads were added to the lysate and incubated for 1 hr at 4°C. Bead-bound antibody-RNA complexes were then washed twice with wash buffer, once with high-salt wash buffer (5×PBS, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate), and once with PNK buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5% NP-40). The immunoprecipitated RNAs were then fragmented with 1×10<sup>–5</sup> U of micrococcal nuclease (MNase, New England BioLabs, M0247S) in 1×MN reaction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>) for 3 min at 37°C. After another round of extensive washing (twice with 1×PNK + EGTA buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mM EGTA, 0.5% NP-40], twice with wash buffer, and twice with PNK buffer), the RNA 3’ ends were dephosphorylated on beads with FastAP alkaline phosphatase (Thermo Scientific, EF0651) for 15 min in FastAP buffer. After washing beads twice with 1×PNK + EGTA buffer, twice with 1×PNK buffer, and twice with BSA solution (0.2 mg/ml BSA in DEPC water), the 3’ linker was ligated with T4 RNA ligase 2 (New England BioLabs, M0242) for 2.5 hr at RT. After washing beads three times with 1×PNK buffer, the RNA was reverse transcribed with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Thermo Scientific,18064014) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Then excess T7-RT primer was digested with Exonuclease I (New England BioLabs, M0293), first-strand cDNA was released from Protein A/G beads by treatment with RNase H (Thermo Scientific, EN0202) and captured by streptavidin C1 beads (Thermo Scientific, 650002). After washing beads twice with 1×B &amp; W buffer (5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 M NaCl), once with BSA solution, the cDNA 3’ linker was ligated with T4 RNA ligase 1 (New England BioLabs, M0437) overnight at RT. Then cDNA was pre-amplified using KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (KAPA Biosystems, KK2601), and PCR products were purified with Ampure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, A63881). Then in vitro transcription was performed, the DNA template was removed with TURBO DNase (Thermo Scientific, AM2238), and the RNA was purified with Agencourt RNA Clean beads (Beckman Coulter, A63987). After reverse transcription and indexed PCR, the PCR products were size-selected on a 2% agarose gel, and regions corresponding to 250–500 bp were purified using Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, 28604). The LACE-seq library was paired-end sequenced using Illumina NovaSeq 6000 at Novogene.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>LACE-seq data processing</title><p>The first 4 nt at 5’ end of read1 and read2 were extracted as UMI and then the adaptor sequences, poly(A) tails at the 3’ end and low-quality reads were removed using fastp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2018</xref>) with parameters ‘--detect_adapter_for_pe -m -e 20 l 18 -y -Y 10 c --overlap_len_require 10 <monospace>--overlap_diff_percent_limit</monospace> 10 U <monospace>--umi_loc per_read</monospace> <monospace>--umi_len 4--poly_x_min_len 5</monospace>’. Clean reads were then first mapped to mouse pre-rRNA using Bowtie2 software (v.2.1.0; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Langmead and Salzberg, 2012</xref>), and the remaining unmapped reads were aligned to mouse mm9 genome using HISAT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2015</xref>). PureCLIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krakau et al., 2017</xref>) was used to identify peaks with default parameters.

Differential splicing events of NGS data were analyzed using CASH software with the standard protocol using p&lt;0.05 as the threshold for filtering. For validation, we first imported the differentially spliced sites of interesting functional genes analyzed by SUPPA2 and CASH into the integrative genomics viewer tool to efficiently and flexibly visualize and explore spliced sites between control and <italic>Srsf10</italic>-cKO samples. The primers for differentially spliced exons were designed using Primer5. Primers were designed within constitutive exons flanking the differentially spliced exons. Standard PCR for analysis by gel electrophoresis was performed according to the manufacturers’ instructions and visualized by running on a 2% agarose gel.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall, the three reviewers agree that the subject of your manuscript could be of interest to readers of <italic>eLife</italic> and that the conclusions are partly supported by the results. However, the reviewers feel that (1) the study is too descriptive and lacks molecular insights, (2) alternative explanations of the results should be considered, (3) there should be more information about whether gene expression changes are really direct targets of SRSF10, (4) there should be additional controls for several of the experiments, and (5) there should be a significant effort to correct a variety of scientific and editorial issues. Consequently, this manuscript should be extensively revised prior to further consideration for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. The revised version of this manuscript must be submitted within 3 months of receiving this decision letter. In its present form, the manuscript is not appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Representative comments by the reviewers follow:</p><p>The molecular mechanism by which SRSF10 impacts key splicing or gene expression events, and how many of these are direct targets of SRSF10, remains unexplored. The study is highly descriptive and lacks molecular insights. Identification of the molecular changes that are driving the loss of spermatogonia upon depletion of SRSF10 requires (1) demonstrating a change in protein expression or activity that follows the transcript changes and (2) demonstrating that one or more of these changes is sufficient to phenocopy SRSF10-depletion.</p><p>Although some of the data showed that the mutant (cKO) mice may contain a deletion mutation of Srsf10 (Figure 1B, Figure 7-Supl 1D), the strategy of generating mutants and genotyping of mice should be presented as data, including the genotyping PCR (gel electrophoresis) of mice and a schematic showing the genomic organization of Srsf10 loci before and after Cre mediated recombination. What does Srsf10F/- represent as described in Materials and methods (Lines 452-453)? The labeling of figures can also be changed from &quot;Control&quot; to &quot;Srsf10F/+; Vasa-Cre&quot; when applicable. Explain what the residual SRSF10 in Figure 7-Supl1D mean for the deletion mutation.</p><p>The authors used heterozygous mutants as the control. At least one experiment should be presented to show that the heterozygous mice indeed had same phenotypes as the wild type, and different from the homozygous mutants. This can be done by comparing spermatogenic cells on testis sections or cell sorting of SSCs among the three genotypes.</p><p>Maintaining consistency when describing SSC sub-populations may help to avoid confusion. For example, in the Abstract it says &quot;impeded the expansion of progenitor spermatogonia&quot;; in lines 97-99, it &quot;impaired … in undifferentiated spermatogonia&quot;; in lines 234-236, it &quot;may not affect the gene expression and proliferation of SSCs&quot;, whereas in Figure 4B, Gfra1 was among the decreased genes at P6. This may be done by clearly defining the particular cellular state with their gene expression signatures. For example, un-differentiated SSCs for cells expressing (GFRa1), undifferentiated progenitors for cells expressing OCT4 and PLZF, differentiating progenitors for cells expressing KIT, cells developed beyond type A1 stage can be referred to as differentiated spermatogonia.</p><p>The conclusion that &quot;the progenitor expansion is affected, SSC formation is not&quot; should be drawn carefully, as several of the data suggest otherwise. For example, Figure 3C, using MVH<sup>+</sup>PLZF- as a criterion for selecting differentiated cells may not exclude GFRa1+ SSCs, since the majority of PLZF+ progenitors are not expressing GFRa1. In this connection, Figure 3F, lines 178-179, described the decrease of GFRa1+ cells, which are classified as SSCs in the manuscript. The single cell RNAseq analyses also suggested the changes in the ratios of USSC1 (un-differentiated SSC1, increased from 17.5% to 35.5%) and USSC2 (un-differentiated SSC2, decreased from 20.2% to 8.1%) in mutants, compared to the control. Note that USSC1 expresses high GFRa1 and USSC2 expresses high PLZF and OCT4. It is likely that impeding the progenitors' cell division caused accumulation of SSCs or that SSCs' defect in M phase progression led to decrease of progenitors. This should be discussed in the Discussion section. The authors should also introduce clearly how the single cells' classification on SSCs were done and how they would match the cell types described before RNA sequencing data.</p><p>In the Introduction, the rationale of studying SRSF10 in male germ line should be mentioned. In the Discussion, alternative implications and caveats of results should be discussed, including – What does DSSC3 mean for the mutants? What is the reason that DEGs were found in mutants when SRSF10 is a splicing regulator? How is it that genes affected by alternative splicing were not the same as DEGs from RNA sequencing analyses?</p><p>The Materials and methods section requires substantial improvements by providing sufficient information on how the experiments were carried out, including details such as: hydration time for fixing testes, companies and catalogs for equipment used, antibodies (mono-/polyclonal) types, solution used for diluting antibodies, pH of PBS used, and how Edu staining was done. Were the scRNAseq done for THY1+KIT+ and THY-/KIT+ cells, were all experiments repeated at least three times including RNA sequencing, etc.</p><p>Table-1 describes the average litter size produced by wild type and mutant mice, which is higher than what is usually found for C57BL6/J mice. The number of pups per litter should be from one female mouse, please check and correct. The time period for this recording should also be indicated.</p><p>Change &quot;per tubule&quot; to &quot;per cross-section&quot; in Figures when applicable. The number of KIT+ and GFRa1+ cells in Figure 3D and 3F should be quantified (e.g, using average number of cells/per unit length of seminiferous tubule).</p><p>In Figure 2A, black arrows indicate apoptotic cells. What criteria were used to tell the difference?</p><p>In Figure 2B, state clearly which one is for the control and which one in for the mutant, lines 139-142. Figure 2E is similar to Figure 7-Supl1D. Explain why the mutants contain SRSF10 protein?</p><p>In Figure 5E – Use the same scale on X-axis for better comparison.</p><p>In Figure 6A – Label top genes in the graph as in Figure 6-Supl2. The number of DEGs described in line 283 is not the same as that shown in Figure 6A. Why is &quot;cellular iron ion homeostasis&quot; not present in up-regulated Gos and &quot;regulation of G2/M transition of mitotic cell cycle&quot; is not present in the down-regulated GOs (line 285) for USSC1 in Figure 6B?</p><p>Describe what the gels shown in Figure 7E and corresponding supplements are, make sure the gel images presented are the same as those in the source files, and check if the labeling for each Table is correct in the Source Files.</p><p>Define clearly how statistics were set for significances: *, **, ** represent what P values in Materials and methods, as well as in the Figure Legends. Instead of stating &quot;at least 500 tubules or 1000 tubules&quot;, present the exact numbers of cross-sections examined for each experiment when applicable in the Figure Legends (e.g., for Figures 2, 3, and 6). Instead of &quot;adults&quot;, give the age of mice used for experiments when applicable, either in the Figures or Figure Legends.</p><p>Check and correct all grammar and spelling errors throughout the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>To some extent the manuscript describes a host of molecular markers (genes) involved in alternative splicing, all of which affect steps in spermatogenesis. Consequently, it is clear that alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs is critical for spermatogenesis, but less clear as to why it is critical. It remains unclear whether or not defects in meiosis initiation by spermatogonal stem cells (SSC) in neonatal mice is due to defects in mitotic progenitor cell proliferation. Is it clear that certain steps in SSC formation are not affected by the deletion of Srsf10? In addition to experiments clearing up this issue, the authors should provide more convincing evidence that they are dealing with completely inactivated Srsf10 knockout mice (e.g., show PCR analysis etc.). Are redundant mechanisms at play here? Of the hundreds of genes in spermatogonia affected by the knockout of Srsf10 (i.e., affected by a lack of alternative splicing), which are thought to be involved in the initiation of meiosis? Are any of these same genes involved in a similar process in females, i.e., the conversion of oogonia (mitotic) into oocytes (meiotic)? The manuscript should undergo major editorial improvements making it more understandable to scientists unfamiliar with spermatogenesis, Srsf10, and alternative splicing (also check the many spelling and grammatical errors).</p><p>In general, this could be a valuable contribution to the literature on the role of alternative splicing in spermatogenesis (and possibly oogenesis). However, despite the extensive nature of this manuscript and its potentially important conclusions, it will be necessary for the manuscript to undergo revision prior to acceptance. The revision should include information missing from the manuscript, alternative interpretations of experiments, and editorial improvements (spelling etc.).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Some main concerns that should be addressed:</p><p>1. Although some of the data showed that the mutant (cKO) mice may indeed contain deletion mutation of Srsf10 (Figure 1B, Figure 7-Supl1D), the strategy of generating mutants and genotyping of mice should be presented as data, including the genotyping PCR (gel electrophoresis) of mice, a schematic showing the genomic organization of Srsf10 loci before and after Cre mediated recombination. For the same reason, what Srsf10F/- represents, as described in Materials and methods (Lines 452-453)? The labeling of figures can also be changed from &quot;Control&quot; to &quot;Srsf10F/+;Vasa-Cre&quot; when applicable. Explain what the residual SRSF10 in Figure 7-Supl1D mean for the deletion mutation.</p><p>2. The authors used heterozygous mutants as the control. At least one experiment should be presented to show that the heterozygous mice indeed had same phenotypes as the wild type, and different from the homozygous mutants. This can be done by comparing spermatogenic cells on testis sections, or cell sorting of SSCs, among three genotypes.</p><p>3. Maintaining consistency when describing SSC sub-populations may help to avoid confusion. For example, in Abstract, &quot;impeded the expansion of progenitor spermatogonia&quot;; in lines 97-99, &quot;impaired … in undifferentiated spermatogonia&quot;; in lines 234-236, &quot;may not affect the gene expression and proliferation of SSCs&quot;, whereas in Figure 4B, Gfra1 was among the decreased genes at P6. It may be done by clearly defining the particular cellular state with their gene expression signatures, for example: un-differentiated SSCs for cells expressing (GFRa1), undifferentiated progenitors for cells expressing OCT4 and PLZF, differentiating progenitors for cells expressing KIT, cells developed beyond type A1 stage can be referred to as differentiated spermatogonia.</p><p>4. The conclusion of &quot;the progenitor expansion is affected, SSC formation is not&quot; should be drawn carefully, as several data suggest otherwise. For example, Figure 3C, using MVH<sup>+</sup>PLZF- as a criterion for selecting differentiated cells may not exclude GFRa1+ SSCs, since the majority of PLZF+ progenitors are not expressing GFRa1. In fact, Figure 3F, lines 178-179, described the decrease of GFRa1+ cells, which are classified as SSCs in the manuscript. The single cell RNAseq analyses also suggested the changes in the ratios of USSC1 (un-differentiated SSC1, increased from 17.5% to 35.5%) and USSC2 (un-differentiated SSC2, decreased from 20.2% to 8.1%) in mutants, comparing to the control. Note that USSC1 expresses high GFRa1 and USSC2 expresses high PLZF and OCT4. It is likely that impeding progenitors' cell division caused accumulation of SSCs, or SSCs' defect in M phase progression led to decrease of progenies (progenitors). This should be discussed in the Discussion section. The authors should also introduce clearly how the single cells' classification on SSCs were done and how they would match the cell types described before RNA sequencing data.</p><p>In the same vein, Figure 3G used MVH to label all germ cells, without considering the SSC sub-groups that may already start to differ at this time point (to support the first wave spermatogenesis), thus this data cannot say about changes in SSC formation. Here, it should be noted that pro-SGs (a.k.a. gnocytes) resume proliferation following the birth of the animal, concomitantly with their migration. The notion described in the text, lines 183-184, &quot;they migrate … then restore proliferation&quot;, lines 186-188, &quot;at P3….G1/G0 arrested pro-spermatogonia&quot; should be corrected. In addition, Edu labeling experiments should be performed for GFRa1+ cells or at P3 (Figure 6D-I), which may provide clues on whether cell cycle and proliferation of SSCs or pro-SGs are affected.</p><p>5. Differentially expressed genes drawn from RNA sequencing data, including scRNAseq data, should be provided as Source Tables.</p><p>6. In the Introduction, the rationale of studying SRSF10 in male germ line should be mentioned. In the Discussion, alternative implications and caveats of results should be discussed, including: what the DSSC3 mean for the mutants? What could be the reason that DEGs were found in mutants when SRSF10 is a splicing regulator and how genes affected by alternative splicing were not the same as DEGs from RNA sequencing analyses?</p><p>7. Materials and methods section requires substantial improvements by providing sufficient information on how the experiments were carried out, including details such as: hydration time for fixing testes, companies and catalogs for equipment used, antibodies (mono-/polyclonal) types, solution used for diluting antibodies, pH of PBS used, how Edu staining was done briefly, were the scRNAseq done for THY1+KIT+ and THY-/KIT+ cells, were all experiments repeated at least three times including RNA sequencing, etc.</p><p>Some other concerns include:</p><p>1. Table-1 describes the average litter size produced by wild type and mutant mice, which is higher than what is usually found for C57BL6/J mice. The number of pups per litter should be from one female mouse, please check and correct. The time period for this recording should also be indicated.</p><p>2. Change &quot;per tubule&quot; to &quot;per cross-section&quot; in Figures when applicable. The number of KIT+ and GFRa1+ cells in Figure 3D and 3F should be quantified, for example, using average number of cells/per unit length of seminiferous tubule.</p><p>3. Figure 2A, black arrows indicate apoptotic cells, what the criteria used to tell the difference? Figure 2B, when describe the comparison between control and mutants, state clearly which one is for control, which one in for mutant, lines 139-142. Figure 2E, similar to Figure 7-Supl1D, explain why the mutants contain SRSF10 protein?</p><p>4. Lines 204-207, the number of DEGs described should be the same as what are shown in Figure 4A. Line 211, &quot;P6 specific down-regulated genes&quot;, line 218, &quot;P8-specific down-regulated genes&quot;, if the DEGs were selected using FC &gt; 2, they may be significantly down-regulated but not specifically.</p><p>5. Figure 5E, use the same scale on X-axis for better comparison.</p><p>6. Figure 6A, label top genes in the graph as in Figure 6-Supl2. The number of DEGs described in line 283 is not the same as what are shown in Figure 6A. Why &quot;Cellular iron ion homeostasis&quot; is not presented in up-regulated GOs, &quot;Regulation of G2/M transition of mitotic cell cycle&quot; is not in the down-regulated GOs (line 285) for USSC1 in Figure 6B?</p><p>7. Line 317-318, &quot;we confirmed the dramatic decrease of Srsf10 in the … Srsf10cKO testes…&quot;, why is it decreased, not depleted?</p><p>8. Missing words in Figure legends, mostly after line 950; change all &quot;&gt;=&quot; to correct symbol.</p><p>9. Describe what the gels shown in Figure 7E and corresponding supplements are, make sure the gel images presented are the same as what are in the source files; also for the Source Tables, check if the labeling for each Table is correct.</p><p>10. Define clearly how statistics were set for significances: *, **, ** represent what P values in Materials and methods, as well as in figure legends. Instead of &quot;at least 500 tubules or 1000 tubules&quot;, present the exact numbers of cross-sections examined for each experiment when applicable in figure legends, e.g. for Figure 2, 3, and 6.

The study is highly descriptive and lacks molecular insights. Identification of the molecular changes that are driving the loss of spermatogonia upon depletion of SRSF10 requires (1) demonstrating a change in protein expression or activity that follows the transcript changes and (2) demonstrating that one or more of these changes is sufficient to phenocopy SRSF10-depletion.</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely thank the reviewer for these constructive comments. We totally agree that profiling the direct targets of SRSF10 in spermatogonia is key to understanding the functional mechanism of SRSF10. To this end, we enriched the THY1<sup>+</sup> spermatogonia at P6 and performed linear amplification of complementary DNA ends and sequencing (LACE-seq) <sup>1</sup>(Figure 7 in the manuscript). The LACE-seq data were highly reproducible (Figure 7b) and showed that SRSF10 preferentially bound to exons and enriched between 0 and 100 nt of the 5′ and 3′ exonic sequences that flank the splice sites (Figure Ic and Id). SRSF10-binding peaks in mouse spermatogonia were significantly enriched for GA-rich (GAAGAG) consensus motifs (Figure 7d), consistent with that previously reported in chicken DT40 cells <sup>2</sup>. In total, 1207 SRSF10-binding targets (FPKM≥10, fold change≥2 in both replicates) were identified in the LACE-seq data in THY1<sup>+</sup> spermatogonia (Figure 7g). These genes were significantly involved in chromatin organization, cell cycle, cellular response to DNA damage stimulus critical events, stem cell population maintenance, spermatogenesis and male meiosis (Figure 7f). Combining the RNA-seq and Iso-seq data, 675 differentially spliced genes were identified, among which 113 genes (50 in RNA-seq data, <italic>P</italic> = 7.97e-33; 76 in Iso-seq data, <italic>P</italic>=1.19e-09) were directly bound by SRSF10 (Figure 8B in the manuscript). These data suggest that SRSF10 regulate alternative splicing of functional genes by directly binding to them. The remaining 562 genes with differentially spliced events might be a secondary effect of SRSF10 depletion, as SRSF10 depletion affected genes that are significantly involved in RNA splicing (Figure 8c). With respect to the differentially expressed genes, of the 206 down-regulated and 378 up-regulated genes, only 8.25% (17/260) and 1.85% (7/378) are SRSF10 targets (Figure 8d), suggesting that the changes in gene expression are unlikely a direct effect of SRSF10 depletion.</p><p>As the reviewer suggested, besides validation of the differentially spliced events at the RNA level, we performed western blot to verify the aberrant splicing at the protein level of some direct and indirect functional targets of SRSF10 in <italic>Srsf10</italic>-cKO spermatogonia. We used a total of 14 commercially available antibodies against 12 proteins, of which eight antibodies did not work well for western blot (<xref ref-type="table" rid="sa2table1">Author response table 1</xref>). Four proteins with differentially spliced events were successfully validated, including two direct targets (NASP and BCLAF1) and two indirect targets (DAZL and KAT7) (Figure 8e and Figure 8E in the manuscript). Although there is no direct evidence in spermatogonia, the resulting patterns of isoform switch of NASP and BCLAF1 after Srsf10 depletion have been reported to perturb their normal function in other cell lines, especially that related to cell cycle <sup>3-5</sup>, partially echoing the deficient progenitor proliferation/expansion in the absence of <italic>Srsf10</italic> (please also refer to lines 449-462, pages 21-22 in the manuscript).</p><table-wrap id="sa2table1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><caption><title>Antibodies used for validating the differentially spliced genes at the protein level in control and <italic>Srsf10</italic>-cKO isolated THY1<sup>+</sup> spermatogonia.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Antibody</th><th>Company and Cat.

This may be done by clearly defining the particular cellular state with their gene expression signatures.

This is indeed important to make the description clearer. We have added the gene expression signatures to define clearly what we were describing a particular cellular state in the manuscript as suggested. For example, we have changed “Depletion of Srsf10 in germ cells had little effect on the formation of SSCs but impeded the expansion of progenitor spermatogonia, leading to the failure of spermatogonia differentiation and meiosis initiation.” to “In the absence of SRSF10, SSCs can be formed, but the expansion of PLZF-positive undifferentiated progenitors was impaired, followed by the failure of spermatogonia differentiation (marked by KIT expression) and meiosis initiation.” in the abstract; “The cell cycle, proliferation and survival were impaired in the residual Srsf10 depleted undifferentiated spermatogonia.” to “The cell cycle, proliferation, and survival were impaired in the residual Srsf10 depleted PLZF<sup>+</sup> undifferentiated progenitors.” in lines 97-98, and “Taken together, these data suggest that Srsf10 deficiency may not affect the gene expression and formation of SSCs, but disturbs genes involved in progenitor spermatogonia and thus their expansion and differentiation.” to “Taken together, these data suggest that Srsf10 deficiency disturbs genes involved in progenitor spermatogonia and thus their expansion and differentiation.” in lines 234-236 in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Other changes that can be found in the revised manuscript include lines 94-96, page 5; line 131, page 7; lines 187-189, page 9; lines 298-299, page 14; line 305, page 15.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The conclusion that &quot;the progenitor expansion is affected, SSC formation is not&quot; should be drawn carefully, as several of the data suggest otherwise. For example, Figure 3C, using MVH<sup>+</sup>PLZF- as a criterion for selecting differentiated cells may not exclude GFRa1+ SSCs, since the majority of PLZF+ progenitors are not expressing GFRa1. In this connection, Figure 3F, lines 178-179, described the decrease of GFRa1+ cells, which are classified as SSCs in the manuscript. The single cell RNAseq analyses also suggested the changes in the ratios of USSC1 (un-differentiated SSC1, increased from 17.5% to 35.5%) and USSC2 (un-differentiated SSC2, decreased from 20.2% to 8.1%) in mutants, compared to the control. Note that USSC1 expresses high GFRa1 and USSC2 expresses high PLZF and OCT4. It is likely that impeding the progenitors' cell division caused accumulation of SSCs or that SSCs' defect in M phase progression led to decrease of progenitors. This should be discussed in the Discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this constructive comment. Indeed, the number of GFRα1<sup>+</sup> cells was somewhat decreased, and the expression of <italic>Gfrα1</italic> was slightly down-regulated in P6 <italic>Srsf10</italic>-cKO testes (although most SSCs markers (<italic>Etv5</italic>, <italic>Bmi1</italic>, <italic>Id4</italic>, <italic>Lhx1</italic>, <italic>Cd82</italic> and <italic>T</italic>) was hardly affected), indicating that the formation and maintenance of GFRα1<sup>+</sup> SSCs might be also affected by the depletion of SRSF10. We have toned down the conclusion in the revised manuscript (lines 28-30, page 2; lines 187-189, page 9; lines 233-236, pages 11-12).</p><p>However, the expression of SSCs markers was not up-regulated from P3 to P8, suggesting that loss of SRSF10 in spermatogonia might not cause the accumulation of SSCs. Although the ratio of USSC1 (SSCs) (now as USPG1 in the revised manuscript) was increased (from 17.5% to 35.5%) in <italic>Srsf10</italic>-cKO samples as detected in the scRNA-seq data, it is more likely a result of the loss of progenitors (USSC2, now as USPG2 in the revised manuscript) and differentiating cells (DSSC1 and DSSC2, now as DSPG2 and DSPG3, respectively) in the single cell suspensions subjected to scRNA-seq.</p><p>scRNA-seq data showed that the expression of genes associated with cell cycle in SSCs (USPG1) and progenitor cells (USPG2) was abnormal in <italic>Srsf10</italic>-cKO testes. However, EdU incorporation was reduced in PLZF<sup>+</sup> spermatogonia in P6 <italic>Srsf10</italic>-cKO testes, but was comparable between control and <italic>Srsf10</italic>-cKO GFRα1<sup>+</sup> cells in P3 testes, suggesting that the cell cycle defect was more severe in the progenitor cells than in SSCs. This might be due to the proliferation of progenitor spermatogonia is much faster and thus more sensitive to SRSF10 depletion than SSCs which are normally quiescent and exhibit a very slow cell cycle rate<sup>6</sup>. Additionally, the PLZF<sup>+</sup> spermatogonia were gradually increased, but at a slower pace, in <italic>Srsf10</italic>-cKO testes from P3 to P12, and the expression of genes involved in the expansion and early differentiation of progenitor spermatogonia was also somewhat up-regulated from P6 to P8 <italic>Srsf10</italic>-cKO testes. Although we cannot fully exclude the possibility that the cell cycle defect in SSCs impedes the transition to progenitors, the significantly decreased undifferentiated spermatogonia is more likely a result of abnormal cell cycle or proliferation of progenitors.</p><p>We have revised the statement more precisely as suggested, and added a new subtitle in the Discussion section to discuss this part (lines 407-423, pages 19-20).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should also introduce clearly how the single cells' classification on SSCs were done and how they would match the cell types described before RNA sequencing data.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out.

Briefly, highly variable genes across single cells were automatically identified and dimensional reduction was performed with principal components analysis (PCA) using the R package Seurat<sup>7</sup>. The top 16 principal components were used for cluster/subtype (five subtypes in the manuscript) identification and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) visualization<sup>8</sup>.

Even if when a lower cutoff (FPKM ≥ 2, |log2FC| ≥ 0.5 and <italic>R</italic> &lt; 0.05) is used, among the 206 down-regulated and 378 up-regulated genes, only 17 (8.25%) down-regulated genes and 7 (1.85%) upregulated genes were identified as the direct target of SRSF10 (Figure V and Figure 8—figure supplement 1 in the manuscript). Considering the altered cell types (for example the loss of progenitors and differentiating spermatogonia) and gene splicing in the absence of SRSF10, changes in gene expression might be mainly a secondary effect of SRSF10 depletion (lines 474-479, page 23).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How is it that genes affected by alternative splicing were not the same as DEGs from RNA sequencing analyses?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this question. First, following the last question, we think that DEGs may be a secondary effect of SRSF10 depletion in mouse spermatogonia. Those DEGs may not be regulated directly by SRSF10, which mainly functions as a splicing factor. Second, genes that are differentially spliced do not necessarily mean that they are differentially expressed. Alternative splicing is a post-transcriptional mechanism of gene regulation, if a splicing event does not affect the stability of a transcript, but only isoform switch, the RNA level may not change.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The Materials and methods section requires substantial improvements by providing sufficient information on how the experiments were carried out, including details such as: hydration time for fixing testes, companies and catalogs for equipment used, antibodies (mono-/polyclonal) types, solution used for diluting antibodies, pH of PBS used, and how Edu staining was done.

In Figure 2E, total protein from the whole testes, including both the germ cells and somatic cells, was used to examine the expression of gH2AX.

Consequently, it is clear that alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs is critical for spermatogenesis, but less clear as to why it is critical.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this thought-provoking comment. This is indeed a fundamental and important question regarding how alternative splicing is involved in gene regulation and spermatogenesis. Changes in splicing would lead to changes in the expression level or the forms and functions of the protein products of a specific gene or a set of critical genes, which may further lead to the failure of spermatogenesis. In our work, we showed that depletion of <italic>Srsf10</italic> leads to changes in alternative splicing of functional genes in spermatogonia, including the direct targets (e.g. <italic>Nasp</italic> and <italic>Bclaf1</italic>) and the indirect targets (e.g. <italic>Dazl</italic> and <italic>Kat7</italic>). For example, isoform switches were found in <italic>Nasp</italic> and <italic>Bclaf1</italic> at both the RNA and protein levels in the absence of SRSF10. Although there is no direct evidence in spermatogonia, the resulting patterns of isoform switch of NASP and BCLAF1 after <italic>Srsf10</italic> depletion (Figure 8E in the manuscript) have been reported to perturb their normal function in other cell lines, especially that related to cell cycle <sup>3-5</sup>, partially echoing the deficient progenitor proliferation/expansion in <italic>Srsf10</italic>-cKO testes (please also refer to lines 449-462, pages 21-22 in the manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It remains unclear whether or not defects in meiosis initiation by spermatogonal stem cells (SSC) in neonatal mice is due to defects in mitotic progenitor cell proliferation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. In neonatal mice, the first round of spermatogenesis initiates directly from prospermatogonia to KIT-positive (KIT<sup>+</sup>) differentiating spermatogonia (thus bypassing the process through undifferentiated progenitors), which continue to develop and produce the first wave of spermatozoa. Meanwhile, another set of prospermatogonia become SSCs which are capable of self-renewal or differentiate into progenitors to initiate spermatogenesis and support the continuity of steady-state spermatogenesis. In P3 <italic>Srsf10</italic>-cKO testes, the number of MVH<sup>+</sup> germ cells was comparable to that in control, suggesting that prospermatogonia can possibly develop into KIT<sup>+</sup> differentiating spermatogonia. However, the meiosis initiation still failed in P8-P15 <italic>Srsf10</italic>-cKO testes during the first wave of spermatogenesis, suggesting that loss of SRSF10 might lead to developmental arrest of KIT<sup>+</sup> differentiating spermatogonia, or SRSF10 might be involved in the initiation of meiosis during the first round of spermatogonia. So, the defects in meiosis initiation of the first round of spermatogenesis are not likely due to the defects in mitotic progenitor cell proliferation, because these spermatogonia do not pass through the progenitor cell proliferation stage. By contrast, the defects in meiosis initiation of subsequent rounds of spermatogenesis are likely a result of defects in mitotic progenitor cell proliferation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is it clear that certain steps in SSC formation are not affected by the deletion of Srsf10? In addition to experiments clearing up this issue, the authors should provide more convincing evidence that they are dealing with completely inactivated Srsf10 knockout mice (e.g., show PCR analysis etc.). Are redundant mechanisms at play here?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. The SSCs can be formed in the <italic>Srsf10</italic> knockout mice, but the number of GFRα1<sup>+</sup> cells was somewhat decreased, and the expression of GFRα1 was slightly down-regulated in P6 <italic>Srsf10</italic>-cKO testes (although most SSCs markers (<italic>Etv5</italic>, <italic>Bmi1</italic>, <italic>Id4</italic>, <italic>Lhx1</italic>, <italic>Cd82</italic> and <italic>T</italic>) was hardly affected). These data indicate that the formation and maintenance of GFRα1<sup>+</sup> SSCs might be also affected by the depletion of SRSF10.

We have also checked and corrected the grammar and spelling errors carefully throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Some main concerns that should be addressed:</p><p>1. Although some of the data showed that the mutant (cKO) mice may indeed contain deletion mutation of Srsf10 (Figure 1B, Figure 7-Supl1D), the strategy of generating mutants and genotyping of mice should be presented as data, including the genotyping PCR (gel electrophoresis) of mice, a schematic showing the genomic organization of Srsf10 loci before and after Cre mediated recombination. For the same reason, what Srsf10F/- represents, as described in Materials and methods (Lines 452-453)? The labeling of figures can also be changed from &quot;Control&quot; to &quot;Srsf10F/+;Vasa-Cre&quot; when applicable. Explain what the residual SRSF10 in Figure 7-Supl1D mean for the deletion mutation.</p><p>2. The authors used heterozygous mutants as the control. At least one experiment should be presented to show that the heterozygous mice indeed had same phenotypes as the wild type, and different from the homozygous mutants. This can be done by comparing spermatogenic cells on testis sections, or cell sorting of SSCs, among three genotypes.</p><p>3. Maintaining consistency when describing SSC sub-populations may help to avoid confusion. For example, in Abstract, &quot;impeded the expansion of progenitor spermatogonia&quot;; in lines 97-99, &quot;impaired … in undifferentiated spermatogonia&quot;; in lines 234-236, &quot;may not affect the gene expression and proliferation of SSCs&quot;, whereas in Figure 4B, Gfra1 was among the decreased genes at P6. It may be done by clearly defining the particular cellular state with their gene expression signatures, for example: un-differentiated SSCs for cells expressing (GFRa1), undifferentiated progenitors for cells expressing OCT4 and PLZF, differentiating progenitors for cells expressing KIT, cells developed beyond type A1 stage can be referred to as differentiated spermatogonia.</p><p>4. The conclusion of &quot;the progenitor expansion is affected, SSC formation is not&quot; should be drawn carefully, as several data suggest otherwise. For example, Figure 3C, using MVH<sup>+</sup>PLZF- as a criterion for selecting differentiated cells may not exclude GFRa1+ SSCs, since the majority of PLZF+ progenitors are not expressing GFRa1. In fact, Figure 3F, lines 178-179, described the decrease of GFRa1+ cells, which are classified as SSCs in the manuscript. The single cell RNAseq analyses also suggested the changes in the ratios of USSC1 (un-differentiated SSC1, increased from 17.5% to 35.5%) and USSC2 (un-differentiated SSC2, decreased from 20.2% to 8.1%) in mutants, comparing to the control. Note that USSC1 expresses high GFRa1 and USSC2 expresses high PLZF and OCT4. It is likely that impeding progenitors' cell division caused accumulation of SSCs, or SSCs' defect in M phase progression led to decrease of progenies (progenitors). This should be discussed in the Discussion section. The authors should also introduce clearly how the single cells' classification on SSCs were done and how they would match the cell types described before RNA sequencing data.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these valuable comments.

The notion described in the text, lines 183-184, &quot;they migrate … then restore proliferation&quot;, lines 186-188, &quot;at P3….G1/G0 arrested pro-spermatogonia&quot; should be corrected.
