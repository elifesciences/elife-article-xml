Within cells this requires crossing the cell membrane, and then free diffusion, distribution, and availability. Here, we explored the in-cell diffusion rates and distribution of a series of small molecular fluorescent drugs, in comparison to proteins, by microscopy and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). While all proteins diffused freely, we found a strong correlation between p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> and the intracellular diffusion and distribution of small molecule drugs. Weakly basic, small-molecule drugs displayed lower fractional recovery after photobleaching and 10- to-20-fold slower diffusion rates in cells than in aqueous solutions. As, more than half of pharmaceutical drugs are weakly basic, they, are protonated in the cell cytoplasm. Protonation, facilitates the formation of membrane impermeable ionic form of the weak base small molecules. This results in ion trapping, further reducing diffusion rates of weakly basic small molecule drugs under macromolecular crowding conditions where other nonspecific interactions become more relevant and dominant. Our imaging studies showed that acidic organelles, particularly the lysosome, captured these molecules. Surprisingly, blocking lysosomal import only slightly increased diffusion rates and fractional recovery. Conversely, blocking protonation by <italic>N-</italic>acetylated analogues, greatly enhanced their diffusion and fractional recovery after FRAP. Based on these results, <italic>N</italic>-acetylation of small molecule drugs may improve the intracellular availability and distribution of weakly basic, small molecule drugs within cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>diffusion</kwd><kwd>small molecule drugs</kwd><kwd>in-cell</kwd><kwd>lysosome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1268/18</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dey</surname><given-names>Debabrata</given-names></name><name><surname>Marciano</surname><given-names>Shir</given-names></name><name><surname>Schreiber</surname><given-names>Gideon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001824</institution-id><institution>Czech Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>22-20319S</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Poryval</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name><name><surname>Groborz</surname><given-names>Ondřej</given-names></name><name><surname>Wohlrabova</surname><given-names>Lucie</given-names></name><name><surname>Slanina</surname><given-names>Tomás</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Poor intracellular availability and diffusion of weakly basic, small molecule drugs can be greatly enhanced by preventing ion trapping in crowded cellular environments.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Drug molecules alter many biochemical reaction pathways inside the cell by interacting with proteins, DNAs, RNAs, or others. By this, they influence one or more specific cellular activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schreiber, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stockwell, 2004</xref>). Due to their bioactivity, stability, rather simple chemical synthesis allowing for industrial bulk scale production and the easiness of administration, most drugs are small molecules (&lt;1 kDa) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ngo and Garneau-Tsodikova, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Veber et al., 2002</xref>). Over half of these drugs have a significant degree of hydrophobicity and are weakly basic at intracellular pH of 7.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Charifson and Walters, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lipinski et al., 1997</xref>). Hydrophobicity is required to cross the lipid bilayer of the cell membranes, and polar functional groups solubilize the drug in the cellular medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lipinski et al., 1997</xref>). The balance between p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> and logP (partition coefficient of small molecules as measured from their partition between octanol/water) is critical for successful drug design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Manallack, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Meanwell, 2011</xref>). Lipinski’s ‘Rules of 5’ suggests that logP should be between 1 and 6 to be a candidate for successful oral administration. Small molecule drugs can be acidic or basic depending on their p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lipinski et al., 1997</xref>). Drugs with p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> ~0–7 are considered acidic, and p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> ~8–14 are regarded as basic or alkaline. Basic drugs with p<italic>K</italic>a ˃8 are more common than their acidic counterparts (p<italic>K</italic>a ˂ 7, ~60:40 ratios). In some cases, lowering their p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> to the range between 6 and 7, has proven beneficial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Charifson and Walters, 2014</xref>). For a long time, mechanisms such as passive diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Di et al., 2012</xref>) and carrier-mediated drug delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dobson and Kell, 2008</xref>) or a combination of both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sugano et al., 2010</xref> have been used to explain intracellular drug delivery. However, transport of a drug across the cellular membrane is only one part of a successful delivery. Intracellular diffusion and bio-distribution needs to be taken in account when assessing the drug mode of action.</p><p>In previous work, we studied the diffusion of fluorescent drug molecules in crowded environments in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dey et al., 2022</xref>). However, the cellular cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells is by far more complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Model et al., 2021</xref>). Intracellular membranes, multiple organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ellis, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fulton, 1982</xref>) and a large diversity of macromolecules, in terms of size, charge and hydrophobicity, render the cellular interior extremely complex and heterogeneous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Milo and Phillips, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Neurohr and Amon, 2020</xref>). Moreover, the pH inside cellular organelles can vastly differ from the cytosolic pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Madshus, 1988</xref>). Organelles like lysosomes, late endosomes, Golgi, and secretory vesicles are acidic and have been known for sequestering weakly basic drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asokan and Cho, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Proksch, 2018</xref>). Therefore, predicting diffusion of a particular drug molecule in the dense cytoplasm is a complex task and requires sub-organelle resolution. For example, positively charged (basic) drugs designed to target nuclear DNA may bind cytoplasmic matter through nonspecific interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Long et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tiwari et al., 2018</xref>), they could be sequestrated within the lysosome, or diffuse slower than expected due to crowding and nonspecific interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gotink et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jansen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhitomirsky and Assaraf, 2015</xref>).</p><p>The mobility of a drug in the cellular interior has been shown to be a good proxy for intracellular drug delivery and other processes, such as nonspecific binding or aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dey et al., 2022</xref>). The primary tool for measuring small molecule diffusion inside the cell is fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), which inherently requires fluorescent drug molecules. FRAP with a confocal microscope is a sufficiently sensitive, versatile, and easy-to-use method suitable for measuring the diffusion of weakly fluorescent molecules. Unfortunately, single-molecule fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), a gold-standard method for measuring diffusion of fluorescent particles, cannot be applied for most small molecule drugs due to their weak fluorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dey et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dey et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zotter et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In this work, we determined the intracellular diffusion coefficients of a series of fluorescent dyes and drugs compared to protein diffusion by FRAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Specifically, we used Line-FRAP, which has a much higher time resolution and therefore can measure faster diffusion rates in comparison to standard FRAP (800 Hz versus 50 Hz), for detailed explanations, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dey et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dey et al., 2021</xref>. A pictorial representation of Line FRAP performed in a live HeLa cell treated with a fluorescent drug is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. The small red circle denotes the bleached area which is done by using a Clip tornado (of 2x2 pixel size). The white line indicates the scanning region which was performed along at a rate of 800 Hz in order to record the FRAP as a function of time. The Line-FRAP cross-section profile as a function of time is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>. The vertical direction of the line denotes the time progress. The vertically marked white rectangular region of interest (ROI), in the left panel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) shows the fluorescence intensity recovery over time, which is plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>. The horizontal rectangular ROI outlined in white (in the right panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) denotes the time frame immediately after the photo-bleach pulse (the highly intense green is the bleach pulse). The time interval between each line scanning measurement is ~1.25 ms. This horizontal white ROI generates the fluorescence intensity over the scanning line distance which is plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>. This profile gives the effective bleach radius when fitted with a gaussian function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dey et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dey et al., 2021</xref>).

For comparison, we calculated D<sub>confocal</sub> values from individual Line FRAP progression curves in HeLa cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>), obtaining the same mean value as for the merged curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B and D</xref>), however, with much larger variation over the mean. To estimate whether the large variation from the mean of the individual curves is due to different fluorescein concentrations in the individual measurements, we plotted the fluorescence signal (which is directly related to the concentration) versus the FRAP recovery rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E, F</xref>) and versus the percent recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2G, H</xref>). The lack of correlation suggests that the variation in FRAP rates of the individual measurements is due to the low signal to noise of the individual curves versus the average. Next, we calculated D<sub>confocal</sub> also for fluorescein in PBS, nucleus and HeLa cell extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The mean values from individual curves are very similar to those calculated from the merged curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), with a normal distribution of the individual calculated D<sub>confocal</sub> values around the mean. Moreover, also for the values measured in the nucleus, no relation between fluorescein concentration and FRAP rates or percent recovery was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2F and H</xref>).

It is composed of cephalosporin core linking B7-hydroxycoumarin to fluorescein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Its calculated D<sub>confocal</sub> values in PBS and inside cells are about half as fast as those measured for fluorescein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–G</xref>), and its fractional recovery is ~0.7. No sign of aggregation is seen in micrographs inside the cell cytoplasm or nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). The substantial slower rate of recovery, and lower fractional recovery of CCF2 relative to Fluorescein suggests its diffusion to be obstructed within the cell. This is in line with our prediction, that the observed substrate limited enzymatic degradation of CCF2 in HeLa cells is a consequence of its occlusion within the cellular cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zotter et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>A third molecule for which we determined the diffusion coefficient is the labelling dye CF514.

Here, our aim is to compare diffusion behavior of the GSK3 inhibitor in solution phase to that found in live cell cytoplasm. Since the molecule has some inherent solubility issues in PBS buffer, we compared its diffusion also in BSA protein solution and in cell culture media DMEM (Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium). Comparative FRAP profiles and D<sub>confocal</sub> rates of SB216763 in different mediums are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>. The FRAP profiles and relative D<sub>confocal</sub> values show very slow diffusion of SB216763 in HeLa cell cytoplasm of ~0.61 ± 0.03 µm<sup>2</sup>s<sup>–1</sup> with a fraction recovery of 0.8 after 10 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>).

In cell culture DMEM media (containing 5% serum protein) fractional recovery after FRAP is very low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), indicating that the drug is still aggregating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dey et al., 2022</xref>). Interestingly, the D<sub>confocal</sub> value in HeLa cell extract was higher ~11.3 ± 0.7 µm<sup>2</sup>s<sup>–1</sup> as is its fractional recovery (0.9), showing that HeLa cell extract, like BSA is disaggregating SB216763. Co-localization with Lysotracker-633 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–E</xref>) shows that SB216763 colocalizes and is sequestered in acidic chambers of the cell lysosomes.

The low p<italic>K</italic>a of weakly basic small molecule drugs drive their accumulation in the lysosome. There, they become protonated (ionic form is less-permeable), which hinders their back-diffusion to the cytosol. The phenomenon is known as cationic ion trapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asokan and Cho, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kaufmann and Krise, 2007</xref>) and results in drug accumulation in lysosomes up to millimolar concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">de Duve et al., 1974</xref>). We blocked lysosomal acidification using either Bafilomycin A1 or sodium azide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) prior to drug administration. Bafilomycin A1 is a specific V-ATPase inhibitor and thus inhibits the supply of protons to the lysosomal chamber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Sodium azide, blocks ATP generation, resulting in the disruption of cellular activities which require ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hiruma et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ishii et al., 2014</xref>).

Previously, we found that small-molecule drugs diffuse differently in crowded media than in a simple buffer solution, even if aggregation is not an issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dey et al., 2022</xref>). Here, we show that many small molecules get trapped within the cellular cytoplasm, resulting in extremely slow diffusion and lower fractional recovery after FRAP.

Indeed, high level of accumulation in the lysosomes were found for all the basic drugs. However, pre-treatment with sodium azide or Bafilomycin A1, which we showed to inhibit lysosomal accumulation, had no or only a small effect on diffusion or fractional recovery after FRAP, which stayed low. Therefore, we evaluated colocalization of GSK3 inhibitor with lipid droplets, the ER or nucleic acids present in cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">3</xref>), but did not detect any.</p><p>The conclusive evidence that slow diffusion and lower FRAP recovery results from the drugs being basic came by altering three molecules from being basic to acidic and vice versa. The best example here is fluorescein, where transformation to 5-amino fluorescein drastically reduced its diffusion as well as its fractional recovery after FRAP. Two additional examples here were Primaquine that was modified to Primaquine Acetate and BODIPY-NH<sub>2</sub> that was modified to BODIPY-NHAc. In both cases, the diffusion became faster, and the fractional recovery increased significantly. We did not find any specific correlation between individual average diffusion rate constants with the concentration of small molecule drugs inside the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E, F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>). For fraction recovery, we saw some decrease at high concentrations for the GSK3 inhibitor and Quinacrine, but not fluorescein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2G–H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>), which would support our notion that they are sequestered in the cell. Correlating the calculated D<sub>confocal</sub> values with p<italic>K</italic>a shows a clear trend, where diffusion is strongly slowed down at higher p<italic>K</italic>a values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). Conversely, logP, molecular weights or number of aromatic rings present in the drug molecules did not relate to D<sub>confocal</sub> values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). This finding is important, as the activity of a drug within the cell is dictated by its active concentration. When the drug is sequestered, its active concentration is reduced. Even, if it is not fully sequestered, but only diffuses much slower, it will result in lower association rate constant, and thus lower affinity towards the drug target. As a result, to keep the drug active, its dose has to be increased, which can have negative implications on side effects, due to off-target binding.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our study shows that in vitro biophysical crowding studies for small molecule drugs are of limited value if one wants to understand the biophysical behavior of the same drug within the cell. While it is true that availability of a drug within a cell is only one factor dictating its biological activity, it is a crucial one. Our findings here raise an important limitation on the standard rules for drug design, as these do not consider the stickiness of basic small molecules within the cell. We were able to directly address this question by using fluorescent molecule drugs, and measuring their location and diffusion within cells. Most importantly, we also show that by blocking protonation of a number of basic compounds we were able to increase substantially their diffusion and recovery after photobleaching, and thus potentially their activity. These findings may be consequential in future drug development.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All the reagents used are described in the Key Resources Table.

The cells were subcultured when 80% confluence was reached using trypsin-EDTA for cell detachment. 2x10<sup>5</sup> HeLa cells in 2.5 ml of DMEM were pipetted into glass-bottomed dishes and incubated overnight. The cells were cultured in a humid atmosphere at 37 °C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The cells were imaged 24–30 hr after seeding. Before the microinjection, the medium was aspirated, and fresh medium was supplemented with 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. For drug treatment, HeLa cells were incubated with 10 µM of drug (diluted 1:1000 from stock) for indicated times at 37 °C, followed by three times PBS 1 X wash prior to imaging. For dose-dependent studies, the drug concentrations varied typically between 2 and 12 µM. Sodium azide concentration was 1 and 50 µM. Bafilomycin A1 was used at 100 nM concentration. Similarly, during the colocalization study, HeLa cells were treated with LysoTracker dye (1 X) with 1:1000 dilution for 30 mins to 1 h at 37 °C, followed by 3 x washing with PBS. Quinacrine, GSK3 inhibitor, Mitoxantrone, 5-amino Fluorescein, Amidoquine, Primaquine and BODIPY analogues were incubated with cells, while Fluorescein, Quinacrine, Primaquine-Ac, and CF514 dye were also micro-injected inside the HeLa cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Microinjection into HeLa cells</title><p>Microinjections were performed using the Eppendorf FemtoJet microinjector attached to the Eppendorf InjectMan NI2 micromanipulator.

For every measurement, a single pressure pulse was applied to deliver the sample into the cell. Air was administrated at 15–25 hPa for 0.1–0.3 s.

For fluorescein sodium salt fluorescence measurements, excitation was done at 440 nm, using a diode laser at an output power of 1–4% of maximal intensity for high to low concentrations. In contrast, emission was recorded from 520 to 550 nm using the spectral detection system. For CCF2-FA, excitation was done with the laser at 440 nm using 1–2% of the maximal intensity, while emission was collected from 470 to 560 nm with SDM560 emission dichromator as cut-off filter. For Quinacrine DHC and GSK3 inhibitor, excitation was done at 488 nm laser using 1–2% of the maximal intensity, while emission was collected from 502 to 560 nm with SDM560 emission dichromator as cut-off filter. During colocalization experiments of Quinacrine DHC and GSK3 inhibitor with LysoTracker-633 dye, the same setting was used for detecting the small molecule drugs in Channel 1 (green). LysoTracker-633 dye was detected in Channel 2 (red) by exciting at 635 nm laser using 1–2% of the maximal intensity, while emission was collected from 655 to 755 nm. Colocalization for Mitoxantrone (red channel) was done by using Quinacrine to track the Lysosomes (green channel). Percentage of volume and drug intensity (material) above threshold is defined as percent colocalized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">Appendix 1—figure 5A, B</xref>). For mitoxantrone and BODIPY analogues, excitation was done at 635 nm laser using 1–2% of the maximal power, and emission was collected from 655 to 755 nm in Channel 2 (red). In the blue channel, excitation was done by 400 nm laser using 2–4% of maximal power, whereas the emission was collected from 420 to 480 nm with SDM480 emission dichromator as cut-off filter. The same setting is used in the blue channel for the SYTO blue maker (to visualize free nucleic acids) and blue fluorescent protein marker (BFP to visualize the ER). For the mcherry protein marker (to visualize the ER), the same setting for the red channel (Channel 2) is used. For every colocalization experiments, proper blank experiments were performed separately in all the respective channels with the same microscope settings to avoid any bleeding/leakage of emission signals from one Channel to another Channel, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig6">Appendix 1—figure 6</xref>.

For photobleaching, ‘Tornado’ of 4 pixels (2x2, 1-pixel=0.207 µm) as default laser settings by the Olympus Fluoview confocal system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dey et al., 2021</xref>). It is the smallest area achievable using Tornado. The bleach circle was kept precisely in the middle of the scanning line. The lines we scanned were unidirectional with time intervals of 1.256ms 1000 times (equivalent to 1.256 s) in the majority of the measurements. The number of scans prior to, during, and after the photobleaching was 10, 42, and 948, respectively. Only in some specific cellular measurements (for GSK3 inhibitor and Quinacrine DHC, where recovery is very slow) the unidirectional lines were scanned 5000 times. Photobleaching was achieved by using the laser at 405 nm or with 635 nm excitations for the 63 ms duration at full intensity (100%). The simultaneous scanner moved at a 100 µs/pixel speed to perform an efficient photo-bleach. We have used two simultaneous scanners during the Line-FRAP experiments: one scanner (at 405 nm with the full intensity of 100%) for photobleaching and another scanner (at 440/515/635 nm with weak intensity) for data acquisition. For all the drugs except Mitoxantrone and BODIPY analogues (emission in red wavelengths), photo-bleach was performed by 405 nm laser. For fluorescence signal detection: fluorescein 440 nm laser (1–4%); CCF2 440 nm laser (1–2%); GSK3 inhibitor 440 nm laser (0–2%); Quinacrine (1–2%) of maximal intensity were used. Emission collections were done from 520 to 550 nm for Quinacrine DHC and GSK3 inhibitor.</p><p>Line FRAP was not possible for primaquine analogues, as it suffers from strong photo-bleach during recovery. Here classical XY FRAP was performed, with photo-bleach done by 405 nm laser with full intensity. The frame rate is maintained at 172ms with a bleach pulse duration was 150ms. Due to microscope setting limitations, Line FRAP is also not feasible for Mitoxantrone and BODIPY analogues. A classical XY-FRAP using two simultaneous scanners is done for these molecules. Here, bleach was performed by simultaneous 635 nm laser with the full intensity of 100%, and the main excitation was done by 635 nm laser (with the power of 4%). Emission collections were done from 655 to 755 nm. For BODIPY analogues FRAP recoveries, the bleach pulse time was 150ms. The bleach pulse time was also 150ms for primaquine analogues for comparative FRAP profile collections. The frame rate is maintained at 172ms. Using the Olympus IX81 FluoView FV1000 Spectral/SIM Scanner confocal laser-scanning microscope, using Tornado (which requires SIM scanner to be loaded) greatly enhances bleaching efficiency. In addition, it shortens the time to obtain the first measurement after bleach (which is immediate in this mode). This property is highly beneficial for Line-FRAP measurements, where the time scale of data acquisition plays an important role. The Fluoview SIM scanner unit synchronizes laser light simulation with confocal and multiphoton imaging to avoid interruption to image observation during laser stimulation or manipulation. We have varied the intensity of the lasers to achieve an optimal signal/noise ratio. Fluorescence recovery plots were fitted to a double exponent growth curve. FRAP experiments were also performed inside the PBS buffer drops and crowding conditions. Line FRAP was done on the cells taken from different plates, treated independently. A coverslip was introduced at the top of the drop to stop evaporation during measurements. Our previously developed method on Line FRAP protocol has been employed to calculate diffusion coefficients from the FRAP rates and averaged bleach sizes. Diffusion rates cannot be calculated using XY-FRAP. However, FRAP parameters were kept constant so that qualitatively we could compare the average half-life and percentage of recoveries. When the areas of bleach were selected in the drug-treated cell cytoplasm, we avoided the lysosomes as much as possible, within the resolution limits of the confocal microscope. Lysosomes themselves were measured to move within the cytoplasm with an diffusion coefficient of 0.03–0.071 µm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bandyopadhyay et al., 2014</xref>), which is much slower than the diffusion measured for even the slowest compounds using fast Line FRAP, further validating that we did not measure lysosome diffusion.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Determination of D<sub>confocal</sub> from FRAP results</title><p>We previously developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dey et al., 2021</xref>) the FRAP in Line mode (Line FRAP) method to monitor the diffusion rates of proteins in various environments. Line-FRAP allows a much faster data acquisition rate compared to classical XY FRAP. It is more suitable for measuring diffusion rates for fast diffusing molecules. To calculate D<sub>confocal</sub>, 20–30 independent measurements on different cells (n) were binned, and the curve fit of the progression curve was used to obtain t<sub>1/2</sub>, and r<sub>e</sub> values and their associated errors as determined from the fit of the curve. r<sub>n</sub> was obtained from bleaching a fixed sample. The D<sub>confocal</sub> values were then calculated using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref> (see ntroduction and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dey et al., 2021</xref>). The standard errors (SE) of the individual parameters were combined to obtain D<sub>confocal</sub> ± SE. The errors and means were used to calculate the significance level of the difference between two treatments, with ns for non-significant, * being for 0.05–0.01, ** being for 0.01–0.005, *** for 0.005–0.001 and ****&lt;0.0001. D<sub>confocal</sub> values from individual Line FRAP profiles were calculated the same way, and one-way ANOVA statistical tests were performed to calculate the significance between treatments using the standard function available in GraphPad Prism v10.1 using Dunnett for multiple comparisons. To verify SE values, we repeated the ~20–30 measurements independently multiple times, which gave the same SE as obtained from individual curve fits of n=30 cells.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-97255-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analysed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files.</p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Dr. Ori Avinoam from Department of Biomolecular Sciences, and Prof. Hagen Hofmann from Department of chemical &amp; structural Biology, Weizmann Institute of Science for their valuable discussions and advices.

However, the major limitation we have faced here is the small number of drug/drug-like molecules that fluorescent with sufficient high quantum yields. For this study, we initially screened 1600 drugs for their fluorescence in the visible spectrum, and penetration into cells, resulting in 16 drugs. Of those, a small number was suitable for FRAP due to low quantum yield. For some of the molecules (Mitoxantrone, Priaquine), recovery was minimal, making them challenging to study. We added this information in the materials and method section under “Selection of drugs used in this study” (p.10).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) A comparison between the percentage of neutral and weak base drug accumulation in lysosomes would have helped indicate weak base ion trapping. Such a comparison would have strengthened this study.</p></disp-quote><p>For weakly basic compounds, the ionic form and the non-ionic form of the molecules always remain in equilibrium. The direction of the equilibrium depends on the pH of the medium, which determines the major form of the drug molecules in the solution. Our examples of GSK3 inhibitor (neutral compound, pka~7.0, as predicted by Chemaxon), shows behaviour very similar to the other basic drugs (pka&gt;8) inside the cells. As lysosome pH is about 5.0, the neutral drug also gets protonated inside the lysosomes, as the colocalization study reveals (Figure 4). We added Fig S16 C-D, where we show co-localization of three drugs within the lysosomes showing that all the three weak base drugs colocalize to acidic lysosomes from moderately to extensively. See also in p. 11 under “Confocal microscopy and FRAP Analysis section”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) When cytosolic diffusion rates of compounds were measured, were the lysosomes extracted from the image using Imaris to determine a realistic cytosolic value? In real-time, lysosomes move through the cytosol at different rates. Because weak base drugs get trapped, it is likely the movement of a weak base in the lysosome being measured rather than the movement of a weak base itself throughout the cytosol. This was unclear in the methods. Please explain.</p></disp-quote><p>We want to thank the reviewer for pointing this out. To clarify the point, we added to the material and method section in p. 13 the following text: “When the areas of bleach were selected in the drug-treated cell cytoplasm, we avoided the lysosomes as much as possible, within the resolution limits of the confocal microscope. Lysosomes themselves were measured to move within the cytoplasm with an diffusion coefficient of 0.03-0.071 µm2 s−1 (Bandyopadhyay et al., 2014), which is much slower than the diffusion measured for even the slowest compounds using fast Line FRAP, further validating that we did not measure lysosome diffusion.” In addition, we show that in cells after Bafilomycin A1 or Na-Azide treatments the number of lysosomes was reduced drastically (Figures S8&amp; S9, and Figure 7), while the rates of diffusion remain very slow, similar to those measured without lysosomal inhibitors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Because weak base drugs can be protonated in the cytoplasm, the authors need to elaborate on why they thought that inhibiting lysosome accumulation of weak bases would increase cytosolic diffusion rates. Ion trapping is different than &quot;micrometers per second&quot; in the cytosol. Moreover, treating cells with sodium azide de-acidifies lysosomes and acidifies the cytosol; thus, more protons in the cytosol means more protonation of weak base drugs. The diffusion rates were slowed down in the presence of lysosome inhibition (Figure 7), which is more fitting of the story about blocking protonation increases diffusion rates, but in this case, increasing cytosolic protonation via lysosome de-acidification agents decreases diffusion rates. Please elaborate.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. We added to the results in p. 7 (top) the following “While we selected bleach spots to be small and located outside of lysosomes, this does not assure that some of the bleached area does not include smaller lysosomes. Therefore we investigated whether inhibiting lysosomal trapping will eliminate slow diffusion of cationic drugs.” In addition, we added to the results in p. 7-8 the following: “Comparative FRAP profiles and diffusion coefficients (Figure 7B-D and 7F-H) were slow, but conversely to Bafilomycin, sodium azide treatment did cause a further reduction is rates from Dconfocal 2.4±0.1 µm2s-1 to 1.8±0.1µm2s-1 for quinacrine and from 0.6 to 0.45 µm2s-1 for the GSK3 inhibitor (Figure 7C and G). Both Bafilomycin and sodium azide treatments resulted in elimination of drug confinement in the lysosome, and the small difference in diffusion rates may be a result of the de-acidification of the lysosomes by sodium azide, which may increase the protons in the cytosol upon treatment.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer : A discussion of the likely impact:</p><p>The manuscript certainly adds another dimension to the field of intracellular drug distribution, but the manuscript needs to be strengthened in its current form. Additional experiments need to be included, and there are clarifications in the manuscript that need to be addressed. Once these issues are resolved, then the manuscript, if the conclusions are further strengthened, is much needed and would be inciteful to drug development.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Major issues:</p><p>The paper suffers from poor statistical treatment of the data. FRAP recovery curves should be shown for each repeat, overlaid by an average with SDs as errorbars or shaded regions shown. In bar plots, SEMs should be eliminated in favor of StdDevs. All datapoints should be shown for each bar in Figs. 3-8. To show differences in D_confocal appropriate statistical tests should be conducted. In addition it is unclear what an &quot;independent repeat&quot; is. Does this mean 30 separate imaging sessions/drug treatments/etc? Is it 30 cells on the same coverslip? Is it a combination of both? All reported errors, SD or SEM, should have a single significant digit. Guidelines and best practices for representing quantitative imaging data are all described and visualized in detail in Lord et al. JBS 2020.</p></disp-quote><p>We improved the statistics and added the individual progression curves and did the statistics on them as requested. See Figure S2 for individual FRAP curves of fluorescein, GSK3 inhibitor and quinacrine. Statistical analysis of the individual FRAP curves is in Figure 3B, 4B, 5B, 7C and G. For details see figures legends and material and methods p. 13 in “Determination of Dconfocal from FRAP results”. Line FRAP was done from the cells taken from different plates, treated independently (see text p. 13).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The extensive (and commendable!) dataset the authors have collected can be put to better use than what is currently done. The main text figures in the current form of the preprint are mostly descriptive and their discussion is qualitative, to the point where the author's conclusions are supported only anecdotally. Instead, I would much rather see panels that collate the entire dataset (both protein and drugs) numerically, comparing diffusion values in buffer/cytoplasm/nucleus for all drugs (Like Fig. S6, which is in my opinion the most important in the paper but for some reason relegated to the SI). In addition I would like to see correlations within the dataset, such as D_confocal vs. pKa, vs. concentration (as measured by overall fluorescence signal, see my comment below), vs. mw, or vs. specific chemical moieties (number of charges, aromatic rings, etc). Such correlations should be discussed in terms of a correlation coefficient if conclusions were to be drawn from them, and include errors if available.</p></disp-quote><p>We want to thank the reviewer for these suggestions. We now made new Figures 9, and S16 to compare multiple parameters. Figure 9C shows a clear relation between pKa and Dconfocal, but no relation was found between logP, MW or number of aromatic rings and Dconfocal. Fig. S3 also shows the relation between drug concentration and Dconfocal values. These data are now discussed in the discussion section in p. 9 (bottom).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The drug sequestration hypothesis and other conclusions brought forth by the authors could be further tested by looking at the concentration dependence of the drugs inside eachcell and/or its partitioning between different subcellular compartments. The concentration dependence of these drugs is discussed in a very anecdotal fashion using two concentrations - and despite some cases showing an effect no further studies were done. Drug concentrations in this experiment can vary between cells between repeats or even within a single repeat as a result of drug chemistry and delivery methods (microinjection/passive permeability). This is especially important since it is unclear what clinically-relevant concentrations are for each drug (or at least an IC50 for the cell types tested here). I would like to see a quantitative measure of concentrations as another metric to compare diffusion behavior (see my comment above as well).</p><p>And maybe one thing to consider in addition would be some discussion in the paper about what sub-cellular distributions might actually mean in the context of drug efficacy (asking for myself as well!) - a paragraph describing recent works on the topic with some references could be instructive.</p></disp-quote><p>We want to thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We added now Figure S3, showing the relation between fluorescence intensity in each cell (which is directly related to the concentration of the compound) and FRAP rates and percent recovery for fluorescein, GSK inhibitor and Quinacrine. The results show now relation between drug concentration and FRAP rates, and some relation towards percent recovery. These data are now discussed in the main text (p. 4 bottor and p.6) and in the discussion (p. 9, bottom).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor issues:</p><p>Readers could benefit from a schematic showing the line FRAP method.

Should these not all be diffusion limited? BCECF - larger than many of the drugs used here - shows ~ 100 μm^2/s in buffer (Verkman TiBS 2002).</p></disp-quote><p>We discussed this in our previous work (Ref. 13, iscience 2022, Dey et al.) Dconfocal is a relative diffusion rate and should not be confused with single-molecule diffusion coefficients. FRAP cannot measure the diffusion of more than 100 μm^2/s in the buffer. However, when comparing apparent FRAP rates between different fluorophores, it is not quantitative due to the major implication of the bleach radius towards diffusion rates. The rate constant normalized by bleach radius^2 is the proper way to compare i.e., our Dconfocal. (Ref. JMB 2021, iScience 2022 by Dey et al.).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Recommendations:</p><p>(1) Page 3 at the bottom of the Introduction states, &quot;...sodium azide (Hiruma et al., 2007) inhibited accumulation in lysosomes, cellular diffusion...increased only slightly.&quot; However, Figure 7C, F shows a sodium azide-induced decrease in the Dconfocal cellular diffusion. Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out; we corrected it in the revised version, including adding statistics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Page 6 states, &quot;Quinacrine accumulation in the lysosome was observed also immediately after micro-injection, with aggregation increasing over time. Dconfocal of 4.2{plus minus}0.2 µm2 s-1 was calculated from line-FRAP immediately after micro-injection, slowing to 2.2{plus minus}0.1 µm2 s-1 following 2 hours incubations, with fractional recoveries of 0.63 and 0.57 respectively.&quot; If lysosome sequestration does not have an effect on cytosolic diffusion rates as the manuscript concludes, why do the authors think the diffusion rate decreased here within 2 hours? A solid conclusion would strengthen the conclusions of this manuscript rather than passing over it.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We added the following text to page 7: “It is notable that the Dconfocal for Quinacrine remained consistent regardless of Bafilomycin treatment, 2 hours after incubation (Fig. S9D, 2.4±0.1 µm2s-1). However, when measured immediately after injection, the diffusion coefficient was higher at 4.2 µm2s-1 (Fig. S5D). This result does not support the notion that the faster diffusion measured immediately after cellular injection relates to lysosomal aggregation, and would better support self-aggregation, or aggregation with other molecules in the cell, which increases over time. This notion is further supported by the almost complete lack in FRAP observed 24 hours after injection (Fig. S5C).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In the Results section, the subheading states, &quot;Inhibition of lysosomal sequestration is only slightly increasing diffusion in cells&quot;, but the conclusion for bafilomycin was...Dconfocal values were not altered by Bafilomycin A1&quot;, and the conclusion for sodium azide was diffusion coefficients (Figure 7B-C and 7E-F) were not much changed for the two drugs and stayed low... similarly to what was observed with Bafilomycin.&quot; The clear question is what is the result, &quot;slightly increased diffusion, decreased diffusion, or had no significant effect at all&quot;? Please clarify the wording in the manuscript to accurately describe the results.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, a small difference is obsevered between the two treatments. We added now statistical significance to Fig. 7D and H and to Fig. S8 and S9. In addition, we clarified this point in the text in p.7-8: “Comparative FRAP profiles and diffusion coefficients (Figure 7B-D and 7F-H) were slow, but conversely to Bafilomycin, sodium azide treatment did cause a further reduction is rates from Dconfocal 2.4±0.1 µm2s-1 to 1.8±0.1µm2s-1 for quinacrine and from 0.6 to 0.45 µm2s-1 for the GSK3 inhibitor (Figure 7C and G). Both Bafilomycin and sodium azide treatments resulted in elimination of drug confinement in the lysosome, and the small difference in diffusion rates may be a result of the de-acidification of the lysosomes by sodium azide, which may increase the protons in the cytosol upon treatment.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) In Figure 8B, why was the Dconfocal for AM-fluorescein with or without sodium azide not included here? Besides consistency, the results might demonstrate significance. Please elaborate on the occlusion of this data.</p></disp-quote><p>Fraction recovery after FRAP of AM-fluorescein was very low. Calculating Dconfocal rates with such low fraction recovery is meaningless, as in the time of measurement only a small fraction recovered. Therefore, we calculated Dconfocal only when fraction recovery was at least 0.5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Throughout the Results section, the ideas and experiments are of relevance, but the suggestions/conclusions at the end of each paragraph of this section seem lightly thought out. For example, as stated on Page 8, &quot;...however, this did not contribute new information to the puzzle.&quot; For a chemistry paper, a chemical suggestion strengthens the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We want to thank the reviewer for these suggestions. We now made new Figures 9, and S16 to compare multiple parameters. Figure 9C shows a clear relation between pKa and Dconfocal, but no relation was found between logP, MW or number of aromatic rings and Dconfocal. Fig. S16 also shows the relation between drug concentration and Dconfocal values. We revised the discussion section to giver more weith to these quantitative assessments. These data are now discussed in p. 9.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In conclusion, the manuscript's ideas are needed, but the conclusions drawn from the experiments need to be strengthened, more explanatory, and consistent with the main conclusion of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>See answer to point 5.</p></body></sub-article></article>
