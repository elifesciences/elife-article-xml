adjacent body parts remapping into the deprived area. Traditionally, this remapping has been characterised by changes in the lip representation, which is assumed to be the immediate neighbour of the hand based on electrophysiological research in non-human primates. However, the orientation of facial somatotopy in humans is debated, with contrasting work reporting both an inverted and upright topography. We aimed to fill this gap in the S1 homunculus by investigating the topographic organisation of the face. Using both univariate and multivariate approaches we examined the extent of face-to-hand remapping in individuals with a congenital and acquired missing hand (hereafter one-handers and amputees, respectively), relative to two-handed controls. Participants were asked to move different facial parts (forehead, nose, lips, tongue) during functional MRI (fMRI) scanning. We first confirmed an upright face organisation in all three groups, with the upper-face and not the lips bordering the hand area. We further found little evidence for remapping of both forehead and lips in amputees, with no significant relationship to the chronicity of their phantom limb pain (PLP). In contrast, we found converging evidence for a complex pattern of face remapping in congenital one-handers across multiple facial parts, where relative to controls, the location of the cortical neighbour – the forehead – is shown to shift away from the deprived hand area, which is subsequently more activated by the lips and the tongue. Together, our findings demonstrate that the face representation in humans is highly plastic, but that this plasticity is restricted by the developmental stage of input deprivation, rather than cortical proximity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>primary somatosensory cortex</kwd><kwd>cortical remapping</kwd><kwd>fMRI</kwd><kwd>face somatotopoy</kwd><kwd>phantom limb pain</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>715022</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Makin</surname><given-names>Tamar R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>215575/Z/19/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Makin</surname><given-names>Tamar R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

A key model for exploring the extent, and consequences of, cortical plasticity is upper-limb loss (via amputation or congenital absence). Here, the cortical hand territory in the primary somatosensory cortex (hereafter S1), suffers an extreme loss of sensory input in tandem with dramatic alterations of motor behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Makin et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Muret and Makin, 2021</xref>). The functional and perceptual correlates of amputation-related plasticity are currently debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Makin and Bensmaia, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ortiz-Catalan, 2018</xref>). In particular, it is not clear whether functional cortical reorganisation is restricted to early life development or can also occur in adults.</p><p>Traditionally, research assessing cortical plasticity after upper-limb loss has followed the tenet that neighbouring body parts of the missing hand, and the lower face in particular, shift and encroach into the deprived hand area. This emphasis on the lip representation stems from early electrophysiological work in non-human primates, where numerous studies demonstrated an ‘upside-down’ facial somatotopy, with the lower face immediately neighbouring the hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dreyer et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Merzenich et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sur et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cusick et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lin and Sessle, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Manger et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Manger et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jain et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cerkevich et al., 2014</xref>). Here, the lips and/or chin inputs have been shown to remap into the deprived hand area after sensory loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pons et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jain et al., 1997</xref>), leading to the well-accepted assumption that remapping is determined by cortical proximity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buonomano and Merzenich, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nardone et al., 2013</xref>). Thereafter, human measurement of topographic shifts has tended to focus on that of the lips, where researchers have reported that shifted lip representation towards and into the deprived hand area is significantly associated with phantom limb pain (PLP) intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Flor et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Birbaumer et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lotze et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grüsser et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Foell et al., 2014</xref>). PLP is a neuropathic pain syndrome experienced in the missing, amputated limb by the majority of amputees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Limakatso et al., 2019</xref>). This condition is commonly thought to arise from maladaptive cortical plasticity in S1 (although see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Makin, 2021</xref>), specifically from a signal mismatch between the missing hand representation and the remapped inputs of the lips in the deprived hand area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ramachandran and Hirstein, 1998</xref>).</p><p>The research focus on lip cortical remapping in amputees is based on the assumption that the lips neighbour the hand representation. However, this assumption goes against the classical upright orientation of the face in S1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Penfield, 1950</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Schwartz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Roux et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sato et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Willoughby et al., 2020</xref>), as first depicted in Penfield’s Homunculus and in later intracortical recordings and stimulation studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Penfield, 1950</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Schwartz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Roux et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sato et al., 2005</xref>), with the upper-face (i.e. forehead) bordering the hand area. Furthermore, neuroimaging studies in humans studying face topography provided contradictory evidence for the past 30 years. While a few neuroimaging studies provided partial evidence in support of the traditional upright face organisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Willoughby et al., 2020</xref>), other studies supported the inverted (or ‘upside-down’) somatotopic organisation of the face, similar to that of non-human primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Yang et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Servos et al., 1999</xref>). Other studies suggested a segmental organisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Moulton et al., 2009</xref>), or even a lack of somatotopic organisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Iannetti et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nguyen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kopietz et al., 2009</xref>), whereas many studies provided inconclusive or incomplete results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mogilner et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hoshiyama et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Disbrow et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nevalainen et al., 2006</xref>). Together, the available evidence does not successfully converge on face topography in humans. In line with the upright organisation originally suggested by Penfield, recent work reported that the shift in the lip representation towards the missing hand in amputees was minimal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Makin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Raffin et al., 2016</xref>), and likely to reside within the face area itself. Surprisingly, there is currently no research that considers the representation of other facial parts, in particular the upper-face (e.g. the forehead), in relation to plasticity or PLP. Detailed mapping of the upper and lower face is therefore needed to assess typical topography of facial sensorimotor organisation, as well as remapping after limb loss.</p><p>More recent electrophysiological studies in monkeys demonstrated that much of the face remapping observed in the primary sensorimotor cortex following upper-limb deafferentation does not result from cortico-cortical plasticity, but instead arises from plasticity in the brainstem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Florence and Kaas, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kambi et al., 2014</xref>). This important finding also highlights the limited explanatory power of local activity increase that has been historically used to infer changes to the representational features of a given brain. Does it reflect a gain modulation of input coming from the brainstem, or increase of local processing of the face input in the hand area? While it remains challenging to dissociate these two contributions, alternative analysis tools are becoming increasingly popular for mining richer information of the processing underlying activity in a given cortical region. Multivariate analyses are sensitive to more subtle changes in representational content, that are not accessible with the traditional univariate approach. In the context of facial remapping, if the deprived hand area updates its local processing to include facial information (and does not just display more facial activity), we would expect it to show greater information about representational features relevant to different facial parts.</p><p>Remapping after upper-limb loss has also been documented in individuals born without a hand (hereafter one-handers), who do not experience PLP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Makin et al., 2013b</xref>). Here, it has been shown that the representation of multiple body parts, including the residual arm, legs and lips, remapped into the missing hand territory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hahamy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hahamy and Makin, 2019</xref>). Importantly, cortical remapping in this group does not depend on cortical proximity. With regard to the lips, a recent transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) study has reported functionally relevant lip activity in the deprived hand area of one-handers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amoruso et al., 2021</xref>), showcasing that reported remapping may also be functional. It was proposed that the observed remapping of various body parts could have been shaped by compensatory behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hahamy et al., 2017</xref>), as these body parts are all used by one-handers to compensate for their missing hand function, but this hypothesis awaits validation.</p><p>Here, we conducted a mapping of face cortical organisation to determine facial orientation (upright versus inverted) in the primary sensorimotor cortex in 22 two-handed controls, 17 amputees, and 21 one-handers using an active functional MRI paradigm, where participants were visually instructed to move their forehead, nose, lips or tongue. This paradigm was chosen because it enabled simultaneous bilateral activation of S1 within individual participants, providing a within-participants control design. We also explored the representation of multiple facial movements, which have not been previously studied in the context of deprivation-triggered brain plasticity. To measure the extent of cortical remapping of the upper (forehead) and lower (lips) face in relation to the deprived (or non-dominant) hand area across all groups, we used surface-based topographic comparisons. For this purpose, we employed up-to-date methodology to harvest traditional measures, that is winner-takes-all assessment of surface coverage in the hand and face areas, followed by cortical (geodesic) distances, and similarity analysis of selectivity maps. Furthermore, to go beyond the gross topographic properties of face representation, we used multivariate representational similarity analysis (RSA). This approach allows us to characterise more subtle alterations in the relationship between facial activity patterns (forehead, nose, lips, tongue) in the deprived hand and the face areas.</p><p>We found that, in line with Penfield’s original description, facial topography was arranged in an upright manner, with the forehead (i.e. upper-face) bordering the hand area across all groups. Contrary to traditional theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flor et al., 2006</xref>), we did not find evidence for facial remapping of either the lips or the (cortically neighbouring) forehead, into the deprived hand area of amputees. We did, however, observe significant remapping of multiple face parts (upper and lower face) in the one-handers group, validating our methodology as suitable for identifying remapping effects. Interestingly, remapping of the cortical neighbour (upper-face) within the one-handers group was away from the missing hand area, while the lips and tongue representations shifted towards the deprived cortex, hinting that the underlying mechanism of remapping is more complex than simple cortical proximity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The cortical neighbour of the hand representation is the forehead</title><p>We first visualised the average group activity resulting from active movements with each of the facial parts (versus rest), within a broad sensorimotor mask. When looking at gross facial organisation at the group-level, we found qualitatively similar activity maps across groups (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), highlighting a robust somatotopy of the face with preserved symmetry across the two hemispheres. These facial maps also indicate an upright orientation of the face in S1, with the forehead located closest to the hand area, followed by the nose, lips, and the tongue located laterally, across all groups. The facial somatotopy presented here therefore suggests that the hand’s cortical neighbour is the forehead (or upper-face), highlighting the need to reassess the often-cited, traditional lip-to-hand marker of cortical remapping in amputees and one-handers. However, conclusions based on threshold-dependant group averages may be misleading as they ignore inter-individual differences.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Group-level activity maps for each facial movement versus rest.</title><p>Group average activity for the forehead (red), nose (yellow), lips (blue) and tongue (green) movements, contrasted to rest, in the (<bold>A</bold>) deprived/non-dominant and (<bold>B</bold>) intact/dominant hemisphere of controls (n=22), amputees (n=17), and one-handers (n=21).

Focusing on the centre of gravity (CoG) of the lips cluster, we first explored changes in the cortical (geodesic) distance between the lips and an anatomical landmark (~1 cm lateral to the hand knob) of amputees and controls.

We also measured the proportion of the deprived hand ROI occupied by the lip-winner surface area (relative to the intact hand area; Laterality index).

Post-hoc comparisons (corrected alpha = 0.01; uncorrected p-values reported) exploring this effect reported significantly greater dissimilarity between facial-part representations in the deprived hemisphere of amputees (<italic>M</italic>=0.214; SE = 0.021; <italic>t</italic><sub>(627.0)</sub>=−4.401, p&lt;.001) and one-handers (<italic>M</italic>=0.273; SE = 0.018; t<sub>(627.0)</sub>=−5.668, p&lt;.001), when compared to their respective intact hemisphere (amputees: <italic>M</italic>=0.152; SE = 0.0205; one-handers: <italic>M</italic>=0.202; SE = 0.018).

This previous work predominantly characterised remapping by investigating shifts of the lip representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Flor et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Birbaumer et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lotze et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grüsser et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Foell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Karl et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">MacIver et al., 2008</xref>). However, by focusing on only one face part, activity elicited by other facial parts (such as the forehead) are not taken into account (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Muret and Makin, 2021</xref>). Here, we explored the relationship of face-to-hand remapping in controls and one-handed groups, and used both univariate (topographic) and multivariate (representational structure) methods to investigate in detail the information content of the face in both the deprived and intact hand and face areas. We found evidence for an upright somatotopy of the face across all groups, confirming that the cortical neighbour to the hand in humans is the upper, not lower, face. We further found little evidence for remapping of all tested facial parts in amputees, with no significant relationship to the presence of PLP. As a positive control, we also recruited individuals that were born without a hand (one-handers), who have previously shown cortical remapping across multiple body parts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hahamy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hahamy and Makin, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amoruso et al., 2021</xref>). Across multiple facial parts (forehead, lips and tongue), one-handers showed evidence for a complex pattern of face remapping in the deprived hand area, with consistent and converging evidence across analysis approaches. Finally, we demonstrate that facial representation in amputees’ deprived hemisphere is more similar to two-handed controls than to one-handers. Together, our findings demonstrate that the face representation in humans is highly plastic, but that this plasticity is restricted by the developmental stage of input deprivation, rather than cortical proximity.</p><p>Firstly, our univariate analyses at both group and individual levels provides converging and clear evidence for an upright orientation of the face in controls, amputees and one-handers. Contrary to previous neuroimaging studies reporting an inverted facial somatotopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Servos et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Yang et al., 1993</xref>; similar to primates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Manger et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jain et al., 2001</xref>), or a lack of somatotopic organisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Iannetti et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nguyen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kopietz et al., 2009</xref>), here we found that the forehead representation borders the hand representation, followed by the nose, the lips, and the tongue located most laterally. These discrepancies may arise from the challenge to find a robust and reliable method to stimulate face parts, and thus elicit detectable cortical activation. In this context, it may be argued that it is difficult to achieve isolated execution of specific facial muscles when performing gross movements without impacting sensory processing of neighbouring facial parts. For instance, tongue movements in our paradigm (e.g. touching the roof of the mouth with the tongue), may be best considered as a holistic inner mouth movement, and forehead movements may be best considered as engaging the upper-face. While this critique is valid, it may also be relevant (although to a smaller degree) for passive paradigms, as stimulation can induce waves that propagate through the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Manfredi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sofia and Jones, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Shao et al., 2016</xref>) and Pacinian receptors were found to activate during stimulation of remote sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Edin and Abbs, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Prsa et al., 2019</xref>). Despite this caveat, both our univariate and multivariate analyses showed that we were successful in isolating sensorimotor representations of the various movements (forehead, nose, lips, and tongue) within our regions of interest (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2</xref> for validation of our approach using vibrotactile stimulation). In other words, even if somatosensory information is overlapping across movements, there is still enough distinct information to separate representational patterns. This finding indicates the suitability of our motor paradigm for teasing apart facial somatotopy, allowing us to characterise the face in greater detail than previously attempted. According to the confirmed upright organisation, if cortical remapping of neighbours exists, we would expect to see the forehead shifting towards and into the hand area – not the lips.</p><p>When looking at face-to-hand remapping in amputees, where the remapping of cortical neighbours has been the prevalent explanation for PLP, we find little evidence of shifts of locality and remapping towards the deprived hand area for facial parts, including the neighbour (forehead) and hypothesised neighbour (lips). This was further confirmed by the Jaccard analysis showing that amputees’ maps were more similar to the ones of controls than of one-handers in the deprived hemisphere, as well as similar spatial representation of amputees’ phantom thumb movements relative to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref>). Our univariate results are further partially supported by our multivariate analysis, where we find no significant changes in dissimilarity of activity patterns across facial parts in amputees’ deprived hand area relative to controls. These results support previous work reporting minimal cortical remapping after amputation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Makin et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kikkert et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Raffin et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that in amputees this area might be functionally unipotent – pertaining to hand-related activity alone and lacking the ability to reorganise after hand loss. However, due to some inconclusive Bayes Factor in our key analyses, we cannot strongly conclude that remapping does not occur in this group. This could be attributed to our relatively small sample (further recruitment was prevented due to Covid-19 restrictions), and in particular, the small proportion of amputees experiencing PLP (11 out of 17). However, pain is not a necessary condition for deprivation-triggered remapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Recanzone et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wang et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andoh et al., 2020</xref>) and vice versa, PLP has been shown to be experienced in absence of remapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">De Nunzio et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, previous studies reporting significant difference between amputees who experienced PLP and those who do not, often employed similar (or smaller) sample sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lotze et al., 2001</xref>), indicating that the expected effect of remapping should be substantial.</p><p>Our findings seem contradictory to the many previous studies reporting lip remapping in amputees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Flor et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Birbaumer et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lotze et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grüsser et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Foell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Karl et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">MacIver et al., 2008</xref>). A major difference with regard to these previous studies, which predominantly focused on a single part of the face, lies in the fact that our study was the first to assess the mapping and potential remapping of multiple facial parts at once. By focusing on the lips only, previous designs excluded other facial parts which may have elicited greater activity in certain areas of S1, resulting in a less accurate delineation of the lip-selective representation. Such down-sampling of body maps, therefore, can lead to biased results and interpretation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Muret and Makin, 2021</xref>). While our design is not exempt from this limitation, the fact that we assessed other parts of the face may explain why our results diverged from previous findings.</p><p>We did find anecdotal evidence for remapping for the tongue within the deprived hand area in amputees. This was a surprising result, as the tongue is not a cortical neighbour to the hand and was not specifically hypothesised to remap in amputees. We also found that amputees demonstrated a different amount of facial information across the two hand areas. Although this multivariate result was not significantly different to that of controls, it demonstrates the plausibility that an inter-hemisphere imbalance may exist to a certain degree, albeit any relationship to PLP is tenuous. While these latter results require further validation, they support our premise that cortical proximity of representations may not be a necessity for remapping to occur. In this context, as our tongue condition could also be classed as an ‘inner mouth’ movement, it is important to note that previous work addressing sensorimotor representations of the mouth and the larynx have demonstrated both lateral and more medial ‘hotspots’ (i.e. a ‘double’ representation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eichert et al., 2020</xref>). The potential tongue remapping in amputees, therefore, may reflect changes in the medial mouth representation, but this would need to be investigated further. Moreover, even if the remapping we observed here goes against the theory of <italic>cortical</italic> proximity, it can still arise from representational proximity at the subcortical level, in particular at the brainstem level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Florence and Kaas, 1995</xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kambi et al., 2014</xref>). While challenging in humans, mapping both the cuneate and trigeminal nuclei would be critical to provide a more complete picture regarding the role of proximity in remapping.</p><p>We did find converging and conclusive evidence for cortical remapping of multiple facial parts, both neighbours (forehead) and non-neighbours (lips and tongue) in our congenital one-handed group. Here, the pattern of remapping is strikingly different to that of cortical neighbourhood theories. Specifically, the location of the cortical neighbour – the forehead – is shown to shift away from the deprived hand area, which is subsequently more activated by the lips and the tongue than is the intact hand area. The increase of facial activity in the deprived hand area is in turn supported by our multivariate results, whereby significantly greater information content for the face was found in the deprived hand area for one-handers when compared to controls. One-handers’ deprived hand area, therefore, seems to have increased discriminability between different facial movements. It is difficult to ascertain from our study the drivers of this remapping. It has been suggested previously that remapping within this group may be driven by functionally-relevant behaviour substituting for the loss of the limb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hahamy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amoruso et al., 2021</xref>). Together with the recent evidence that lip information content is already significant in the hand area of two-handed participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Muret et al., 2022</xref>), compensatory behaviour since developmental stages might further uncover (and even potentiate) this underlying latent activity. Alternative explanations relate to an overall and unspecific release of inhibition (i.e. decreased GABA) in the missing hand area, allowing for latent activity of other body parts to be detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hahamy et al., 2017</xref>). While speculative, our results tend to support the former, as we report remapping for facial parts which have the ability to compensate for hand function, for example using the lips and/or mouth to manipulate an object, and a lack of remapping into the hand area for those that cannot (the forehead and nose). This increased activity from body parts compensating for hand function may represent a stabilising mechanism, aimed at preserving the integrity of the sensorimotor network and its function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Muret and Makin, 2021</xref>). The deprived hand area in one-handers, therefore, may reflect domain specificity – suitable for adapting to multiple body parts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amoruso et al., 2021</xref>), which may preserve the role of the hand area by sustaining its hand-function related information content.</p><p>A limitation that should be acknowledged arises from the potential contribution to S1 from M1 activity. Since these cortical areas are neighbours, it is difficult to separate them with certainty. We minimised the contribution of M1 by taking multiple acquisition and pre-processing steps, including the use of anatomical delineation at the individual level, as well as a comprehensive analytical approach (e.g. both univariate and multivariate techniques). Perhaps most convincingly, our RSA evidence for remapping in congenital one-handers but not in amputees were qualitatively stronger in S1 relative to M1. Furthermore, it has been claimed that active movements may produce different cortical maps to those with passive stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Flor et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andoh et al., 2018</xref>), and previous work demonstrating a relationship between cortical remapping and PLP tended to use passive stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Flor et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Birbaumer et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Foell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Karl et al., 2001</xref>). However, we do not think this methodological difference underlies our contrasting results as movement-induced lip activity has been shown to demonstrate lip remapping before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lotze et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">MacIver et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Striem-Amit et al., 2018</xref>), indicating that an active paradigm is suitable for assessing cortical remapping (if it exists). Conversely, a recent study using passive lip stimulation in amputees did not find any evidence for remapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Philip et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, we recently ran a study which found that S1 topography and multivariate representational structure are similar across active and passive paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sanders et al., 2019</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2</xref> for a comparison between active and passive facial stimulation). In our view, the choice of an active paradigm is the most reflective of naturalistic tactile inputs in everyday life. Together with robust evidence for remapping in one-handers using all the methods tested here, our choice of active paradigm is clearly suitable to identify topographic organisation and remapping, and is practically accessible and translatable to fMRI designs.</p><p>To conclude, both our univariate and multivariate analyses found consistent evidence for a complex pattern of face remapping in congenital one-handers, in line with the theory suggesting remapping in this group reflects compensatory behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Muret and Makin, 2021</xref>). This is in contrast to amputees, where we find little evidence for cortical remapping, indicating a relative stability of both the hand and face representation after limb loss. By and large, remapping measures were not linked to PLP. Our results call for a reassessment of traditional remapping theories based on cortical proximity, and future research into potential remapping of the inner mouth representation after limb loss.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Seventeen individuals with acquired unilateral upper-limb amputation (age; <italic>M</italic>=53.71, SE = 2.69, women; n=4, missing right hand; n=9), twenty-one individuals with unilateral congenital transverse arrest (age; <italic>M</italic>=42.67, SE = 3.04, women; n=13, missing right hand; n=8) and twenty-two two-handed controls (age; <italic>M</italic>=45.55, SE = 2.02, women; n=10, left-handers; n=6) were recruited (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> for full details). Two additional amputees who were recruited for the study did not participate in the scanning session due to MRI safety concerns, and further recruitment was stalled due to Covid-19 restrictions. The proportion of participants with intact/dominant right hand, as well as gender, were matched across groups (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>χ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula><sub>(2)</sub>=2.674, p=0.263; <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>χ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula><sub>(2)</sub>=5.593, p=0.061). While significant differences between groups were observed for age (<italic>H</italic><sub>(2)</sub>=7.689, p=.021), post-hoc comparisons confirmed non-significant differences between amputees and one-handers relative to controls. Age covariates were therefore only included in statistical analyses when direct comparisons between amputees and one-handers were carried out. Procedures were in accordance with NHS National Research Ethics Service approval (18/LO/0474), and written informed consent was obtained.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Demographic details for amputees (A01-17) and congenital one-handers (C01-21).</title><p>Level of limb deficiency is as follows: 1=limb loss above elbow (transhumeral), 2=limb loss below elbow (transradial); L=left, <italic>R</italic>=right; PLS &amp; PLP frequency: 0=no sensation or pain, 1=once or less per month, 2=several times per month, 3=once a week, 4=daily, 5=all the time. <sup>*</sup>PLP intensity rating was on average.

asked to rate the frequency of PLP experience within the last year. They also rated the intensity of their worst PLP experience during the last week (or in a typical week involving PLP; 0=no pain, 100=worst pain imaginable). A chronic measure of PLP was calculated by dividing the worst PLP intensity in the last week by PLP frequency (1=all the time, 2=daily, 3=once a week, 4=several times per month, 5=once or less per month). This approach which takes into account the chronic aspect of PLP has been used successfully before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Makin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Makin et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kikkert et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Draganski et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lyu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kikkert et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kikkert et al., 2017</xref>), and has high inter-session reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kikkert et al., 2018</xref>).

This paradigm was chosen because it enabled bilateral activation of S1 simultaneously, allowing us to directly compare activity patterns between the two hemispheres (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2</xref> for validation of the active paradigm and Discussion for other considerations). Participants were also instructed to move their left and right thumb (amputees were asked to flex/extend their phantom thumb to the best of their ability; one-handers were asked to imagine such movement), resulting in 6 conditions. Since the way one-handers performed the missing thumb condition could not be controlled (e.g., visual or motor imagery), this condition was not considered for analysis. Baseline (i.e. rest) was included as a 7<sup>th</sup> condition. Specific instructions involved: raising eyebrows (forehead), flaring nostrils (nose), puckering lips (lips), tapping tongue to the roof of the mouth (tongue), flexing and extending (thumb). The protocol comprised of 8 s blocks, with each condition repeated 4 times per run (5 times for baseline), over 3 functional runs. Before entering the scanner, participants practised each movement with the experimenter to ensure that the movement could be executed and to standardise each movement across participants (e.g. specificity and pace). Performance during scanning was visually monitored online with the use of an eye-tracker camera and an experimenter dedicated to this task. Note that multiple participants reported during the experimenter briefing that they could not successfully flare their nostrils, and were therefore instructed to attempt moving their nose in the scanner.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>MRI data acquisition</title><p>Functional and anatomical MRI data were obtained using a 3 Tesla Prisma MRI scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) with a 32-channel head coil. Anatomical data was acquired using a T1-weighted sequence (MPRAGE), with the following parameters: TR = 2530ms; TE = 3.34ms; flip angle = 7°; voxel size = 1 mm isotropic resolution. Functional data based on the blood oxygenation level dependant (BOLD) signal were acquired using a multiband T2*-weighted pulse sequence, with a between-slice acceleration factor of 4 and no in-slice acceleration (TR = 1450ms; TE = 35ms; flip angle = 70°; voxel size = 2 mm isotropic resolution; imaging matrix = 106 x 106; FOV = 212 mm). 72 slices were oriented in the transversal plane.

Field maps were used for distortion correction of functional data.</p><p>For each participant, we calculated a midspace between the three functional runs, that is the average space in which the images are minimally reorientated. Each functional run was then aligned to the midspace and registered to structural images (within-subject) using FMRIB’s Linear Image Registration Tool (FLIRT), and optimised using Boundary-Based Registration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Greve and Fischl, 2009</xref>).

The design was composed of 6 explanatory variables for each movement, convolved with a double-gamma hemodynamic response function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Friston et al., 1998</xref>), and its temporal derivative. The six motion parameters were included as regressors of no interest.

Although the primary motor cortex (M1) and S1 are expected to activate during facial movement we primarily focused on S1 remapping due to the traditional focus in the maladaptive plasticity literature on S1 representational shifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flor et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, M1 topography tends to be less well-defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Schieber, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Graziano and Aflalo, 2007</xref>), and so characterisation of typical facial topography may be more apparent in S1. Nevertheless, we wish to note that due to the proximity of S1 to M1, it is possible that marginal contribution from M1 may have affected our S1 activity profiles.</p><p>Firstly, S1 was defined on the average surface using probabilistic cytoarchitectonic maps, by selecting nodes for Brodmann Areas (BAs) 1, 2, 3 a, and 3b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wiestler and Diedrichsen, 2013</xref>). The S1 hand ROI (hereafter hand ROI) was defined by selecting the nodes approximately ~1 cm below and ~2.5 cm above the anatomical hand knob. In contrast to earlier work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wesselink and Ejaz, 2019</xref>), we defined a conservative lateral boundary of the hand ROI (~1 cm below the hand knob) to ensure there was limited facial activity captured. From the remaining parts of S1, the medial region was discarded and the lateral region was selected as a first approximation of the S1 face ROI (hereafter face ROI; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Regions of interest and winner-takes-all analysis in the primary somatosensory cortex for an example participant.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Regions of interest (ROIs) used for univariate analyses are outlined in purple for the hand, and in orange for the face.

The hand and lateral ROIs were then projected into individual brains via the reconstructed individual anatomical surfaces. As the secondary somatosensory cortex (S2) contains a crude somatotopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ruben et al., 2001</xref>), the lateral ROI was further trimmed in participant’s structural space by removing the overlap with S2. S2 was defined in MNI152 space using the Juelich Histological Atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wiech et al., 2014</xref>). The S2 ROI was registered to participants’ structural space using an inversion of the nonlinear registration carried about by FNIRT. The remaining lateral ROI with the overlap from S2 removed was used as the face ROI for all univariate analyses. We note that due to the probabilistic nature of these masks, there could be some marginal contribution from S2 in our estimated face area.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Winner-takes-all approach</title><p>To characterise S1 facial topography, the hand and face ROIs were combined to produce an overall S1 ROI (minus the medial region), and a winner-takes-all approach was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). For each participant, thresholded z-statistics averaged across the three functional runs were assigned to one of four face parts (forehead, nose, lips, tongue), dependent on which facial movement relatively showed maximal activity within the S1 ROI. Face-winners (i.e. the output of the winner-takes-all) were then projected to the individual’s anatomical surface. Note that we excluded the thumb, which covered ~66% of the deprived hand ROI surface area in amputees and controls (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref>). This allowed us to align our analysis with previous research, and to draw comparisons of facial somatotopy across all groups (one-handers do not have a phantom limb, and therefore we cannot probe the ‘missing’ hand representation directly). All subsequent analyses at the individual’s anatomical surface level were computed using Connectome Workbench (v1.4.2).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Cortical distance analysis</title><p>To assess possible shifts in facial representations towards the hand area, the centre-of-gravity (CoG) of each face-winner map was calculated in each hemisphere. The CoG was weighted by cluster size meaning that in the event of multiple clusters contributing to the calculation of a single CoG for a face-winner map, the voxels in the larger cluster are overweighted relative to those in the smaller clusters. The geodesic cortical distance between each movement’s CoG and a predefined cortical anchor was computed. The cortical anchor was defined as the midpoint of the lateral border of the hand ROI (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). This anatomical landmark was drawn manually for each participant, the midpoint calculated, and both were visually confirmed by a second experimenter. The geodesic distance was assigned a negative value if the movement’s CoG was located below the hand border (i.e. laterally).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Surface area calculation</title><p>To assess possible remapping into the hand area, a secondary winner-takes-all analysis was restricted to the hand ROI only. The surface area coverage (mm<sup>2</sup>) for each face-winner were computed on the individual anatomical inflated surface. We next calculated the proportion of the hand ROI occupied by each face part by dividing each face-winner’s surface area by the total hand ROI surface area for each individual.

Note that this approach characterises cortical remapping in relation to the intact hemisphere and has been used in numerous previous studies on amputees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Flor et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Birbaumer et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grüsser et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Foell et al., 2014</xref>).

For each amputee, the similarity across the 22 controls and 21 one-handers respectively was averaged. The same approach was used to compare the other groups. For intra-group similarity, the participant analysed was excluded from the rest of its group to avoid comparing it to itself.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Group-level visualisations</title><p>Prior to group-level visualisations, participant information regarding hand dominance (controls) and deprived hemisphere (one-handed participants) were used to sagittal-flip raw pre-processed data, such that the brain activity corresponding to the non-dominant/missing hand is always represented in the left hemisphere (note that a similar proportion of participants were flipped across groups). Group-level statistical parameter maps were then created with a threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) approach using FSL’s Randomise tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Winkler et al., 2014</xref>). TFCE is a nonparametric, permutation-based method for cluster formation, and has been shown to demonstrate improved sensitivity when compared to typical thresholding methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Smith and Nichols, 2009</xref>). Group activity mixed-effect maps were calculated for each fixed-effect (i.e. averaged across the three functional runs) parameter estimate of a face movement (forehead, nose, lips, tongue) contrasted to baseline. Prior to permutation (n=5000), parameter estimates were masked with a sensorimotor mask, defined as the precentral and postcentral gyrus from the Harvard Cortical Atlas. A family-wise error correction of p&lt;0.05 and variance smoothing of 5 mm (as recommended for datasets with less than 20 participants) were used. Resulting clusters were thresholded at p&lt;0.01 and projected to a group cortical surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Glasser et al., 2016</xref>) using Connectome Workbench (v1.4.2), and activity is visualised in Brodmann Areas 1, 2, 3 a, 3b, and 4.</p><p>As well as activity maps, we also visualised the winner-takes-all output at the group-level.

Resulting consistency maps were then projected to a group cortical surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Glasser et al., 2016</xref>) using Connectome Workbench (v1.4.2) for visualisation only.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Multivariate representational analysis</title><p>Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nili et al., 2014</xref>) was used to assess the multivariate relationship between activity patterns generated by each face part. RSA was conducted in the hand and face ROIs to explore possible remapping across representational features between groups. To ensure the selectivity of the hand and face areas, the ROIs used for univariate analyses were each further trimmed medially by ~1 cm, creating a 1 cm gap between the hand and face ROIs. For each participant, parameter estimates for the four facial movements (forehead, nose, lips and tongue) and the contralateral thumb (for controls and amputees only) were extracted from all voxels within the chosen ROI, as well as residuals from each runs’ first-level analysis (three runs in total). Multidimensional noise normalisation was used to increase reliability of distance estimates (noisier voxels are down-weighted), based on the voxel’s covariance matrix calculated from the GLM residuals. Dissimilarity between resulting facial activity patterns were then measured pairwise using cross-validated Mahalanobis distances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Walther et al., 2016</xref>). Due to cross-validation, the expected value of the distance is zero if two patterns are not statistically different from each other. Distances significantly different from zero indicate the two representational patterns are different; negative distances indicate noise. Larger distances for movement pairs therefore suggest greater discriminative ability for the chosen ROI. The resulting six unique inter-facial representational distances (10 unique distances when including the thumb for controls and amputees only) were characterised in a representation dissimilarity matrix (RDM). Multidimensional scaling (MDS) was also used to project the higher-dimensional RDM into lower-dimensional space, whilst preserving inter-facial dissimilarity, for visualisation purposes only. Analysis was conducted on an adapted version of the RSA Toolbox in MATLAB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nili et al., 2014</xref>), customised for FSL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wesselink and Maimon-Mor, 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>All statistical analyses were carried out using JASP (Version 0.14). Outliers were classified as +/-3 standard deviations to the mean. We chose to not remove outliers in our analyses and checked that the significance and direction of the results did not change if identified outliers were removed (see below for number of outliers). When appropriate, univariate analyses was compared using parametric statistics. To assess normality for parametric tests, Shapiro-Wilk tests were run on residuals in combination with inspection of Q-Q plots and reporting of Levene’s Test for Equality of Variances. Where stated, non-parametric test statistics are reported where the assumption of normality has been violated. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used to explore group differences to controls in cortical distances (n=1 outlier for forehead in controls; n=1 outlier for tongue in controls). Each mixed ANOVA had a between-subject factor of Group (Controls x Amputees; Controls x One-handers) and a repeated-measures factor of Hemisphere (Intact/Dominant x Deprived/Non-dominant), and was run separately for each facial movement (forehead, nose, lips and tongue). We controlled for brain size volume when comparing cortical distances between groups. Post-hoc comparisons were conducted with a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (reported corrected alpha and uncorrected p-values in text). Due to issues relating to integration of the correction for brain size in follow-up analyses, both the effect size (noted as ~<italic>d</italic>) and Bayes factor (noted as ~<italic>BF<sub>10</sub></italic>) in the post-hoc t-tests were not accounting for brain size. If assumptions of normality were violated, the difference between cortical distances in the intact and deprived hemisphere were calculated, and the group difference between one-handed groups and controls was computed using a Mann-Whitney U test. Resulting statistics are reported alongside the mixed ANOVA output. Independent <italic>t</italic>-tests were used to calculate laterality indices group differences (no outliers identified across groups). We reported the corresponding Bayes Factor (<italic>BF<sub>10</sub></italic>), defined as the relative support for the alternative hypothesis, for non-significant interactions and post-hoc comparisons. While it is generally agreed that it is difficult to establish a cut-off for what consists sufficient evidence, we used the threshold of <italic>BF</italic> &lt;1/3 as sufficient evidence in support of the null, consistent with others in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wetzels et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dienes, 2014</xref>) (though see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kass and Raftery, 1995</xref>). The Cauchy prior width was set at 0.707 (JASP’s default). To investigate whether remapping measures were related to PLP, we used a one-tailed Mann-Whitney U tests to compare laterality indices of amputees with (n=11) and without PLP (n=6) for relevant facial parts, under the hypothesis that PLP should result in greater remapping (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">Appendix 1—figure 4</xref> for the analogous analysis for the cortical geodesic distances).</p><p>For Jaccard analysis of similarity, a linear mixed model (LMM) analysis was used to compare the similarity of amputees’ maps relative to those of controls and one-handers (no outliers), containing fixed factors of group (controls and one-handers), hemisphere (intact, deprived) and facial movement (forehead, nose, lips and tongue). A random effect of participant, as well as covariates of age, were also included in the model. A similar analysis was used to compare the similarity of controls’ maps relative to those of amputees and one-handers respectively (n=1 outlier for the nose in controls). For multivariate analyses, the same analysis was used but with the fixed factors of group (controls, amputees, and one-handers), hemisphere (intact, deprived) and face-face pairs (6 unique representational distances; n=1 outlier in hand and face ROI for controls). All LMM’s were carried out in Jamovi (version 1.6.15) under restricted maximum likelihood (REML) conditions with Satterthwaite adjustment for the degrees of freedom.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>Senior editor, <italic>eLife</italic></p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Writing – original draft, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Written Informed consent, and consent to publish, was obtained from all participants.

Once the actuators had been attached and the participant was inside the scanner bore, a short thresholding procedure was carried out, whereby the pressure (KPa) of the actuators was adjusted to reach above-threshold subjective equality across body parts. The procedure began by defining the pressure for the least sensitive body part – the nose. Here pressure began at 35 KPa and was increased or decreased in step-sizes of 5 KPa. Stimulation length was 8 seconds and participants had 3 seconds to make their response, for example pressing a button to either increase/decrease the pressure or state that the pressure was ‘ideal’ (clearly perceived). The nose was then used as a reference body part, whereby 8 seconds of stimulation was administered to the nose followed by 8 seconds of stimulation to one of the other body parts (forehead, lips, tongue, left and right thumb), that is the target body part. The participant then had 3 seconds to respond via button-press in order to adjust the pressure (increasing or decreasing by 5 KPa) of the target body part in order to generate a similar tactile experience to that of the nose. Throughout thresholding, if the participant responded with ‘ideal’ twice, or if 5 trials had been administered, the resulting pressure was chosen for that body part. During the functional MRI task, each body part was stimulated using the thresholded KPa and a stimulation frequency of 5 Hz. The same block design (with similar time-course) as for the Active sessions was used (i.e., 8 s stimulation blocks, each condition repeated 4 times per run, 5 times for baseline), but over 4 functional runs instead of 3.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s9-1-3"><title>Functional MRI data acquisition and analysis</title><p>Functional and anatomical MRI data for the Passive and Active2 sessions were obtained with the same MRI parameters as for the Active1 session (collected on the same scanner as the data collected for the main analyses), but on a different 3T Prisma scanner.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Christian Büchel as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Moritz Wurm (Reviewer #1); Sliman J Bensmaia (Reviewer #2); Olivier Collignon (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>After consultation with the other reviewers, we believe that this is an interesting and potentially important study but that significant clarifications are needed to fully convince us that the claims are indeed supported by the data. This opinion was reached because ultimately we feel additional analyses are required to address some of the key concerns raised.</p><p>All the points raised in the separate reviews should be addressed but here follows what are the key elements that were discussed in the consultation phase.</p><p>One concern links to the claim that it was unsolved whether the face representation in S1 is upside-down in humans as it has been shown in non-human primates. To us, it seems there is already ample evidence that an up-right organization of the face would be observed in the human S1. Even if the fMRI data in humans triggered some debates it seems it did not capture sufficient momentum to revisit the original upright face homunculus as described by Penfield itself, since most textbook representations continue to include upright face representations.</p><p>The originality of the current study compared to previous work done by the authors themselves should be clarified.</p><p>Given that a motor task was used it seems relevant to not only limit analyses to S1 but also include M1; the claim the M1 maps are less clear than those in S1 is not fully convincing.</p><p>The authors should provide additional data to support some of the claims made in the paper. In particular, the authors should be coherent in how they treat the nose condition across uni and multivariate analyses. Our feeling is that the nose should be reintroduced in the analytical pipeline and distance/overlap (both uni and multi-variate) should be calculated including the nose. If the authors decide to remove this condition, they should provide empirical support for doing so, and do it for all analytical steps if the reason is that the activity triggered by this condition was unreliable. Similarly, the reason to not include the thumb condition in some analyses and sometimes selectively in one-handers is unclear. This seems actually an interesting condition to fully explore, we guess for the same reasons the authors included the condition in the design. It seems the rationale relates to the fact one-handers have no fantom hand sensation but this was known beforehand, so if this is the reason, why include this condition?</p><p>The difference between the winner-takes-all analysis and the group consistency maps should be clarified.</p><p>Finally, there are concerns about the claim that one-handers differ from amputees when no direct statistical data support such a claim.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Using fMRI-based univariate and multivariate analyses, Root, Muret, et al. investigated the topography of face representation in the somatosensory cortex of typically developed two-handed individuals and individuals with a congenital and acquired missing hand. They provide clear evidence for an upright face topography in the somatosensory cortex in all three groups. Moreover, they find that one-handers, but not amputees, show shorter distances from lip representations to the hand area, suggesting a remapping of the lips. They also find a shift away of the upper face from the deprived hand area in one-handers, and significantly greater dissimilarity between face part representations in amputees and one-handers. The authors argue that this pattern of remapping is different to that of cortical neighborhood theories and points toward a remapping of face parts which have the ability to compensate for hand function, e.g., using the lips/mouth to manipulate an object.</p><p>These findings provide interesting insights into the topographic organization of face parts and the principles of cortical (re)organization. The authors use several analytical approaches, including distance measures between hand- and face-part-responsive regions and representational similarity analysis (RSA). Particularly commendable is the rigorous statistical analysis, such as the use of Bayesian comparisons, and careful interpretation of absent group differences.</p><p>There are only a few aspects that could be clarified or added:</p><p>Only in the discussion does it become clear that an active execution paradigm is used to map the somatotopy of facial parts. This could be clarified earlier, for example at the beginning of the Results section. The use of an execution paradigm seems to be a reasonable choice, which is supported by the robust topographic organization they find and the comparison between active and passive paradigms. However, the topographic organization is not restricted to S1; a similar organization can be found in the adjacent motor cortex. This could be mentioned in the Results, and perhaps a few words on these findings and/or the relationship between somatotopy and mototopy with regard to remapping might be informative.</p><p>It is a bit unclear why the nose is not included in the main winner-takes-all analysis (Figure 1) and only shown in the Supplementary Methods. The authors argue in the Methods section that they excluded the nose in the univariate analysis due to weak activation, whereas they include it in the RSA due to the increased sensitivity to subtle changes in activity patterns. This appears a bit inconsistent because also the RSA should suffer from weak voxelwise activations. In Supplementary Figure 1, the activation does not look particularly weak, and the winner-takes-all approach indicates that there are voxels that are most strongly activated for the nose compared to all other facial parts. This could be explained in more detail. Related to this point, did the authors test for nose remapping in amputees and one-handers?</p><p>What happened with the thumb movement imagery in the one-handers? Suppl. Figure 2 shows the respective effects for amputees and controls. Did the one-handers fail to show significant effects? It might be interesting to compare the one-handers' imagery effects with the execution effects in amputees and controls, even if putative differences might be less straightforward to interpret (might be due to representational differences or different paradigms).</p><p>Related to this point, the face-thumb distance values in Figure 5 are only shown for the controls and amputees. For the reader, the reason is not immediately clear, so perhaps this could be clarified in the figure caption.</p><p>There are differences between the forehead clusters found in the winner-takes-all analysis (Figure 1) and the group consistency maps; the latter showing a strong overlap with the hand ROI. For the lips and tongue, the maps appear much more consistent. What could be the reason for this discrepancy, and how can the overlap between hand ROI and forehead be interpreted?</p><p>When reporting the weak but significant result of reduced forehead coverage in amputees, the authors could also refer to the BF=1.5, which suggests only anecdotal evidence.</p><p>The authors did not remove outliers, which is justified, and the authors checked that the significance and direction of the results did not change if identified outliers were removed. However, could the authors indicate the number of outliers?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>After amputation, the deafferented limb representation in the somatosensory cortex is activated by stimulation of other body parts. A common belief is that the lower face, including the lips, preferentially &quot;invades&quot; deafferented cortex due to its proximity to cortex. In the present study, this hypothesis is tested by mapping the somatosensory cortex using fMRI as amputees, congenital one-handers, and controls moved their forehead, nose, lips or tongue. First, they found that, unlike its counterpart in monkeys, the representation of the face in the somatosensory cortex is right-side up, with the forehead most medial (and abutting the hand) and the lips most lateral. Second, there was little evidence of &quot;reorganization&quot; of the deafferented cortex in amputees, even when tested with movements across the entire face rather than only the lips. Third, congenital one-handers showed significant reorganization of deafferented cortex, characterized principally by the invasion of the lower face, in contrast to predictions from the hypothesis that proximity was the driving factor. Fourth, there was no relationship between phantom limb pain reports and reorganization.</p><p>As a non-expert in fMRI, I cannot evaluate the methodology. That being said, I am not convinced that the current consensus is that the representation of the face in humans is flipped compared to that of monkeys. Indeed, the overwhelming majority of somatosensory homunculi I have seen for humans has the face right side up. My sense is that the fMRI studies that found an inverted (monkey-like) face representation contradict the consensus. Similarly, it is not clear to me how the observations (1) of limited reorganization in amputees, (2) of significant reorganization in congenital one-handers, and (3) of the lack of relationship between PLP and reorganization is novel given the previous work by this group. Perhaps the authors could more clearly articulate the novelty of these results compared to their previous findings. Finally, Jon Kaas and colleagues (notably Niraj Jain) have provided evidence in experiments with monkeys that much of the observed reorganization in the somatosensory cortex is inherited from plasticity in the brain stem. Jain did not find an increased propensity for axons to cross the septum between face and hand representations after (simulated) amputation. From this perspective, the relevant proximity would be that of the cuneate and trigeminal nuclei and it would be critical to map out the somatotopic organization of the trigeminal and cuneate nuclei to test hypotheses about the role of proximity in this remapping.</p><p>A few comments:</p><p>Which cortical fields do the authors refer to as primary somatosensory cortex? Brodmann's areas 3a, 3b, 1 and 2?</p><p>On line 322, I suggest using &quot;completeness&quot; rather than &quot;completion.&quot;</p><p>On line 372, I suggest using &quot;critique&quot; rather than &quot;limitation.&quot;</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In their study, the authors set up to challenge the long-held claim that cortical remapping in the somatosensory cortex in hand deprived cortical territories follows somatotopic proximity (the hand region gets invaded by cortical neighbors) as classically assumed. In contrast to this claim, the authors suggest that remapping may not follow cortical proximity but instead functional rules as to how the effector is used. Their data indeed suggest that the deprived hand area is not invaded by the forefront which is the cortical neighbor but instead by the lips which may compensate for hand loss in manipulating objects. Interestingly the authors suggest this is mostly the case for one-handers but not in amputees for who the reorganization seems more limited in general (but see my comments below on this last point).</p><p>This is a remarkably ambitious study that has been skilfully executed on a strong number of participants in each group. The complementarity of state-of-the-art uni- and multi-variate analyses are in the service of the research question, and the paper is clearly written. The main contribution of this paper, relative to previous studies including those of the same group, resides in the mapping of multiple face parts all at once in the three groups.</p><p>In the winner takes all approach, the authors only include 3 face parts but exclude from the analyses the nose and the thumb. I am not fully convinced by the rationale for not including nose in univariate analyses – because it does not trigger reliable activity – while keeping it for representational similarity analyses. I think it would be better to include the nose in all analyses or demonstrate this condition is indeed &quot;noisy&quot; and then remove it from all the analyses. Indeed, if the activity triggered by nose movement is unreliable, it should also affect multivariate.</p><p>The rationale for not including the hand is maybe more convincing as it seems to induce activity in both controls and amputees but not in one-handers. First, it would be great to visualize this effect, at least as supplemental material to support the decision. Then, this brings the interesting possibility that enhanced invasion of hand territory by lips in one-handers might link to the possibility to observe hand-related activity in the presupposed hand region in this population. Maybe the authors may consider linking these.</p><p>The use of the geodesic distance between the center of gravity in the Winner Take All (WTA) maps between each movement and a predefined cortical anchor is clever. More details about how the Center Of Gravity (COG) was computed on spatially disparate regions might deserve more explanations, however. Moreover, imagine that for some reason the forefront region extends both dorsally and ventrally in a specific population (eg amputees), the COG would stay unaffected but the overlap between hand and forefront would increase. The analyses on the surface area within hand ROI for lips and forehead nicely complement the WTA analyses and suggest higher overlap for lips and lower overlap for forehead but none of the maps or graphs presented clearly show those results – maybe the authors could consider adding a figure clearly highlighting that there is indeed more lip activity IN the hand region.</p><p>In addition to overlap analyses between hand and other body parts, the authors may also want to consider doing some Jaccard similarity analyses between the maps of the 3 groups to support the idea that amputees are more alike controls than one-handers in their topographic activity, which again does not appear clear from the figures.</p><p>This brings to another concern I have related to the claim that the change in the cortical organization they observe is mostly observed in one-handers. It seems that most of this conclusion relies on the fact that some effects are observed in one-handers but not in amputees when compared to controls, however, no direct comparisons are done between amputees and one-handers so we may be in an erroneous inference about the interaction when this is actually not tested (Nieuwenhuis, 11). For instance, the shift away from the hand/face border of the forehead is also (mildly) significant in amputees (as observed more strongly in one-handers) so the conclusion (eg from the subtitle of the Results section) that it is specific to one-hander might not fully be supported by the data. Similar to the invasion of the hand territory from the lips which is significant in amputees in terms of surface area. All together this calls for toning down the idea that plasticity is restricted to congenital deprivation (eg last sentence of the abstract). Even if numerically stronger, if I am not wrong, there are no stats showing remapping is indeed stronger in one-handers than in amputees and actually, amputees show significant effects when compared to controls along the lines as those shown (even if more strongly) in one-handers. Also, maybe the authors could explore whether there is actually a link between the number of years without hand and the remapping effects.</p><p>One hypothesis generated by the data is that lips remap in the deprived hand area because lips serve compensatory functions. Actually, also in controls, lips and hands can be used to manipulate objects, in contrast to the forehead. One may thus wonder if the preferential presence of lips in the hand region is not latent even in controls as they both link in functions?</p><p>1) The authors should re-assess their conclusion that remapping is mostly present in one-handers than amputees in absence of a convincing statistical demonstration that it is actually the case. The amputees show similar effects or trends for similar remapping as those observed in one-handers. maybe one source of this lower reliability in the effects of amputees links to the lower number of participants and their higher variability in ethology (eg age of amputation etc…). Maybe the authors could explore whether there is actually a link between the number of years without hand and the remapping effects.</p><p>2) The authors should be coherent in the body part they include for their univariate and multivariate analyses. I let them decide whether they think the nose condition was too noisy (eg because people could not follow instructions to move the nose) or not. If they think the condition however did not elicit reliable activity, this should affect both uni and multivariate analyses.</p><p>3) I recommend the authors show the map elicited by hand movement in the three groups, support their claim that this is only reliably observed in controls and amputees but not one-handers; and maybe discuss (or even better do some analyses on that, eg correlation) the possibility that the preservation of the hand map is potentially a factor influencing remapping (eg do the amputees with the most salient remaining hand maps are those showing less remapping?).</p><p>4) The authors should clarify in their figure where do they observe that the lip increases activity WITHIN the hand region in one-handers.</p><p>5) The fact that the univariate results of Figure 1 do not follow well those presented in the WTA maps deserves some consideration. Indeed, what seems striking in Figure 1 is that the forehead activity extends more dorsally in one-handers, approaching the hand region, which contradicts conclusions from WTA. Also, it might be informative to have an outline of the brain mask (in all figures) of the S1 ROI used for constraining spatially the univariate analyses.</p><p>6) In Figure 5 the thumb is not represented in one-handers. It would be interesting for the reader to see that indeed the instruction to move the thumb did not elicit a reliable activity map and what was the criteria to selectively remove it in one-handers aside from the fact they don't experience fantom sensation. It is also unclear why the thumb is not displayed in the MDS while it's computed in the RDM of controls and amputees.</p><p>7) Maybe discuss further the potential (latent) link between hand and lips as they both can be used to manipulate objects even in controls.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.76158.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>After consultation with the other reviewers, we believe that this is an interesting and potentially important study but that significant clarifications are needed to fully convince us that the claims are indeed supported by the data.

But we think this reflects the disproportional impact of Penfield’s cartooning of the homunculus, despite the scarcity and inherent limitations of the data supporting his work and the (over-)simplified depiction of the Homunculus (as we detail below). We believe that the silent consensus is that sensorimotor body representation is more nuanced then revealed by this textbook cartoon, and as such, the idea that the hand area is neighbouring the lower face in humans have been strongly embedded in contemporary research in particular relating to brain reorganisation. As an illustrating example, the first paper to describe the lower face (lips and cheek) shifting towards the hand area (Flor et al., 1995), has been cited over 2,000 times. This is one of many related examples, and when put together there is no doubt that this misrepresentation is highly popular and has influenced not only development of treatment for phantom limb pain, but also other related condition, such as complex regional pain syndrome (Maihöfner et al., 2004, 2006), dystonia (Burman et al., 2009; Elbert et al., 1998) and spinal cord injury (Wrigley et al., 2009). This empirical ambiguity is due to the fact that the vast majority of human studies is focused on lip representation, combined with the methodological difficulties of stimulating the face in an MRI environment. Consequently, our study is among the first to replicate Penfield’s observations with converging neuroimaging analyses in individual participants.</p><p>Having said all that, to appease the reviewers, we have re-written the introduction to reflect the inclusive neuroimaging results, and nuanced our claim throughout the manuscript (starting with the title and abstract) to reflect our findings confirm the original observations made by Penfield and colleagues.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The originality of the current study compared to previous work done by the authors themselves should be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>We are happy to clarify on the conceptual, methodological and empirical innovation our study provides.

We are going beyond remapping by using RSA, which allows us to ask not only if new information is available in the deprived cortex (as well as the native face area), but also whether this new information is structured consistently across individuals and groups. We show that representational content is enhanced in the deprived cortex one-handers whereas it is stable in amputees relative to controls (and to their intact hand region).</p></list-item><list-item><label>(4)</label><p>Based on previous studies, the assumption was that reorganisation in congenital one-handers was relatively unspecific, affecting all tested body parts.

As detailed below and summarised in the new supplementary figures (Figure 6 and 7 —figure supplement 1), we find very similar representational structure for both face organisation and “reorganisation” across groups to what we reported originally in S1.

Comm.; Makin et al., 2013 <italic>eLife</italic>; Hahamy et al., 2017). As we note in our original manuscript, activity elicited by thumb movements dominates most of the hand area (66%) in both amputees and controls. To reduce the discrepancy in our analyses across all three groups, we cannot include this condition. For this reason, we decided to remove the hand-face dissimilarity analysis which we included in our original manuscript.

Interestingly, the statistical evidence for remapping in the hand ROI were similar, though qualitatively stronger in S1 (i.e., significant difference between one-handers and two-handed controls only observed in S1).</p><p>When looking at face-face pairwise dissimilarity in the M1 hand ROI (Figure 6 —figure supplement 1), we found a non-significant three-way interaction of Group (Amputees x Controls x One-handers) x Hemisphere (Intact x Deprived) x Face-Face pair (including the nose) (<italic>F<sub>(10,627.0)</sub></italic>=0.398, <italic>p</italic>=0.948; controlled for age) and a significant Group x Hemisphere interaction (<italic>F<sub>(2,627.0)</sub></italic>=7.553, <italic>p</italic>&lt;.001). Post-hoc comparisons (corrected α=0.0125; uncorrected <italic>p</italic>-values reported) indicated a similar pattern of results to S1, with significantly greater dissimilarity between facial-part representations in the deprived hemisphere of amputees (<italic>M</italic>=0.214; <italic>SE</italic>=0.0193 ; <italic>t<sub>(627.0)</sub></italic>=3.9633, <italic>p</italic>&lt;.001) and one-handers (<italic>M</italic>=0.243; <italic>SE</italic>=0.0170; <italic>t<sub>(627.0)</sub></italic>=3.8525, <italic>p</italic>&lt;.001), when compared to their respective intact hemisphere (amputees: <italic>M</italic>=0.157; <italic>SE</italic>=0.0193; one-handers: <italic>M</italic>=0.193; <italic>SE</italic>=0.0170; corrected α=0.0125; uncorrected p-values reported). When comparing to controls non-dominant hemisphere (M=0.192; SE=0.0163), we did not find any significant differences in both one-handers (t<sub>(77.4)</sub>=2.1656, p=0.033) and amputees (t<sub>(75.9)</sub>=0.8371, p=0.405).These results are in line with both our multivariate and univariate results in S1, which demonstrate extensive cortical remapping of facial parts in our one-handers group, and tentatively suggests again inter-hemispheric changes in the intact hand ROI of amputees (amputees: <italic>M</italic>=0.157; <italic>SE</italic>=0.0193; controls: <italic>M</italic>=0.201; <italic>SE</italic>=0.0163; <italic>t<sub>(75.9)</sub></italic>=-1.7382, <italic>p</italic>=0.086).</p><p>When looking at face-face pairwise dissimilarity in the M1 face ROI we note minor differences to our S1 multivariate results. Here, despite a non-significant Group x Hemisphere x Face-Face interaction (<italic>F<sub>(10,627.0)</sub></italic>=0.2969, <italic>p</italic>=0.982; controlled for age; see Figure 7 —figure supplement 1), we found a significant Group x Hemisphere interaction (<italic>F<sub>(2,627.0)</sub></italic>=4.3429, <italic>p</italic>=0.013), arising from lower facial information content in the intact (M=0.557; SE=0.0305) compared to the deprived (M=0.597; SE=0.0305) face ROI in amputees, but this difference did not survive our correction for multiple comparisons (t<sub>(627.0)</sub>=2.22199, p=0.027; corrected α=0.0125; trend defined as p&lt;0.025; uncorrected p-values reported). Between-hemisphere differences were non-significant when looking at the one-hander group (deprived: <italic>M</italic>=0.536; <italic>SE</italic>=0.0268; intact: <italic>M</italic>=0.567; <italic>SE</italic>=0.0268; <italic>t<sub>(627.0)</sub></italic>=-1.93153, <italic>p</italic>=0.054). Non-significant differences were also found when comparing the deprived face ROI in amputees (<italic>t<sub>(67.2)</sub></italic>=-0.00525, <italic>p</italic>=0.996) and one-handers (<italic>t<sub>(68.0)</sub></italic>=-1.64705, <italic>p</italic>=0.104) to the controls non-dominant hemisphere (<italic>M</italic>=0.597; <italic>SE</italic>=0.0257). These results therefore tentatively suggest that the reported interaction is likely driven by decreased facial information content in the intact face ROI when compared to the deprived face region in amputees (although note no significant differences were reported when comparing the intact face ROI in amputees to controls (amputees: <italic>M</italic>=0.557; <italic>SE</italic>=0.0305; controls: <italic>M</italic>=0.593; <italic>SE</italic>=0.0257; <italic>t<sub>(67.2)</sub></italic>=-0.90806, <italic>p</italic>=0.367)), suggesting again the presence of inter-hemispheric plasticity within this group (akin to results in S1). We also surprisingly found a significant Group x Face-Face (<italic>F<sub>(10,627.0)</sub></italic>=0.1934, <italic>p</italic>=0.038) interaction when looking at face-face pairwise distances in the M1 face ROI, suggesting that the information content for each movement (regardless of hemisphere) differed across groups. This interaction arose from significantly smaller forehead-lips distances for one-handers compared to controls (<italic>t<sub>(125)</sub></italic>=-2.625, <italic>p</italic>=0.010), but this effect did not survive correction for multiple comparisons (corrected α=0.004).</p><p>These additional analyses are specified in lines 426-427, 442-444, in the legends of Figure 6 and Figure 7 of the main text, with their respective Figure supplements 1 and data source 2, and in the Discussion (line 574-576).</p><p>It is a bit unclear why the nose is not included in the main winner-takes-all analysis (Figure 1) and only shown in the Supplementary Methods. The authors argue in the Methods section that they excluded the nose in the univariate analysis due to weak activation, whereas they include it in the RSA due to the increased sensitivity to subtle changes in activity patterns. This appears a bit inconsistent because also the RSA should suffer from weak voxelwise activations. In Supplementary Figure 1, the activation does not look particularly weak, and the winner-takes-all approach indicates that there are voxels that are most strongly activated for the nose compared to all other facial parts. This could be explained in more detail. Related to this point, did the authors test for nose remapping in amputees and one-handers?</p><p>Following this comment, we have re-ran all univariate analyses to include the nose condition, and updated all results throughout the main text, supplemental results and related figures. We initially chose to exclude the nose from univariate analyses because many participants could not move it. RSA is less sensitive to noise (due to cross-validation) and to selectivity/topography (two issues we had with the nose condition) and for these reasons we initially decided to keep the nose in the RSA analysis and exclude it from the univariate analyses. But we agree that being consistent avoids unnecessary confusion, and adding the nose condition into all analyses did not change the univariate results, apart from a now significant group x hemisphere interaction for the CoG of the tongue when comparing amputees and controls, better matching the trends for greater surface coverage in the deprived hand ROI of amputees.</p><p>We also performed and added in the Supplementary section the univariate results for the nose (Appendix Figure 1). We only shortly mention this result in the main text (lines 324-330) since we feel like the Results section is already pretty dense with results, and this additional result does not change our interpretation and conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What happened with the thumb movement imagery in the one-handers? Suppl. Figure 2 shows the respective effects for amputees and controls. Did the one-handers fail to show significant effects? It might be interesting to compare the one-handers' imagery effects with the execution effects in amputees and controls, even if putative differences might be less straightforward to interpret (might be due to representational differences or different paradigms).</p></disp-quote><p>In short – we cannot answer this question. To clarify, this condition was present solely to fill the experimental gap so that the protocols were matched as closely as possible across groups and we never intended to analyse this condition in one-handers. While we agree it could have been interesting to study how one-handers relate to their missing hand, there are different kinds of motor imagery (e.g., visual, kinaesthetic) and without dedicated research tools it would have been tricky for us to monitor individual one-handers strategies for imagining movement of a limb they never had. Consequently, we gave only broad instructions for this condition, that one-handers could interpret in various ways (visual, motor imagery or even prosthesis movements). It thus does not make much sense for us to look at it, and will not be meaningful to compare to the amputees group where we very explicitly instructed participants to move their phantom hand. Appendix Figure 3 addresses the question of persistent representation in amputees, which is highly relevant for this paper. To reduce the discrepancy, we removed the analysis including the phantom hand (see next comment). And we added this explanation in the methods (lines 645-647).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related to this point, the face-thumb distance values in Figure 5 are only shown for the controls and amputees. For the reader, the reason is not immediately clear, so perhaps this could be clarified in the figure caption.</p></disp-quote><p>Upon reflection (and thanks to the reviewers’ comments), we decided to remove entirely the hand-face dissimilarity analysis, which does not directly relate to the question of remapping (but rather of shared representation), in addition to making the paper unbalanced (as explained above, we were unable to run this analysis in one-handers). We will now feature this analysis in another paper that appears more appropriate in the context of referred sensations in amputees (Amoruso et al., 2022 MedRxiv).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are differences between the forehead clusters found in the winner-takes-all analysis (Figure 1) and the group consistency maps; the latter showing a strong overlap with the hand ROI. For the lips and tongue, the maps appear much more consistent. What could be the reason for this discrepancy, and how can the overlap between hand ROI and forehead be interpreted?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for any confusion. Figure 1 represents the thresholded group-level maps (vs rest, <italic>not</italic> winner-takes-all) within our initial (and very broad) sensorimotor mask, whereas the winner-takes-all inter-subject consistency maps are displayed in the following figures (2 to 4). The strong overlap with the hand ROI observed for the forehead is due to the use of an ROI including both the face and hand regions, where hand activity (not available for all groups) was not included. The logic behind this choice was that including the hand ROI would ease the detection of remapping (into the hand ROI). Given the winner-takes-all procedure (which included minimal thresholding), and the fact that the forehead is the immediate neighbour of the hand area, the slightly stronger forehead activity dominated the hand area. But when more stringent thresholding is introduced (as in Figure 1), the forehead activity is insufficient to pass the threshold. To add clarity to the activity presented in Figure 1, we have visualised the pre-thresholding mask of the pre- and post-central gyrus (defined using the Harvard Cortical Atlas in dark grey; see line 172), as well as the hand and face ROIs used in the subsequent winner-takes-all analysis, and amended Figure legends to state that the group-level activity visualised is versus rest (line 167) and winner-takes-all maps done within the combined hand+face ROI (line 199-200). We have also updated the figure legend of Figure 2 (lines 202-204) to explicitly acknowledge these differences: “Please note that the individual-participant winner-takes-all maps are minimally thresholded, and thus produce an inherently different spatial distribution relative to the group contrast maps presented in Figure 1”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>When reporting the weak but significant result of reduced forehead coverage in amputees, the authors could also refer to the BF=1.5, which suggests only anecdotal evidence.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s above recommendation, however we initially decided to provide Bayes Factors only in the absence of effects, to show whether we had enough evidence in support for the null hypothesis (see lines 877-879: “We reported the corresponding Bayes Factor (BF10), defined as the relative support for the alternative hypothesis, for non-significant interactions and post-hoc comparisons.”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors did not remove outliers, which is justified, and the authors checked that the significance and direction of the results did not change if identified outliers were removed.

A common belief is that the lower face, including the lips, preferentially &quot;invades&quot; deafferented cortex due to its proximity to cortex. In the present study, this hypothesis is tested by mapping the somatosensory cortex using fMRI as amputees, congenital one-handers, and controls moved their forehead, nose, lips or tongue. First, they found that, unlike its counterpart in monkeys, the representation of the face in the somatosensory cortex is right-side up, with the forehead most medial (and abutting the hand) and the lips most lateral. Second, there was little evidence of &quot;reorganization&quot; of the deafferented cortex in amputees, even when tested with movements across the entire face rather than only the lips. Third, congenital one-handers showed significant reorganization of deafferented cortex, characterized principally by the invasion of the lower face, in contrast to predictions from the hypothesis that proximity was the driving factor. Fourth, there was no relationship between phantom limb pain reports and reorganization.</p><p>As a non-expert in fMRI, I cannot evaluate the methodology. That being said, I am not convinced that the current consensus is that the representation of the face in humans is flipped compared to that of monkeys. Indeed, the overwhelming majority of somatosensory homunculi I have seen for humans has the face right side up. My sense is that the fMRI studies that found an inverted (monkey-like) face representation contradict the consensus.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for point this out. As we tried to emphasise in the introduction, very few neuroimaging studies actually investigated face somatotopy in humans, with inconsistent results. We agree the default consensus tends to be dominated by the up-right depiction of Penfield’s homunculus (recently replicated by Roux et al., 2018). However, due to methodological and practical constraints, alignment across subjects in the case of intracortical recordings is usually difficult to achieve, and thus makes it difficult to assess the consistency in topographical organisation. Moreover, <italic>previous imaging studies did not manage to convincingly support Penfield’s homunculus</italic>. For these two key reasons, the spatial orientation of the human facial homunculus is still debated. A further limiting factor of previous studies in humans is that the vast majority of human studies investigating face (re)mapping in humans focused solely on the lip representation, using the cortical proximity hypothesis to interpret their results. Consequently, as we highlight above in our response to the Editor, there is a wide-spread and false representation in the human literature of the lips neighbouring the hand area.</p><p>To account for the reviewer’s critic and convey some of this context, we changed our title from: <italic>Reassessing face topography in primary somatosensory cortex and remapping following hand loss</italic>; to: <italic>Complex pattern of facial remapping in somatosensory cortex following congenital but not acquired hand loss</italic>. This was done to de-emphasise the novelty of face topography relative to our other findings.</p><p>We also rewrote our introduction (lines 79-94) as follows:</p><p>“The research focus on lip cortical remapping in amputees is based on the assumption that the lips neighbour the hand representation. However, this assumption goes against the classical upright orientation of the face in S1<sup>26–30</sup>, as first depicted in Penfield’s Homunculus and in later intracortical recordings and stimulation studies<sup>26–29</sup>, with the upper-face (i.e., forehead) bordering the hand area. In contrast, neuroimaging studies in humans studying face topography provided contradictory evidence for the past 30 years. While a few neuroimaging studies provided partial evidence in support of the traditional upright face organisation<sup>31</sup>, other studies supported the inverted (or ‘upside-down’) somatotopic organisation of the face, similar to that of non-human primates<sup>32,33</sup>. Other studies suggested a segmental organisation<sup>34</sup>, or even a lack of somatotopic organisation<sup>35–37</sup>, whereas some studies provided inconclusive or incomplete results<sup>38–41</sup>. Together, the available evidence does not successfully converge on face topography in humans. In line with the upright organisation originally suggested by Penfield, recent work reported that the shift in the lip representation towards the missing hand in amputees was minimal<sup>42,43</sup>, and likely to reside within the face area itself. Surprisingly, there is currently no research that considers the representation of other facial parts, in particular the upper-face (e.g., the forehead), in relation to plasticity or PLP.”</p><p>We also updated the discussion accordingly (lines 456, 468-476, 489-491).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, it is not clear to me how the observations (1) of limited reorganization in amputees, (2) of significant reorganization in congenital one-handers, and (3) of the lack of relationship between PLP and reorganization is novel given the previous work by this group.

We are going beyond remapping by using RSA, which allows us to ask not only if new information is available in the deprived cortex (as well as the native face area), but also whether this new information is structured consistently across individuals and groups.

Jain did not find an increased propensity for axons to cross the septum between face and hand representations after (simulated) amputation. From this perspective, the relevant proximity would be that of the cuneate and trigeminal nuclei and it would be critical to map out the somatotopic organization of the trigeminal and cuneate nuclei to test hypotheses about the role of proximity in this remapping.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for highlighting this very relevant point, which we are well aware of. We fully agree with the reviewer that this is an important goal for future study, but functional imaging of the brainstem in humans is particularly challenging and would require ultra high field imaging (7T) and specialised equipment. We have encountered much local resistance due to hypothetical issues for MRI safety for scanning amputees in this higher field strength, meaning we are unable to carry out this research ourselves. Our former lab member Sanne Kikkert, who is now running her independent research programme in Zurich, has been working towards this goal for the past 4 years. So we can say with confidence that this aim is well beyond the scope of the current study. In response to your comment, we mentioned this potential mechanism in the introduction (lines 98-101), we ensured that we only referred to “cortical proximity” throughout our manuscript, and we circle back to this important point in the discussion.</p><p>Lines 538-542: “Moreover, even if the remapping we observed here goes against the theory of <italic>cortical</italic> proximity, it can still arise from representational proximity at the subcortical level, in particular at the brainstem level<sup>44,45</sup>.

In contrast to this claim, the authors suggest that remapping may not follow cortical proximity but instead functional rules as to how the effector is used. Their data indeed suggest that the deprived hand area is not invaded by the forefront which is the cortical neighbor but instead by the lips which may compensate for hand loss in manipulating objects. Interestingly the authors suggest this is mostly the case for one-handers but not in amputees for who the reorganization seems more limited in general (but see my comments below on this last point).</p><p>This is a remarkably ambitious study that has been skilfully executed on a strong number of participants in each group. The complementarity of state-of-the-art uni- and multi-variate analyses are in the service of the research question, and the paper is clearly written.

I think it would be better to include the nose in all analyses or demonstrate this condition is indeed &quot;noisy&quot; and then remove it from all the analyses. Indeed, if the activity triggered by nose movement is unreliable, it should also affect multivariate.</p></disp-quote><p>Following this comment, we re-ran all univariate analyses to include the nose, and updated throughout the main text and supplemental results and related figures.

Full details are provided in our response to Reviewer 1 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The rationale for not including the hand is maybe more convincing as it seems to induce activity in both controls and amputees but not in one-handers. First, it would be great to visualize this effect, at least as supplemental material to support the decision. Then, this brings the interesting possibility that enhanced invasion of hand territory by lips in one-handers might link to the possibility to observe hand-related activity in the presupposed hand region in this population. Maybe the authors may consider linking these.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. As we explain in our response to Reviewer 1 above, we did not intent the thumb condition in one-handers for analysis, as the task given to one-handers (imagine moving a body part you never had before) is inherently different to that given to the other groups (move – or at least attempt to move – your (phantom) hand). As such, we could not pursuit the analysis suggested by the reviewer here. To reduce the discrepancy and following Reviewer 1’s advice, we decided to remove the hand-face dissimilarity analysis which we included in our original manuscript, and might have sparked some of this interest. Upon reflection we agreed that this specific analysis does not directly relate to the question of remapping (but rather of shared representation), in addition to making the paper unbalanced.

We now include the Jaccard similarity analysis, which quantified the degree of similarity (0=no overlap between maps; 1=fully overlapping) between winner-takes-all maps (which included the nose; akin to the revised univariate results) across groups. For each face part/amputee, the similarity with the 22 controls and 21 one-handers respectively was averaged. We utilised a linear mixed model which included fixed factors of Group (One-handers x Controls), Movement (Forehead x Nose x Lips x Tongue) and Hemisphere (Intact x Deprived) on Jaccard similarity values (similar to what we used for the RSA analysis). A random effect of participant, as well as covariates of ages, were also included in the model.</p><p>Results showed a significant group x hemisphere interaction (<italic>F<sub>(240.0)</sub></italic>=7.70, <italic>p</italic>=0.006; controlled for age; Figure 5), indicating that amputees’ maps showed different similarity values to controls’ and one-handers’ depending on the hemisphere. Post-hoc comparisons (corrected α=0.025; uncorrected <italic>p</italic>-values reported) revealed significantly higher similarity to controls’ than to one-handers’ maps in the deprived hemisphere (<italic>t<sub>(240)</sub></italic>=-3.892, <italic>p</italic>&lt;.001). Amputees’ maps also showed higher similarity to controls’ maps in the deprived relative to the intact hemisphere (<italic>t<sub>(240)</sub></italic>=2.991, <italic>p</italic>=0.003). Amputees, therefore, displayed greater similarity of facial somatotopy in the deprived hemisphere to controls, suggesting again fewer evidence for cortical remapping in amputees.</p><p>We added these results at the end of the univariate analyses (lines 334-350) and in the discussion (lines 463-464 and 496-499).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This brings to another concern I have related to the claim that the change in the cortical organization they observe is mostly observed in one-handers. It seems that most of this conclusion relies on the fact that some effects are observed in one-handers but not in amputees when compared to controls, however, no direct comparisons are done between amputees and one-handers so we may be in an erroneous inference about the interaction when this is actually not tested (Nieuwenhuis, 11). For instance, the shift away from the hand/face border of the forehead is also (mildly) significant in amputees (as observed more strongly in one-handers) so the conclusion (eg from the subtitle of the Results section) that it is specific to one-hander might not fully be supported by the data. Similar to the invasion of the hand territory from the lips which is significant in amputees in terms of surface area. All together this calls for toning down the idea that plasticity is restricted to congenital deprivation (eg last sentence of the abstract). Even if numerically stronger, if I am not wrong, there are no stats showing remapping is indeed stronger in one-handers than in amputees and actually, amputees show significant effects when compared to controls along the lines as those shown (even if more strongly) in one-handers.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this very important comment. We fully agree – the RSA across-groups comparison is highly informative but insufficient to support our claims. We did not compare the groups directly to avoid multiple comparisons (both for statistical reasons and to manage the size of the Results section). But the reviewer’s suggestion to perform a Jaccard similarity analysis complements very nicely the univariate and multivariate results and allows for a direct (and statistically lean) comparison between groups, to assess whether amputees are more similar to controls or to congenital one-handers, taking into account all aspects of their maps (both spatial location/CoG and surface coverage). We added the Jaccard analysis to the main text, at the end of the univariate results (lines 334-384). The Jaccard analysis suggests that amputees’ maps in the deprived hemisphere were more similar to the maps of controls than to the ones of congenital one-handers. This allowed us to obtain significant statistical results to support the claim that remapping is indeed stronger in one-handers than in amputees (lines 345-350). We also compared both amputees and one-handers to the control group. In line with our univariate results, this revealed that the only face part for which controls were more similar to one-handers than to amputees was the tongue (lines 378-380). And that the forehead remapping observed at the univariate level in amputees (surface area), is likely to arise from differences in the intact hemisphere (lines 380-382).</p><p>Finally, we also added the post-hoc statistics comparing amputees to congenitals in the RSA analysis (lines 424-426): “While facial information in the deprived hand area was increased in one-handers compared with amputees, this effect did not survive our correction for multiple comparisons (<italic>t</italic><sub>(70.7)</sub>=-2.117, <italic>p</italic>=0.038).”</p><p>Regarding the univariate results mentioned by the reviewer, we would like to emphasise that we had no significant effect for the lips in amputees, though we agree the surface area appears in between controls and one-handers. But this laterality index was not different from zero. This test is now added lines 189-190. Regarding the forehead, we fully agree with the Reviewer, and we adjusted the subtitle accordingly (lines 240-241). For consistency, we also added the t-test vs zero for the forehead surface area (non-significant, lines 250-252).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, maybe the authors could explore whether there is actually a link between the number of years without hand and the remapping effects.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this question, we explored our data using a correlation analysis. The only body part who showed some suggestive remapping effects was the tongue, and so we explored whether we could find a relationship (Pearson’s correlation) between years since amputation and the laterality index of the Tongue in amputees (r = 0.007, p=0.980, 95% CI [-0.475, 0.475]). We also explored amputees’ global Jaccard similarity values to controls in the deprived hemisphere (r = -0.010, p=0.970, 95% CI [-0.488, 0.473]), and could not find any relationship. Considering there was no strong remapping effect to explain, we find this result too exploratory to include in our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One hypothesis generated by the data is that lips remap in the deprived hand area because lips serve compensatory functions. Actually, also in controls, lips and hands can be used to manipulate objects, in contrast to the forehead. One may thus wonder if the preferential presence of lips in the hand region is not latent even in controls as they both link in functions?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s reasoning, and we think that the distributed representational content we recently found in two-handers (Muret et al., 2022) provides a first hint in this direction. It is worth noting that in that previous publication we did not find differences across face parts in the activity levels obtained in the hand region, except for slightly more negative values for the tongue. But we do think that such latent information is likely to provide a “scaffolding” for remapping. While the design of our face task does not allow to assess information content for each face part (as done for the lips in Muret et al., 2022), this should be further investigated in follow-up studies.</p><p>We added a sentence in the discussion to highlight this interesting notion:</p><p>Lines 555-558: “Together with the recent evidence that lip information content is already significant in the hand area of two-handed participants (Muret et al., 2022), compensatory behaviour since developmental stages might further uncover (and even potentiate) this underlying latent activity.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The authors should re-assess their conclusion that remapping is mostly present in one-handers than amputees in absence of a convincing statistical demonstration that it is actually the case. The amputees show similar effects or trends for similar remapping as those observed in one-handers. maybe one source of this lower reliability in the effects of amputees links to the lower number of participants and their higher variability in ethology (eg age of amputation etc…). Maybe the authors could explore whether there is actually a link between the number of years without hand and the remapping effects.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to emphasise that our Bayesian statistics help address this issue when supportive of the null hypothesis (i.e., lack of interaction for the lip CoG: <italic>BF<sub>10</sub></italic>=0.297). But we also fully agree that a more direct comparison between amputees and one-handers was necessary. As we detailed above, we now provide analysis to address both univariate and multivariate group differences, performed with the two most sensitive analyses, Jaccard analysis and RSA.</p><p>In the Jaccard analysis, amputees showed significantly higher similarity to controls, and their global similarity to controls was not related to covariates such as years since amputation. We also show in <italic>Figure 5 —figure supplement 1</italic> comparable intra-group consistency in amputees relative to one-handers. We believe this rules out the reviewer’s concern that the amputees data is more noisy/variable due to amputation-related covariates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should be coherent in the body part they include for their univariate and multivariate analyses. I let them decide whether they think the nose condition was too noisy (eg because people could not follow instructions to move the nose) or not. If they think the condition however did not elicit reliable activity, this should affect both uni and multivariate analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this comment in the most straight forward way we could – re-running all analyses to include the nose and update all of the study results accordingly. Despite slight quantitative changes, the overall pattern of the results was relatively unchanged in comparison to our original analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) I recommend the authors show the map elicited by hand movement in the three groups, support their claim that this is only reliably observed in controls and amputees but not one-handers; and maybe discuss (or even better do some analyses on that, eg correlation) the possibility that the preservation of the hand map is potentially a factor influencing remapping (eg do the amputees with the most salient remaining hand maps are those showing less remapping?).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their interesting suggestion that the preservation of the hand map may influence reported (lack of) remapping. To explore this within our data, and from the recommendation of the reviewer, we looked at the correlation between the percentage of surface area coverage for maximal phantom hand activity in the hand ROI (similar to that shown in Appendix Figure 3 in standard space) to the laterality indices of the tongue (the one facial part in amputees to tentatively indicate facial remapping). When doing so we find a non-significant correlation (kendall's tau=0.121, p=0.281, BF10=0.366), along with an inconclusive Bayes Factor, suggesting that preservation of phantom hand activity may not be a deciding factor of facial remapping within this dataset. Considering there was no strong remapping effect to explain, we find this result too exploratory to include in our manuscript. But we would happily add it to the Supplements if advised by the Reviewer.</p><p>We therefore continued with an alternative approach that might make more intuitive sense – do we have more stability, thus more control-like maps, if amputees display more (preserved) hand representation? To address this question, we ran a Pearson correlation between the global Jaccard similarity values of amputees relative to controls and the percentage of surface area coverage for maximal phantom hand activity in the hand ROI (similar to that shown in Appendix Figure 3 in standard space). We found here again a non-significant correlation (r = 0.317, p=0.215, 95% CI [-0.193, 0.692]).</p><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-76158-sa2-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors should clarify in their figure where do they observe that the lip increases activity WITHIN the hand region in one-handers.</p></disp-quote><p>The laterality indices are clearly showing this, since it corresponds to the proportion of surface area coverage IN the hand region, for the winner-maps of each face part (thus winning over the other face parts). See above for a similar analysis on activity levels (β values) in the hand region.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The fact that the univariate results of Figure 1 do not follow well those presented in the WTA maps deserves some consideration. Indeed, what seems striking in Figure 1 is that the forehead activity extends more dorsally in one-handers, approaching the hand region, which contradicts conclusions from WTA. Also, it might be informative to have an outline of the brain mask (in all figures) of the S1 ROI used for constraining spatially the univariate analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for any confusion. As we detail in our response to Reviewer 1 above, the activity presented in Figure 1 reflects each facial movement contrasted to rest, mainly localised outside, and posterior to, the hand ROI (outlined in Figure 1 in purple). The WTA maps, summarised in the consistency maps in Figures 2-4, reflect how consistent are the (minimally thresholded) WTA maps. If we used a higher threshold, much of the upper face WTA map would disappear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In Figure 5 the thumb is not represented in one-handers. It would be interesting for the reader to see that indeed the instruction to move the thumb did not elicit a reliable activity map and what was the criteria to selectively remove it in one-handers aside from the fact they don't experience fantom sensation. It is also unclear why the thumb is not displayed in the MDS while it's computed in the RDM of controls and amputees.</p></disp-quote><p>Upon reflection (and thanks to the reviewers’ comments), we decided to remove entirely the hand-face dissimilarity analysis, which does not directly relate to the question of remapping (but rather of shared representation), in addition to making the paper unbalanced. We will now feature this analysis in another paper that appears more appropriate in the context of referred sensations in amputees (Amoruso et al., 2022 MedRxiv).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Maybe discuss further the potential (latent) link between hand and lips as they both can be used to manipulate objects even in controls.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a sentence in the discussion to that extent:</p><p>Lines 555-558: “Together with the recent evidence that lip information content is already significant in the hand area of two-handed participants (Muret et al., 2022), compensatory behaviour since developmental stages might further uncover (and even potentiate) this underlying latent activity.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
