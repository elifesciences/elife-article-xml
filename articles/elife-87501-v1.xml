Parkinson’s disease (PD), and plasma extracellular vesicle (EV) synaptic proteins are emerging as biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases. Assessment of plasma EV synaptic proteins for their efficacy as biomarkers in PD and their relationship with disease progression was conducted. In total, 144 participants were enrolled, including 101 people with PD (PwP) and 43 healthy controls (HCs). The changes in plasma EV synaptic protein levels between baseline and 1-year follow-up did not differ significantly in both PwP and HCs. In PwP, the changes in plasma EV synaptic protein levels were significantly associated with the changes in Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)-II and III scores. Moreover, PwP with elevated levels (first quartile) of any one plasma EV synaptic proteins (synaptosome-associated protein 25, growth-associated protein 43 or synaptotagmin-1) had significantly greater disease progression in UPDRS-II score and the postural instability and gait disturbance subscore in UPDRS-III than did the other PwP after adjustment for age, sex, and disease duration. The promising potential of plasma EV synaptic proteins as clinical biomarkers of disease progression in PD was suggested. However, a longer follow-up period is warranted to confirm their role as prognostic biomarkers.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>extracellular vesicle</kwd><kwd>synpatic protein</kwd><kwd>Parkinson's disease</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Minister of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOST 110-2314-B-038-096</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hong</surname><given-names>Chien-Tai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001868</institution-id><institution>National Science Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>111-2314-B-038-136</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hong</surname><given-names>Chien-Tai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The promising potential of plasma extracellular vesicle synaptic proteins as clinical biomarkers of disease progression in Parkinson's disease has been presented.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">de Lau and Breteler, 2006</xref>) that is well known for its progression, which involves increased disability and burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bloem et al., 2021</xref>). Worsening is noted not only in motor symptoms but also in nonmotor ones, particularly cognition. The rate of disease progression varies among people with PD (PwP). In the ongoing Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative cohort study, approximately one-third of untreated PwP exhibited rapid progression during the first 2 years of follow-up. By contrast, the remaining PwP had a slow progressive course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen-Plotkin et al., 2018</xref>). Unfortunately, no disease-modifying therapy for halting disease progression and no predictor for assessing disease progression are available.</p><p>Synapses are sites of neuronal communication, and synaptic degeneration is an early functional pathogenic event in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Picconi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arendt, 2009</xref>). Postmortem studies have revealed a substantial loss of dopamine terminals in the putamen and amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Iseki et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kordower et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, the loss of glutamatergic corticostriatal synapses has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stephens et al., 2005</xref>). Mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to some of the synaptic loss in PD, and the buildup of α-synuclein, a key synaptic protein, plays a significant role in the development of PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gcwensa et al., 2021</xref>). Assessment of synaptic proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can reflect synaptic loss in patients with neurological diseases and is a key area of research interest. Significant research has been directed toward evaluating synaptic changes in CSF to enhance early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases before neuron loss and track disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lleó et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Milà-Alomà et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bereczki et al., 2017</xref>). Several synaptic proteins are promising biomarkers of synaptic function. Synaptosome-associated protein 25 (SNAP-25) is a presynaptic protein that plays a crucial role in neuronal survival, vesicular exocytosis, and neurite outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antonucci et al., 2016</xref>). Increased CSF levels of SNAP-25 have been reported in PwP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bereczki et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43) is a presynaptic protein anchored to the cytoplasmic side of the presynaptic plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benowitz and Routtenberg, 1997</xref>). CSF levels of GAP-43 have been reported to be significantly higher in patients with AD than in healthy controls (HCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sjögren et al., 2001</xref>). Synaptotagmin-1 is a calcium sensor vesicle protein that is vital for rapid synchronous neurotransmitter release in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Courtney et al., 2019</xref>). Significantly increased CSF levels of synaptotagmin-1 have been reported in patients with AD and mild cognitive impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Öhrfelt et al., 2019</xref>). Regarding PD, one study reported an increase in the level of CSF SNAP-25 but not Ras-related protein 3A or neurogranin. Moreover, treated PwP exhibited higher CSF levels of SNAP-25 than did their drug-naïve counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bereczki et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>However, collecting CSF is somewhat invasive and necessary for clinical assessments, but it may cause side effects like headaches after the procedure. Although studies have assessed blood biomarkers for PD diagnosis and progression, the results are conflicting. A lack of correlation between the peripheral blood content and the brain because of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) is a major obstacle to the identification of blood biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Qin et al., 2016</xref>). Assessment of peripheral blood extracellular vesicle (EV) proteins can be an alternative approach. EVs are tiny vesicles covered with a lipid membrane. They contain proteins, lipids, and nucleic acid responsible for cell-to-cell signal transmission. The integrity of EVs can be maintained when crossing the BBB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jan et al., 2017</xref>). Plasma EV biomarkers are being rapidly developed for PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Leggio et al., 2021</xref>). EV-cargo α-synuclein has been the most studied target that has exhibited strong potential for distinguishing PwP from HCs and other patients with atypical parkinsonism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chung et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Niu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zheng et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Si et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stuendl et al., 2021</xref>). EV-cargo tau, β-amyloid, neurofilament light chain, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and insulin receptor substrate have also been assessed in PwP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Athauda et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chung et al., 2020d</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chung et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chung et al., 2021a</xref>). These results indicate the potential role of EV content as biomarkers in PD.</p><p>The levels of synaptic proteins in blood exosomes, a specific type of EV, decrease in patients with AD and frontotemporal dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goetzl et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, blood exosomal SNAP-25, GAP-43, neurogranin, and synaptotagmin-1 levels are lower in patients with AD. A combination of exosomal synaptic protein biomarkers could predict cognitive impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jia et al., 2021</xref>). A cross-sectional study showed that PwP have lower levels of synaptic proteins in neuron-derived exosomes in their blood compared to healthy individuals, allowing for an approximately 80% accurate distinction between PwP and HCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agliardi et al., 2021</xref>). Considering the plasma EVs remain stable up to 90 d (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kalra et al., 2013</xref>), this prevents the fluctuation of free-form synaptic proteins because of transient surge or degradation. Moreover, SNAP-25 is transported in the blood by EVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agliardi et al., 2019</xref>). However, there is no information from the cohort study of PD. Therefore, the association between plasma EV synaptic proteins and PD progression was assessed and determined whether plasma EV synaptic proteins could be used as clinical biomarkers to predict the progression of PD.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The participants’ demographic data at baseline and 1-year follow-up are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>.

sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Although no significant difference in plasma EV synaptic protein levels was observed between PwP and HCs in the research, alterations in plasma EV synaptic protein levels in PwP were linked to motor decline. In addition, baseline plasma EV synaptic protein levels were associated with clinical outcomes, as assessed using PIGD subscores at follow-up. PwP with elevated baseline levels of any one plasma EV synaptic protein (SNAP-25, GAP-43, or synaptotagmin-1) exhibited significant deterioration in the activities of daily living (as assessed by UPDRS-II scores and PIGD subscores in UPDRS-III) between baseline and follow-up. The promising potential of plasma EV synaptic proteins as biomarkers for PD, particularly its progression, was indicated.</p><p>Significant worsening of UPDRS-II scores and PIGD subscores in UPDRS-III was noted in PwP with higher baseline levels of plasma EV synaptic proteins (first quartile). UPDRS-II is a crucial but underestimated parameter for assessing PwP; it can be used to assess the daily functional capability related to motor symptoms in PwP without temporary drug interruptions, as in the case of UPDRS-III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rodriguez-Blazquez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sampaio, 2009</xref>). PIGD subtype is linked to a higher Lewy bodies burden, a rapid decline, and greater risks of cognitive impairment, falls, and mortality compared to the tremor-dominant (TD) subtype. The TD subtype, in contrast, tends to have a relatively benign course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johnson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burn et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ren et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nutt, 2016</xref>). PwP may convert from the TD subtype to the PIGD subtype during disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, PIGD-related motor symptoms respond to dopaminergic medications to a lesser extent than do tremor-, akinesia-, and rigidity-related symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kempster et al., 2007</xref>), which may more directly reflect the progression of the disease. PwP with elevated levels of any one plasma EV synaptic protein exhibited greater deterioration, as assessed using UPDRS-II scores and PIGD subscores, as observed in the research. High EV synaptic protein levels conventionally indicate increased synaptogenesis; this contrasts the synaptic loss pattern noted in PD. Decreased blood exosomal synaptic protein levels have been reported in patients with AD and frontotemporal dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goetzl et al., 2016</xref>). However, in PwP who are at the early disease stage, compensatory synaptic sprouting and increased synaptic plasticity are noted in the striatum. This compensation, also known as motor reserve, may temporarily decrease the clinical disease burden. However, the patient would be more vulnerable to deterioration if the compensation is overshadowed by degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chung et al., 2020e</xref>). For instance, in one study, PwP who engaged in higher premorbid exercises exhibited milder motor symptoms despite having a similar gradient of striatal dopaminergic reduction at baseline; however, they exhibited more rapid deterioration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sunwoo et al., 2017</xref>). The inclusion of primarily early-stage PwP (mean disease duration of less than 3 y) with mild disease burden (baseline UPDRS-II score = 8.49) in the research suggests that elevated plasma EV synaptic protein levels might indicate activation of a compensatory process. Such PwP are at an increased risk of rapid deterioration and disease progression and should be candidates for disease-modifying interventions, including pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments.</p><p>A notable pioneering role is the evaluation of changes in plasma EV synaptic protein levels and elucidating the relationship between these changes and cognitive decline in PwP. Considering the well-established role of synaptic degeneration and plasticity in PD, the theoretical background of the use of these synaptic proteins as plasma EV biomarkers for PD is confirmed. Moreover, most synaptic proteins are neuron derived, thereby preventing contamination from non-neuronal tissues. The significant link between changes in plasma EV synaptic protein levels and changes in UPDRS-II, UPDRS-III, and AR subscore indicates the effectiveness of these proteins in detecting motor decline in PwP. This suggests that these proteins could serve as an objective parameter for future disease-modification clinical trials. Elevated baseline plasma EV synaptic protein levels can also predict rapid deterioration in PwP, highlighting the importance of motor reserve and synaptic plasticity in the progression of PD for future research. Although no single synaptic protein can precisely predict the progression of PD, these protein targets may be considered for inclusion in a biomarker panel. They can be analyzed using an artificial intelligence-assisted artificial neural network, a method commonly used to predict outcomes in various neurological diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chung et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chung et al., 2020c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">James et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chou et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>There were several limitations to the study. Technically, semiquantitative assessment of plasma EV synaptic protein (SNAP-25, GAP-43, and synaptotagmin-1) levels was performed using western blot analysis. The lack of absolute values, that is, from the results of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, limits further clinical application. In addition, because numerous synaptic proteins are involved in the pathogenesis of PD, the three selected proteins may not reflect all features of the synaptic condition. The selection of HSP-70 as the control for the synaptic proteins quantification of plasma EV is not undisputable. Two types of EV proteins are used for this role: membrane proteins and intravesicular proteins. Membrane proteins include CD9, CD63, and CD81; intravesicular proteins include TSG101, annexins, and chaperone proteins, such as HSP-70. Since the expression of HSP-70 is usually steady, the HSP-70 was used as the internal control, but it is a limitation of the present study. Furthermore, the evaluation of the overall plasma EVs rather than specifically focusing on neuron-derived exosomes potentially introduced a bias toward somatic-origin EVs. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that synaptic proteins primarily originate from neurons. Even when considering neuron-derived exosomes, it is important to recognize that they are not exclusively derived from the brain, which can lead to contamination from the peripheral nervous system. The final technical issue in the present study was the relatively small size of the isolated EVs. Despite the primary focus on isolating exosomes, which are the smallest type of EVs, it is important to consider that the presence of small-sized EVs could potentially be attributed to EV fragmentation that occurs during the freezing and thawing processes. Regarding the limitation from the cohort, it is also worth mentioning that the 1-year follow-up period to assess the progression of PD was relatively short and may have been insufficient to detect significant disease progression. On the other hand, the evaluation of motor symptoms took place in a hospital setting. In this context, patients were not asked to stop taking their anti-PD medications. This decision was made due to safety concerns, such as the risk of falls. As a result, specific motor symptoms, particularly tremor and AR, which are more sensitive to medication compared to PIGD, may have been effectively managed by the anti-PD medications. This could potentially explain the improvement in tremor observed between the baseline and 1-year follow-up, especially among PwP with elevated baseline plasma EV synaptic proteins. Additionally, synaptic dysfunction is a frequently observed phenomenon in several neurological diseases, and it is not exclusive to PD. Consequently, the HC group may have included individuals with coexisting neurological conditions in the research, potentially explaining the lack of a significant difference between the PD group and the HCs. However, this approach also illuminates the significance of synaptic dysfunction in the advancement of PD. This insight can be invaluable for monitoring disease progression, particularly in the context of clinical trials focused on disease modification. Choosing the first quartile as a cutoff value of plasma EV synaptic proteins is also one of the limitations of the study. While developing new biomarkers, there was no clear cutoff value as reference for the continuous variable, and percentile is considered for predicting the prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Duarte, 2021</xref>). Further studies are required to validate this application. Lastly, the results form a mono-centric, small-scale and short-period PD cohort required further validation.</p><p>In conclusion, the changes in the levels of plasma EV synaptic proteins, namely SNAP-25, GAP-43, and synaptotagmin-1, are associated with motor decline in PwP. Elevated baseline plasma EV synaptic protein levels can predict increased deterioration of motor function, particularly PIGD symptoms, in PwP. Plasma EV synaptic proteins have the potential to be used as biomarkers of PD progression and detection. A longer longitudinal follow-up is warranted to clearly assess the prognostic efficacy of plasma EV synaptic proteins in PwP.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study participants</title><p>A total of 101 PwP and 43 HCs were enrolled.

To ensure that the data could be compared between different gels, all the data were normalized to the average of the control group in the same gel.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS for Windows 10 (version 26; SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). A linear mixed model was used to assess whether the changes in plasma EV synaptic protein levels differed between PwP and HCs after adjustment for age and sex. A generalized linear model was used to determine the association between the changes in plasma EV synaptic protein levels and the changes in clinical parameters in PwP after adjustment for age, sex, and disease duration. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to assess the association between plasma EV synaptic proteins and clinical parameters at follow-up in PwP after adjustment for age, sex, and disease duration. Repeated-measures analysis of covariance with estimated marginal means was employed to compare the changes in clinical parameters between baseline and follow-up in PwP with elevated baseline levels (first quartile) of any one plasma EV synaptic protein. Finally, p-values&lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Resources, Data curation, Software, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Validation, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: This study was approved by the Joint Institutional Review Board of Taipei Medical University (TMU-JIRB approval no.

We acknowledge your observation that the absence of a discernible difference in plasma EV synaptic protein levels between the PD and control subjects constitutes a significant limitation of our study. This outcome could be attributed to the fact that the controls were recruited from the neurology outpatient clinic, representing a group that could be considered &quot;sub-healthy.&quot; Moreover, these individuals are not exempt from aging-related neurodegenerative processes. Considering that our PD subjects are in the early stages of the disease (with a mean disease duration of less than 3 years) and that synaptic dysfunction is a broader indicator rather than specific to PD, these factors could collectively contribute to the lack of distinction between the PD and control groups.</p><p>However, our primary intention was also to explore the potential of plasma EV synaptic proteins as predictive markers for disease progression in PD. In this regard, we have identified their applicability within the current PD cohort. We are committed to conducting further follow-up with these study subjects over an extended duration to delve deeper into these findings.</p><p>We revised the following statement in the discussion part to address this issue as following “Additionally, synaptic dysfunction is a frequently observed phenomenon in several neurological diseases, and it is not exclusive to PD. Consequently, the HC group in our current study may have included individuals with coexisting neurological conditions, potentially explaining the lack of a significant difference between the PD group and the HCs. However, this approach also illuminates the significance of synaptic dysfunction in the advancement of PD. This insight can be invaluable for monitoring disease progression, particularly in the context of clinical trials focused on disease modification.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Tables in general are hard to follow.

In Table 2, our aim was to demonstrate the association between the change of plasma EV synaptic proteins with the change of clinical severity, and presented as coefficient (p value). We apologize for any prior ambiguity in the main text's description of these results and have since made revisions to enhance clarity.</p><p>Regarding the &quot;per 100% change,&quot; this is due to the quantification of plasma EV synaptic proteins being based on a semi-quantitative Western blot method. Each measurement was normalized by the average baseline plasma synaptic protein levels of healthy controls (HCs). The term &quot;per 100% change&quot; denotes the increase or decrease in plasma EV synaptic protein abundance relative to the average baseline levels observed in healthy controls. We apologize for any confusion caused and removed this term. In addition, we rephrased the statement to ensure better understanding and readability in the Table legend of revised manuscript as following “The association between the change of plasma EV synaptic proteins abundance (between baseline and follow-up) with the change of clinical severity in motor and cognitive domains (between baseline and follow-up) in people with Parkinson’s disease. A generalized linear model was employed and the data was presented as coefficient (p value).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>It is only when PwP were classified as a first quartile that a significantly greater deterioration was found. However, in the case of tremor, the top 25% had values going from 0.46-0.47 to 0.32-0.35, whereas the lower three quarters went from 0.33-0.34 to 0.27-0.28 depending on the protein analyzed. This needs to be clarified in the text.</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>Response: Thanks for your comments. As per the unified Parkinson's disease rating score (UPDRS), a higher score indicates greater severity of symptoms. Regarding tremor, we observed a general trend of improvement in both groups. PwP with elevated baseline plasma EV proteins had a trendy of worse tremor score at baseline, and the improvement was significantly better than the rest of PwP. This improvement seems to contradict the progressive nature of PD, and one possible explanation could be the alleviation of symptoms due to medication usage. The assessment of motor symptoms took place within the hospital setting, where we refrained from requesting patients to withhold their anti-PD medications due to concerns about safety issues such as falls. Consequently, certain motor symptoms might have been effectively controlled by the anti-PD medication. Traditionally, symptoms like tremor and rigidity (as reflected by the akinetic rigidity score) respond well to medications, while postural instability and gait disturbance (PIGD) are less responsive. In our cohort, we noted an improvement in tremor scores and stability in akinetic rigidity (AR) scores. Conversely, PD patients with higher baseline plasma EV synaptic protein levels exhibited notable progression in PIGD scores. These findings have been documented in the results section and discussed comprehensively within the revised manuscript as following “On the other hand, the evaluation of motor symptoms occurred in a hospital setting where we did not ask patients to stop taking their anti- PD medications due to safety concerns like the risk of falls. As a result, specific motor symptoms, particularly tremor and AR, which are more sensitive to medication compared to PIGD, may have been effectively managed by the anti-PD medications. This could potentially explain the improvement in tremor observed between the baseline and one-year follow-up, especially among PwP with elevated baseline plasma EV synaptic proteins.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Table 3 is hard to read and some of the values seem repetitive, especially for tremor, AR, and PIGD.

We have ensured the accuracy of the results presented in Table 2. While some of the entries may appear similar, they do indeed possess distinct differences.</p><p>To enhance readability, we streamlined the information in Table 3 by removing the p-values from the intra-group comparisons between baseline and the 1-year follow-up within each domain. We retained the original p-values for trend related to the inter-group comparisons for changes. Detailed information has been relocated to the supplementary section of the revised manuscript. In Figure 2, we illustrated the relationship between baseline plasma extracellular vesicle (EV) synaptic protein levels and the clinical assessment parameters during follow-up in patients with Parkinson's disease (PwP). This portrayal is distinct from the information depicted in Table 3.</p><p>If you had concerns about the resemblance between Table 3 and Figure 3, please note that the values in Table 3 represent raw scores, while the values in Figure 3, namely the estimated marginal means, are the &quot;adjusted&quot; scores for UPDRS-II and PIGD at baseline and follow-up.

This limitation stems from the low concentration of plasma EV synaptic proteins, which restricts the feasibility of utilizing techniques such as ELISA or other quantitative methods for protein assessment.

In the previous manuscript, we provided a relatively detailed account of the procedures related to EV isolation and validation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1096/fj.202100787R">https://doi.org/10.1096/fj.202100787R</ext-link>). In the revised manuscript, we added some information about the principle of the EV isolation kit, and the validation antibody as following “Plasma EVs were isolated from 1 mL of plasma by exoEasy Maxi Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), a membrane-based affinity binding step to isolate exosomes and other EVs without relying on a particular epitope, in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions and storaged in the −80。C freezer. The isolated plasma EVs were then eluted and stored. Usually, 400 μL of eluate is obtained per mL of plasma. The isolated plasma EVs were validated according to the International Society of Extracellular Vesicles guidelines, which include1.markers, including the presence of CD63 (ab59479, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), CD9(ab92726, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), tumor susceptibility gene 101 protein (GTX118736, GeneTex, CA, USA) and negative of cytochrome c (ab110325; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) 2. Physical characterization through the nanoparticle tracking analysis, which demonstrated the majority of the size of EV are mainly within 50-100nm 3. The morphology from the electron microscopy analysis. The validation had been described previously [29-31]. “</p><p>It's important to note that our primary focus was on exosomes, the smallest subtype of EVs. Through nanoparticle tracking analysis, we observed that the majority of isolated EVs fell within the diameter range of 50-150nm, exhibiting significant surface marker (i.e. CD63 and CD9) expression. Moreover, electron microscopy confirmed their vesicular morphology. These meticulously validated EVs were promptly analysed post-isolation.</p><p>However, we acknowledge that the plasma obtained from study participants might have undergone freezing prior to EV isolation. This freezing process has the potential to diminish the yield rate of EVs and result in some degree of fragmentation. We have duly included this issue as a limitation in our revised manuscript as following “The final technical issue in the present study was the relatively small size of the isolated EVs. Despite the primary focus on isolating exosomes, which are the smallest type of EVs, it's important to consider that the presence of small-sized EVs could potentially be attributed to EV fragmentation that occurs during the freezing and thawing processes.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Regarding synaptic protein quantification, the choice of western blotting may not be the best one. ELISA and other multiplex arrays are available. How the authors do justify their choice?</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>Response: Thanks for your comments. We appreciate your input regarding the semi-quantitative western blot analysis not being the most optimal approach. Owing to the limited quantity of isolated plasma EVs and the significant protein abundance of synaptic proteins within these EVs, we did explore the use of an ELISA assay. However, it's worth noting that for a specific subset of the samples, the readout obtained was lower than the lower limit of detection of the ELISA kit. In response, we have incorporated this point as limitation within the discussion section of the revised manuscript as following “Semiquantitative assessment of plasma EV synaptic protein (SNAP-25, GAP-43, and synaptotagmin-1) levels was performed using western blot analysis. The lack of absolute values, i.e. from the results of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, limits further clinical application.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Do the authors try to sort plasma EV by membrane-associated neuronal EV markers using either vesicle sorting or immunoprecipitation?</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>Response: Thanks for your comments. The current study did not specifically isolate neuron-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs), potentially introducing some bias to the results. However, it's important to note that synaptic proteins, such as SNAP-25, exhibit a high degree of neuron-specific expression, with a predominant presence in the brain (as indicated by <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000132639-SNAP25/tissue">https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000132639-SNAP25/tissue</ext-link>). Given this context, the limitation of not analyzing neuron-derived EVs could be mitigated to some extent. In response, we have incorporated this point as limitation within the discussion section of the revised manuscript as following “Furthermore, this study evaluated the overall plasma EVs rather than specifically focusing on neuron-derived exosomes, potentially introducing a bias towards somatic-origin EVs. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that synaptic proteins primarily originate from neurons. Even when considering neuron-derived exosomes, it's important to recognize that they are not exclusively derived from the brain, which can lead to contamination from the peripheral nervous system.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Many technical aspects may be improved.

We recognize that the aforementioned issues represent limitations of our current study.
