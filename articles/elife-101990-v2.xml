complication known as ventilator-induced lung injury. In mice, we found that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and high-volume ventilation, LPS-HVV, lead to hypoxemia with neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formation in the alveoli. Furthermore, <italic>Il1r1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> LPS-HVV mice did not develop hypoxemia and had reduced NETs, indicating that IL-1R1 signaling is important for NETs formation and hypoxemia. Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) is known to reduce the release of inflammatory mediators. In LPS-HVV mice, TH (32°C body temperature) prevented hypoxemia development, reducing albumin leakage, IL-1β, gasdermin D (GSDMD), and NETs formation. We also observed that LPS-primed macrophages, when stimulated at 32°C with ATP or nigericin, release less IL-1β associated with reduced GSDMD cleavage. Thus, hypothermia is an important modulating factor in the NLRP3 inflammasome activation, IL-1β release, and NETs formation, preventing LPS-HVV-induced acute respiratory failure.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Patients suffering from acute respiratory distress syndrome, a serious illness that can affect people with existing conditions, usually require ventilators to assist them with breathing. However, ongoing inflammation and changes to their conditions can complicate this breathing support, sometimes causing ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI).</p><p>VILI can lead to fluid accumulation in the lungs, tissue damage and abnormally low oxygen levels in the blood. The condition has been linked to immune cells, called neutrophils, which release sticky webs as a defense against invading microorganisms. However, together with a mediator of the inflammatory immune response, the cytokine IL-1β, these neutrophil extracellular traps, or NETs, can worsen inflammation and increase damage to the lungs.</p><p>Scientists have been searching for ways to mitigate this damage, and one promising strategy is therapeutic hypothermia, a controlled method of lowering body temperature. However, it has been unclear if cooling can affect the release of IL-1β and the formation of NETs.</p><p>To find out more, Nosaka et al. used a mouse model of acute respiratory distress syndrome and VILI. The researchers injected mice with lipopolysaccharide to mimic the clinical setting of ventilated patients under infection-induced septic shock, or saline solution as a control, and exposed them to high ventilation. They then measured blood pressure, blood oxygen levels and immune factors in the lung. This revealed that IL-1β boosts NET formation, which clogged the mice’s lungs and induced acute lung injury. Cooling the mice’s bodies to 32°C significantly reduced lung damage. It also lowered IL-1β levels and prevented the formation of NETs, thus protecting the lungs.</p><p>Further tests on immune cells showed that hypothermia slowed key steps in inflammation, which reduced harmful immune responses. These results suggest that lowering the body temperature could be a simple and effective way to protect lungs when ventilators are needed, which could be beneficial in the treatment of conditions such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, COVID-19 or other severe lung diseases.</p><p>Therapeutic hypothermia could become an easy, non-invasive way to protect the lungs of critically ill patients and improve hospital care. However, before this treatment can be widely used, clinical trials in humans are needed to confirm its safety and effectiveness.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>macrophages</kwd><kwd>neutrophils</kwd><kwd>lung</kwd><kwd>acute</kwd><kwd>ventilator</kwd><kwd>ARDS</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL130353-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shimada</surname><given-names>Kenichi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Therapeutic hypothermia mitigates ventilator-induced lung injury by suppressing macrophage-derived IL-1β release, thereby reducing neutrophil extracellular trap formation, vascular leakage, and hypoxemia in a two-hit acute lung injury model.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a serious pulmonary disorder defined by the onset of non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema and hypoxemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Force et al., 2012</xref>). While it has been more than 50 years since ARDS was first described in the literature, ARDS is still a major cause of respiratory failure in critically ill patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Matthay et al., 2019</xref>). Positive-pressure mechanical ventilation (MV) has become an essential supportive strategy for the management of ARDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Del Sorbo et al., 2017</xref>). However, with the onset of MV as a treatment, it was eventually understood that MV itself can cause and aggravate lung injury, a condition termed ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rittayamai and Brochard, 2015</xref>). Although the protective ventilation strategy using low tidal volume has been proven to decrease mortality of ARDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pham and Rubenfeld, 2017</xref>), the mortality rate of ARDS remains as high as 40% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bellani et al., 2016</xref>). Non-injurious MV was reported to be able to still activate proinflammatory signals in the lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gharib et al., 2009</xref>). Understanding the mechanisms of VILI should lead to novel strategies to further reduce mortality in ARDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rittayamai and Brochard, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Neutrophils are key players in the development of ARDS and VILI, as their infiltration is a hallmark of lung injury progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grommes and Soehnlein, 2011</xref>). Over the past decade, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have been the subject of intense research, with many advances made (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mutua and Gershwin, 2021</xref>). NETs are a neutrophil-derived meshwork of chromatin fibers decorated with granule peptides and enzymes and represent a critical host defense strategy against invading microorganisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Castanheira and Kubes, 2019</xref>). Intriguingly, recent studies found that NETs play a role in the pathogenesis of tissue injuries, including ARDS and VILI, either with or without infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Porto and Stein, 2016</xref>), and NETs have emerged as an important player in COVID-19 pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Silva et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Veras et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Castanheira and Kubes, 2023</xref>). However, the mechanism of NETs formation and its functional implications in alveolar space during VILI are incompletely understood.</p><p>IL-1β has been linked with many inflammatory disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arend and Guthridge, 2000</xref>). IL-1β levels in BALF were increased in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Conway Morris et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, plasma levels of IL-1β have been associated with worse outcomes in ARDS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Meduri et al., 1995</xref>). However, while how IL-1β mechanistically affects ARDS is still unknown, it seems that increased amounts of IL-1β are associated with the severity of ARDS. NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation and interleukin (IL)-1β release by alveolar macrophages (AMs) was identified as a mechanism for severe acute lung injury (ALI) development in a two-hit model of ARDS using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) instillation and MV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jones et al., 2014</xref>). IL-1β is the most biologically active cytokine in the acute phase of ARDS. It is generally considered that mature IL-1β signals via alveolar epithelial cells, resulting in increased lung permeability and pulmonary edema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ganter et al., 2008</xref>). Recent studies have demonstrated that IL-1β and NETs share gasdermin D (GSDMD) as a facilitator of their release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">He et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sollberger et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, IL-1β promotes NETs formation in different experimental settings, which has attracted attention as an uncovered function of IL-1β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mitroulis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Apostolidou et al., 2016</xref>). However, whether IL-1 participates in NETs induction in lung injury is still unknown.</p><p>Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) has been generating interest as a promising strategy for ARDS refractory to the current evidence-based therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hayek et al., 2017</xref>). TH has long been known to be protective against severe lung injuries clinically and experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Villar and Slutsky, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hayek et al., 2017</xref>). In a porcine two-hit model induced by MV and oleic acid, TH reduced the ARDS-associated lung injury and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Angus et al., 2022</xref>). Additionally, one case report showed the successful use of TH for severe refractory hypoxemia in a COVID-19 patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cruces et al., 2021</xref>). This has led to a phase II clinical trial called ‘cooling to help injured lungs’ (CHILL) in which TH is applied in association with neuromuscular blockade in ARDS patients, including those with COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shanholtz et al., 2023</xref>). TH has strong anti-inflammatory effects, and previous studies have reported inhibition of IL-1β production under hypothermia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Diao et al., 2020</xref>). However, little is known about how TH affects IL-1β production and NETs formation.</p><p>In this study, we found that IL-1R1 signaling enhanced NETs formation, which contributed to the development of hypoxemia and severe ALI. In addition, we found that TH inhibited IL-1β release from macrophages, which led to less NETs formation and albumin leakage in the alveolar space in our lung injury model. These results add new insights into IL-1β signaling in VILI and ARDS, and its down-modulation by TH, which could provide new therapeutic targets.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Hypoxemia and NETs formation in alveoli during severe ALI induced by LPS plus MV</title><p>To better understand the mechanisms underlying ARDS and VILI, we subjected C57BL/6 mice to intratracheal instillation of LPS and MV with high-volume ventilation (HVV) or low-volume ventilation (LVV). At 30 and 150 min of MV, arterial blood gases were measured, and at the end of 180 min, the animals were euthanized and the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The combination of LPS and HVV (LPS-HVV) caused a prominent reduction in the partial pressure of oxygen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) in the arterial blood (PaO<sub>2</sub>) of mice when compared to the other controls receiving normal saline (NS) and/or LVV instillation, indicative of lung dysfunction. The requirement of both LPS and HVV for hypoxemia development was confirmed by the strong interaction (p&lt;0.001) between these two factors found by the statistical analysis, and it occurred without significant change in carbon dioxide partial pressure (PaCO<sub>2</sub>), pH, and base excess in the arterial blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). Hypoxemia was accompanied by increased neutrophil migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) compared with NS+HVV without significant change in the number of macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) as determined by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) and in the total cell number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>) in BALF. To evaluate the induction of local inflammatory responses in the alveoli, we assessed the levels of several inflammatory markers in BALF. Only LPS, but not HVV, was required for the increase of IL-6, TNFα, and CXCL1. On the other hand, only HVV was sufficient to increase the IL-18 release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F–I</xref>). Although these increased inflammatory mediators do not indicate interactions between LPS and HVV in the proposed model, LPS+HVV increased albumin levels in the BALF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), indicating increased vascular permeability. This injury was associated with increased IL-1β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), IL-1α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), CXCL2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), plasminogen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1J</xref>), and fibrinogen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1K</xref>) in the BALF. We next sought to identify if the neutrophils were activated differently between LPS+LVV and LPS-HVV since there was no significant difference in neutrophil migration between the two models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), but only LPS-HVV developed hypoxemia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We measured the concentration of myeloperoxidase (MPO) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>) and neutrophil elastase (NE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>), two neutrophil granule enzymes which are also known to contribute to the formation of NETs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Papayannopoulos et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Metzler et al., 2014</xref>), as well as the presence of histone-DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>) and MPO-DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>) complexes, validated methods for estimating general cell death and NETs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ishii et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yoo et al., 2014</xref>), respectively. We found that LPS-HVV significantly increased all these NETs-associated parameters, indicating the involvement of NETs in the alveolar space with the local severe ALI, resulting in hypoxemia observed in this model.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Severe acute lung injury induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plus high-volume mechanical ventilation (MV) is associated with neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formation in the alveoli.</title><p>LPS or normal saline (NS) was intratracheally instilled into C57BL/6 mice, and after 120 min, the animals were anesthetized and placed on MV for 180 min with the tidal volumes of 30 mL/kg, high-volume ventilation (HVV), or 10 mL/kg low-volume ventilation (LVV) (<bold>A</bold>).

To confirm the participation of IL-1 receptor type 1 (IL-1R1) downstream signaling in the severe ALI development in this two-hit model, we submitted wild-type (WT) and <italic>Il1r1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice to LPS-HVV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). <italic>Il1r1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice did not develop hypoxemia, as shown with preserved PaO<sub>2</sub> values while WT mice have reduced PaO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Although IL1R1 deficiency did not affect the number of neutrophils and macrophages in BALF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>), it prevented the development of edema resulting from increased vascular permeability, as measured by albumin in BALF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). As expected, IL-1β levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>) were not affected by loss of IL-1R1, demonstrating that there is no feedback loop required for IL-1β production in this model. Loss of this receptor also reduced the release of IL-6 in the BALF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>) but did not alter the levels of TNFα and CXCL2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H and I</xref>). Even though the lack of IL-1R1 did not affect neutrophil migration, its loss led to a reduction in BALF MPO and NE levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J and K</xref>), as well as cell death (histone DNA) and the NETs formation as measured by MPO-DNA complexes in the BALF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L and M</xref>). IL-1β has been found to promote NETs formation in some studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mitroulis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Meher et al., 2018</xref>). To confirm the participation of IL-1β in NETs formation in vitro, we used neutrophils from a variety of tissues, including bone marrow neutrophils (BMN), alveolar neutrophils (AN), circulating neutrophils (CN), and peritoneal neutrophils (PN). The purity of these neutrophils was evaluated by flow cytometry (CD45.2<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> Ly6G<sup>+</sup>). Isolated BMN, AN, CN, and PN were approximately 88%, 99%, 86%, and 89% pure, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Moreover, AN nuclei look more segmented than the others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and present higher expression of CD11b and Ly6G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>). Neutrophil quality was tested by the baseline of NETs formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>) with no stimulus after 4 hr of incubation. BMN and AN baseline NETs formation was up to 10%, while CN and PN presented about 20% and 60%, respectively, indicating lower stability under cell culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B and C</xref>). We then evaluated the NETs formation in response to IL-1β, LPS, and ionomycin (ION) by neutrophils under cell culture with concentration-response curves, as well as co-stimulation experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). With BMN and AN, we evaluated the concentration-response with single stimuli and co-stimulation of LPS or IL-1β with ION (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–G</xref>). The concentration-response curves were also evaluated with CN and PN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D and E</xref>). In all samples, the amounts of LPS and IL-1β used were not sufficient to induce NETs formation. Given the better stability of BMN and AN under cell culture, we used these cells for additional experiments. BMN were more resistant to ION, requiring a concentration of 10 μM to induce a 50% NETs formation response, while AN only required 3 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and F</xref>). The sensitivity difference between BMN and AN NETs formation may be related to their maturity state, as AN have highly segmented nuclei and higher CD11b and Ly6G expressions compared with BMN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B–E</xref>). As LPS and IL-1β did not induce NETs formation by themselves, we next investigated if they could alter the response to ION. For this, neutrophils were stimulated with 10 μg/mL of LPS or 100 ng/mL of IL-1β, and 10 μM (BMN) or 3 μM (AN) of ION, and NETs formation was evaluated. We found that IL-1β, but not LPS, enhanced ION-induced NETs formation of both BMN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>) and AN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F and G</xref>).

Several studies have proven that TH can modulate the inflammatory response controlling the release of a variety of inflammatory mediators including IL-1β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Diao et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, we decided to investigate whether hypothermia treatment might provide a feasible way to modulate the development of LPS-HVV-mediated severe ALI. We then subjected C57BL6 to the LPS+HVV model under controlled body temperature of 37±1°C or 32 ± 1°C, designated as normothermia and hypothermia, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>).

Macrophages incubated at 32°C released significantly less IL-1β compared with those incubated at 37° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and E</xref>). The mechanism by which hypothermia inhibits IL-1β release seems to be independent of caspase-1 activation, as there was no difference in caspase-1 activity assay by FLICA between 37°C or 32°C treated macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref>), but we found that hypothermia resulted in reduced caspase-1 release in the supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Cleavage of GSDMD is a late limiting step for inflammasome-mediated IL-1β release because its N-terminal fragment forms pores on macrophages' plasma membrane where the intracellular cytokine crosses into the extracellular compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">He et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, we investigated the effect of 37°C or 32°C temperature on GSDMD expression and cleavage in BMDMs by immunofluorescence and observed that at 32°C BMDMs express less GSDMD with reduced GSDMD cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F–H</xref>). Furthermore, 32°C treatment inhibited GSDMD secretion. These data corroborated our observation that while hypothermia inhibited the IL-1β release in the supernatant, there was a concomitant accumulation of unreleased mature IL-1β in the macrophages incubated at 32°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>).

We have previously reported that NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1β release from AMs are required for the development of hypoxemia in a mouse model of VILI induced by LPS plus MV, and inhibition of IL-1β signaling via anakinra (IL-1RA), an IL-1 receptor antagonist, attenuates the hypoxemia in this model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jones et al., 2014</xref>). However, IL-1α also signals through the IL-1R1. Thus, a second study confirmed that neither anti-IL-1α-treated mice nor IL-1α KO mice were protected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nosaka et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, IL-18 is not sufficient to induce hypoxemia, as saline+HVV-treated mice do not develop hypoxemia but still induce IL-18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nosaka et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, IL-1β – but not IL-1α or IL-18 – appears to play a critical role in inducing hypoxemia during LPS+HVV. In the present study, we now show that IL-1β signaling is important for NETs formation in LPS-stimulated mice undergoing MV, with supporting data demonstrating that IL-1β enhances ION-induced NETs formation in vitro. Other studies have also reported that IL-1β signaling participates in NETs formation by human neutrophils, demonstrating that single stimulus with human IL-1β is sufficient to induce NETs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mitroulis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Meher et al., 2018</xref>). IL-1β plays a role in the inflammation observed in the lungs of ARDS patients, and the IL-1β level correlates with the severity of disease in these patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Meduri et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pugin et al., 1996</xref>). Understanding how IL-1β modulates NETs formation in VILI further enhances the importance of IL-1β as a master cytokine in ALI pathophysiology. In an LPS-induced ALI model, NETs and their components can directly injure endothelial and alveolar epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Saffarzadeh et al., 2012</xref>). In fact, histones, a component of NETs, have been described as damage-associated molecular patterns and can activate Toll-like receptors on a variety of cells, participating in organ injury development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2022</xref>). Previous to the discovery of NETs, neutrophil granule components NE and MPO were already found to cause damage to endothelial glycocalyx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Klebanoff et al., 1993</xref>), which also contribute to lung injury. Neutrophil-derived IL-1β was shown to be released on NETs DNA fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Apostolidou et al., 2016</xref>), which could interact directly with the alveolar capillary barrier, leading to an increase in lung epithelial and endothelial permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Roux et al., 2005</xref>). In addition to the direct role for lung injury, NETs could indirectly aggravate lung injury by inducing further IL-1β production in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hu et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, released MPO on NETs fiber was shown to be active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Parker et al., 2012</xref>), which could also activate AMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grattendick et al., 2002</xref>) and lead to additional IL-1β production. Our data support and expand the premise that IL-1β plays a significant role as a driver of the vicious cycle involved in ventilation-induced ALI and ARDS.</p><p>The two-hit ALI models induced by LPS plus MV have been widely accepted and studied extensively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Domscheit et al., 2020</xref>). Although MV with 20 mL/kg of tidal volume has been generally accepted as clinically relevant HVV, which we have also used so far, Wilson and colleagues showed that this volume was unlikely to induce substantial lung overstretch in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wilson et al., 2012</xref>). In this study, we slightly modified our former model, using 30 mL/kg of tidal volume, to have higher volume of MV. Moreover, we added 3 cm H<sub>2</sub>O positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to avoid atelectrauma and to focus on injury by lung overstretch, known as volutrauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wakabayashi et al., 2014</xref>). We confirmed that both LPS and HVV were required for the development of ALI in our model, using control mice treated with NS and/or LVV. The two-hit requirement in our model resembles the typical clinical ARDS-developing scenario that involves pneumonia and MV, as well as the two-signal for IL-1β production and release. LPS works as the primary signal to induce pro-IL-1β production, and HVV activates the NLRP3 inflammasome and induces IL-1β release in mouse AMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, we found that IL-1β was prominently higher in BALF of LPS+HVV mice and was the main driver of our lung injury model.</p><p>Only a few studies have been focused on NETs formation as an important player in the pathogenesis of VILI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rossaint et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yildiz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2017</xref>). However, NETs are well described as a mechanism in severe COVID-19 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2023</xref>) and ARDS pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Scozzi et al., 2022</xref>). We found that both inhibiting NETs formation by abolishing NETs by DNase I treatment and attenuating LPS+HVV-induced hypoxemia. Previous reports showed increased NETs in systemic circulation or in the lungs in a single-hit VILI mice model, which was markedly reduced by DNase treatment, resulting in attenuated lung injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rossaint et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2017</xref>). In another study, Yildiz and colleagues also investigated NETs formation in the lung tissue of a two-hit VILI mice model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yildiz et al., 2015</xref>). However, their model differed from ours as the authors used (20 mL/kg versus 30 mL/kg) as tidal volume, with no PEEP, for their 4 hr of MV (versus 3 hr in our study) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yildiz et al., 2015</xref>). These investigators found slightly increased IL-1β levels, as well as high concentrations of DNA and citrullinated histone-h3, indirect measurement of NETs, in BALF upon LPS and MV, but DNase treatment was not sufficient to inhibit hypoxemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yildiz et al., 2015</xref>). They also did not observe an attenuation in NETs formation in response to IL-1RA treatment in their model, while we found that LPS+HVV in <italic>IL-1R1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice results in reduced levels of NETs in the alveoli. These observations support the idea that IL-1β may drive more pathogenic NETs formation in LPS+HVV that leads to severe hypoxemia. Given that the role of neutrophils and types of NETs are still not clear in ALI/ARDS, further studies are clearly warranted.</p><p>A striking finding in our study was that hypothermia was protective in an LPS+HVV-mediated mouse model of VILI, preventing severe hypoxemia. Not only did hypothermia treatment in our model inhibit IL-1β release, but it also prevented NETs formation. A previous study demonstrated that hypothermia is not protective in a single-hit VILI mouse model; however, it corroborates our data by showing that hypothermia did inhibit IL-1β release in the alveoli without altering neutrophil migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Faller et al., 2010</xref>). However, in a rat model of LPS-induced ALI, hypothermia inhibited neutrophil migration to the alveoli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lim et al., 2003</xref>). Several studies reported lower IL-1β levels in BALF from hypothermia-treated animals subjected to LPS-induced lung injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lim et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hong et al., 2005</xref>), which is consistent with our results. Lim and colleagues also reported that hypothermia inhibits LPS-induced nuclear factor κB activation in the lungs and in AMs stimulated ex vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lim et al., 2004</xref>). Another study reported that hypothermia attenuated the expression of caspase-1 in traumatic brain injury in rats, with reduced mature IL-1β and caspase-1 in the cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tomura et al., 2012</xref>). In our study, we found that caspase-1 activity was unaltered in BMDMs cultured under hypothermia, but that IL-1β release was impaired and associated with lower GSDMD expression and cleavage. It has been broadly proposed that the cleaved N-terminus GSDMD can form oligomeric pores in the plasma membrane and play a key role in IL-1β secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zou et al., 2021</xref>). While LPS-dependent palmitoylation was proposed as a requirement for N-terminus GSDMD pore formation in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balasubramanian et al., 2024</xref>), the N-terminus GSDMD plasma membrane translocation and pore formation mechanisms are still poorly understood. Indeed, GSDMD binds to mitochondria outer membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miao et al., 2023</xref>) and nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">He et al., 2023</xref>) besides plasma membrane. Furthermore, several studies have shown that soluble GSDMD is detected in culture supernatant or body fluids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Karmakar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nagai et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Silva et al., 2022</xref>), but our study may be the first reporting GSDMD detection in the BALF in LPS plus MV-induced severe ALI. Supporting this, GSDMD can participate in the host defense by binding to pathogen membranes, potentially forming cytotoxic pores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lieberman et al., 2019</xref>). We hypothesized that hypothermia would not affect pro-IL-1β production but inhibit inflammasome activation in macrophages. We found that both immature and mature IL-1β were stuck inside the macrophages with activated caspase-1, associated with a significant reduction in mature GSDMD.</p><p>One limitation of our study is that the data includes only young male mice. However, despite this limitation, we believe these results to be generally applicable as human studies have found that mortality in patients with ARDS does not differ between sexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heffernan et al., 2011</xref>). Additionally, we induced severe ALI by placing mice on HVV 2 hr after LPS administration. At this time point, pulmonary inflammation remains minimal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dagvadorj et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, LPS induces a febrile response in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ganeshan and Chawla, 2017</xref>) and can cause either hyperthermia or hypothermia in mice, depending on the dose and ambient temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rudaya et al., 2005</xref>). Mice and humans also differ in their sensitivity to LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ganeshan and Chawla, 2017</xref>), highlighting limitations when translating these findings to human sepsis or infection responses. It is also important to distinguish between physiological hypothermia (just below 36°C) and TH (typically 32–34°C). While physiological hypothermia is a recognized occurrence in humans with severe infections, it is worth exploring whether TH serves as a protective response or if maintaining normothermia to hyperthermia has detrimental effects.</p><p>In summary, we developed a two-hit model of severe ALI and ARDS in which both LPS and HVV were required to induce hypoxemia in mice. We demonstrated that IL-1β signaling in neutrophils plays a role in NETs induction, which participates in the development of severe lung injury and hypoxemia. Both IL-1β and NETs have been widely implicated as having a key role in the development of ALI. This research adds specific information about the mechanisms by which severe hypoxemia observed in ARDS may be associated with IL-1β effects in lung and NETs formation. These observations suggest that the inflammasome pathway and its downstream mediators, such as IL-1β and NETosis, may be effective therapeutic targets and could be downmodulated by hypothermia during management of ARDS.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>C57BL/6, <italic>S100a8<sup>Cre</sup></italic>, <italic>Il1r1</italic><sup>-/-</sup>, <italic>Lyz2</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice on C57BL/6 background were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). <italic>Padi4</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice were provided by Dr. Kelly Mowen (Scripps Research, San Diego, CA, USA). <italic>Atg16l1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice were provided by Dr. Shih (Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA).

The purification was made using two different density gradient protocols made with Percoll (Percoll, GE Healthcare, GE17-0891-01) prepared in Hanks’ balanced salt solution (HBSS). The Percoll gradient 1 (PG1) consists of a three-layer gradient made with 75%, 57%, and 52% of Percoll, and the Percoll gradient 2 (PG2) consists of two layers, 68% and 52% of Percoll. The gradients containing 1 mL of cell suspension on the top were centrifuged for 30 min, 1500 × <italic>g</italic> at RT, with soft acceleration and deceleration. Neutrophils were located above the 75% or 68% Percoll layers for PG1 and PG2, respectively. To obtain BMNs, mice were euthanized, and the rear leg bones were removed and flushed with HBSS with 2 mM of EDTA (HBSS-EDTA). The cells were centrifuged for 5 min, 450 × <italic>g</italic> at RT, and the red blood cells (RBCs) were lysed by adding 10 mL of 0.2% NaCl, gently mixing for 30 s. The salt balance was recovered by adding 5 mL of 2.3% NaCl. The cells were centrifuged for 5 min, 450 × <italic>g</italic> at RT, and resuspended in 1 mL of HBSS-EDTA. The cell suspension was carefully added to the PG1, and the BMN isolation was performed as above. For ANs, as described in the two-hit ALI model, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane, orotracheally intubated with intravenous catheter, and LPS 0.2 mg/kg was i.t. instilled. Three days later, BALF was obtained with 5 mL of HBSS-EDTA divided into five lavages with 1 mL of HBSS-EDTA. The cells were centrifuged for 5 min, 450 × <italic>g</italic> at RT, and resuspended at 1 mL of HBSS-EDTA. The cell suspension was carefully added to PG2, and the AN were isolated. CNs were obtained from the blood collected 6 hr after LPS 0.2 mg/kg i.p. injection. The total whole blood was collected by retro-orbital bleeding, in a 5 mL tube containing 2.5 mL of EDTA (2 mg/mL in PBS). The RBCs were lysed by adding the blood (maximum 5 mL, 2.5 mL of blood+2.5 mL of EDTA) to 30 mL of 0.2% NaCl, gently mixing for 30 s. The salt balance was recovered by adding 15 mL of 2.3% NaCl. The lysis step was repeated one time in case remaining RBCs were observed in the pellet formed after 5 min of centrifugation, 450 × <italic>g</italic> at RT. After total elimination of RBCs, the pellet was resuspended in 1 mL of HBSS-EDTA. The cell suspension was added to the PG2, and the CN were purified. For peritoneal neutrophil isolation, mice received i.p. injections with 1.5 mL of 3% thioglycolate, and after 16 hr, the animals were euthanized, and the peritoneal cavity was washed with 5 mL of HBSS-EDTA. The cells were centrifuged for 5 min, 450 × <italic>g</italic> at RT, and resuspended in 1 mL of HBSS-EDTA. The cell suspension was added to PG2, and the neutrophils were isolated.

Neutrophil purity was evaluated by flow cytometry by staining the cells with PE anti-mouse Ly6G (50-1276-U100, 1:200, Tonbo Bioscience), FITC anti-human/mouse CD11b (35-0112-U100, 1:200, Tonbo Bioscience), and APC/Cyanine7 anti-mouse CD45.2 (109824, 1:200, BioLegend). The percentage of neutrophils (CD11b<sup>+</sup> Ly6G<sup>+</sup>) was determined in the gate of CD45.2<sup>+</sup> cells, analyzed using FlowJo software (FlowJo LLC 10.10.0, Becton Dickinson).

We made three sets of experiments to investigate NETs formation under different conditions, using RPMI/neutrophils to prepare all the treatments. In the first set, after resting the cells for 1 hr at 37°C, the cells were treated with the following: LPS (30–100,000 ng/mL); IL-1β (recombinant mouse IL-1β protein, ab259421, Abcam) (0.3–1000 ng/mL); and ION (ionomycin calcium salt 10634, Sigma-Aldrich) (10–100,000 nM). In the second set, combined stimuli were given to BMN and AN. The cells were first rested at 37°C for 30 min, LPS (10 µg/mL) or IL-1β (100 nM) was added, and after 30 min, the cells were treated with the concentration of ION sufficient to induce about 50% of NETs formation, which is 10 µM for BMN and 3 µM for AN. In the third set, BMN and AN were placed at 37°C or 32°C for 1 hr, and then treated with ION 10 µM for BMN and 3 µM for AN. In all of them, the cells were incubated for 4 hr at 37°C or 32°C, maintaining the initial resting temperature setting in each experiment, to allow NETs induction. The cells were then stained with 5 µM of SYTOX Green (SYTOX Green Nucleic Acid Stain, 57020, Invitrogen) prepared in sterile PBS and centrifuged for 5 min, 500 × <italic>g</italic> RT. The images were obtained on a Keyence BZ-9000 (Keyence Corporation of America) microscope at ×20 magnification. The NETs forming neutrophils percentage was evaluated manually by investigators blinded to sample identity. Quantification was based on the total cell number in the field, determined by the sum of Hoechst (white) and SYTOX Green (green) positive cells, as counted using the Keyence BioAnalyzer software (Keyence Corporation of America).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>BMDM culture</title><p>Bone marrow was obtained from 8- to 12-week-old male WT C57BL/6, <italic>Atg16l1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> or <italic>Atg16l1<sup>Δ/Δ</sup> Lyz2<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice, and BMDMs were differentiated in RPMI/macrophages (RPMI 1640, 10-041-CV, Corning; supplemented with 1% of Penicillin-Streptomycin Solution, 30-0002-CL, Corning; 50 μM of 2-mercaptoethanol; and 10% of Fetal Bovine Serum, FB-02, Omega Scientific) containing 15% of L929 cell conditioned medium (LCM) for 7 days, supplementing the medium with extra 15% of LCM every 3 days. Cells were washed with PBS, and non-adherent cells were removed; adherent cells were then collected and seeded in a 96-well plate 1 day before stimulation. BMDMs were primed with LPS 1 μg/mL for 3 hr, followed by ATP 5 mM (adenosine 5′-triphosphate disodium salt, A2383-1G, Sigma-Aldrich) or NIG 10 μM (Nigericin sodium salt, BML-CA421-0005, Enzo Life Sciences) stimulation for 30 min at either 37°C or 32°C, and the supernatants were collected for ELISA measurements and western blotting, and the cells were lysed for western blotting. For evaluating caspase-1 activity and GSDMD expression by immunofluorescence, LPS-primed BMDMs were stimulated with 5 mM ATP for 15 min or 10 μM NIG for 30 min. For caspase-1 activity, a commercial kit (FAM-FLICA Caspase-1 Assay Kit, 98, Immunochemistry Technology) was used. Immunoblots were performed using antibodies against IL-1β (anti-IL-1 beta antibody, 2 μg/mL, ab9722; Abcam), caspase-1 (recombinant anti-pro caspase-1+p10+p12 antibody, 1:1000, ab179515; Abcam), and GSDMD (recombinant anti-GSDMD antibody, 1:1000, ab209845, Abcam). The GSDMD antibody used in the immunoblot was also used for immunofluorescence staining, which was mounted with fluorescence mounting medium with DAPI (Mounting Medium With DAPI, ab104139, Abcam).

What would be the role of IL1a in this scenario?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for asking this question. We have addressed this in our previous paper (Nosaka et al. Front Immunol 2020;11; 207) where we used anti-IL-1a and IL-1a KO mice (Nosaka et al. Front Immunol 2020;11; 207) in our model and found that neither anti-IL-1a treated mice nor IL-1a KO mice were protected. Thus, IL-1b plays a role in inducing hypoxemia during LPS+HVV but not IL-1a. We will now add this point in our revised manuscript discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors depleted neutrophils using anti-Ly6G. What about MDSCs? Do these latter cells be involved in ARDS and VILI?</p></disp-quote><p>Anti-Ly6G neutrophils depletion may potentially affect G-MDSCs as well (Blood Adv 2022 Jul 29;7(1):73–86), however, we have not looked directly at G-MDSCs. If these cells were depleted we would have expected to see an increase in inflammation, which we did not. Instead, anti-Ly6G treated mice were protected. Thus, we can not comment on any presumed role of G-MDSCs in LPS+HVV induced severe ALI model that we used.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors found that TH inhibited IL-1β release from macrophages led to less NETs formation and albumin leakage in the alveolar space in their lung injury model. A graphical abstract could be included suggesting a cellular mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for summarizing our findings and the suggestion. Unfortunately, eLIFE does not publish a graphical abstract.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) If Macrophages are responsible for IL1b release that via IL1R1 induces NETosis, what happens if you deplete macrophages? what is the role of epithelial cells?</p></disp-quote><p>Previous studies have found that macrophage depletion is protective in several models of ALI (Eyal. Intensive Care Med. 2007;33:1212–1218., Lindauer. J Immunol. 2009;183:1419–1426.), and other researchers have found that airway epithelial cells did not contribute to IL-1β secretion (Tang. PLoS ONE. 2012;7:e37689.). We have previously reported that epithelial cells produce IL-18 without LPS priming signal during LPS+HVV (Nosaka et al. Front Immunol 2020;11; 207). Thus, IL-18 is not sufficient to induce Hypoxemia as Saline+HVV treated mice do not develop hypoxemia (Nosaka et al. Front Immunol 2020;11; 207). We will now add this point to the revised discussion of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Nosaka et al is a comprehensive study exploring the involvement of IL1beta signaling in a 2-hit model of lung injury + ventilation, with a focus on modulation by hypothermia.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors demonstrate quite convincingly that interleukin 1 beta plays a role in the development of ventilator-induced lung injury in this model, and that this role includes the regulation of neutrophil extracellular trap formation.

The main model used, one of intratracheal LPS plus mechanical ventilation is well accepted for research exploring the pathogenesis and potential treatments for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, the interpretation may still be open to question - in the model here, animals were exposed to LPS to induce inflammation for only 2 hours, and seemingly displayed no signs of sickness, before the start of ventilation. This would not be typical for the majority of ARDS patients, and whether hypothermia could be effective once substantial injury is already present remains an open question. The interaction between LPS/infection and temperature is also complicated - in humans, LPS (or infection) induces a febrile, hyperthermic response, whereas in mice LPS induces hypothermia (eg. Ganeshan K, Chawla A. Nat Rev Endocrinol. 2017;13:458-465). Given this difference in physiological response, it is therefore unclear whether hypothermia in mice and hypothermia in humans are easily comparable. Finally, the use of only young, male animals such as in the current study has been typical but may be criticised as limiting translatability to people.</p><p>Therefore while the conclusions of the paper are well supported by the data, and the biological pathways have been impressively explored, questions still remain regarding the ultimate interpretations.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that at two hours post LPS, there is only minimal pulmonary inflammation at that time (Dagvadorj et al Immunity 42, 640–653). This is a limitation to the experimental model we used in our study. Additionally, as the reviewer pointed out that LPS induces hyperthermia in human, but it is also well-established that physiological hypothermia occurs in humans with severe infections and sepsis (Baisse. Am J Emerg Med. 2023 Sep: 71: 134-138., Werner. Am J Emerg Med. 2025 Feb;88:64-78.). Therefore, the difference between human and mouse responses to sepsis or infections may be more nuanced. Furthermore, it is important to distinguish between physiological hypothermia (just &lt;36°C) and therapeutic hypothermia (typically 32-34°C). We will add to the discussion whether hypothermia serves as a protective response, and the transition from normothermia to hyperthermia could have detrimental effects. We only used young male mice in our study as the Reviewer points out; we will also add this point to the revised discussion as a limitation of our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p>(i) With hypothermia, metabolic activity would be expected to be reduced and therefore presumably impact on CO2/pH. These may have an impact on outcomes from ventilation, so could the authors include this data and discuss as appropriate?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included these data in Suppl Fig 6. While we observed significant differences in blood pH and PaCO<sub>2</sub> in Hypothermia treatment group, these values remained within clinically normal range (PaCO<sub>2</sub> : 35 - 45 mmHg, pH : 7.35 - 7.45). Neither Alkalosis (PaCO<sub>2</sub> &lt; 35 mmHg , pH&gt; 7.45) nor Acidosis (PaCO<sub>2</sub> &gt; 45 mmHg, pH &lt; 7.35) was observed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(ii) It is noticeable that there are quite large differences in experimental numbers between groups - typically 7-12, 5-12 in Figure 2. How were these N determined? For example is there a reason why there is apparently N = 8 for BALF neutrophils in the saline + HVV group (Figure 1c) but N = 12 for LPS + HVV group? Did any animals die during any of the protocols for example?</p></disp-quote><p>We conducted experiments with 4 mice per experiment (2 mice per group x2 or 4 mice per group) for ventilation experiments, and pooled data from 5-6 independent experiments or 3-4 independent experiments, respectively. No mouse mortality was observed (unless otherwise noted). However, in the severe ARDS group, some mice were dehydrated by the endpoint of experiments, preventing blood or BALF collections. As a result sample sizes were unequal in some case. Nevertheless, no data were selectively excluded.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(iii) Discussion - On page 13 you refer to data involving Cl-amidine administration. This does not seem to be related to any experiments reported in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We apology for this mistake and have removed it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(iv) Methods - authors state that BALF was obtained after 150 minutes of ventilation, yet the experiments apparently lasted for 180 minutes. Presumably this is an error?</p></disp-quote><p>We apology for this inconsistency. We collected blood for measuring blood gas at 30 min and 150 min after ventilation. However, mice were kept on ventilator 30 min longer, and then mice were euthanized and BALF were collected. Thus, BALF were collected at 180 min, 30 minutes after the final blood draw. We have corrected the methods in revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(v) Statistical methods - authors state that sometimes Mann-Whitney U-test was used and sometimes unpaired t-test, presumably reflecting that some data were normally distributed and some were not. Could the authors please describe the tests used to confirm distribution of data.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified which stattistcal methods were used in our revised manuscript.</p><p>Briefly, Normality within the groups was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk and KolmogorovSmirnov tests. Three-way ANOVA (Figure 1B; Supplemental Figure 1B-D; Supplemental Figure 6), one-way ANOVA (Supplemental Figure 4D-E; Supplemental Figure 5C), and two-way ANOVA were performed for data with more than two groups, followed by Tukey's post hoc test. Some groups analyzed by two-way ANOVA in Figure 1 and Supplemental Figure 1 failed the normality tests due to zero values (analyte not detected by ELISA) or the relatively small sample size, as samples were distributed across multiple measurements. However, the primary group of interest, LPS+HVV, showed significant differences from other groups with consistently low P-values in most datasets, supporting the decision to retain the ANOVA analyses. For comparisons between two groups, the Mann-Whitney U test was used when one or both groups failed the Shapiro-Wilk normality test, while the unpaired Student's t-test was applied to the remaining normally distributed data.</p></body></sub-article></article>
