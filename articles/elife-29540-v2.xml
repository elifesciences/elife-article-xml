We report novel mechanisms by which TRMs regulate T cell activities at tissue sites. These mechanisms are mediated by the complement receptor of immunoglobulin family (CRIg). Using animal models for autoimmune type 1 diabetes (T1D), we found that CRIg<sup>+</sup> TRMs formed a protective barrier surrounding pancreatic islets. Genetic ablation of CRIg exacerbated islet inflammation and local T cell activation. CRIg exhibited a dual function of attenuating early T cell activation and promoting the differentiation of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory (Treg) cells. More importantly, CRIg stabilized the expression of Foxp3 in Treg cells, by enhancing their responsiveness to interleukin-2. The expression of CRIg in TRMs was postnatally regulated by gut microbial signals and metabolites. Thus, environmental cues instruct TRMs to express CRIg, which functions as an immune checkpoint molecule to regulate adaptive immunity and promote immune tolerance.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>macrophages</kwd><kwd>T cells</kwd><kwd>immune checkpoint</kwd><kwd>immunological tolerance</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>CRIg</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100002570</institution-id><institution>American Association of Immunologists</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yuan</surname><given-names>Xiaomei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008871</institution-id><institution>JDRF</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2-SRA-2016-306-S-B</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fu</surname><given-names>Wenxian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 DK063491</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fu</surname><given-names>Wenxian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007911</institution-id><institution>University of California, San Diego</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UL1 TR000100</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fu</surname><given-names>Wenxian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Tissue-resident macrophages sense environmental cues and regulate adaptive immunity via an immune checkpoint molecule CRIg.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Most complex diseases are associated with a tissue-specific chronic inflammation. Excessive inflammation has deleterious consequences, characterized by tissue damage and disease onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Medzhitov, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grivennikov et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Olefsky and Glass, 2010</xref>). Understanding cellular and molecular mechanisms that can keep inflammation in check will have important therapeutic implications in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Macrophages, especially tissue-resident populations (TRMs) represent a key constituent of the innate immune system in orchestrating inflammation and influencing the functions of other immune and non-immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Medzhitov, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davies et al., 2013</xref>). In concert with other innate immune cells (e.g., mast cells), macrophages sense environmental stimuli and subsequently instruct adaptive immunity (primarily T cells), together to elicit the processes of host defense and tissue repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Iwasaki and Medzhitov, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Under autoimmune conditions, self-reactive T cells accumulate at tissue sites and lead to tissue destruction. T cell activities need to be restrained to maintain immunological tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sharpe and Freeman, 2002</xref>). However, how these autoimmune T cell responses are influenced by tissue microenvironment remains poorly understood. We hypothesize that macrophages, especially TRMs may fulfill such a role to modulate tissue T cell activities. Multiple mechanisms may be exploited by these TRMs to regulate T cell activities. First, these TRMs express multiple coinhibitory molecules of B7/CD28 and TNFR families, such as PD-L1, PD-1 and TIM-4 (refs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kuang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gordon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thornley et al., 2014</xref>]). Second, TRMs may regulate the generation, stability, and function of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T (Treg) cells. This notion is supported by a few studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Denning et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Soroosh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Haribhai et al., 2016</xref>). These studies have demonstrated that macrophages residing in the lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Soroosh et al., 2013</xref>), or intestinal lamina propria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Denning et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Haribhai et al., 2016</xref>) can promote the generation of Treg cells. These two mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, because certain coinhibitory molecules (e.g., PD-L1) have been found to promote the generation of Treg cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Francisco et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amarnath et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Recently, a new subset of TRMs has been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Helmy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vogt et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fu et al., 2012</xref>). These macrophages are phenotypically characterized as CD11b<sup>+</sup> F4/80<sup>hi</sup> CRIg<sup>+</sup>. CRIg<sup>+</sup> macrophages can be detected in peritoneal cavity and most digestive organs, including pancreas, liver, small and large intestines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Helmy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vogt et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gautier et al., 2012</xref>). Macrophages from lymphoid organs do not express CRIg. CRIg is also absent in other immune cells, including T cells, B cells, NK cells, dendritic cells, monocytes, and neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Helmy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vogt et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, the expression of CRIg is restricted to TRMs. CRIg (gene symbol: <italic>Vsig4</italic>) was previously reported as a complement receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Helmy et al., 2006</xref>). It binds to complement components C3b, iC3b and C3c, and is involved in the phagocytosis of microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Helmy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wiesmann et al., 2006</xref>). However, further studies including ours, have revealed that CRIg can function as a coinhibitory molecule of the B7/CD28 superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vogt et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fu et al., 2012</xref>). In this regard, CRIg potently suppresses T cell proliferation and cytokine production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vogt et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fu et al., 2012</xref>). Given that CRIg is exclusively expressed by TRMs, we propose that CRIg mediated signaling represents a tissue-derived mechanism by which resident macrophages regulate tissue homeostasis and inflammatory processes.</p><p>In autoimmune type 1 diabetes (T1D), islet inflammation (insulitis) is exacerbated by the loss-of-balance between regulatory and pathogenic immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bluestone et al., 2010</xref>). However, not all individuals with insulitis proceed to become diabetic, suggesting that there exist mechanisms that can keep insulitis in check. We have previously found that the abundance of CRIg<sup>+</sup> macrophages in the pancreas was negatively correlated with the risk of diabetes onset in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, the primary animal model for T1D. More importantly, in vivo administration of CRIg-Ig fusion protein suppressed diabetes in these mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fu et al., 2012</xref>). In this study, we attempted to understand how CRIg impacts T cell activities using mouse T1D as a primary model system. Our studies revealed a dual role of CRIg in regulating effector T cell proliferation and Treg differentiation and stability. Together, these two outcomes led to a reinforced immune tolerance in NOD mice. Furthermore, we investigated the role of gut microbiota and derived metabolites in regulating the expression of CRIg in TRMs. Together, these findings support a new model of immune regulation in tissue homeostasis whereby environmental cues instruct TRMs to express CRIg, which functions as an immune checkpoint molecule to regulate adaptive immunity and promote immune tolerance.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CRIg<sup>+</sup> TRMs form a protective barrier surrounding pancreatic islets to prevent autoimmune infiltration in NOD mice</title><p>CRIg is exclusively expressed in TRMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Helmy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vogt et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fu et al., 2012</xref>). CRIg<sup>+</sup> macrophages can be detected in most digestive organs at steady state, including the pancreas, liver, colon and peritoneal cavity of both C57BL/6 (B6) and NOD mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1-figure supplement 1A, B</xref> and data not shown). CRIg<sup>+</sup> cells was also found in human pancreas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). There was no CRIg<sup>+</sup> cell in the lung in both mouse strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref> and data not shown). The expression of CRIg was not detected in lymphoid-lineage cells, including T cells, B cells and NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In the pancreas, CRIg<sup>+</sup> TRMs were enriched at the capsular area of the islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), exhibiting a perivascular distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fu et al., 2012</xref>). We have previously found that the abundance of islet CRIg<sup>+</sup> macrophages in NOD mice was negatively correlated with the risk of diabetes onset in these animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fu et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting a disease-suppressing role of CRIg<sup>+</sup> TRMs in T1D. However, the mechanisms remained undefined. Given the unique tissue distribution pattern of these cells, we examined the relationship between the severity of insulitis and the abundance of peri-islet CRIg<sup>+</sup> TRMs on a per-islet basis in pre-diabetic NOD mice. We found that intact islets (free from autoimmune infiltration) were associated with more abundant peri-islet CRIg<sup>+</sup> TRMs. In contrast, in insulitic islets, there was a lack of CRIg expression in TRMs, especially in those peri-islet areas succumbed to infiltration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These results suggest that CRIg<sup>+</sup> TRMs may function as a local barrier to prevent immune infiltration into pancreatic islets. We proposed that CRIg molecule was critical for these TRMs to exhibit such a protective role in insulitis. To confirm the role of CRIg, we generated CRIg-null mutation onto a NOD background. Indeed, genetic ablation of CRIg significantly exacerbated the severity of insulitis, reflected by a massive infiltration of leukocytes in most islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), supporting a critical role of CRIg for these CRIg<sup>+</sup> TRMs to suppress insulitis. This was consistent with our previously published observations showing that the lower the number of pancreatic CRIg<sup>+</sup> TRMs, the higher the incidence of diabetes in NOD mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fu et al., 2012</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29540.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>CRIg<sup>+</sup>TRMs form a protective barrier to prevent tissue autoimmune infiltration and activation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The distribution of CRIg<sup>+</sup> TRMs within the pancreas.

Due to the heterogeneities of insulitis in NOD mice, we calculated the ratios between regulatory and pathogenic cells in pancreatic islets to more accurately reflect how CRIg deficiency affected the severity of insulitis within each individual mouse. Comparing to age-matched wildtype NOD mice, CRIg knockout (KO) mice exhibited an altered balance between regulatory and effector T cells, reflected by: (i) The fraction of Treg cells was reduced in pancreatic islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Such a reduction of Treg abundance was not seen in lymphoid organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), supporting a tissue-specific immunoregulatory role of CRIg. (ii) The ratio between pancreatic Treg and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was also reduced in NOD/CRIg KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We next analyzed cytokine production in T cells isolated from NOD/CRIg KO and littermate control mice. Both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells isolated from the pancreatic islets, not lymphoid organs, of NOD/CRIg KO mice exhibited significantly increased production of IFN-γ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), which is a key pathogenic cytokine in T1D development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feuerer et al., 2009</xref>). We next examined whether CRIg<sup>+</sup> TRMs interacted with T cells. Immunostaining of pre-diabetic islets (with ongoing insulitis) from NOD mice showed that there were cell clusters containing both CRIg<sup>+</sup> TRMs and T cells in close proximity, suggesting a cell-cell contact between CRIg<sup>+</sup> TRMs and T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>In summary, pancreatic CRIg<sup>+</sup> TRMs form a protective barrier surrounding the islets to prevent insulitis and impact local immuno-balance between effector and regulatory T cells. CRIg molecule plays a central role for these TRMs to exert their diabetes-suppressing effect.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>CRIg suppresses T cell proliferation by attenuating early T cell activation signaling</title><p>CRIg has been reported to suppress T cell activation and cytokine production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vogt et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fu et al., 2012</xref>). However, how CRIg regulates T cell activities remains unknown. Consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vogt et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fu et al., 2012</xref>), we found that plate-coated CRIg-Ig, not control Ig, suppressed T cell proliferation in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We asked whether CRIg affected early activation phase, or late proliferation phase, of T cells. To answer this question, we isolated CD4<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>-</sup> conventional T (Tconv) cells and cultured them in vitro for 3 days with anti-CD3/CD28. These cultured T cells were supplemented with plate-coated CRIg-Ig under two different conditions - either only the first 24 hours (hr), or only the late 48 hr, of the in vitro culture. We found that the presence of CRIg-Ig during the first 24 hr was sufficient to suppress T cell proliferation, to an extent similar to the condition where CRIg-Ig was present all time of the culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In contrast, when CRIg-Ig was only present during the last 48 hr, its suppressive effect on T cell proliferation was largely abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Therefore, CRIg interferes early T cell activation. This notion was further supported by flow cytometric analysis of the expression of CD69 and CD25, two cell-surface markers depicting T cell activation. In a time-course assay, the majority of T cells exhibited an upregulation of both CD69 and CD25 within 17 hr. CRIg-Ig potently suppressed the upregulation of both CD69 and CD25 in T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We then examined whether CRIg affected TCR signaling pathways. Using phosphorylation assays, we found that the presence of plate-bound CRIg-Ig suppressed the phosphorylation of ZAP70, ERK1/2, AKT and ribosomal protein S6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). These data suggest that CRIg-Ig dampens several pathways that are crucial for early T cell activation, including the most proximal signaling complex (ZAP70), the ERK-MAPK pathway (ERK1/2, and S6) and the AKT-MTOR pathway (AKT, S6).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29540.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>CRIg suppresses T cell activation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) CFSE-labeled CD4<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>-</sup> Tconv cells were stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28.

We asked whether complement components were involved in CRIg elicited T cell suppression. Using a specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) (clone 14G8) (ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gorgani et al., 2008</xref>]) that can block the binding of CRIg to C3 components, we found that 14G8 did not abolish T cell suppression by CRIg, suggesting that complements were not involved in CRIg-mediated T cell suppression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This notion was further supported by that CRIg can attenuate TCR activation in serum-free condition, which was deprived of complements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In fact, CRIg-Ig mediated suppression of T cell proliferation was even enhanced by anti-CRIg (e.g., clone 14G8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), or other clonotypes of anti-CRIg mAbs that do not interfere the binding of CRIg to C3 components (data not shown), suggesting a possible cross-linking effect by anti-CRIg mAbs on CRIg-Ig. In line with this, we found that soluble CRIg-Ig did not suppress T cell proliferation. In contrast, pre-coating the plates with anti-CRIg mAb (clone 14G8, or 17C9) enabled soluble CRIg-Ig to potently suppress T cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>We then asked whether CRIg can directly bind to T cells. In this regard, isolated CD4<sup>+</sup> Tconv cells were activated in vitro with anti-CD3/CD28 and cultured for various lengths of time (12, 24, and 72 hr, respectively). At each stage of T cell activation, these cells were incubated with biotinylated CRIg-Ig or control Ig at 37°C for 1 hr, and the binding was measured using a streptavidin-conjugated secondary Ab. We found that CRIg can bind to activated T cells, in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Interestingly, we observed stronger binding of CRIg-Ig to T cells at their early, not late, stage of in vitro activation (12 hr and 24 hr versus 72 hr) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This was consistent with the suppressive effect of CRIg-Ig on T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). CRIg-Ig can also bind to activated Treg cells. However, in any analyzed concentration of CRIg-Ig, or time-point, the binding intensity was lower comparing to that for Tconv cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Consistent with this, Treg cells were less sensitive to CRIg-mediated suppression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>).</p><p>The extracellular domains of CRIg contain one IgV-type of immunoglobulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Helmy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vogt et al., 2006</xref>).

Based on the availabilities of Ig fusion proteins, we tested CTLA-4, PD-1, VISTA, CD226 and TIGIT to assess whether the soluble forms of any of these proteins can block the effect of CRIg-Ig on T cell proliferation.

We asked whether CRIg has a similar effect on Treg differentiation. We assessed this possibility in an in vitro TGF-β - induced Treg (iTreg) condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2003</xref>). Purified CD4<sup>+</sup> Foxp3(GFP)<sup>-</sup> Tconv cells from the spleen and LNs of NOD/Foxp3<sup>GFP</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Haribhai et al., 2007</xref>) were cultured in the presence of anti-CD3/CD28, IL-2 and TGF-β to induce iTreg differentiation. As expected, TGF-β promoted iTreg differentiation in a dose-dependent manner. At any given dose of TGF-β, CRIg-Ig further enhanced the generation of iTreg cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). CRIg-mediated enhancement of iTreg generation was more profound when TGF-β concentration was relatively low (e.g., there was a more than two-fold increase of iTreg induction by CRIg-Ig with 0.2 ng/ml TGF-β) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). To assess whether CRIg-Ig alone could induce the conversion of Tconv cells into iTreg cells, an anti-TGF-β neutralizing mAb (clone 1D11) (ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang et al., 2015</xref>]) was added to eliminate any trace-amount of TGF-β in the culture medium. In the absence of TGF-β, CRIg-Ig alone did not induce the generation of iTreg cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Treg cells can be converted from Tconv cells under the conditions where antigens (Ag) are encountered in the absence of optimal costimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kretschmer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Verginis et al., 2008</xref>).

We next evaluated whether CRIg<sup>+</sup> macrophages can promote iTreg generation.

We found that a 2-week in vivo CRIg-Ig treatment preferentially enhanced pTreg development in pancreatic islets, not pancreas- draining or non-draining lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Conversely, we transferred purified BDC2.5<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> Foxp3(GFP)<sup>-</sup> Tconv cells into either NOD or NOD/CRIg KO mice. The generation of Treg cells was compromised in the absence of CRIg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Of note, this reduction only occurred in the pancreas, not in pancreas-draining or non-draining lymph nodes, suggesting a local microenvironment-specific role of CRIg in regulating pTreg generation.

An anti-TGF-β neutralizing antibody (clone 1D11) was added to eliminate the trace amount of TGF-β in the culture medium. After 3 days, about 50% of control iTreg cells lost their expression of Foxp3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In contrast, in the presence of plate-bound CRIg-Ig, a significantly higher fraction of iTreg cells retained Foxp3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The loss of Foxp3 in restimulated iTreg cells was exacerbated over the course of cell dividing.

Moreover, the expression level of Foxp3 protein on a per cell basis was also higher in restimulated iTreg cells in the presence of CRIg-Ig, compared to that in control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Notably, this Treg-stabilizing effect of CRIg is TGF-β independent, because we have added an anti-TGF-β neutralizing mAb to eliminate any trace amount of TGF-β.

We asked whether iTreg cells, when restimulated in the presence of CRIg-Ig, were more responsive to limited amount of IL-2. In this regard, TGF-β induced iTreg cells were sorted and restimulated with anti-CD3/CD28, in the presence of CRIg-Ig or control Ig, with various doses of IL-2. In control iTreg cells restimulated with anti-CD3/CD28, increased concentrations of IL-2 did not prevent the loss of Foxp3 in these cells. In contrast, the presence of CRIg-Ig resulted in a significantly higher fraction of restimulated iTreg cells retaining their expression of Foxp3, in the presence of IL-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). CRIg induced iTreg cells expressed a higher level of IL-2Rβ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>), suggesting an enhanced responsiveness of these cells to IL-2.

IL-2-induced STAT5 phosphorylation in iTreg cells was significantly enhanced by CRIg-Ig (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>).

One week later, transferred iTreg cells from both spleen and pancreatic islets were analyzed. Control and CRIg iTreg cells exhibited similar degrees of engraftments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>), suggesting that preconditioning with CRIg did not affect homeostatic survival and expansion of these adoptively transferred cells.

In spleen, a significantly higher fraction of transferred CRIg-iTreg cells maintained their expression of Foxp3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Although CRIg (plate-bound) was present during the in vitro generation of iTreg cells, it was dissociated from these cells after adoptive transfer.

The instability of adoptively transferred iTreg cells was more profoundly exacerbated in pancreatic islets, as expected. However, preconditioning with CRIg before the adoptive transfer retained a significantly higher percentage of Foxp3 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

The role for Th17 cells in T1D has been controversial, either diabetogenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Emamaullee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gao et al., 2010</xref>) or protective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tse et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nikoopour et al., 2010</xref>).

Because we have previously found that the onset of diabetes was suppressed in CRIg-Ig treated NOD mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fu et al., 2012</xref>), it thus can be speculated that these accumulated Th17 cells in pancreatic islets are not diabetogenic.

Such an outcome is achieved through a dual effect of CRIg: the suppression of pathogenic Th1 cells and the promotion of Treg cell differentiation and function. The diabetogenicity of effector T cells can be further dampened by elevated Treg abundance and function. Overall, CRIg-mediated immunomodulation diverts autoimmunity towards immunological tolerance.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>The expression of CRIg in TRMs is influenced postnatally by microbial signals</title><p>The above findings support a role of CRIg as a tissue environment-specific checkpoint molecule for immunological homeostasis. The dearth of CRIg expression in TRMs is tightly correlated with exacerbated tissue inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Therefore, it is worth investigating what factors and signals regulate the expression of CRIg in TRMs. CRIg is abundantly expressed in a number of organs/tissues, including liver Kupffer cells of adult mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Helmy et al., 2006</xref>). However, in contrast, CRIg was almost completely absent in the liver from neonatal (day one post birth) mice, though F4/80<sup>+</sup> Kupffer cells were readily detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). We confirmed the absence of CRIg expression in macrophages from other tissues, including the pancreas in neonatal mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Therefore, CRIg is not constitutively expressed in macrophages, rather, is contingent upon extrinsic signals arisen postnatally. We then asked when the expression of CRIg was induced postnatally. For this, we tracked the expression of CRIg in peritoneal large TRMs (F4/80<sup>hi</sup>) longitudinally in both NOD and B6 strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Clearly, there was a sharp increase of CRIg expression in macrophages around the time of weaning, a time-point when mice were exposed to environmental cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Laukens et al., 2016</xref>). The colonization of gut microbiota at early age, especially around the time of weaning is critical for the postnatal development of immune system.

We here define a new model of regulating T cell activities by tissue resident cells. In this model, TRMs sense environmental cues and express CRIg. Through the function of CRIg, tissue-specific autoimmunity is suppressed and immune tolerance is reinforced. Multiple mechanisms are involved in this model to promote immune tolerance. First, CRIg<sup>+</sup> TRMs form a barrier protecting pancreatic islets from succumbing to destructive insulitis. Second, CRIg preferentially suppresses effector T cell proliferation. Third, CRIg promotes the differentiation and stability of Treg cells.</p><p>CRIg<sup>+</sup> TRM mediated protection provides one explanation why not all islets are equally destructed during T1D development. In animal models and arguably in human patients of T1D, islet autoimmunity (insulitis) is universally present. However, not all insulitis proceeds to become diabetic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">André et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Poirot et al., 2004</xref>). Even in genetically identical monozygotic twins, the concordance of T1D incidence is only about 40–50%. It is still elusive what determines the risk of one individual to become diabetic. Moreover, not all islets are equally destroyed and there exist intact islets even in longstanding diabetic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bluestone et al., 2010</xref>). It is unclear why some islets are free from immune infiltration while the others are not. CRIg<sup>+</sup> TRMs specifically localize in the capsular area of an islet. The dearth of CRIg expression in these TRMs is correlated with the aggressiveness of insulitis in each individual islet. In line with this, insulitis is markedly exacerbated in NOD mice with CRIg-null mutation.</p><p>Several aspects of T cell activities can be modulated by CRIg. For each of them, our data also provide critical mechanistic insights. First, CRIg suppresses T cell proliferation by attenuating the activation of multiple TCR signaling cascades, including the most proximal signaling complex, the ERK-MAPK pathway and the AKT-MTOR pathway. The preferential suppression of effector T cells by CRIg is likely due to a higher level of the expression of a putative CRIg receptor in effector T cells than that in Treg cells. Our binding assays suggest that the receptor for CRIg is only transiently induced during early activation phase in T cells. Using competition assays, we have excluded a number of known coinhibitory molecules of immunoglobulin family as a potential receptor for CRIg. Other approaches including biochemical assays and protein interaction arrays will be employed to identify the receptor for CRIg. Second, reminiscent of the role of PD-L1 (refs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Francisco et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2008</xref>]), CRIg can also promote TGF-β induced Treg differentiation. CRIg does not directly enhance TGF-β signaling, instead, it robustly suppresses AKT signaling under iTreg induction condition, thus potentiating the differentiation of iTreg cells. Beyond promoting iTreg differentiation, another key finding is that CRIg increases the stability of Treg cells. This Treg-stabilizing effect of CRIg is not attributed to epigenetic modification of <italic>Foxp3</italic> promoter, instead, CRIg makes Treg cells more sensitive to IL-2 by increasing the expression of IL-2Rβ and the phosphorylation of STAT5. Moreover, our data suggest that Treg cells do not need continuous cell-cell contact with CRIg<sup>+</sup> TRMs to maintain Foxp3 expression.</p><p>Adoptive transfer of Treg cells is a promising strategy to induce immune tolerance in the treatment of human autoimmune diseases and organ transplantations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tang and Bluestone, 2013</xref>). However, variable stabilities of in vitro generated iTreg cells hinder this therapeutic option. We propose that CRIg may become a potential candidate to overcome the barrier of instability in Treg-based therapies. Correlated with the enhanced stability of CRIg iTreg cells, these cells are also more suppressive in a T cell proliferation assay.</p><p>CRIg has also been reported as a complement receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Helmy et al., 2006</xref>). However, our data reveal that the effects of CRIg in T cells can be exerted in a complement-independent manner. This suggests that complement components are not necessarily involved in CRIg-mediated suppression of effector T cells and differentiation of Treg cells.</p><p>CRIg emerges as a molecular link between environmental cues and adaptive immunity in controlling excessive tissue inflammation. The expression of CRIg in macrophages is dampened by inflammatory signals, such as lipopolysaccharide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vogt et al., 2006</xref>). Loss of abundancy of CRIg<sup>+</sup> macrophages is associated with exacerbated tissue inflammation in multiple autoimmune conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vogt et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fu et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, identifying what signals induce or suppress the expression of CRIg in TRMs is essential for better understanding how TRMs sense environmental signals and in turn orchestrate the activities of T cells. We find that CRIg expression in TRMs is induced postnatally and the abundance of CRIg<sup>+</sup> TRMs sharply increases around weaning, a time window allowing postnatal colonization of gut microbiota in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Laukens et al., 2016</xref>). The connection between gut microbiome and CRIg is evident from our studies showing that antibiotic treatment diminishes CRIg expression in TRMs at various locations, including colon, pancreas and peritoneal cavity. A recent study has demonstrated that antibiotic-mediated gut dysbiosis accelerated the development of T1D in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Livanos et al., 2016</xref>). The dampened expression of CRIg in pancreatic TRMs under dysbiotic conditions could be one plausible mechanism. Thus, environmental factors (most likely microbial signals and metabolites) instruct TRMs to express CRIg, which functions as an immune checkpoint molecule to regulate tissue T cell activities.</p><p>We found CRIg<sup>+</sup> cells in human pancreas, suggesting a potential role of CRIg in human T1D. CRIg<sup>+</sup> TRMs are also abundantly present in other gastrointestinal organs, including liver and intestines in both mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Helmy et al., 2006</xref>). It thus can be speculated that CRIg may also play a role in maintaining immunological homeostasis in these tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

After digestion, single cells were filtered by passing through a 70 um cell strainer and suspended in FACS staining buffer. Colon lamina propria (cLP) cells were prepared as previously described. Briefly, the intestine was cut longitudinally and sliced into 0.2–0.5 cm pieces, followed by incubating in 10 ml Ca2<sup>+</sup>/Mg2<sup>+</sup> free HBSS containing 10% FBS, 15 mM HEPES, and 5 mM EDTA at 37°C on a 200 rpm shaker for 20 min.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Yuan, et al. describes a role of the complement receptor of immunoglobulin family (CRIg), which is exclusively expressed by tissue macrophages, in the induction of peripheral Foxp3-expressing Treg cells. The authors demonstrated that CRIg directly acted on an unknown ligand/receptor of activated T cells, promoting and stabilizing the differentiation of Treg cells via regulating IL-2 signaling pathways. Micro-environmental cues in the gut, including microbiota and metabolites (retinoic acid), were shown to control the expression of CRIg on tissue macrophages, leading to the induction of Treg-mediated immunological tolerance.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It has been reported that CRIg plays a key role in tolerance induction. One major advance claimed by the paper is the promotion and stabilization of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> peripheral Tregs by CRIg. However, the authors mainly used a CRIg-Ig fusion protein in their experiments to induce Treg cells and tolerance, which may be artificial. They should purify CRIg<sup>+</sup> macrophages and coculture them with activated Th cells to test whether the macrophages with physiological levels of CRIg can specifically induce Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs.</p><p>2) It was shown that CRIg-Ig promoted iTreg differentiation in vitro, but the authors should address whether CRIg<sup>+</sup> macrophages could directly induce pTregs in in vivo settings. This will strengthen their claims. The frequency of Tregs in the pancreas was reduced in CRIg<sup>-/-</sup> NOD as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>. However, this experimental system does not exclude a possibility of indirect contribution of CRIg to the expansion of pTregs.</p><p>In addition, regarding <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, how did the authors investigate the percentages of CRIg<sup>+</sup> macrophages and each T cell population in pancreas? Additionally, the authors seemed to isolate cells from pancreatic islets selectively, but how did they do this? There seems to be no explanation for these procedures in the manuscript.</p><p>3) Relating to the above point, where do pancreatic CRIg<sup>+</sup> macrophages interact with activated Tconv cells and convert them into pTregs? Is there co-localization of CRIg<sup>+</sup> macrophages and converted Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs in the pancreas?</p><p>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, CRIg-Ig binding to activated Tconv is shown, but staining intensity is marginal and not convincing. More kinetics and control cells should be taken. In addition, expression levels of CRIg on thymic, peripheral, and in vitro induced Tregs need to be examined.</p><p>5) With CRIg<sup>-/-</sup> BL6 mice, are the findings in NOD mice also the case in BL6 mice? Since macrophages from various tissues express CRIg, the authors should examine whether CRIg<sup>-/-</sup> mice have reduced frequencies of Tregs in mucosal tissues such as the gut, peritoneum, skin, and lung, where CRIg<sup>+</sup> tissue macrophages are present.</p><p>6) The rationale for the CRIg/C3 blockade experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> supplements. is unclear. A combination of CRIg-Ig and anti-CRIg completely blocked the proliferation of T conv cells. Although the authors assume that anti-CRIg can block the binding of CRIg to C3 components, this unexplained strong effect of anti-CRIg on T cell suppression is a bit odd. Are active C3 components present in this culture medium? Why does anti-CRIg induce a sort of super agonistic effect of CRIg? On the other hand, this complete T cell proliferation arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) with CRIg and anti-CRIg contradicts with other results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) in which T cells robustly proliferate in the presence of CRIg and anti-CRIg.</p><p>7) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, the differentiation of pTregs from Tconv was impaired in the pancreas, but not in LNs of CRIg<sup>-/-</sup> NOD mice which had received adoptive transfer of BDC2.5 Tconv. This is a bit odd. It is unlikely that there is enough cellular niche to allow Tconv to get activated, expand, and differentiate into pTreg in T cell-sufficient NOD mice. They should show more detailed FACS profiles, for example, the proportion of Thy1.1 (transferred) vs Thy1.2 (resident) in Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs in the pancreas and LNs.</p><p>Also, CRIg-Ig treatment enhanced pTreg generation in pancreas but not in panLNs and ILNs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>. The authors should discuss the reason for this result.</p><p>8) Is the target molecule of CRIg on effector T cells and regulatory T cells same or different? The authors should discuss how CRIg exhibit opposite effects on the two different T cell populations.</p><p>9) It is hard to understand why the authors focused on environmental factors that modulate CRIg expression on TRMs in the tissues other than pancreas. Is there any relationship between CRIg levels in pancreatic TRMs and bacterial colonization or RA? How about the expression of CRIg in pancreatic TRMs after birth in wild-type and NOD mice? It is more valuable for this study to find the environmental cues that would regulate CRIg levels in pancreatic TRMs, if possible, especially during the development of type 1 diabetes.</p><p>10) Does CRIg bind to Treg and synergize with TGFb? Binding of CRIg to Tregs should be added (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> for activated T cells) along with key controls.</p><p>11) Treg stability depends on the methylation status of FoxP3 CNS2 region. The authors have shown that CRIg does not affect the methylation status of CNS2 site of Foxp3 yet FoxP3 expression in adoptively transferred iTregs generated with CRIg-Ig is remarkably stable. The inference from this observation is that Tregs do not need continuous cell:cell contact with CRIg-expressing macrophages to maintain FoxP3 expression and function. The authors should discuss this point.</p><p>12) The experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref> are interesting and compelling. However they do not connect well with the rest of the paper. These features should have been examined in pancreatic macrophages to make <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref> cohesive with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>-5.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29540.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It has been reported that CRIg plays a key role in tolerance induction.

We could isolate and transfer CRIg<sup>+</sup> macrophages into congenically disparate recipient mice. However, we do not think this assay could address whether these transferred CRIg<sup>+</sup> macrophages expand pTreg cells directly or by influencing other cells or pathways. Another caveat is that it is challenging to assess tissue engraftment of transferred macrophages, as these cells do not express CCR2 and other key chemokine receptors for tissue migration. We think that an in vitro coculture could define the direct effect of these TRMs in iTreg induction. We have performed this experiment, as it also answered the question raised in comment #1. We have included these data as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>.</p><p>We, however, propose that genetic ablation of CRIg would provide critical clues of the role of CRIg in affecting Treg (especially pTreg) abundancy, and our results supported this notion. To further strengthen this claim, we now have specifically analyzed the proportion of Helios<sup>-</sup> Tregs (largely pTregs) in various tissue sites (pancreas, colon and lung) of NOD/CRIg<sup>-/-</sup>and wildtype littermate controls. CRIg<sup>+</sup> macrophages are present in pancreas and colon, but not in the lung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Our data showed that Helios<sup>-</sup> pTregs in pancreas and colon, but not lung, were preferentially reduced in CRIg null mutant mice, correlated with the tissue-distribution profile of CRIg<sup>+</sup> macrophages. These data further supported the role of CRIg in affecting the abundancy of pTreg. We have now included these pTreg results between CRIg<sup>-/-</sup>and wildtype mice as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, and added the analyses of CRIg<sup>+</sup> cells in the lung in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, regarding <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, how did the authors investigate the percentages of CRIg<sup>+</sup>macrophages and each T cell population in pancreas? Additionally, the authors seemed to isolate cells from pancreatic islets selectively, but how did they do this? There seems to be no explanation for these procedures in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for any ambiguity in the descriptions.</p><p>For CRIg<sup>+</sup> macrophages, the numbers showed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> (right panel) were counted from immunostaining of pancreatic sections of 10-wks old NOD mice. We examined each individual islet under microscope and counted the total number of CRIg<sup>+</sup> TRMs per each islet. For this measurement, we did not isolate these cells from pancreatic islets. We have now updated the descriptions to improve the clarity in the Materials and methods, figure legends and text. We here wanted to explain a bit more about why we chose such a method. Because during the development of insulitis in both mice (e.g., NOD strain) and humans, not all islets are synchronously infiltrated (there are intact islets even in long-standing diabetic patients) (Bluestone, Herold and Eisenbarth, 2010), the reasons for this heterogeneous penetrance remain poorly understood. Due to the unique peri-islet distribution of CRIg<sup>+</sup> TRMs and the function of CRIg, our studies led to a model whereby CRIg<sup>+</sup> macrophages form a protective barrier for each individual islet. This provided a plausible explanation to the long-standing question of why some islets are infiltrated while others are not. The dearth of CRIg<sup>+</sup> TRMs at a barrier of the islet may exacerbate the infiltration.</p><p>For T cells, the “% Treg in CD4” in panel C was calculated by gating on Foxp3 fractions within CD4<sup>+</sup> populations. It also reflected the ratio between Treg and Foxp3<sup>-</sup> CD4 T cells. For the panel of “Ratio Treg/CD8”, it meant within the pancreas of each individual mouse (depicted by each dot), the number of Treg cells divided by the number of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Using this analysis, it clearly highlighted the loss of balance between Treg cells and other T cells that are largely pathogenic. We have now updated the descriptions in the Materials and methods, figure legends and text for clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Relating to the above point, where do pancreatic CRIg<sup>+</sup>macrophages interact with activated Tconv cells and convert them into pTregs? Is there co-localization of CRIg<sup>+</sup>macrophages and converted Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs in the pancreas?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for raising this question. We performed a co-staining of CRIg and CD4 of pancreatic frozen sections from a 10-wk old NOD mice (having ongoing insulitis) to reveal whether there was cell-cell contact between CRIg<sup>+</sup> TRMs and CD4 T cells. Indeed, we found cell aggregates containing both CRIg<sup>+</sup> TRMs and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, conforming the close interactions among them. We have now included the results as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>.</p><p>Again, these data supported our model whereby CRIg<sup>+</sup> macrophages form a protective barrier for each individual islet. Notably, while we were revising this manuscript, a paper published by Mohan et al. (Mohan JF, PNAS 2017. 114: E7776) suggested a similar role of peri-islet macrophages. We quote their statements here and note that one graph from their study depicts the localizations of macrophages and T cells in pancreas of NOD mice; “Suppressive roles of MFs have also been reported (Fu et al., 2012), which may be accounted for by their position as gate-keepers to islet entry in the initial phases, or by the capsule that MFs appear to form around the remaining β-cell mass in cases of established insulitis”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, CRIg-Ig binding to activated Tconv is shown, but staining intensity is marginal and not convincing. More kinetics and control cells should be taken. In addition, expression levels of CRIg on thymic, peripheral, and in vitro induced Tregs need to be examined.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now repeated multiple times the binding of CRIg to activated T cells at different time-points of T cell activation and different concentrations of CRIg-Ig. These new data confirmed our conclusion of that CRIg can bind to activated T cells. Consistent with the conclusion in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, it showed that the expression of putative CRIg receptors was higher at early stage of T cell activation (the binding intensities: 12h≅24h&gt;&gt;72h). We have now replaced the original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> with these new data.</p><p>We apologize for any confusion in describing the expression of CRIg. CRIg is not expressed in T cells of any subset, or location.

A combination of CRIg-Ig and anti-CRIg completely blocked the proliferation of T conv cells. Although the authors assume that anti-CRIg can block the binding of CRIg to C3 components, this unexplained strong effect of anti-CRIg on T cell suppression is a bit odd. Are active C3 components present in this culture medium? Why does anti-CRIg induce a sort of super agonistic effect of CRIg? On the other hand, this complete T cell proliferation arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) with CRIg and anti-CRIg contradicts with other results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) in which T cells robustly proliferate in the presence of CRIg and anti-CRIg.</p></disp-quote><p>Why CRIg-Ig/anti-CRIg complex exhibited an enhanced effect? Under in vitro settings, we propose that this is an effect of cross-linking. This notion was supported by several observations: soluble CRIg-Ig did not affect T cell proliferation; a plate-bound condition is needed for CRIg-Ig to exhibit a suppressive effect on T cells. Adding anti-CRIg mAb probably further affected the conformational change of CRIg to enhance its engagement with the putative CRIg receptor. To further evaluate the possible cross-linking effect, we have performed a new experiment by coating anti-CRIg (or isotype) mAb to culture plate and adding soluble CRIg-Ig to in vitro cultured CD4 Tconv cells. Again, soluble CRIg-Ig did not suppress T cells if the plate was coated with isotype control mAb. However, in the presence of plate-bound anti-CRIg mAb, soluble CRIg-Ig now can robustly suppress T cell proliferation, further supporting a notion of cross-linking. We have now included these data as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p>Under in vivo settings, we asked whether anti-CRIg/CRIg-Ig complex exhibited a longer serum half-life compared with CRIg-Ig alone. To test this, we treated mice with one dose of CRIg-Ig, or equal amount of CRIg-Ig plus anti-CRIg Ab. The mice were sequentially bled 1, 3, and 7d after injections, and serum concentrations of CRIg were measured by ELISA using Abs of different isotypes and recognizing different epitopes. Clearly, it showed that the inclusion of anti-CRIg maintained higher serum concentrations of CRIg. We have now included these data as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p>Regarding complements in the culture medium. We used heat-inactivated serum for all cell cultures. However, it may still contain complement components, likely from bovine serum (we could not find an ELISA kit to specifically detect bovine complements). Therefore, we chose to use serum-free medium to repeat T cell proliferation and iTreg induction experiments with or without CRIg. However, deprivation of serum for longer than 24 hrs severely affected the viability of cultured T cells, making it difficult to assess the effect of CRIg. We then alternatively conducted a short-term assay in serum-free medium. Since we have demonstrated that CRIg attenuated TCR activation signaling cascades by measuring the phosphorylation of ZAP70, Erk1/2, AKT and S6. Therefore, using the same approach, except using serum-free culture medium. Indeed, CRIg-Ig could attenuate TCR activation without complements.

This is a bit odd. It is unlikely that there is enough cellular niche to allow Tconv to get activated, expand, and differentiate into pTreg in T cell-sufficient NOD mice. They should show more detailed FACS profiles, for example, the proportion of Thy1.1 (transferred) vs Thy1.2 (resident) in Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs in the pancreas and LNs.</p><p>Also, CRIg-Ig treatment enhanced pTreg generation in pancreas but not in panLNs and ILNs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>.

We used activated TCR monoclonal BDC2.5 T cells that were highly diabetogenic and had the advantages for competition with polyclonal endogenous T cells. We have now added FACS data to show the engraftments of transferred Thy1.1<sup>+</sup> T cells and the fractions of them becoming GFP(Foxp3)<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Because the key point here was how much transferred Tconv cells were converted into Treg cells in the presence or absence of CRIg-Ig, we only analyzed transferred cells, not endogenous Treg cells.</p><p>Re “Why CRIg-Ig treatment enhanced pTreg generation in pancreas but not in panLNs and ILNs?”This is mainly due to that pTreg cells are primarily differentiated at tissue sites. Mice deficient for Foxp3 conserved noncoding sequence 1 (CNS1) have normal numbers of tTregs but have severe deficit of pTregs (Zheng et al., 2010). The defects are most striking at mucosal surfaces, which are the primary sites for pTreg generation. We have strengthened this statement in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Is the target molecule of CRIg on effector T cells and regulatory T cells same or different? The authors should discuss how CRIg exhibit opposite effects on the two different T cell populations.</p></disp-quote><p>Without knowing the cognate receptor for CRIg in Tconv or Treg cells, we here provide our postulations based on the data from the binding and functional assays. First, CRIg exhibits a coinhibitory effect on T cells. For this function, I don’t think it is opposite between Tconv and Treg cells. CRIg can bind to both Tconv and Treg cells. However, the binding intensity was substantially higher in Tconv than that in Treg cells, suggesting that the putative receptor that mediates coinhibitory effect is more abundantly expressed in activated Tconv than that in Treg cells. Consistent with this, we found that under the same experimental settings CRIg more potently suppressed Tconv than Treg cells (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>).</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29540.026</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-29540-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><p>Regarding the effect of CRIg in promoting Treg generation. Our data supported that the putative receptor mediating T cell suppression is not necessarily needed for Treg differentiation by CRIg. This is because that CRIg-Ig would not suppress T cells at the late stage of T cell in vitro activation and proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), which is very likely due to the transient expression of the receptor for CRIg in T cells. However, we did a new experiment and found that CRIg can still promote the conversion of these T cells at their late stage of in vitro activation/proliferation into Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells in the presence of TGF-β. This suggested that another mechanism is involved in Treg induction. We have now included these data and also revised the discussions accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) It is hard to understand why the authors focused on environmental factors that modulate CRIg expression on TRMs in the tissues other than pancreas. Is there any relationship between CRIg levels in pancreatic TRMs and bacterial colonization or RA? How about the expression of CRIg in pancreatic TRMs after birth in wild-type and NOD mice? It is more valuable for this study to find the environmental cues that would regulate CRIg levels in pancreatic TRMs, if possible, especially during the development of type 1 diabetes.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these comments. Related to comment #12 below, we have now performed new experiments to dissect the connections between environmental factors (gut microbiota and RA) and CRIg<sup>+</sup> TRMs in the pancreas especially during the development of T1D, as the reviewer pointed out. We have included the new data as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>. Interestingly, while antibiotic treatment diminished pancreatic CRIg<sup>+</sup> TRMs, blocking RA signaling in vivofailed to do so, suggesting different regulations were utilized at different tissues to maintain CRIg expression in TRMs. A recently study demonstrated that antibiotic-mediated gut microbiome perturbation accelerates development of type 1 diabetes in mice (Livanos et al., 2016). The dampened expression of CRIg in pancreatic TRMs could be one possible mechanism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Does CRIg bind to Treg and synergize with TGFb? Binding of CRIg to Tregs should be added (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> for activated T cells) along with key controls.</p></disp-quote><p>The promoting effect of CRIg-Ig in iTreg differentiation could be directly through enhancing TGF-β signaling or potentiating other signaling in iTregs independent of TGF- b. We have now conducted the phosphorylation assays of Smad2/3 in iTreg condition in the presence or absence of CRIg-Ig and found that CRIg-Ig did not further enhance TGF- b induced Smad2/3 phosphorylation. We have previously found that CRIg-Ig suppress the activities of AKT and S6 in T cells under iTreg condition. Therefore, CRIg-Ig does not directly affect TGF-b signaling, instead, potentiates other pathways that facilitate iTreg differentiation. We have now added the Smad2/3 phosphorylation results as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>We have now demonstrated that CRIg can bind to activated Treg cells, but to a much lower level compared to that in Tconv cells.

The authors have shown that CRIg does not affect the methylation status of CNS2 site of Foxp3 yet FoxP3 expression in adoptively transferred iTregs generated with CRIg-Ig is remarkably stable. The inference from this observation is that Tregs do not need continuous cell:cell contact with CRIg-expressing macrophages to maintain FoxP3 expression and function. The authors should discuss this point.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. Our data supported this inference.
