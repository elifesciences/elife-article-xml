according to our ends. To explain this proclivity, scientists have calibrated their lens to either low-level skills such as motor cognition or high-level skills such as language or social cognition. Yet, little has been said about the intermediate-level cognitive processes that are directly involved in mastering this materiality, that is, technical cognition. We aim to focus on this intermediate level for providing new insights into the neurocognitive bases of human materiality. Here, we show that a technical-reasoning process might be specifically at work in physical problem-solving situations. We found via two distinct neuroimaging studies that the area PF (parietal F) within the left parietal lobe is central for this reasoning process in both tool-use and non-tool-use physical problem-solving and can work along with social-cognitive skills to resolve day-to-day interactions that combine social and physical constraints. Our results demonstrate the existence of a specific cognitive module in the human brain dedicated to materiality, which might be the supporting pillar allowing the accumulation of technical knowledge over generations. Intensifying research on technical cognition could nurture a comprehensive framework that has been missing in fields interested in how early and modern humans have been interacting with the physical world through technology, and how this interaction has shaped our history and culture.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>physical understanding</kwd><kwd>technical reasoning</kwd><kwd>theory of mind</kwd><kwd>tool use</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-21-CE28-0023-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Osiurak</surname><given-names>François</given-names></name><name><surname>Rossetti</surname><given-names>Yves</given-names></name><name><surname>Lesourd</surname><given-names>Mathieu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010115</institution-id><institution>Région Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NUMERICOG-2017-900-EA 3082 EMC-R-2075</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Osiurak</surname><given-names>François</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Understanding and reasoning about the physical world rely on a specific brain network, in which the area PF of the left inferior parietal lobe plays a central role.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Modern societies heavily rely on and even depend upon technology. From the first lithic industries to the most modern and complex ones, technologies enable us to fulfil elementary needs such as feeding or building shelters, and even more sophisticated ones such as communicating, conquering space, or playing music. Human technology is ubiquitous and this omnipresence reflects how we, as a species, are remarkably skilled at shaping the physical world according to our needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boyd et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lombard, 2016</xref>). A paradox though remains in modern science. Even if this special skill has allowed our prolific expansion, only a little attention has been paid to the cognition needed to practically develop the technology required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Whiten, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wynn et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wynn and Coolidge, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Whiten, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">van Elk, 2021</xref>). We do make and use advanced technologies, and we also transmit them to the next generations, but the full understanding of the neurocognitive processes implied is still in its infancy.</p><p>Most of this understanding has long come from clinical neuropsychology, through the observation of apraxic patients in whom damage to the left inferior part of the parietal lobe leads to tool-use disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">De Renzi and Lucchelli, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goldenberg and Hagmann, 1998</xref>). These disorders have been initially interpreted as reflecting impaired sensorimotor programs dictating the prototypical manipulation of common tools (e.g., a hammer) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van Elk et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heilman et al., 1982</xref>). This manipulation-based approach has provided interesting insights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kleineberg et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Weiss et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kroliczak et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Michalowski et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wheaton et al., 2009</xref>) and even elegant attempts to explain how these sensorimotor programs could support the use of both unfamiliar and novel tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buchmann and Randerath, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mizelle and Wheaton, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stoll et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Seidel et al., 2023</xref>), but remains silent on the more general cognitive mechanisms behind human technology that include the use of common and unfamiliar or novel tools but must also encompass tool making, construction behaviour, technical innovations, and transmission of technical content.</p><p>This silence has been initially broken by a series of studies initiated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goldenberg and Hagmann, 1998</xref>, which has documented a behavioural link in left brain-damaged patients between common tool use and the ability to solve mechanical problems by using and even sometimes making novel tools (e.g., extracting a target out from a box by bending a wire to create a hook) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goldenberg and Hagmann, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heilman et al., 1997</xref>). Brain-lesion studies have revealed that this behavioural link has a neural reality because both common and novel tool uses are impaired after damage to the left inferior parietal lobe and particularly the area PF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goldenberg and Spatt, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Martin et al., 2016</xref>). As (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goldenberg and Spatt, 2009</xref>) claimed, ‘[t]hese results support the conclusions that the parietal lobe contribution to tool use concerns general principles of tool use rather than knowledge of the prototypical use of common tools and objects, and the comprehension of mechanical interactions of the tool with other tools, recipients or materials rather than the selection of grip formation and manual movements’ (p. 1653). Neuroimaging studies have thereafter extended <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goldenberg and Spatt, 2009</xref> conclusion to situations other than tool use strictly speaking. For instance, evidence has indicated the preferential activation of the left area PF when people observe others use tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Reynaud et al., 2019</xref>) as well as when people view physical events, whether they are instructed or not to reason about them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fischer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pramod et al., 2022</xref>). Also, the cortical thickness of the left area PF was found to predict the performance on psychotechnical tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Federico et al., 2022</xref>) (e.g., water-pouring problems). It is noteworthy that these studies have also reported the involvement of other areas, such as the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) or the lateral occipitotemporal cortex (LOTC).</p><p>These findings have fuelled the development of the technical-reasoning hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Osiurak and Reynaud, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Osiurak et al., 2023</xref>), which offers a larger account of the neurocognitive processes at work for understanding and shaping our physical world and for successfully passing technologies to the next generations in a cumulative manner, forming what has been dubbed the cumulative technological culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boyd et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tomasello et al., 1993</xref>). Technical reasoning refers to the ability of reasoning about the physical properties of objects and is nurtured by implicit mechanical knowledge acquired through interactions with objects. It is both causal (i.e., prediction of future events) and analogical (i.e., transfer from one situation to another). To solve a physical problem, an agent can use prior knowledge about mechanical properties and physical laws that apply to the physical world, such as gravity and leverage. Then, this knowledge is combined with the constraints of the current situation, which include the available data, and any objects required to achieve the desired goal. The outcome of the technical-reasoning process is a simulation of the mechanical action to be performed, which then constrains, if the individual intends to act, their bodily actions through a kind of mechanical-to-motor action cascade, which will ultimately feedback onto the central representations of our body, space, and objects. As mentioned above, the left area PF occupies a central place in the technical-reasoning network, along with additional brain areas such as the left IFG and LOTC.</p><p>Here, we focus on two key aspects of the technical-reasoning hypothesis that remain to be addressed: generalizability and specificity. If technical reasoning is a specific form of reasoning oriented towards the physical world, then it should be implicated in <italic>all</italic> (the generalizability question) <italic>and only</italic> (the specificity question) the situations in which we need to think about the physical properties of our world. To tackle these two questions, we designed two fMRI experiments that included four different tasks (Experiment 1: Mechanical problem-solving task; <italic>n</italic> = 34; Experiment 2: Psychotechnical task, fluid-cognition task, and mentalizing task; <italic>n</italic> = 35; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), detailed in the following lines.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental tasks.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In the mechanical problem-solving task (Experiment 1), participants had to figure out for 4 s how to move a red cube trapped in a 3D glass box from its original location to a new target location. Then, two tools were presented for 3 s, and they had to decide which was the correct one to solve the mechanical problem. Before the scanning session, the participants were informed that five distinct tools could be used to solve the mechanical problems.

Then the bottom part was presented for 4 additional seconds, with the top part remaining on display. The participants had to choose the cartoon with the probable ending to the story depicted in the three first drawings. In the PHYS-Only condition, the selection only needed to understand the physical context. In the INT + PHYS condition, the selection needed to understand both the physical context and the social context. Illustrations in (<bold>D</bold>) reproduced with permission from Birgit Völlm.

As suggested above, neuropsychological studies have supported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goldenberg and Spatt, 2009</xref> conclusion about the contribution of the inferior parietal lobe to general principles of tool use, but no neuroimaging study has confirmed this conclusion so far. For this, we designed a first experiment allowing the observation of the cerebral activities related to physical problem-solving implying tool use. Participants were presented with mechanical problems, consisting in figuring out how to move, with the help of a novel tool, a small red cubic element trapped in a 3D glass box projected on a screen from its original location into a new target location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This task allowed us to test the involvement of the technical-reasoning network – and particularly of the left area PF – in novel tool use. Nonetheless, the generalizability of technical reasoning implies that its network is recruited beyond tool use and serves as a basis for the physical understanding of the world surrounding us. We tested this assumption by studying the neural correlates tied to the understanding of physical principles, disembodied from any tool-use situation. In a second neuroimaging experiment, participants performed a psychotechnical task in which they had to solve non-tool-use physical problems, such as water-pouring problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hegarty, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We predicted that the technical-reasoning network and particularly the left area PF should be recruited to perform this psychotechnical task. In addition, as technical reasoning is supposedly a central component of the mechanical problem-solving task and the psychotechnical task, and the INT + PHYS and PHYS-Only conditions of the mentalizing task, which will be described below, we hypothesized that the technical-reasoning network should be commonly activated across these tasks and should be found in a conjunction analysis of the four experimental conditions.</p><p>The second question concerns the specificity of the technical-reasoning network. As technical reasoning is an implicit and causal form of reasoning, it may be easily conflated with other forms of implicit/non-verbal and/or causal reasoning, such as fluid reasoning or mentalizing. Thus, in the second experiment, we tested its specificity by asking participants to perform fluid-reasoning and mentalizing tasks. Fluid reasoning, hereafter called fluid cognition, refers to temporarily maintaining information to produce adapted responses to solve novel problems or plan and execute directed behaviour based on inductive and deductive relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blair, 2006</xref>). Although fluid cognition is a non-verbal form of reasoning, it does not necessitate knowledge of the physical world, its constraints and the mechanical laws governing it. The distinction between technical reasoning and fluid cognition has already been supported by behavioural evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Oliveira et al., 2019</xref>) as well as by neuroimaging studies that have shown the recruitment of the prefrontal cortex in fluid cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hobeika et al., 2016</xref>), with brain regions that are not commonly reported in the context of tool use or physical understanding (e.g., dorsal prefrontal cortex and medial superior frontal gyrus). The participants in the second experiment had to complete a fluid-cognition task, which was an adaptation of the Raven’s Progressive Matrices test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This test has been widely used to predict performance on a wide range of logical reasoning tasks and has been found to predict the general factor of intelligence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gray and Thompson, 2004</xref>). We hypothesized the recruitment of the fluid-cognition network, particularly the prefrontal cortex, in the fluid-cognition task, which should diverge from the network involved in the psychotechnical task. Mentalizing refers to detecting and attributing mental states to others or oneself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gallagher and Frith, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Van Overwalle and Baetens, 2009</xref>). It is a form of causal reasoning, given that it can be used to infer how hidden mental states can cause some specific behaviours. Depending on the situation, this ability requires the collaboration of several cognitive mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gallagher and Frith, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Van Overwalle and Baetens, 2009</xref>), such as perspective taking (medial prefrontal cortex), the understanding of communicative gestures (temporoparietal junction including the angular gyrus) or knowledge about the person (temporal pole). Frequently, this can also require the indirect involvement of technical reasoning to apprehend the physical dimension of the situation (e.g., it is raining, and two umbrellas can provide shelter from the rain), which can be crucial for inferring mental states (e.g., Alex uses one umbrella but does not give the other to Mary). For the mentalizing task, the participants were shown a comic strip conveying a short story and had to select between two additional cartoons the appropriate ending to that story (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brunet et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Völlm et al., 2006</xref>). There were two experimental conditions in this task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>): Reasoning only on the physical dimension of the event (PHYS-Only condition) and inferring an intention combined with reasoning on the physical dimension of the event (INT + PHYS condition). We predicted that the technical-reasoning network should be recruited in both conditions but the mentalizing network would be only involved in the INT + PHYS condition, allowing us to distinguish the cognitive processes implicated in the causal understanding of physical events versus events implying inferring an intention.</p><p>To sum up, the contribution that this study aims to make is to test the idea that technical reasoning might be implicated in the situations in which we need to think about the physical properties of our world. In line with previous work, we predicted that this specific form of technical cognition engages a network of brain areas, among which the area PF within the left supramarginal gyrus plays a central role.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Behavioural results</title><p>All the behavioural results are given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, the whole-brain analyses revealed that the mechanical problem-solving task engaged an almost all-left network of areas, comprising the left supramarginal gyrus within the inferior parietal lobe (including the area PF), the left IFG (opercular and triangular parts), and the left superior parietal cortex and dorsal premotor cortex. The psychotechnical task of Experiment 2 generated a more bilateral network, with greater activation in both supramarginal gyri (including the left area PF but not the right area PF), the opercular part of both IFG, both LOTC, and both superior parietal and dorsal premotor cortices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Taken together, these results validate our prediction in indicating the involvement of the left area PF, which is central to the technical-reasoning network. This confirms that the technical-reasoning network depends upon the recruitment of the left area PF, even if additional cognitive processes involving other peripheral brain areas can be engaged depending on the task.

Before their extensive subsequent presentation, we will focus here on the results from these conditions allowing us to test our generalizability hypothesis. The whole-brain analyses indicated preferential activation in the left supramarginal gyrus (including the left area PF) in both conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D, E</xref>). Finally, the conjunction analysis of the four experimental conditions (the mechanical problem-solving task, the psychotechnical task, and the PHYS-Only and INT + PHYS conditions of the mentalizing task) led to the only activation in the left supramarginal gyrus (including the left area PF; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). These findings confirmed that the left area PF, central to the technical-reasoning network, is recruited in any situation requiring physical understanding.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2-2"><title>Specificity of the technical-reasoning network</title><p>Even if technical reasoning is a non-verbal and causal form of reasoning, it must not be conflated with other non-verbal and/or causal forms of reasoning, such as fluid cognition and mentalizing. Therefore, we predicted that distinct cerebral networks are recruited for technical reasoning, fluid cognition, and mentalizing. The whole-brain results for the fluid-cognition task of Experiment 2 confirmed our prediction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We found activation of both dorsal prefrontal cortices and medial superior frontal cortices, which are characteristic to fluid cognition but not to technical reasoning. Additional activation was reported in both LOTC, insulae, superior parietal cortices, and dorsal premotor cortices. No activation of the inferior parietal lobes was found. Concerning the mentalizing task of Experiment 2, the PHYS-Only condition revealed a bilateral network of areas, comprising both supramarginal gyri (including the right area PF and the left area PF as described above) and LOTC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The INT + PHYS condition highlighted a bilateral network of areas comprising the left supramarginal gyrus (including the left area PF as described above), both LOTC, the right IFG (opercular and triangular parts), both temporoparietal junctions (including the angular gyri) and the right temporal pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Importantly, the contrast of the INT + PHYS condition to the PHYS-Only condition revealed a network of bilateral areas that characterize the mentalizing network, namely both temporoparietal junctions (including both angular gyri), both medial prefrontal cortices, and the right temporal pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). No activation of brain areas of the technical-reasoning network survived this contrast.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Region of interest results</title><p>We conducted additional analyses to test the robustness of our findings. One of our results was that we did not report any specific activation of the left area PF in the fluid-cognition task contrary to the mechanical problem-solving task, the psychotechnical task, and the PHYS-Only and INT + PHYS conditions of the mentalizing task. However, this negative result needed exploration at the region of interest (ROI) level. Therefore, we created a spherical ROI of the left area PF with a 5-mm radius in the MNI standard space (–59; –31; 40). This ROI was literature-defined to ensure the independence of its selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reynaud et al., 2016</xref>). ROI results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. The analyses confirmed the results obtained with the whole-brain analyses by indicating a greater activation of the left area PF in the mechanical problem-solving task, the psychotechnical task, and the PHYS-Only and INT + PHYS conditions of the mentalizing task (all p &lt; 0.001), but not in the fluid-cognition task (p = 0.35). As mentioned above, the experimental conditions of all the tasks were more difficult than their control conditions. As a result, the specific activation of the left area PF documented above could simply reflect that this area responds to a greater extent in a harder condition relative to an easy condition of a task. This interpretation is nevertheless ruled out by the results obtained with the fluid-cognition task. We did not report a specific activation of the left area PF in this task while its experimental condition was more difficult than its control condition. To test more directly this effect of difficulty, we conducted new ROI analyses by removing all the participants who performed at or below 50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). These new analyses replicated the initial analyses by showing a greater activation of the left area PF in the mechanical problem-solving task, the psychotechnical task, and the PHYS-Only and INT + PHYS conditions of the mentalizing task (all p &lt; 0.001), but not in the fluid-cognition task (p = 0.48).

The first was that the tasks could recruit the same regions for different cognition functions (same-region-but-different-function interpretation). The second was that the activated regions of the different tasks could be adjacent but did not overlap at finer resolutions (adjacency interpretation). We tested the same-region-but-different-function interpretation by conducting additional ROI analyses, which consisted of correlating the specific activation of the left area PF (i.e., difference in terms of mean Blood-Oxygen Level Dependent [BOLD] parameter estimates between the experimental condition minus the control condition) in the psychotechnical task, the fluid-cognition task, and the PHYS-Only and INT + PHYS conditions of the mentalizing task. This analysis did not include the mechanical problem-solving task because the sample of participants was not the same for this task. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, we found significant correlations between all the tasks that were hypothesized as recruiting technical reasoning, that is, the psychotechnical task and the PHYS-Only and INT + PHYS conditions of the mentalizing task (all p &lt; 0.05). By contrast, no significant correlation was obtained between these three tasks and the fluid-cognition task (all p &gt; 0.15). This finding invalidates the same-region-but-different-function interpretation by revealing a coherent pattern in the activation of the left area PF in situations in which participants were supposed to reason technically. We examined the adjacency interpretation by analysing the specific locations of individual peak activations within a 12-mm radius sphere centred on the left area PF ROI coordinates (–59; –31; 40) for each task and each subject. Results are reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. As can be seen, the peaks of the fluid-cognition task were located more anteriorly, in the left area PFt (Parietal Ft) and the postcentral cortex, compared to the peaks of the other four tasks, which were more posterior, in the left area PF. Statistical analyses based on the <italic>y</italic> coordinates of the individual activation peaks confirmed this description (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Indeed, the <italic>y</italic> coordinates of the peaks of the mechanical problem-solving task, the psychotechnical task and the PHYS-Only and INT + PHYS conditions of the mentalizing task were posterior to the <italic>y</italic> coordinates of the peaks of the fluid-cognition task (all p &lt; 0.05), whereas no significant differences were reported between the four tasks (all p &gt; 0.05).

Capitalizing on early Goldenberg’s intuitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goldenberg and Hagmann, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goldenberg and Spatt, 2009</xref>), the technical-reasoning hypothesis assumes that this idiosyncratic technological trajectory reflects a specific form of technical cognition that involves a cerebral network in which the left area PF of the inferior parietal lobe is central (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Osiurak and Reynaud, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Osiurak et al., 2023</xref>). However, two characteristics of this reasoning remained to be tested, that is, its generalizable but specific nature. Here, we report two neuroimaging studies that confirmed these two characteristics. In the following lines, we discuss in turn the key findings of the present experiments, by stressing how they allow us to pave the way for future research on technical cognition.</p><p>The first key finding is that the left area PF, central to the technical-reasoning network, is systematically recruited in any situations involving physical events, confirming the generalizable dimension of technical reasoning. Neuropsychological evidence has indicated that damage to the left area PF impairs both common and novel tool use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goldenberg and Spatt, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Martin et al., 2016</xref>). Previous neuroimaging studies have also revealed that this brain area is specifically activated when (1) people focus on the mechanical actions between a tool and an object (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reynaud et al., 2016</xref>), (2) watch another individual use tools with objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Reynaud et al., 2019</xref>), (3) reason about physical events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fischer et al., 2016</xref>), or (4) look at physical events without being explicitly instructed to reason about them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pramod et al., 2022</xref>). The present study corroborates these results in showing that this brain area is also preferentially recruited when people use novel tools to solve physical problems, or reason about physical events. More importantly, the conjunction analysis that included the mechanical problem-solving task, the psychotechnical task, and the PHYS-Only and INT + PHYS conditions of the mentalizing task confirmed this finding. Taken together, these findings suggest that the technical-reasoning network ‘<italic>can provide the foundations for future research on this quintessentially human trait: Using, making, and reasoning about tools and more generally shaping the physical world to our ends</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2020</xref>; p. 29309).</p><p>It should be clear here that we do not advocate the localizationist position simply stating that activation in the left area PF is the necessary and sufficient condition for technical reasoning. We rather defend the view according to which it requires a network of interacting brain areas, one of them – and of major importance – being the left area PF. This allows the engagement of different configurations of cerebral areas in different technical-reasoning tasks, but with a central process acting as a stable component: The left area PF. Thus, when people intend to use physical tools, it can work in concert with brain regions specific to object manipulation and motor control, thereby forming another network, the tool-use network. It can also interact with brain regions specific to intentional gestures to form a ‘social-learning’ network that allows people to enhance their understanding about the physical aspects of a technical task (e.g., the making of a tool) through communicative gestures such as pointing gestures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bluet et al., 2025</xref>). The major challenge for future research is to specify the nature of the cognitive process supported by the left area PF and that might be involved in the broad understanding of the physical world. One possibility is that the left area PF might be a hub as is the temporal pole for semantic cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ralph et al., 2017</xref>). Another is derived from the technical-reasoning hypothesis, which was initially developed from the observation of patients with tool-use disorders, who met difficulties in selecting and even making appropriate tools to solve mechanical problems. Although a link between problem-solving and reasoning can be drawn, it remains that associative learning is a viable candidate to explain how people solve mechanical problems or even more generally make predictions about physical events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Heyes, 2023</xref>). Finally, others have suggested the notion of an ‘intuitive’ physics engine, a kind of simulator able to perform physical inference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Battaglia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yildirim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schwettmann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fischer and Mahon, 2021</xref>). Future research is needed to explore these alternative interpretations and potentially reconcile some of them, which is the essential step for the development of a field dedicated to the study of technical cognition.</p><p>The second key finding is that the technical-reasoning network is not recruited in other non-verbal and/or causal reasoning forms, confirming that it is a specific form of reasoning oriented towards the physical world. Indeed, no activation of the left area PF was found for the fluid-cognition task, differentiating the logical-reasoning process engaged for solving this task from technical reasoning. This is in line with previous results dissociating technical reasoning from fluid cognition based on behavioural experiments. For instance, in a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Oliveira et al., 2019</xref>), the technical-reasoning skills and fluid-cognition skills of 245 participants were assessed with tasks close to those employed here for assessing these two forms of reasoning. A factor analysis with varimax rotation was conducted and corroborated the orthogonality of technical-reasoning and fluid-cognition tasks. At the cerebral level, previous studies have indicated the key role of the prefrontal cortex in fluid cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hobeika et al., 2016</xref>), which is also found in the present results. However, we did not report any engagement of the technical-reasoning network in the fluid-cognition task, confirming that technical reasoning is a non-verbal form of reasoning specific to the physical domain that must be distinguished from fluid cognition. The results of the mentalizing task are also informative in this respect. In the INT + PHYS condition of this task, the attribution of the characters’ intentions was accompanied by the mandatory understanding of the physical event associated. On the contrary, the PHYS-Only condition only implied reasoning about the physical actions performed by the characters of the cartoon. Our results confirmed this ‘hierarchy’ of processes. The left area PF was found for the two conditions as stated previously, but the INT +PHYS condition engaged an additional network of areas previously associated with mentalizing skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gallagher and Frith, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Molenberghs et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schurz et al., 2021</xref>): The bilateral temporoparietal junctions, the bilateral medial prefrontal cortex, and the right temporal pole. In broad terms, the results of the mentalizing task indicate that causal reasoning has distinct forms and that it recruits distinct networks of the human brain (Social domain: Mentalizing; Physical domain: Technical reasoning), which can nevertheless interact together to solve day-to-day problems in which several domains are involved, such as in the INT + PHYS condition of the mentalizing task.</p><p>The third key finding is that the technical-reasoning network involves brain areas whose recruitment varies according to the task. Understanding the role played by these additional brain areas is crucial not only to describe the flexibility of the technical-reasoning network but also to continue to clarify (by exclusion) the role of the left area PF. The first additional area to consider is the left IFG, particularly its opercular part. This area has been repeatedly found in previous research on technical reasoning. We reported activation of left IFG in the mechanical problem-solving task (–50; 7; 20) and the psychotechnical task (–50; 7; 27). Even if the left IFG activation did not survive corrections in the conjunction analysis, it must be noted that a cluster of a small size (<italic>k</italic> = 68) was located around the peak at (–48; 9; 19). These peaks were situated in the close vicinity of the ones reported in two meta-analyses related to tool-use understanding (–49; 8; 31) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reynaud et al., 2016</xref>) and tool-use observation (–51; 5; 33) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Reynaud et al., 2019</xref>). The functional role of the left IFG in the context of tool use has been previously discussed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Reynaud et al., 2019</xref>) and a plausible hypothesis is that the left IFG integrates the multiple constraints posed by the physical situation to set the ground for a correct reasoning process, such as it could be involved in syntactic language processing (for a somewhat similar view, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buxbaum and Randerath, 2018</xref>). It has already been shown that language and tool use share syntactic processes in the basal ganglia of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Thibault et al., 2021</xref>). This hypothesis of IFG as a ‘constraint combiner’ for language and tool use is currently under investigation in our group and needs solid experimental proof.</p><p>Another additional area that has been found in three experimental conditions (psychotechnical task, and the PHYS-Only and INT + PHYS conditions of the mentalizing task) was the LOTC. These specific activations could be related to familiarity with the tools or objects shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vingerhoets, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lesourd et al., 2021</xref>). Indeed, we did not find the activation of this brain area in the mechanical problem-solving task, which focused on unfamiliar tool-use situations. The three others experimental conditions included common tools such as hammers or screwdrivers for the psychotechnical task, and common objects used as tools for the mentalizing tasks (e.g., stick, rope, and chair). Thus, the activation of the LOTC might reflect the involvement of semantic processes whose involvement would remain to understand.</p><p>Finally, activation was also found in the right area PF for the PHYS-Only condition of the mentalizing task. A recent morphometry study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Federico et al., 2022</xref>) showed that the cortical thickness of the left area PF predicts technical-reasoning and visuospatial performance, whereas the right area PF only predicts visuospatial performance, confirming the distinction between these two abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mitko and Fischer, 2020</xref>). These findings suggest that the right area PF is recruited along with the left area PF when the task makes high demands on both technical and visuospatial dimensions, as in the PHYS-Only condition of the mentalizing task. This interpretation, although viable, remains unlikely given that there is no reason to consider that this condition makes heavier demands on both technical and visuospatial dimensions than the mechanical problem-solving task or the psychotechnical task. In broad terms, the role played by the right area PF in the technical-reasoning network remains an open issue.</p><p>Before concluding, we would like to point out two potential limitations of the present study. The first limitation concerns the fact that the literature has documented the recruitment of the left area PF in many neuroimaging experiments in which there was no need to reason about physical events (e.g., language tasks). This can be easily illustrated by entering the left area PF coordinates in the Neurosynth database. This finding could be enough to refute the idea that this brain area is specific to technical reasoning. Although this limitation deserves to be recognized, it is also true for many other findings. For instance, sensory or motor brain regions such as the precentral or the postcentral cortex have been found activated in many non-motor tasks, the visual word form area in non-language tasks, or the Heschl’s gyrus in non-musical tasks. This remains a major challenge for scientists, the question being how to solve these inconsistencies that can result from statistical errors or stress that considerable effort is needed to understand the very functional nature of these brain areas. Thus, understanding that the left area PF is central to physical understanding can be viewed as a first essential step before discovering its fundamental function, as suggested by the functional polyhedral approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Genon et al., 2018</xref>). The second limitation concerns the alternative interpretation that the left area PF is not central to technical reasoning but to the storage of sensorimotor programs about the prototypical manipulation of common tools. Here, we show that the left area PF is recruited even in situations in which participants do not have to process common manipulable tools. For instance, some items of the psychotechnical task consisted of pictures of tractor, boat, pulley, or cannon. The fact that we found a common activation of the left area PF in such tasks as well as in the mechanical problem-solving task, in which participants could nevertheless simulate the motor actions of manipulating novel tools, indicates that this brain area is not central to tool manipulation but to physical understanding. That being said, some may suggest that viewing a boat or a cannon is enough to incite the simulation of motor actions, so our tasks were not equipped to distinguish between the manipulation- and the reasoning-based approach. We have already shown that the left area PF is more involved in tasks that focus on the mechanical dimension of the tool-use action (e.g., the mechanical interaction between a tool and an object) than its motor dimension (i.e., the interaction between the tool and the effector [e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Reynaud et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reynaud et al., 2016</xref>]). Nevertheless, we recognize that future research is still needed to test the predictions derived from these two approaches.</p><p>Following the effort undertaken by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bayani et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gärdenfors and Högberg, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gärdenfors, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Strachan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Charbonneau et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sperber, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sperber and Hirschfeld, 2004</xref>), the present study contributes to integrating cognitive science into the cultural evolution field in which technical cognition – if not cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Heyes, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heyes, 2018</xref>) – has remained peripheral to the debate on the origins and evolution of human technology. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wynn et al., 2017</xref> stated, ‘[e]ven archaeologists, for whom technical remains are the primary data source, have tended to privilege language and symbol use in discussion of the modern mind’ (p. 21). Yet, recent accounts have proposed that non-social-cognitive skills such as causal understanding or technical reasoning might have played a crucial role in cumulative technological culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Whiten, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Osiurak et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vale et al., 2021</xref>). Support for these accounts comes from micro-society experiments, which have demonstrated that the improvement of technology over generations is accompanied by an increase in its understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Osiurak et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Osiurak et al., 2022</xref>), or that learners’ technical-reasoning skills are a good predictor of cumulative performance in such micro-societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Oliveira et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Osiurak et al., 2016</xref>). While behavioural experiments tend to demonstrate the impact of technical reasoning on cumulative technological culture, the present findings offer a neural reality to these behavioural results and inspire new questions: Which, if any, cognitive subcomponents of technical reasoning are specific to the human species? Can cumulative technological culture emerge without technical reasoning? How to distinguish technical reasoning from associative learning in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Heyes, 2023</xref>)? How do humans translate their physical understanding into explanations? All these and other fascinating questions constitute a research agenda for investigating the co-evolution of the human brain, cognition, and technology.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>The study was conducted in the Laboratory for the Study of Cognitive Mechanisms at the University of Lyon (Lyon, France) and in the Lyon Neuroimaging Department (CERMEP, Lyon, France). For both experiments, participants were randomly recruited through advertisements posted on social media websites. One week before the MRI session, the participants signed the informed consent to take part in the study and were seen by a medical doctor to ascertain their eligibility for the neuroimaging session. All the participants were right-handed, had a normal or corrected-to-normal vision, provided informed consent, and reported no history of neurological or psychiatric disorder. All the participants signed written consent and were given a monetary incentive for their time (60€). The study was in line with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by a French Ethics Committee (N°ID-RCB: 2018-A00734-51). Thirty-four participants (<italic>M<sub>age</sub></italic> = 24.21, SD = 4.04, range: 18–36; female gender: <italic>n</italic> = 20, male gender: <italic>n</italic> = 14) took part in Experiment 1 and 35 new participants (<italic>M<sub>age</sub></italic> = 24.31, SD = 5.37, range: 20–44; female gender: <italic>n</italic> = 23, male gender: <italic>n</italic> = 12) in Experiment 2. Inclusion in the final sample required that head motion during scanning did not exceed 0.5 mm displacement (i.e., framewise displacement) between consecutive volumes on 90% of volumes. No participants were excluded based on this criterion.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Stimuli and design</title><p>For all experiments, the participants were thoroughly briefed on the instructions for completing the tasks just before the scanning session. Two practice trials per condition were proposed but did not reappear inside the scanner. The first experiment consisted of a <italic>T</italic><sub>1</sub>-weighted anatomical scan and a functional run for the mechanical problem-solving task. The other experiment was scanned in a single session with two functional runs separated with a <italic>T</italic><sub>1</sub>-weighted anatomical scan. The psychotechnical and mentalizing tasks were part of the first run, and the fluid-cognition task was scanned in the second run. We used a within-subject design with blocks of different lengths for each condition for the Experiment 1, and a fixed length of 30 s for all the other experiments emanating from the presentation of, respectively, 5, 3, and 3 images for, respectively, 6, 10, and 10 s each, for the psychotechnical, fluid-cognition and mentalizing tasks. Blocks were separated with a fixation cross for 15 s in all conditions. Participants’ answers were collected via a button box held in their right hand.</p><sec id="s4-2-1"><title>Mechanical problem-solving task</title><p>Eight experimental and eight control blocks were either 25 s (4 blocks), 32.5 s (2 blocks), or 40 s (2 blocks) long. Each block consisted of 3, 4, or 5 trials. Each trial was composed as follows: The image of the 3D glass box only was displayed for 4 s. In the control condition, a black square mask was applied on the picture. Then, for the next 3 s, two tools (experimental condition) or two missing pieces (control condition) were added on the left and right sides of the 3D box (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Before the scanning session, the participants were informed that, in the experimental condition, five distinct tools could be used to solve the mechanical problems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), which consisted in moving a small red cubic element trapped in the 3D glass box from its original location into a new target location. In the scanner, the participants had to figure out for 4 s and for each mechanical problem how to solve it by using one of the tools shown before the scanning session. Then, two tools were presented for 3 s, and they had to decide which was the correct one to solve the mechanical problem by pressing either the left or the right button of the button box. The control condition was a visual completion task. The participants scrutinized the 3D glass box for 4 s and then had 3 s to decide which of the two missing pieces presented was the correct one to fill the mask. A 500-ms fixation cross separated the trials. On the last trial of each block, a red frame appeared around the visual scene, signalling to the participants that their response was awaited. Consequently, 3 additional seconds were added to the display of the box with tools or pieces on the sides to allow for motor response. Blocks alternated between the experimental condition and the control condition.

Blocks alternated between the experimental condition and the control condition, six times each. The participants had to select which of the two presented situations was the correct one or the most effective one in the experimental condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), whereas, in the control condition, they had to select the situation containing a square (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

The adaptations consisted in reducing the number of options from 4 to 2 and in modifying one part of the picture to create a square (for the control condition). As these batteries are commercialized, we did not provide the items – even the modified ones – in an open-access repository. Nevertheless, the items can be available on request.

First, the superior part of the board was shown for 6 s, for the participants to try to make sense of the cartoon first. Then the bottom part was presented for 4 additional seconds, with the top part remaining on display. On the last image of each block, a red frame appeared, indicating to the participants that a physical answer via the button box was required, during the last 2 s of the presentation. Blocks were therefore 30 s long and were repeated six times each. Half of the cartoons in each condition involved a single character, the other half more than one character (all but one implied two characters, and one implied a character versus a crowd). For the two experimental conditions (i.e., INT + PHYS and PHYS-Only conditions; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), the participants had to choose the cartoon with the probable ending to the story depicted in the three first drawings, and for the control condition, they had to select which cartoon was already present in the first three ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In the PHYS-Only condition, the selection only needed to understand the physical context. In the INT + PHYS condition, the selection needed to understand both the physical context and the social context.

I appreciate that accuracy plots are now included, as well as a separate analysis where differences in parameter estimates are performed for participants whose accuracy data were above chance levels. I also appreciate the new figure with the sphere ROIs for each participant, as they help us appreciate anatomical variability in the peak response separately for each task.</p><p>I have four concerns related to the weaknesses of the study:</p><p>(1) Although the results still hold when removing participants whose accuracy was 50% or less, a major limitation of this study is that participants made a button press response only to the last trial in a block. This is problematic because a participant could get all trials in a block correct except for the last one, or a participant could get all trials in a block wrong, and performance would be considered equivalent-as a consequence, it is not possible for one to know if participants who are at chance are performing differently from participants who are not at chance, and it is not possible to control for variance in reaction time (a concern also raised by reviewer 3).</p><p>(2) My second concern relates to the way in which the data are interpreted based on thresholding. There is above-threshold activation in the left SMG for all tasks except the fluid cognition task. The z-scores associated with significant voxels in Figure 3 are very strong (minimum z is 6). If one were to relax the threshold of the group level maps to, e.g., p &lt; .001, uncorrected, FDR q &lt; .05, or FWER of .10, there will be overlapping voxels outside the SMG. The discussion of the left SMG in the manuscript is prominent and narrowly construed-the left SMG is discussed as if it were 'the' region: &quot;This confirms that the technical-reasoning network depends upon the recruitment of the left area PF, even if additional cognitive processes involving other peripheral brain areas can be engaged depending on the task&quot; (pp. 9). My intuition is there will be numerous other areas of overlap when using a threshold that is still highly significant (e.g., z = 3 or 4). So, for proponents of the technical reasoning hypothesis, is there a counterfactual or alternative brain area/network/system not in the left SMG?</p><p>(3) I like the new Figure 6 because it shows variability in the location of the peak coordinate at the level of single participants. And, indeed, there's considerable variability that is typical when localizing ROIs in single participants. My concern is the level at which hypothesis testing is performed. An independent SMG ROI is used to extract parameter estimates and correlate responses between tasks to show a pattern of correlation that comports with a technical reasoning model of left SMG function. This is a fine approach but it does not rule out the so-called 'same region different function' interpretation because it relies on correlation-one cannot reverse infer that the left SMG is carrying out the same function across different tasks because the response in that area is more strongly correlated between certain tasks. This finding points to that possibility and makes interesting predictions for future studies to pursue, but it cannot tell us whether common functions in the left SMG are involved in each task. E.g., one interesting prediction for future studies is to test if patients with lesions to this site are disproportionately more inaccurate in the experimental condition of the mechanical problem solving task, the psychotechnical task, the mentalizing task, but not the fluid cognition task.</p><p>(4) I appreciated the approach to testing the adjacency interpretation by showing the sphere and peak Y coordinate across the tasks. It is interesting that across the groups, there is no difference in the peak Y coordinate of the psychotechnical task and both conditions of the mentalizing task, whereas the peak Y coordinate in the fluid intelligence task is more anterior in the post-central gyrus across participants (why is that?). But why restrict the analysis to just the Y coordinate? A rigorous way to test the adjacency hypothesis is to compute Euclidean distance among X, Y, and Z coordinates between any two tasks collected in the same participant. One can then test if the Euclidean distance between, e.g., the psychotechnical task and one condition of the mentalizing task is smaller than the Euclidean distance between the psychotechnical task and the fluid cognition task. Similarly, one can test whether Euclidean distance between the INT and PHY conditions of the mentalizing task is smaller than the Euclidean distance between the INT and psychotechnical task or PHY and psychotechnical task. There is no justification to restrict this analysis to the anterior-posterior dimension only.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.94578.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The authors have responded very thoughtfully to many of the points raised, and the revised manuscript will make a useful contribution to our understanding of some of the computations performed by area PF. In particular, the investigators' addition of analyses of peak activations, their additional clarifications that area PF is likely to be part of a larger network concerned with technical reasoning, and their responses to the reviewers' concerns about differential task difficulty have strengthened the conclusions that can be drawn from the study.</p><p>The authors' response does not completely mitigate the concern noted by all 3 reviewers that the control tasks were easier than their corresponding experimental tasks (for everything but the fluid cognition task). The specific trouble with this issue can be appreciated by looking at Figure 4A, for example, which shows that area PF was activated for many individuals in both the control task and the experimental mechanical problem-solving task, but more so for the latter. Since the experimental task was harder (and more trial time was likely spent on task trying to solve it), the concern remains that area PF was driven harder by the experimental task in part due to the more challenging nature of that task.</p><p>The revised manuscript counters that the fluid cognition task was also harder than its control condition, yet did not activate PF more than its control condition. But this response seems to sidestep the central point of the reviewers' concerns: the fundamental computations that underlie the technical reasoning tasks may also be present in the respective (non technical-reasoning-based) control tasks and drive area PF activations to greater or lesser degrees based on how much they tax those computations. The fact that the fluid cognition experimental task and control task are not differentially difficult does not mitigate this concern, it just suggests that neither of those tasks tap the same fundamental computations, whatever they may be. (As an added note, Figures 2 and 4 show that both the PHYS-only and INT+PHYS mentalizing tasks only weakly activated PF, and both of these tasks were easier than the other technical cognition tasks).</p><p>The new ROI analysis with removal of subjects who performed below 50% in the revised manuscript is somewhat helpful, but there are two remaining issues: (1) chance performance is defined by a binomial test in this case, so scores somewhat above 50% may still be at chance depending on the number of items, and thus there may have been subjects who were not removed who could not perform the tasks; (2) it would have been convincing to include accuracy as a covariate in the modeling of BOLD parameter estimates for the remaining above-chance subjects to ensure that all reported effects remain once differential task difficulty is taken into account. It also appears that the legend for Figure S2, which indicates that the figure includes just subjects who performed at or below 50%, may not be correct; does the figure instead show data from subjects who performed at or above 50%?</p><p>Despite these remaining concerns, there are many aspects of this revised study that render it a useful contribution that will likely spur further research in this very interesting area.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.94578.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Osiurak</surname><given-names>François</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Lumière University Lyon 2</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Lyon</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Federico</surname><given-names>Giovanni</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Laboratory of Experimental Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience, Suor Orsola Benincasa University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Naples</named-content></addr-line><country>Italy</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Fournel</surname><given-names>Arnaud</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Lumière University Lyon 2</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Lyon</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Gaujoux</surname><given-names>Vivien</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Lumière University Lyon 2</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Lyon</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lamberton</surname><given-names>Franck</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Centre d'Exploration et de Recherche Médicale par Emission de Positons</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bron</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ibarrola</surname><given-names>Danièle</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Centre d'Exploration et de Recherche Médicale par Emission de Positons</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bron</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Rossetti</surname><given-names>Yves</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Lyon Neuroscience Research Center, Lyon University 1</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Lyon</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lesourd</surname><given-names>Mathieu</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Université Marie et Louis PAsteur</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Besançon</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, Osiurak and colleagues investigate the neurocognitive basis of technical reasoning.

The new analyses ruled out both alternative interpretations, thereby reinforcing our interpretation.</p><p>“The conjunction analysis reported was subject to at least two key limitations that needed to be overcome to assure a correct interpretation of our findings. The first was that the tasks could recruit the same regions for different cognition functions (same-region-but-different-function interpretation). The second was that the activated regions of the different tasks could be adjacent but did not overlap at finer resolutions (adjacency interpretation). We tested the same-region-but-different-function interpretation by conducting additional ROI analyses, which consisted of correlating the specific activation of the left area PF (i.e., difference in terms of mean Blood-Oxygen Level Dependent [BOLD] parameter estimates between the experimental condition minus the control condition) in the psychotechnical task, the fluid-cognition task, and the PHYS-Only and INT+PHYS conditions of the mentalizing task. This analysis did not include the mechanical problem-solving task because the sample of participants was not the same for this task. As shown in Fig. 5, we found significant correlations between all the tasks that were hypothesized as recruiting technical reasoning, i.e., the psychotechnical task and the PHYS-Only and INT+PHYS conditions of the mentalizing task (all <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). By contrast, no significant correlation was obtained between these three tasks and the fluid-cognition task (all <italic>p</italic> &gt; .15). This finding invalidates the same-region-but-different-function interpretation by revealing a coherent pattern in the activation of the left area PF in situations in which participants were supposed to reason technically. We examined the adjacency interpretation by analysing the specific locations of individual peak activations within the left area PF ROI for the mechanical problemsolving task, the psychotechnical task, the fluid-cognition task, and the PHYS-Only and INT+PHYS conditions of the mentalizing task. These peaks, which corresponded to the maximum value of activation obtained for each participant within the left area PF ROI, are reported in Fig. 6. As can be seen, the peaks of the fluid-cognition task were located more anteriorly, in the left area PFt (Parietal Ft) and the postcentral cortex, compared to the peaks of the other four tasks, which were more posterior, in the left area PF. Statistical analyses based on the <italic>y</italic> coordinates of the individual activation peaks confirmed this description (Fig. 6). Indeed, the <italic>y</italic> coordinates of the peaks of the mechanical problem-solving task, the psychotechnical task and the PHYS-Only and INT+PHYS conditions of the mentalizing task were posterior to the <italic>y</italic> coordinates of the peaks of the fluid-cognition task (all <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), whereas no significant differences were reported between the four tasks (all <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05). These findings speak against the adjacency interpretation by revealing that participants recruited the same part of the left area PF to perform tasks involving technical reasoning.” (p. 11-13)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Control tasks may be inadequate: the tasks may involve other factors, such as motor/ actionrelated information. For the psychotechnical task, fluid-cognition task, and mentalizing task, the experiment tasks need not only care about technical-cognition information but also motor-related information, whereas the control tasks do not need to consider motor-related information (mainly visual shape information). Additionally, there may be no difference in motor-related information between the conditions of the fluid-cognition task. Therefore, the regions of interest may be sensitive to motor-related information, affecting the research conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer 1 for this comment. We added a specific section in the discussion that addresses this limitation.</p><p>“The second limitation concerns the alternative interpretation that the left area PF is not central to technical reasoning but to the storage of sensorimotor programs about the prototypical manipulation of common tools. Here we show that the left area PF is recruited even in situations in which participants do not have to process common manipulable tools. For instance, some items of the psychotechnical task consisted of pictures of tractor, boat, pulley, or cannon. The fact that we found a common activation of the left area PF in such tasks as well as in the mechanical problem-solving task, in which participants could nevertheless simulate the motor actions of manipulating novel tools, indicates that this brain area is not central to tool manipulation but to physical understanding. That being said, some may suggest that viewing a boat or a cannon is enough to incite the simulation of motor actions, so our tasks were not equipped to distinguish between the manipulation-based approach and the reasoning-based approach. We have already shown that the left area PF is more involved in tasks that focus on the mechanical dimension of the tool-use action (e.g., the mechanical interaction between a tool and an object) than its motor dimension (i.e., the interaction between the tool and the effector [e.g., 24, 40]). Nevertheless, we recognize that future research is still needed to test the predictions derived from these two approaches.” (p. 18-19)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>-Negative results require further validation: the cognitive results for the fluid-cognition task in the study may need more refinement.

Four functional MRI (fMRI) experiments were created to test this hypothesis. Group contrast maps were then obtained for each task, and overlap among the tasks was computed at the voxel level. The principal finding is that the left PF exhibited differentially greater BOLD response in tasks requiring participants to reason about the physical properties of actions and objects (referred to as technical reasoning). In contrast, there was no differential BOLD response in the left PF when participants engaged in fMRI variant of the Raven's progressive matrices to assess fluid cognition.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This is a well-written manuscript that builds from extensive prior work from this group mapping the brain areas and cognitive mechanisms underlying object manipulation, technical reasoning, and problem-solving. Major strengths of this manuscript include the use of control conditions to demonstrate there are differentially greater BOLD responses in area PF over and above the baseline condition of each task. Another strength is the demonstration that area PF is not responsive in tasks assessing fluid cognition - e.g., it may just be that PF responds to a greater extent in a harder condition relative to an easy condition of a task. The analysis of data from Task 3 rules out this alternative interpretation. The methods and analysis are sufficiently written for others to replicate the study, and the materials and code for data analysis are publicly available.</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely thank Reviewer 2 for their precious comments, which helped us improve the MS.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The first weakness is that the conclusions of the manuscript rely on there being overlap among group-level contrast maps presented in Figure 2.

The first was that the tasks could recruit the same regions for different cognition functions (same-region-but-different-function interpretation). The second was that the activated regions of the different tasks could be adjacent but did not overlap at finer resolutions (adjacency interpretation). We tested the same-region-but-different-function interpretation by conducting additional ROI analyses, which consisted of correlating the specific activation of the left area PF (i.e., difference in terms of mean Blood-Oxygen Level Dependent [BOLD] parameter estimates between the experimental condition minus the control condition) in the psychotechnical task, the fluid-cognition task, and the PHYS-Only and INT+PHYS conditions of the mentalizing task. This analysis did not include the mechanical problem-solving task because the sample of participants was not the same for this task. As shown in Fig. 5, we found significant correlations between all the tasks that were hypothesized as recruiting technical reasoning, i.e., the psychotechnical task and the PHYS-Only and INT+PHYS conditions of the mentalizing task (all <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05).

Thus, some of the control tasks seem to control much better for difficulty and time on task than others. For example, the control task for the psychotechnical task simply requires the indication of which array contains a simple square shape (i.e., it is much easier than the psychotechnical task), whereas the control task for mechanical problem-solving requires mentally fitting a shape into a design, much like solving a jigsaw puzzle (i.e., it is only slightly easier than the experimental task).</p></disp-quote><p>It is true that some control conditions could be easier than other ones. These differences reinforced the common activation found in the left area PF in the tasks hypothesized as involving technical reasoning, because this activation survived irrespective of the differences in terms of experimental design. For us, the rationale is the same as for a meta-analysis, in which we try to find what is common to a great variety of tasks. The only detrimental consequence we identified here is that this difference explained why we did not report a specific activation of the left area PF in the fluid-cognition task, as if the left area PF was more responsive when the task was difficult. This possibility assumes that the experimental condition of the fluid-cognition task is much more difficult than its control condition compared to what can be seen in the other tasks. As Reviewer 2 stressed in Point 1, this interpretation is unlikely, because the differences between the experimental and control conditions were similar to the fluid-cognition task in the mechanical problem-solving and psychotechnical tasks.

This suggests that both networks need to work together for solving a day-today problem in which both the physical constraints of the situation and the intention of the individual must be integrated. Our findings replicated previous ones with a similar task (e.g., Brunet et al. 2000; Völlm et al., 2006), in which the authors gave an interpretation similar to ours in considering that this task requires understanding physical and social causes. Perhaps that the reference to the results of the mentalizing task was not explicit enough.

Even if we accept the idea that we possess specific sensorimotor programs about tool manipulation, it remains that these programs cannot explain how an individual decides to bend a wire to make a hook or to pour water in a recipient to retrieve a target. As a matter of fact, such behaviour has been reported in nonhuman animals, such as crows (Weir et al., 2002, Nature) or orangutans (Mendes et al., 2007, Biology Letters). In these studies, the question is whether these nonhuman animals understand the physical causes or not, but the question of sensorimotor programs is never addressed (to our knowledge). This is also true in developmental studies on tool use (e.g., Beck et al., 2011, Cognition; Cutting et al., 2011, Journal of Experimental Child Psychology). This is what we meant here, that is, the manipulation-based approach is not equipped to explain how people solve physical problems by using or making tools – or any object – or by building constructions or producing technical innovations. However, we agree that some papers have been interested in exploring the link between common and novel tool use and have suggested that both could recruit common sensorimotor programs. It is noteworthy that these studies do not test the predictions from the manipulation-based approach versus the reasoning-based approach, so both interpretations are generally viable as stressed by Seidel et al.

In addition, we also disagree that the link between common tool use and novel tool use was weak.</p><p>“The hypothesis put forward in the introduction predicts that knowledge about prototypical tool use assessed by pantomime of tool use and the ability to infer function from structure assessed by novel tool selection can both contribute to the use of familiar tools. Indeed results of both tests correlated signicantly with the use of familiar tools pantomime of tool use: r = 0.77, novel tool selection: r = 0.62; both <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, but there was also a signicant correlation between the two tests r = 0.64, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001.” (Goldenberg &amp; Hagmann, 1998; p. 585)</p><p>As can be seen in this quote, they reported a significant correlation between novel tool selection and the use of familiar tools. It is also noteworthy that the novel tool selection test and the pantomime test correlated together. Georg Goldenberg told one of the authors (F. Osiurak; personal communication) that this result incited him to revise its idea that pantomime could assess “semantic knowledge”, which explains why he did not use it again as a measure of semantic knowledge. Instead, he preferred to use a classical semantic matching task in his <italic>2009 Brain</italic> paper with Josef Spatt, in which they found a clearer dissociation between semantic knowledge and common/novel tool use not only at the behavioral level but also at the cerebral level.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Introduction: Please expand and clarify this sentence &quot;However, this involvement seems to be task-dependent, contrary to the systematic involvement of left are PF. The IFG and LOTC activations observed in prior studies are of interest as well. Were they indeed all taskdependent in these studies?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this sentence is confusing. We meant that, in the studies reported just above in the paragraph, these regions were not systematically reported contrary to the left area PF. As we think that this information was not crucial for the logic of the paper, we preferred to remove it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Introduction: If implicit mechanical knowledge is acquired through interactions with objects, how is that implicit knowledge conveyed to pass on the material culture to others?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer 3 for this comment. Although mechanical knowledge is implicit, it can be indirectly transmitted to other individuals, as shown in two papers we published in Nature Human Behaviour (Osiurak et al., 2021) and Science Advances (Osiurak et al., 2022). Actually, verbal teaching is not the only way to transmit information. There are many other ways of transmitting information such as gestural teaching (e.g., pointing the important aspects of a task to make them salient to the learner), observation without teaching (i.e., when we observe someone unbeknown to them) or reverse engineering (i.e., scrutinizing an artifact made by someone else). We have shown that even in reverse-engineering conditions, participants can benefit from what previous participants have done to increase their understanding of a physical system. In other words, all these forms of transmission allow the learners to understand new physical relationships without waiting that these relationships randomly occur in the environment. There is a wide literature on social learning, which describes very well how knowledge can be transmitted without using explicit communication. In fact, it is very likely that such forms of transmission were already present in our ancestors, allowing them to start accumulating knowledge without using symbolic language. We did not add this information in the MS because we think that this was a little bit beyond the scope of the MS. Nevetheless, we cited relevant literature on the topic to help the reader find it if interested in the topic.</p><p>“Yet, recent accounts have proposed that non-social cognitive skills such as causal understanding or technical reasoning might have played a crucial role in cumulative technological culture (6, 29, 66). Support for these accounts comes from micro-society experiments, which have demonstrated that the improvement of technology over generations is accompanied by an increase in its understanding (67, 68), or that learners’ technical-reasoning skills are a good predictor of cumulative performance in such micro-societies (33, 69).” (p. 19)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What distinguishes this implicit mechanical knowledge from stored knowledge about object manipulation? Are these two conceptualizations really demonstrably (testably) different?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it is complex to distinguish between these two hypotheses as suggested by Seidel et al. (2023) cited above (see Reviewer 3 Point 8). We have conducted several studies to test the opposite predictions derived from each hypothesis. The main distinction concerns the understanding of physical materials and forces, which is central to the technical-reasoning hypothesis but not to the manipulation-based approach. Indeed, sensorimotor programs about tool manipulation are not assumed to contain information about physical materials and forces. In the present study, the understanding of physical materials and forces was needed in the four tasks hypothesized as requiring technical reasoning, i.e., the mechanical problem-solving task, the psychotechnical task and the PHYS-Only and INT+PHYS conditions of the mentalizing task. We can illustrate this aspect with items of each of these tasks. Figure 1A is of the mechanical problem-solving task.</p><p>As explained in the MS, participants had memorized the five possible tools before the scanner session. Thus, for 4 seconds, they had to imagine which of these tools could be used to extract the target out from the box. We did so to incit them to reason about mechanical solutions based on the physical properties of the problem. Then, they had 3 seconds to select the tool with the appropriate shape, here the right one. In this case, the motor action remains the same (i.e., pulling). Another illustration can be given, with the psychotechnical task (Figure 1B).</p><p>In this task, the participant had to reason as to whether the boat-tractor connection was better in the left picture or in the right picture. This needs to reason about physical forces, but there is no need to recruit sensorimotor programs about tool manipulation. Finally, a last example can be given with the PHYS-Only condition of the mentalizing task (but the logic is the same for the INT+PHYS condition except that the character’s intentions must also be taken into consideration Figure 1D).</p><p>Here the participant must reason about which picture shows what is physically possible. In this task, there is no need to recruit sensorimotor programs about tool manipulation. In sum, what is common between these three tasks is the requirement to reason about physical materials and forces. We do not ignore that motor actions could be simulated in the mechanical problemsolving task, but no motor action needed to be simulated in the other three tasks. Therefore, what was common between all these tasks was the potential involvement of technical reasoning but not of sensorimotor programs about tool manipulation. Of course, an alternative is to consider that motor actions are always needed in all the situations, including situations where no “manipulable tool” is presented, such as a tractor and a boat, a pulley, or a cannon. We cannot rule out this alternative, which is nevertheless, for us, prejudicial because it implies that it becomes difficult to test the manipulation-based approach as motor actions would be everywhere. We voluntarily decided not to introduce a debate between the reasoning-based approach and the manipulation-based approach and preferred a more positive writing by stressing the insights from the present study. Note that we stressed the merits of the manipulation-based approach in the introduction because we sincerely think that this approach has provided interesting insights. However, we voluntarily did not discuss the debate between the two approaches. Given Reviewer 3’s comment (see also Reviewer 1 Point 2), we understand and agree that some words must be nevertheless said to discuss how the manipulation-based approach could interpret our results, thus stressing the potential limitations of our interpretations. Therefore, we added a specific section in the discussion in which we discussed this aspect in more details.</p><p>“The second limitation concerns the alternative interpretation that the left area PF is not central to technical reasoning but to the storage of sensorimotor programs about the prototypical manipulation of common tools. Here we show that the left area PF is recruited even in situations in which participants do not have to process common manipulable tools. For instance, some items of the psychotechnical task consisted of pictures of tractor, boat, pulley, or cannon. The fact that we found a common activation of the left area PF in such tasks as well as in the mechanical problem-solving task, in which participants could nevertheless simulate the motor actions of manipulating novel tools, indicates that this brain area is not central to tool manipulation but to physical understanding. That being said, some may suggest that viewing a boat or a cannon is enough to incite the simulation of motor actions, so our tasks were not equipped to distinguish between the manipulation-based approach and the reasoning-based approach. We have already shown that the left area PF is more involved in tasks that focus on the mechanical dimension of the tool-use action (e.g., the mechanical interaction between a tool and an object) than its motor dimension (i.e., the interaction between the tool and the effector [e.g., 24, 40]). Nevertheless, we recognize that future research is still needed to test the predictions derived from these two approaches.” (p. 18-19)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Introduction and throughout: The framing of left Area PF as a special area for technical reasoning is overly reductionistic from a functional neuroanatomic perspective in that it ignores a large relevant literature showing that the region is involved with many other tasks that seem not to require anything like technical cognition. Indeed, entering the coordinates - 56, -29, 36 (reported as the peak coordinates in common across the studied tasks) in Neurosynth reveals that 59 imaging studies report activations within 3 mm of those coordinates; few are action-related (a brief review indicated studies of verbal creativity, texture processing, reading, somatosensory processing, stress reactions, attentional selection etc). Please acknowledge the difficulty of claiming that a large brain region should be labeled the brain's technical reasoning area when it seems to also participate in so much else. The left IPL (including area PF) is densely connected to the ventral premotor cortex, and this network is activated in language and calculation tasks as well as tool use tasks (e.g., Matsumoto, Nair, et al., 2012). What other constructs might be able to unite this disparate literature, and are any of these alternative constructs ruled out by the present data? Lacking this objective discussion, the manuscript does read as a promotion of the investigators' preferred viewpoint.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer 3 for this comment. As stressed in the initial version of the MS, we did not write that the left area PF is sufficient but central to the network that allows us to reason about the physical world. Regardless, we agree that an objective discussion was needed on this aspect to help the reader not misunderstand our purpose. We added a section in this aspect as suggested.</p><p>“Before concluding, we would like to point out two potential limitations of the present study. The first limitation concerns the fact that the literature has documented the recruitment of the left area PF in many neuroimaging experiments in which there was no need to reason about physical events (e.g., language tasks). This can be easily illustrated by entering the left area PF coordinates in the Neurosynth database.</p><p>This finding could be enough to refute the idea that this brain area is specific to technical reasoning. Although this limitation deserves to be recognized, it is also true for many other findings. For instance, sensory or motor brain regions such as the precentral or the postcentral cortex have been found activated in many non-motor tasks, the visual word form area in non-language tasks, or the Heschl’s gyrus in nonmusical tasks. This remains a major challenge for scientists, the question being how to solve these inconsistencies that can result from statistical errors or stress that considerable effort is needed to understand the very functional nature of these brain areas. Thus, understanding that the left area PF is central to physical understanding can be viewed as a first essential step before discovering its fundamental function, as suggested by the functional polyhedral approach (56).” (p. 18)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion: The discussion of a small cluster in the IFG (pars opercularis) that nearly survived statistical correction is noteworthy in light of the above point. This further underscores the importance of discussing networks and not just single brain regions (such as area PF) when examining complex processes. The investigators note, &quot;a plausible hypothesis is that the left IFG integrates the multiple constraints posed by the physical situation to set the ground for a correct reasoning process, such as it could be involved in syntactic language processing&quot;. In fact, the hypothesis that the IFG and SMG are together related to resolving competition has been previously proposed, as has the more specific hypothesis that the SMG buffers actions and that the context-appropriate action is then selected by the IFG (e.g., Buxbaum &amp; Randerath, 2018). The parallels with the way the SMG is engaged with competing lexical or phonological alternatives (e.g., Peramunage, Blumstein et al., 2011) have also been previously noted.</p></disp-quote><p>We added the Buxbaum and Randerath (2018)’s reference in this section.</p><p>“The functional role of the left IFG in the context of tool use has been previously discussed (24) and a plausible hypothesis is that the left IFG integrates the multiple constraints posed by the physical situation to set the ground for a correct reasoning process, such as it could be involved in syntactic language processing (for a somewhat similar view, see [51]).” (p. 16-17)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Introduction and Discussion: Please clarify how the technical reasoning network overlaps with or is distinct from the tool-use network reported by many previous investigators.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a couple of sentences in the discussion to clarify this point.</p><p>“It should be clear here that we do not advocate the localizationist position simply stating that activation in the left area PF is the necessary and sufficient condition for technical reasoning. We rather defend the view according to which it requires a network of interacting brain areas, one of them – and of major importance – being the left area PF. This allows the engagement of different configurations of cerebral areas in different technical-reasoning tasks, but with a central process acting as a stable component: The left area PF. Thus, when people intend to use physical tools, it can work in concert with brain regions specific to object manipulation and motor control, thereby forming another network, the tool-use network. It can also interact with brain regions specific to intentional gestures to form a “social-learning” network that allows people to enhance their understanding about the physical aspects of a technical task (e.g., the making of a tool) through communicative gestures such as pointing gestures (42). The major challenge for future research is to specify the nature of the cognitive process supported by the left area PF and that might be involved in the broad understanding of the physical world.” (p. 14)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion: All of the experimental tasks require a response from a difficult choice in an array, and all of the tasks except for the fluid cognition task are likely to require prediction or simulation of a motion trajectory-whether an embodied or disembodied trajectory is unclear. The Discussion does mention the related (but distinct) idea of an &quot;intuitive physics engine&quot;, a &quot;kind of simulator&quot;, Please clarify how this study can rule out these alternative interpretations of the data. If the study cannot rule out these alternatives, the claims of the study (and the paper title which labels PF as a technical cognition area) should be scaled back considerably.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer 3 for this comment. The authors of the papers on intuitive physics engine or associative learning do not suggest that these processes are embodied. As discussed above, we clarified our perspective on the role of the left area PF and hope that these modifications help the reader better understand it. We warmly thank Reviewer 3 for their comments, which considerably helped us improve the MS.</p></body></sub-article></article>
