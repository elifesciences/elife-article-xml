in the early visual cortical regions is related to the spatial frequency (SF) selectivity of neurons. However, there has been no direct investigation into how this relationship is reflected in population receptive field (pRF) sizes despite the common application of pRF mapping in visual neuroscience. We hypothesised that adaptation to high/low SF would decrease the sensitivity of neurons with respectively small/large receptive field sizes, resulting in a change in pRF sizes as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). To test this hypothesis, we first quantified the SF aftereffect using a psychophysical paradigm where human observers made SF judgments following adaptation to high/low SF noise patterns. We then incorporated the same adaptation technique into a standard pRF mapping procedure to investigate the spatial tuning of the early visual cortex following SF adaptation. Results showed that adaptation to a low/high SF resulted in smaller/larger pRFs, respectively, as hypothesised. Our results provide the most direct evidence to date that the spatial tuning of the visual cortex, as measured by pRF mapping, is related to the SF selectivity of visual neural populations. This has implications for various domains of visual processing, including size perception and visual acuity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>spatial frequency</kwd><kwd>pRF</kwd><kwd>fMRI</kwd><kwd>visual adaptation</kwd><kwd>spatial vision</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009193</institution-id><institution>Marsden Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>3716355</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dakin</surname><given-names>Steven C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Modulations in population receptive field size induced by spatial frequency adaptation reveal a direct link between spatial tuning in the visual cortex and spatial frequency selectivity of neuronal populations.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neurons in the visual cortex respond to stimulation within a limited range of the visual field, namely the receptive field. The receptive fields are organized in such a way that adjacent neurons are stimulated by adjacent areas in the visual field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wandell et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wandell and Winawer, 2011</xref>). A consequence of such retinotopic organisation is that receptive field characteristics of the human visual cortex can be studied with a model-based pRF mapping method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dumoulin and Wandell, 2008</xref>) using fMRI. The method involves systematically stimulating different regions of the visual field and modelling the corresponding fMRI responses to estimate quantitative pRF properties, such as size and position.</p><p>Both pRF mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dumoulin and Wandell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Amano et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Dumoulin and Harvey, 2012</xref>) and electrophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Van Essen et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Klink et al., 2021</xref>) studies have established that the receptive field sizes of neuronal populations depend on (a) the eccentricity of the receptive field location and (b) the visual area they are drawn from, within the visual hierarchy. Neurons corresponding to the central visual field exhibit smaller receptive fields (finer spatial tuning), whereas those responding to the more peripheral visual field have larger receptive fields (coarser spatial tuning). The dependence of receptive field size on eccentricity has been linked to human visual performance, specifically visual acuity (the smallest size of object we can reliably recognise) and discrimination of relative size. A progressive increase in eccentricity is associated with a proportional decline in resolution visual acuity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Anstis, 1974</xref>). Additionally, perceived size biases in eccentric areas of the visual field are linked to the spatial tuning pattern across eccentricity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Moutsiana et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Urale and Schwarzkopf, 2023</xref>).</p><p>Neurons in early visual areas are selectively sensitive to a limited range of spatial frequencies (SFs) within their receptive fields. SF tuning in the visual cortex has been reported in cats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Everson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">HÃ¼bener et al., 1997</xref>), macaque monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Xu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">De Valois et al., 1982</xref>), and humans using fMRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aghajari et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Henriksson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Broderick et al., 2022</xref>). This selectivity has also been probed psychophysically using an adaptation paradigm developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blakemore and Campbell, 1969</xref> (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Campbell and Robson, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blakemore and Sutton, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blakemore et al., 1970</xref>). Prolonged exposure to a grating of a particular SF (1) reduces perceptual sensitivity to the adapted SF, which manifests as an increase in the detection threshold for a grating at the adapted SF; and (2) alters the apparent SF of subsequently presented gratings such that their apparent SF is ârepelledâ from the adapted SF (i.e. lower SF gratings appear even lower, higher SF gratings appear even higher; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Webster, 2015</xref> for a review on visual adaptation). This adaptation effect suggests the existence of SF tuning channel units, each maximally sensitive to a given relatively narrow range of SFs. A decline in one channelâs sensitivity results in the adjacent channels taking the lead in the overall response, thereby shifting the perceived SF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Braddick et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mollon, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Frisby and Mayhew, 1980</xref>). A similar channel mechanism has been proposed to account for eccentric size aftereffects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altan and Boyaci, 2020</xref>) and numerosity adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Aulet and Lourenco, 2023</xref>), although others have claimed SF channels themselves play a direct role in numerosity judgments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dakin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Paul et al., 2022</xref>). Moreover, studies have suggested that SF-tuned mechanisms play a crucial role in size perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Carrasco et al., 1986</xref>).</p><p>The neuronal SF preference across eccentricity follows a similar pattern to the variations in the receptive field size with respect to eccentricity. Neurons responding to peripheral stimulation are typically tuned to lower SFs than those representing central vision, and vice versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aghajari et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, SF-tuned neurons in the primary visual cortex are roughly scaled versions of one another in terms of their preferred SF, suggesting scale-invariance in neuronal processing of SF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Teichert et al., 2007</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). Based on these observations, one might infer a link between the SF selectivity of neuronal populations and their receptive field sizes. Such a connection is supported by single-unit recordings from the striate cortex of macaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">De Valois et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Foster et al., 1985</xref>) and cats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Movshon et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Linsenmeier et al., 1982</xref>). Furthermore, extending these findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Keliris et al., 2019</xref>) introduced a novel method for estimating neuronal receptive field sizes in humans through fMRI, utilizing the SF selectivity of neurons. The results they provided were in close alignment with those obtained from electrophysiological measurements, yet they diverged significantly from pRF estimates.</p><p>While pRF estimation does not yield a direct measurement of neuronal receptive fields, it remains a widely employed technique in human research, spanning a diverse array of studies, including, but not limited to mapping the visual field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dumoulin and Wandell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Amano et al., 2009</xref>), identifying neural correlates of visual performance and functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Silva et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Harvey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">He et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dekker et al., 2019</xref>), and examining how visual processing in the patient population diverges from the healthy population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Papanikolaou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alvarez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schwarzkopf et al., 2014</xref>). This prevalence underscores the importance of understanding how pRF measurements are connected to certain neuronal properties, such as SF selectivity, in addition to studying neuronal receptive fields directly. To our knowledge, no existing study has elucidated how the interplay between neuronal RF size and SF selectivity is reflected in pRF estimates.</p><p>In this study, we employed an SF adaptation paradigm within the standard pRF mapping design to explore this relationship in human pRFs. We hypothesized that SF adaptation would influence measured pRF sizes. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, we anticipated that neurons would show decreased responsiveness after adaptation to their preferred SFs, and as a result, the sizes of the pRFs would be in accordance with those of non-adapted neurons. More specifically, we expected to observe larger pRF sizes following adaptation to high SF and smaller pRF sizes after adaptation to low SF (A simulation showing the hypothesized pRF size effects with limited contribution from either large or small RFs is included in the shared data repository). We first psychophysically tested the perceptual aftereffect of adapting to relatively high or low SF. Then, we examined the spatial tuning of the early visual cortex under the influence of these adapters.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Hypothesized effect of SF adaptation on pRF size and stimulus sequence of the behavioural experiment.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Illustration of the hypothesized effect of SF adaptation on pRF size.

While visual aftereffects are usually induced by long periods of initial and top-up adaptations to maximize the strength of the perceptual effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Greenlee et al., 1991</xref>), our overarching aim was to integrate adaptation within the pRF mapping method. This necessitated the implementation of brief top-up adaptations as the pRF mapping design requires that each volume in the fMRI experiment include a top-up adaptation along with the mapping stimuli. Consequently, to ensure that the SF adapter stimuli designed for the pRF mapping context would induce a robust perceptual aftereffect, we investigated the effect of brief adaptation to noise images with either relatively high or low SF structures on the subsequent perception of mid-SF.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Ten participants (three males and seven females; age range: 25â42; mean <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mstyle><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle displaystyle="false"><mml:mo stretchy="false">[</mml:mo><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">]</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>36</mml:mn></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math><tex-math id="inft1">\begin{document}$[M]=36$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula>) with normal or corrected-to-normal vision participated in the experiment.

The contrast of the images was 100%.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref> shows an example illustration of the high-SF adapter stimulus, the mid-SF reference stimulus, and a test stimulus. There were two adapter conditions. One used low SF noise, which had a peak SF of 0.5 cpd, and the other used high SF noise with a peak SF of 3.5 cpd. The test phase included two noise stimuli. The one in the same visual hemifield as the adapter was called reference, and its peak SF was always â¼ 1.3 cpd, the geometric mean of the SFs of the two adapters. The one in the unadapted visual hemifield, however, varied in SF throughout the experiment. There were 30 different SFs for the test stimulus, ranging from 0.2 to 3.8 cpd. During stimulus presentation, we alternated different noise images of the same SF at 20 Hz to prevent afterimages. For this purpose, we generated 40 noise images for each of the two adapter stimuli (high and low SF), 20 images for the reference stimulus, and 6 images for each of the 30 available test SFs. For all types of stimuli, the bandwidth of the peak spatial frequencies was 0.5 octaves.</p><p>Stimuli were presented within a circular aperture with a radius of 7.7Â° of visual angle. In addition, a gray mask occluded part of the stimulus. The mask consisted of a circle (radius: â¼ 1Â° of visual angle) at the center of the screen and two 20Â° wide wedges covering the top and bottom vertical meridian. A 0.4Â° wide alpha gradient mask was applied along the edges of the stimuli to eliminate the high SF components of the sharp edges. The stimuli for the psychophysics experiment were designed to match those of the fMRI arm of the study, where we aimed to avoid stimulating the contralateral hemifields.</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-3"><title>Procedure</title><p>Participants were first familiarized with the concept of spatial frequencies. They were shown a noise pattern similar to those used in the actual experiment and were allowed to interact with its SF using the H and L keys on the keyboard to make its SF gradually higher or lower, respectively. They were free to spend as much time as needed until they felt comfortable with the spatial frequencies and were ready for the experiment. Participants pressed the space bar to continue with the practice trials. There were 25 practice trials in which the participants were shown the test stimuli as they appeared in the actual experimental trials (see test phase in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) and asked to indicate the one with higher SF. They were free to end the practice trials after they were comfortable with the task.</p><p>A single trial of the experiment consisted of the following phases: Adaptation (only in adaptation conditions), test, and response. Participants were required to fixate on a black dot at the center of the screen throughout the experiment. In the adaptation phase, participants were shown a ring segment of alternating noise images having a certain peak SF (either 0.5 or 3.5 c/deg). The adapter stimulus was either in the left or right visual hemifield. The adaptation lasted for 30 s in the first trials and 0.5 s in the rest of the trials, as a top-up adaptation.</p><p>The SF of the test stimuli was adaptively determined throughout the experiment. We used two interleaved one-up one-down adaptive staircases, starting from high and low SFs (3.8 and 0.2 cpd). The step size of the staircase was 0.5 cpd at the beginning, and it was halved after each response reversal until it reached 0.13 cpd. There were 30 trials in a staircase. The test phase was followed by a blank gray display, which signalled the participant to press one of the two arrow keys to indicate the location of the noise segment having a higher SF. The experiment proceeded to the next trial if one of the allowed keys was pressed within 2 s; otherwise, the trial was repeated.</p><p>An experimental session consisted of six blocks for three adaptation conditions (high SF adaptation, low SF adaptation, and no adaptation) and two visual hemifields (left and right).

Assuming larger RFs convey selectivity for low SF and smaller RFs convey selectivity for high SF, we expected to find relatively smaller pRFs after low SF adaptation and larger pRFs after high SF adaptation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). This is because the adaptation would decrease the responsiveness of a certain group of neurons that are selectively sensitive to the adapter SF, and this would lead to a change in the overall pRF size, favoring the relatively non-adapted neurons. A simulation of the adaptation effect on pRF size can be found in the shared data repository.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s3-1-1"><title>Participants</title><p>We only scanned the participants who showed a strong SF aftereffect in the behavioural experiment because we were interested in studying the properties of neural populations underlying the perceptual adaptation effect.

Additionally, another participant, represented with the unshaded pink circle in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, was excluded due to an MRI-incompatible metal implant.

One of the adapters consisted of the low SF (0.5 cpd), and the other consisted of the high SF noise images (3.5 cpd), throughout the run. The location of the high and low SF adapters was alternated between left and right visual hemifield in each consecutive run. This way, half of the runs included a high-SF adapter on the left and a low-SF adapter on the right visual hemifield (High-Low or HL runs), and the other half included the opposite configuration (Low-High or LH runs).

During the mapping sequence, mid-SF bars swept the screen step by step, in eight directions. Two blank phases were presented in the middle of eight bar directions and also at the end of the mapping sequence. Each mapping component (bars and blanks) was preceded by a short top-up adaptation stimulus, consistently in all volumes throughout the mapping phase.

We used bar stimuli containing high-contrast noise images with mid-SF (â¼ 1.3 cpd; the geometric mean of the adapter spatial frequencies). The noise images on the bars alternated at 20 Hz. The bars were presented for 0.5 s and preceded by a 0.5 s of top-up adaptation (this makes the effective initial adaptation period 30.5 s). The stimuli were shown within a circular aperture with a diameter of 15Â° that is equal to the height of the display. Bars were also occluded in the unadapted areas via a gray mask. The contours of the bars constituted by the mask or the aperture were smoothed. The width of the bars subtended 1.15Â° of visual angle, unless occluded by the mask. The length also varied due to the mask and the aperture.</p><p>Twenty-five bars that were half-overlapping in width stepped through the screen in 25 s. The visual hemifield was swept by these bars eight times in a run. The first sweep was from bottom to top, and the following sweeps were 45Â° clockwise rotated versions of the previous one. In addition, there were 25 s mean-luminance blocks in the middle and at the end of the eight directions, where instead of a bar, a blank screen followed the top-up adaptations. The runs ended after a second 25 s baseline with nothing but a fixation point shown on a gray background.</p><p>The fixation point was presented at the center of the screen at all times. To measure participantsâ performance in fixating at the center, we changed the fixation color and asked participants to press a key (on an MRI-compatible response box) when the color changed.

High-resolution structural images were collected to project the functional data onto. This was followed by functional runs for pRF mapping; each lasted 5 min 30 s. The total number of pRF runs varied between six to ten across participants but always maintained an even count. This ensured that each participant had an equal number of runs for both HL and LH configurations. The variation in the number of runs arose due to time constraints of the scanning sessions and occasional participant preferences to conclude the session earlier than scheduled.</p><p>The gradient-echo, T2*-weighted pRF mapping scans were acquired with 2.3 mm isotropic voxel size. Scans had a field of view of 221 mm, TR of 1 s, TE of 30ms, flip angle of 62Â°, a rBW of 1680 Hz/pixel, a multiband slice acceleration factor of 3, and an in-plane/parallel imaging acceleration factor of 2.

We corrected motion artifacts using the realign and unwarp module with the default parameters. Then we coregistered the realigned and unwarped functional images to the structural scan. To obtain a surface mesh of the pial and gray-white matter boundaries, the structural images were reconstructed with FreeSurfer (Version 7.1.1).</p><p>Preprocessed functional volumes were projected onto the surface mesh using FreeSurfer.

To quantify the reliability of the visual responsiveness of each vertex, we calculated the noise ceiling. For this, we first correlated the time series of odd and even runs of each condition, then we used the Spearman-Brown prophecy formula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brown, 1910</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Spearman, 1910</xref>) to calculate the reliability of the average of all runs of the same condition. The noise ceiling is achieved by squaring this measure, which gives a maximum achievable goodness of fit for each vertex. The details of these calculations can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Morgan and Schwarzkopf, 2020</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Urale et al., 2022</xref>.</p><p>We then averaged the runs for each condition. This process yielded two hemisphere files for both the HL and the LH adapter conditions. We discarded the volumes that were not pertinent to the pRF estimation, such as the initial adaptation period and the two baselines at the beginning and at the end of the mapping sequence. Finally, the hemispheres from the same adapter condition were combined to produce a single file for the high/low SF adapted condition.</p></sec><sec id="s3-1-5"><title>pRF estimation and region of interest (ROI) identification</title><p>The data analysis was performed using the SamSrf toolbox, version 8.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schwarzkopf, 2021</xref>) in MATLAB 2020b. We generated a binary representation of the bar stimulus at each TR and calculated each voxelâs predicted response to the stimulus from the overlap with the voxelâs modelled pRF profile. Here, the predicted response at each TR was calculated based on the bars (not adapters), because the visual region stimulated by the adapter was the same in all TRs, critically during the blank periods as well. Since the adapters provide a constant source of signal throughout the mapping sequence, their contribution to the signal cancels out over the time series and they cannot be modelled separately.</p><p>We modelled pRFs as two-dimensional Gaussian functions with these free parameters: Cartesian coordinates, <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf20"><mml:mstyle><mml:msub><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mstyle></mml:math><tex-math id="inft20">\begin{document}$  x_{0}$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf21"><mml:mstyle><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mstyle></mml:math><tex-math id="inft21">\begin{document}$  y_{0}$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula>, and the size of the pRF, which is defined as the standard deviation, <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf22"><mml:mstyle><mml:mi>Ï</mml:mi></mml:mstyle></mml:math><tex-math id="inft22">\begin{document}$  \sigma$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula> of the Gaussian function. Convolving the predicted pRF response with the canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF; determined based on previously acquired data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">de Haas et al., 2014</xref>), we predicted the Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) time series for each voxel. To find the optimal pRF parameters that minimize the error between the predicted and empirical BOLD time series, we followed a coarse-to-fine fit approach. First, we generated an extensive search grid with the numerous plausible combinations of the three pRF parameters. The predicted BOLD time series at each point in the search grid was correlated with the observed BOLD time series. The parameters that led to the best correlation were then used in the second stage of the fitting. We used the Nelder-Mead simplex search algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nelder and Mead, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lagarias et al., 1998</xref>) to further refine the parameters.

The median of each eccentricity bin was averaged across participants (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). The difference plots were consistently above zero along almost all eccentricity bins in all visual regions. This indicates that, on average, the median pRF size in the high SF adapted condition was larger than in the low SF adapted condition in all regions and eccentricities.

This makes the regions incomparable in terms of the pRF size change. Therefore, in addition to the absolute pRF size difference shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, we also calculated proportional pRF size difference maps for all participants (Details of this calculation are available in appendix A.2 âProportional pRF size change mapâ). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1âfigure 2</xref> shows the results for a representative participant whose pRF maps were shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.</p><p>Additionally, we tested possible signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio differences between the two conditions and found no consistent difference (see appendix A.3 âSignal to noise ratioâ and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1âfigure 3a</xref> for details).</p><p>The average time series of percent signal change highly matched between conditions.

Although the physical contrasts of the high and low SF adapter stimuli were matched in our study, one may argue that the adapters can possibly change the perceived contrast of the mapping stimuli and that the perceptual contrast differences in the mapping bars could potentially affect pRF sizes. So lastly, to test whether this could influence our results, we conducted another psychophysical experiment. Here we tested if our SF adapters result in a change in perceived contrast, and critically, whether the perceived contrast differs between high and low SF adapter conditions. We used the same SF-filtered adapter stimuli from the fMRI experiment to test their possible effects on the perceived contrast of the subsequently presented mid-SF stimulus.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Twelve participants (seven males, five females; age range: 23â44; <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf46"><mml:mstyle><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle displaystyle="false"><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>30</mml:mn></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math><tex-math id="inft46">\begin{document}$M=30$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula>) with normal or corrected-to-normal vision participated in the experiment.

To familiarize participants with the stimuli and the contrast, a noise image was shown before the experiment. Participants were allowed to interact with the contrast of the image by pressing H and L keys. Then they proceeded to the practice trials when they felt comfortable. Practice trials consisted of 25 trials in which the participants were asked to judge the contrast of the two noise images and report the one with higher contrast. Practice trials were exactly the same as they would appear in the actual experimentâs no-adaptation conditions.</p><p>Similar to the first psychophysical experiment, experimental trials consisted of an adapter (only in the adaptation conditions), a test phase, and a response period. The stimulus sequence of trials is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>. The adapter and the reference noise images were exactly the same images that were used in the fMRI experiment, but presented similar to the first psychophysical experiment. The only difference in this second experiment was that we adaptively altered the contrast of the test stimulus in each trial, instead of the SF. We used two interleaved one-up one-down adaptive staircases. One of the staircases started from low contrast, which was 0.1; the other started from the maximum contrast, 1. Test stimuli were drawn from a set of 360 images: twelve noise images at each of thirty contrast levels (0.01â1.0 in steps of 0.031). The peak SF of these new images was 1.3 c/deg, the same SF as the reference images. Because this experiment aimed to test potential confound in the main experiment, the reference stimulus here always had the maximum contrast of 1, matching that of the mapping stimulus in the fMRI experiment.

Instead, we calculated the PSEs based on the response reversals. After removing the first three reversals, we averaged the contrast levels at each reversal, except for those Â±2 median absolute deviations away from the median. Through visual inspection, we ensured the robustness of this method, which effectively removed transient deviations in the data and eliminated the staircases in which no response reversals were observed.

In this study, we provide novel empirical evidence of this relationship by incorporating an adaptation paradigm into the standard pRF mapping procedure. Recognizing that neural responsiveness to a stimulus feature diminishes after adaptation and that the most substantial change occurs in neurons typically tuned to the adapted feature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Vautin and Berkley, 1977</xref>), we aimed to reduce the sensitivity and response of the high- or low-SF-tuned neuronal populations through adaptation and subsequently estimate pRF sizes.</p><p>Our results demonstrated that adapting to a band-pass SF noise pattern results in (1) a shift in the pRF size distributions in the early visual areas, and (2) a repulsive perceptual SF aftereffect on the subsequently presented pattern. The behavioral effect we found is consistent with previous adaptation studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blakemore and Sutton, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blakemore et al., 1970</xref>). Most importantly, our fMRI experiment showed that in multiple visual regions, ranging from V1 to V3A and V4, the spatial tuning of neuronal populations was sharpened following a low-SF adaptation and broadened after a high-SF adaptation. This provides evidence that population receptive field sizes in the early visual cortical regions are linked to the SF selectivity of visual neurons.</p><p>The relationship we showed between pRF sizes and SF tuning of neuronal populations aligns with early studies that reported a correlation between the preferred SF and classical receptive field size in the animal striate cortex (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">De Valois et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Movshon et al., 1978</xref>). In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Keliris et al., 2019</xref>âs fMRI findings on humans suggested larger/smaller average single-unit receptive field (suRF) sizes for the checkerboard stimuli containing a lower/higher SF pattern, respectively. Importantly (as they also argued) their results are directly comparable to electrophysiology studies because they estimated SF-dependent BOLD response and eliminated spatial scatter of the receptive fields. This is, therefore, distinguished from the regular pRF size measurements, as clearly reflected in their results as well. Although our pRF results are not directly comparable to the suRF sizes or classical neuronal RF sizes, our findings are overall in agreement with such findings.</p><p>Nevertheless, and contrary to our findings, a previous fMRI study has found no evidence of SF-selectivity-dependent pRF size change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Welbourne et al., 2018</xref>). The researchers used stimuli having different chromaticities to estimate pRF sizes, with the hypothesis that the pRF sizes would change as a function of stimulus chromaticity, based on the accumulated research showing different SF tuning profiles for different color-coding pathways (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mullen, 1985</xref>). They found no difference between pRF estimates made with an achromatic luminance-defined grating and with either of two isoluminant chromatic gratings, and suggested that the receptive field size and SF tuning coupling does not hold at the cortical level. In light of the present study, their findings might suggest that the different SF tuning characteristics of wavelength-sensitive neurons of sub-cortical structures might not be preserved in the cortex. Alternatively, the SF-tuning and the pRF size relationship might be present in the achromatic but not the chromatic pathways. However, it is also possible that different chromaticity bars might not differentiate neuronal response, due to a likely effect of spatial attention to the bars. Previous studies established that pRFs could be estimated with occluded as well as illusory contour stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">de Haas and Schwarzkopf, 2018</xref>) and with motion-defined bar stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hughes et al., 2019</xref>). These findings suggest that the responses obtained from the mapping stimuli are dominated by a more complex processing rather than the specific stimulus properties. In the present study, we used the same mapping stimuli between conditions. The difference in the pRF estimations would inherently originate from SF adaptation, which not only showed a strong perceptual effect (psychophysical experiment) but also likely had a robust effect on the responsiveness of the relevant neuronal populations.</p><p>The top-up adaptation duration we used in each trial was short in comparison to some of the previous adaptation studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dragoi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Liu et al., 2007</xref>; but also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pavan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tsouli et al., 2021</xref> for other examples of sub-second adaptation to visual stimuli). Although this brief adaptation was enough to yield a strong perceptual effect behaviorally, it might raise questions about whether the observed pRF size change can possibly be related to such a short adaptation. In this regard, an alternative consideration could be that the cortical activation for the adapter and the mapping stimuli mesh together and result in distinct pRF measurements due to the possible disruptive effect of the top-up stimuli, instead of serving as adapters. Such an explanation, which rules out the adaptation effect, would not predict a decreased sensitivity of a certain group of SF selective neurons. Correspondingly, the pRF size estimations would be shifted towards the receptive field properties of the neurons selectively responding to the SF of the adapters. This scenario would predict larger pRFs in the low-SF condition and smaller pRFs in the high-SF condition, opposite to our findings. Therefore, our findings cannot be explained by such an interaction between top-up adapters and the mapping stimuli.</p><p>In addition, although the top-up adaptations in each trial were brief, it can be postulated that the effects of adaptation presented at each volume accumulate throughout the mapping sequence in our pRF experiment. This accumulation occurs because the entire visual field we measured was consistently stimulated by the adaptation stimuli, while the mapping stimulus only covered a small portion in any given trial, and it varied in size and location throughout the run. This design ensured that the effective adaptation duration consistently exceeded that of a single top-up presentation. Consequently, it can also be inferred that the adaptation effect in our fMRI experiment was likely more pronounced than what we quantified behaviorally. This inference is supported by the fact that, in the psychophysical experiment, the test stimulus consistently overlaid the same region as the adapter in every trial. Conversely, in the fMRI experiment, the confined area of the mapping bars allowed for an uninterrupted buildup of the adaptation effect across most of the visual field.</p><p>We also considered other possible confounding effects of the two SF adapter stimuli on the pRF measurements. The first of which is about the SNR. Previous work has shown that using a mapping stimulus that derives response from only a subset of neurons in a voxel results in lower SNRs and smaller pRFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yildirim et al., 2018</xref>). Both SF adapters in the present study presumably decreased the responsiveness of certain neurons within a voxel, which leads the responses to be based on a subset of neurons. If this generates disproportionate SNR changes between the two conditions, specifically lower SNR in the low-SF adapted condition, pRF size decrease in the low-SF adapted condition can possibly be attributed to the SNR differences. However, our supplementary analyses showed that this is not a concern for our pRF results. Both percent signal change time series and noise ceiling data from each vertex indicate similar SNR between the conditions.</p><p>The second considered point was about perceived contrast. Our control experiment demonstrated that the observed differences between the two adaptation conditions cannot be attributed to differences in perceived contrast. Previous research has indicated that SF adaptation increases the detection threshold of same-SF test stimuli viewed subsequently, with this effect gradually fading for test SFs that are increasingly different from the adapted SF, until the difference reaches 2 octaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Snowden and Hammett, 1996</xref>). The SF we employed in our mapping stimuli falls within this reported range for both adapters, so it is reasonable to expect the perceived contrast for the mapping stimuli to be reduced under both adaptation conditions. This expectation is consistent with our supplementary analyses (See appendix Perceived contrast change after SF adaptation). Nevertheless, this perceptual deviation from the actual contrast crucially cannot account for any differences between the two adaptation conditions when the perceived contrast change is identical under both adapter conditions. Our data suggests there was no difference in perceived contrast between the high- and low-SF-adapted conditions, likely because the SF of the two adapters was equivalently distant in log space from the SF of the mapping stimuli.</p><p>While the perceived contrast following the two adapters showed no differences, a noteworthy difference was observed in the SF aftereffect. The magnitude of the perceptual aftereffect was higher after the high SF adapter, as compared to that after the low SF adapter. Similar asymmetries in bidirectional aftereffects were also reported by previous studies on SF adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blakemore et al., 1970</xref>), as well as other visual adaptations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Aulet and Lourenco, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altan and Boyaci, 2020</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blakemore et al., 1970</xref>, for example, reported that the perceptual SF shifts after low-SF adapters (between 1.5 and 3 cpd in their study) were not symmetric around the adapter SFs and were overall weaker than those after mid- and high-SF adapters. Although the reason is unclear, we speculate that it might be related to the relative locations of the adapter SFs on the contrast sensitivity function. While the adapter stimuli we used had SFs that were equally distant from the test SF in log space, they would not have equal contrast sensitivities, and the SF of the test stimuli we used did not correspond to the peak of contrast sensitivity function. This might, in turn, result in different levels of the perceptual aftereffect. Alternatively, it could also be related to possible variations in bandwidth and overlap of the SF channels.</p><p>It is plausible to expect a similar pattern between perceptual effect and pRF size change, so an equivalent asymmetry might also be present for pRF size changes caused by different adapters. However, we are unable to test this with the present data, because our experimental design only included high- and low-SF adaptation conditions (no neutral condition) to maximize scan time for each condition. Future studies could isolate the effect of each adapter stimulus by adding a neutral condition such as without adaptation or with an adapter stimulus having the same SF as the mapping stimulus. Such a design would probably require multiple scanning sessions per participant, or maximizing the SNR by using a higher magnetic field strength. Our data also do not allow for reliable detection of the relationship between behavioral results and the pRF size change. There are two reasons for this. First, we deliberately excluded participants who did not show a strong perceptual effect, and second, we had a relatively small sample size to test such a link.</p><p>Overall, our findings, specifically spatial tuning alteration after SF adaptation, may provide insight for various domains of visual processing, including texture segmentation, cortical limits of acuity, size perception, and numerosity perception. For instance, previous research has demonstrated that adaptation to a specific SF can influence the performance accuracy in a texture segmentation task â a task that is highly interrelated with spatial resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Carrasco et al., 2006</xref>). The performance of detecting a sub-texture consisting of oriented lines that are different from its surroundings has been shown to be highest in mid-peripheral locations, while relatively low in central and more peripheral locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kehrer, 1989</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Carrasco et al., 2006</xref> suggested that this performance variation depending on the stimulus location is due to the systematic decrease in spatial resolution (or increase in average receptive field sizes) as a function of eccentricity. They hypothesized that the detection of the texture stimulus they used would not benefit from neurons having too small (central) or too large (peripheral) receptive fields due to the scale of the texture, and thus SF adaptation would influence the performance. They found that high-SF adaptation eliminated the central performance drop. The rationale was that the high-SF adaptation would decrease the central spatial resolution, which would make it closer to the optimal spatial tuning for the task and consequently increase the task performance in central locations. Our finding provides empirical support for their explanation and aligns well with their results, showing the dynamic nature of spatial tuning in the visual field and indicating the relationship between SF tuning and spatial resolution.</p><p>Similarly, attenuating the responsiveness of neuronal populations that are irrelevant to the task can also benefit acuity. Previous work has suggested that adapting to visual stimuli with high temporal frequency (fast flicker) decreases the contribution from the magnocellular pathway that has high temporal and low spatial tuning and consequently results in an improvement in acuity due to the change in overall spatial sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arnold et al., 2016</xref>). Also, it has been shown that adaptation to receding and looming motion results in an improvement in acuity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tagoh et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lages et al., 2017</xref>). These findings are akin to relief from short-sightedness after some time without wearing spectacles, which can be explained by blur adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mon-Williams et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Elliott et al., 2011</xref>), and they all convergingly suggest that decreased sensitivity of certain neuronal populations via adaptation can improve access to high-SF information which would result in an enhanced acuity. Relatedly, a decrease in the receptive field sizes of neuronal populations should also accompany this change.</p><p>Furthermore, recent psychophysical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bonn and Odic, 2024</xref>), imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Paul et al., 2022</xref>), and computational (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dakin et al., 2011</xref>) studies presented the key role of SF in numerosity encoding. Notably, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bonn and Odic, 2024</xref> have demonstrated that adaptation to SFs led to various degrees of numerosity underestimation, with the largest effect observed following low-SF adaptation. This finding suggests a potential reliance of numerosity perception on neuronal populations characterized by larger receptive fields, which are more prevalent in peripheral vision. Consistent with this, their experiments also revealed that the cross-adaptation effect was evident in peripheral vision, but not in central vision.</p><p>Moreover, our results can provide additional insight into the relevance of SF channels for visual size perception. It has been proposed that some size illusions can be attributed to the SF-tuned channels in the visual system, with a particular emphasis on the role of low-SF tuned units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Carrasco et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Carrasco et al., 1986</xref> reported that the strength of the Muller-Lyer illusion was diminished significantly after adapting to a low-SF grating and accordingly suggested that the illusory size perception occurs due to the low-SF components of the Muller-Lyer stimuli. However, this explanation has been challenged by several other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Carlson et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Larsen and Goldstein, 1994</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Carlson et al., 1984</xref>, for instance, modified the Muller-Lyer illusion so that the lines were replaced by a sequence of dots. The dots were either white dots that predominantly contained low spatial frequencies or luminance-balanced dots that contained predominantly high spatial frequencies. Even though the two types of stimuli considerably differed from each other, particularly at low spatial frequencies, they found no difference in the illusion magnitude between them. It is possible that the low-SF adaptation of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Carrasco et al., 1986</xref> resulted in a decreased sensitivity of a neuronal group that has relatively large receptive fields and that apparently played a key role in perceiving the illusory stimulus possibly due to the scale of the stimulus. Decreased level of activation of certain neuronal populations should be the main reason for the diminished perceptual effect, instead of the certain SF components of the stimuli. This view would not predict any difference in the illusion magnitudes of the SF-modified Muller-Lyer stimulus as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Carlson et al., 1984</xref> study, because the overall stimuli in both conditions would still activate the relevant large receptive field neurons with intact sensitivity.</p><p>In conclusion, we investigated the effect of SF adaptation on the spatial tuning of neuronal populations in the early visual regions. We showed that pRF sizes after high-SF adaptation were overall larger (i.e. more coarsely tuned) than those observed after low-SF adaptation. The effect was consistent between participants and also between the visual regions tested. This is evidence of a direct relationship between SF tuning and spatial resolution of the neuronal populations in humans, which could modulate downstream visual processing.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s6"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Project administration, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Project administration, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Resources, Funding acquisition, Writing â review and editing, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Investigation, Methodology, Writing â review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>The protocols and procedures were approved by the University of Auckland Human Participants Ethics Committee (reference 024231).

Remaining vertices were averaged within each ROI, and the time courses for both conditions were plotted for all participants. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1âfigure 3a</xref> shows the time courses in each ROI, averaged across participants. A visual inspection of the figure suggests that the signal amplitudes from the two adaptation conditions highly match, especially during the pRF mapping sequence.</p><p>The figure shows small differences between the two conditions during the adaptation periods. We believe this is because of the different spatial frequency content of the adapter stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Singh et al., 2000</xref>. Besides, slight differences during the initial and the final baseline periods are likely to be due to the overall signal modulations with regard to the variations in signal to the visual stimulation relative to that to the baseline. However, these small differences before and after the mapping sequence are not likely to have an effect on our results.</p><p>Since the noise ceiling, the maximum achievable goodness-of-fit, is also indicative of the signal-to-noise ratio, we also compared noise ceiling values in two conditions along the eccentricity axis. To do so, we binned the noise ceiling data into 100 1Â° wide eccentricity bins using a sliding window approach. We used the average of the two conditions for eccentricity selection. Median values of each bin were calculated for both conditions and averaged across participants. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1âfigure 3b</xref> represents the average noise ceiling data from the two SF adaptation conditions (red: high SF; blue: low SF) as well as the difference between the noise ceiling values (black), binned into eccentricity bands. Overall, the noise ceiling plots across eccentricity are similar between the two conditions. The black line, the difference between the conditions, is consistently close to zero with an exception in central V1. The noise ceiling in central V1, which mostly consists of smaller pRFs, is larger in the high SF adaptation condition than in the low SF adaptation condition. Although the reason behind this difference is unclear, it does not follow the pRF size change we observed in this region and, therefore, cannot account for our main findings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s9-4"><title>A.4 Vertex thresholding</title><p>After filtering out the artifactual vertices and the vertices with a low goodness-of-fit, we did not apply further removal of vertices from our analyses, as explained in the main text.

Both tests showed very robust effects when tested with various prior distribution (Cauchy) widths. Results indicate a clear decrease in perceived contrast as a result of SF adaptation, which is consistent with the literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Snowden and Hammett, 1996</xref>.</p><p>However, the magnitude of these effects should be interpreted with caution because our experiment was not designed to answer this question and therefore is suboptimal for testing the magnitude of perceived contrast shift after adaptation. Given that the reference stimulus had a maximum contrast level of 100%, and the test stimulus could not exceed this limit, any random key presses when both stimuli had equivalent contrast would lead to a small but artificial decrease in the measured perceived contrast. This decrease would be roughly half of the smallest step size, which is 0.05 as clearly observable in the no-adaptation condition in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>. Even though this artificial decrease should not necessarily influence the individual SF adaptation conditions âgiven that the perceived contrasts under these conditions are considerably distant from the point where the reference and test stimuli are equalâ the applied bias correction would introduce a minor impact.</p></sec></sec></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="editor-report" id="sa0"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.100734.3.sa0</article-id><title-group><article-title>eLife Assessment</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Carrasco</surname><given-names>Marisa</given-names></name><role specific-use="editor">Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>New York University</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="evidence-strength"><kwd>Solid</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="claim-importance"><kwd>Valuable</kwd></kwd-group></front-stub><body><p>This well-designed study combining psychophysical and fMRI data presents a <bold>valuable</bold> finding regarding how adaptation alters spatial frequency processing in the cortex.

In particular, the deposition of the paper's data has allowed me to probe and refine several of my previous concerns. While I still have major concerns about how the data are presented in the current draft of the manuscript, my skepticism about data quality overall has been much alleviated. Note that this review focuses almost exclusively on the fMRI data as I was satisfied with the quality of the psychophysical data and analyses in my previous review.</p><p>Major Concerns</p><p>(I) Statistical Analysis</p><p>In my previous review, I raised the concern that the small sample size combined with the noisiness of the fMRI data, a lack of clarity about some of the statistics, and a lack of code/data likely combine to make this paper difficult or impossible to reproduce as it stands. The authors have since addressed several aspects of this concern, most importantly by depositing their data. However their response leaves some major questions, which I detail below.</p><p>First of all, the authors claim in their response to the previous review that the small sample size is not an issue because large samples are not necessary to obtain &quot;conclusive&quot; results. They are, of course, technically correct that a small sample size can yield significant results, but the response misses the point entirely. In fact, small samples are more likely than large samples to erroneously yield a significant result (Button et al., 2013, DOI:10.1038/nrn3475), especially when noise is high. The response by the authors cites Schwarzkopf &amp; Huang (2024) to support their methods on this front. After reading the paper, I fail to see how it is at all relevant to the manuscript at hand or the criticism raised in the previous review. Schwarzkopf &amp; Huang propose a statistical framework that is narrowly tailored to situations where one is already certain that some phenomenon (like the adaptation of pRF size to spatial frequency) either always occurs or never occurs. Such a framework is invalid if one cannot be certain that, for example, pRF size adapts in 98% of people but not the remaining 2%. Even if the paper were relevant to the current study, the authors don't cite this paper, use its framework, or admit the assumptions it requires in the current manuscript. The observation that a small dataset can theoretically lead to significance under a set of assumptions not appropriate for the current manuscript is not a serious response to the concern that this manuscript may not be reproducible.</p><p>To overcome this concern, the authors should provide clear descriptions of their statistical analyses and explanations of why these analyses are appropriate for the data. Ideally, source code should be published that demonstrates how the statistical tests were run on the published data. (I was unable to find any such source code in the OSF repository.) If the effects in the paper were much stronger, this level of rigor might not be strictly necessary, but the data currently give the impression of being right near the boundary of significance, and the manuscript's analyses needs to reflect that. The descriptions in the text were helpful, but I was only able to approximately reproduce the authors analyses based on these descriptions alone. Specifically, I attempted to reproduce the Mood's median tests described in the second paragraph of section 3.2 after filtering the data based on the criteria described in the final paragraph of section 3.1. I found that 7/8 (V1), 7/8 (V2), 5/8 (V3), 5/8 (V4), and 4/8 (V3A) subjects passed the median test when accounting for the (40) multiple comparisons. These results are reasonably close to those reported in the manuscript and might just differ based on the multiple comparisons strategy used (which I did not find documented in the manuscript). However, Mood's median test does not test the direction of the difference-just whether the medians are different-so I additionally required that the median sigma of the high-adapted pRFs be greater than that of the low-adapted pRFs. Surprisingly, in V1 and V3, one subject each (not the same subject) failed this part of the test, meaning that they had significant differences between conditions but in the wrong direction. This leaves 6/8 (V1), 7/8 (V2), 4/8 (V3), 5/8 (V4), and 4/8 (V3A) subjects that appear to support the authors' conclusions. As the authors mention, however, this set of analyses runs the risk of comparing different parts of cortex, so I also performed Wilcox signed-rank tests on the (paired) vertex data for which both the high-adapted and low-adapted conditions passed all the authors' stated thresholds. These results largely agreed with the median test (only 5/8 subjects significant in V1 but 6/8 in in V3A, other areas the same, though the two tests did not always agree which subjects had significant differences). These analyses were of course performed by a reviewer with a reviewer's time commitment to the project and shouldn't be considered a replacement for the authors' expertise with their own data. If the authors think that I have made a mistake in these calculations, then the best way to refute them would be to publish the source code they used to threshold the data and to perform the same tests.</p><p>Setting aside the precise values of the relevant tests, we should also consider whether 5 of 8 subjects showing a significant effect (as they report for V3, for example) should count as significant evidence of the effect? If one assumes, as a null hypothesis, that there is no difference between the two conditions in V3 and that all differences are purely noise, then a binomial test across subjects would be appropriate. Even if 6 of 8 subjects show the effect, however (and ignoring multiple comparisons), the p-value of a one-sided binomial test is not significant at the 0.05 level (7 of 8 subjects is barely significant). Of course, a more rigorous way to approach this question could be something like an ANOVA, and the authors use an ANOVA analysis of the medians in the paragraph following their use of Mood's median test. However, ANOVA assumes normality, and the authors state in the previous paragraph that they employed Mood's median test because &quot;the distribution of the pRF sizes is zero-bounded and highly skewed&quot; so this choice does not make sense. The Central Limits Theorem might be applied to the medians in theory, but with only 8 subjects and with an underlying distribution of pRF sizes that is non-negative, the relevant data will almost certainly not be normally distributed. These tests should probably be something like a Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA on ranks.</p><p>All of the above said, my intuition about the data is currently that there are significant changes to the adapted pRF size in V2. I am not currently convinced that the effects in other visual areas are significant, and I suspect that the paper would be improved if authors abandoned their claims that areas other than V2 show a substantial effect. Importantly, I don't think this causes the paper to lose any impact-in fact, if the authors agree with my assessments, then the paper might be improved by focusing on V2. Specifically, the authors' already discuss psychophysical work related to the perception of texture on pages 18 and 19 and link it to their results. V2 is also implicated in the perception of texture (see, for example, Freeman et al., 2013; DOI:10.1038/nn.3402; Ziemba et al., 2016, DOI:10.1073/pnas.1510847113; Ziemba et al., 2019; DOI:10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1743-19.2019) and so would naturally be the part of the visual cortex where one might predict that spatial frequency adaptation would have a strong effect on pRF size. This neatly connects the psychophysical and imaging sides of this project and could make a very nice story out of the present work.</p><p>(II) Visualizations</p><p>The manuscript's visual evidence regarding the pRF data also remains fairly weak (but I found the pRF size comparisons in the OSF repository and Figure S1 to be better evidence-more in the next paragraph). The first line of the Results section still states, &quot;A visual inspection on the pRF size maps in Figure 4c clearly shows a difference between the two conditions, which is evident in all regions.&quot; As I mentioned in my previous review, I don't agree with this claim (specifically, that it is clear). My impression when I look at these plots is of similarity between the maps, and, where there is dissimilarity, of likely artifacts. For example, the splotch of cortex near the upper vertical meridian (ventral boundary) of V1 that shows up in yellow in the upper plot but not the lower plot also has a weirdly high eccentricity and a polar angle near the opposite vertical meridian: almost certainly not the actual tuning of that patch of cortex. If this is the clearest example subject in the dataset, then the effect looks to me to be very small and inconsistently distributed across the visual areas. That said, I'm not convinced that the problem here is the data-rather, I think it's just very hard to communicate a small difference in parameter tuning across a visual area using this kind of side-by-side figure. I think that Figure S2, though noisy (as pRF maps typically are), is more convincing than Figure 4c, personally. For what it's worth, when looking at the data myself, I found that plotting log(ð(H) / ð(L)), which will be unstable when noise causes ð(H) or ð(L) to approach zero, was less useful than plotting plotting (ð(H) - ð(L)) / (ð(H) + ð(L)). This latter quantity will be constrained between -1 and 1 and shows something like a proportional change in the pRF size (and thus should be more comparable across eccentricity).</p><p>In my opinion, the inclusion of the pRF size comparison plots in the OSF repository and Figure S1 made a stronger case than any of the plots of the cortical surface. I would suggest putting these on log-log plots since the distribution of pRF size (like eccentricity) is approximately exponential on the cortical surface. As-is, it's clear in many plots that there is a big splotch of data in the compressed lower left corner, but it's hard to get a sense for how these should be compared to the upper right expanse of the plots. It is frequently hard to tell whether there is a greater concentration of points above or below the line of equality in the lower left corner as well, and this is fairly central to the paper's claims. My intuition is that the upper right is showing relatively little data (maybe 10%?), but these data are very emphasized by the current plots.The authors might even want to consider putting a collection of these scatter-plots (or maybe just subject 007, or possible all subjects' pRFs on a single scatter-plot) in the main paper and using these visualizations to provide intuitive supporting for the main conclusions about the fMRI data (where the manuscript currently use Figure 4c for visual intuition).</p><p>Minor Comments</p><p>(1) Although eLife does not strictly require it, I would like to see more of the authors' code deposited along with the data (especially the code for calculating the statistics that were mentioned above). I do appreciate the simulation code that the authors added in the latest submission (largely added in response to my criticism in the previous reviews), and I'll admit that it helped me understand where the authors were coming from, but it also contains a bug and thus makes a good example of why I'd like to see more of the authors' code. If we set aside the scientific question of whether the simulation is representative of an fMRI voxel (more in Minor Comment 5, below), Figures 1A and the &quot;AdaptaionEffectSimulated.png&quot; file from the repository (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/d5agf">https://osf.io/d5agf</ext-link>) imply that only small RFs were excluded in the high-adapted condition and only large RFs were excluded in the low-adapted condition. However, the script provided (SimlatePrfAdaptation.m: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/u4d2h">https://osf.io/u4d2h</ext-link>) does not do this. Lines 7 and 8 of the script set the small and large cutoffs at the 30th and 70th percentiles, respectively, then exclude everything greater than the 30th percentile in the &quot;Large RFs adapted out&quot; condition (lines 19-21) and exclude anything less than the 70th percentile in the &quot;Small RFs adapted out&quot; condition (lines 27-29). So the figures imply that they are representing 70% of the data but they are in fact representing only the most extreme 30% of the data. (Moreover, I was unable to run the script because it contains hard-coded paths to code in someone's home directory.) Just to be clear, these kinds of bugs are quite common in scientific code, and this bug was almost certainly an honest mistake.</p><p>(2) I also noticed that the individual subject scatter-plots of high versus low adapted pRF sizes on the OSF seem to occasionally have a large concentration of values on the x=0 and y=0 axes. This isn't really a big deal in the plots, but the manuscript states that &quot;we denoised the pRF data to remove artifactual vertices where at least one of the following criteria was met: (1) sigma values were equal to or less than zero ...&quot; so I would encourage the authors to double-check that the rest of their analysis code was run with the stated filtering.</p><p>(3) The manuscript also says that the median test was performed &quot;on the raw pRF size values&quot;. I'm not really sure what the &quot;raw&quot; means here. Does this refer to pRF sizes without thresholding applied?</p><p>(4) The eccentricity data are much clearer now with the additional comments from the authors and the full set of maps; my concerns about this point have been met.</p><p>(5) Regarding the simulation of RFs in a voxel (setting aside the bug), I will admit both to hoping for a more biologically-grounded situation and to nonetheless understanding where the authors are coming from based on the provided example. What I mean by biologically-grounded: something like, assume a 2.5-mm isotropic voxel aligned to the surface of V1 at 4{degree sign} of eccentricity; the voxel would span X to Y degrees of eccentricity, and we predict Z neurons with RFs in this voxel with a distribution of RF sizes at that eccentricity from [reference], etc. eventually demonstrating a plausible pRF size change commensurate to the paper's measurements. I do think that a simulation like this would make the paper more compelling, but I'll acknowledge that it probably isn't necessary and might be beyond the scope here.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.100734.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>This is a well-designed study examining an important, surprisingly understudied question: how does adaptation affect spatial frequency processing in human visual cortex? Using a combination of psychophysics and neuroimaging, the authors test the hypothesis that spatial frequency tuning is shifted to higher or lower frequencies, depending on preadapted state (low or high s.f. adaptation). They do so by first validating the phenomenon psychophysically, showing that adapting to 0.5 cpd stimuli causes an increase perceived s.f., and 3.5 cpd causes a relative decrease in perceived s.f. Using the same stimuli, they then port these stimuli to a neuroimaging study, in which population receptive fields are measured under high and low spatial frequency adaptation states. They find that adaptation changes pRF size, depending on adaptation state: adapting to high s.f. led to broader overall pRF sizes across early visual cortex, whereas adapting to low s.f. led to smaller overall pRF sizes. Finally the authors carry out a control experiment to psychophysically rule out the possibility that the perceived contrast change w/ adaptation may have given rise to these imaging results (doesn't appear to be the case). All in all, I found this to be a good manuscript: the writing is taut, and the study is well designed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.100734.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Altan</surname><given-names>Ecem</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Auckland</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Auckland</named-content></addr-line><country>New Zealand</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Morgan</surname><given-names>Catherine A</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Auckland</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Auckland</named-content></addr-line><country>New Zealand</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Dakin</surname><given-names>Steven C</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>The University of Auckland</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Auckland</named-content></addr-line><country>New Zealand</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Schwarzkopf</surname><given-names>Dietrich Samuel</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Auckland</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Auckland</named-content></addr-line><country>New Zealand</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their careful evaluation and positive comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Adaptation paradigm</p><p>âwhy is it necessary to use an *adaptation* paradigm to study the link between SF tuning and pRF estimation? Couldn't you just use pRF bar stimuli with varying SFs?â</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this question. First, by using adaptation we can infer the correspondence between the perceptual and the neuronal adaptation to spatial frequency. We couldnât draw any inference about perception if we only varied the SF inside the bar. More importantly, while changing the SF inside the bar might help drive different neuronal populations, this is not guaranteed. As we touched on in our discussion, responses obtained from the mapping stimuli are dominated by complex processing rather than the stimulus properties alone. A considerable proportion of the retinotopic mapping signal is probably simply due to spatial attention to the bar (de Haas &amp; Schwarzkopf, 2018; Hughes et al., 2019). So, adaptation is a more targeted way to manipulate different neuronal populations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other pRF estimates: polar angle and eccentricity</p></disp-quote><p>We included an additional plot showing the polar angle for both adapter conditions (Figure S4), as well as participant-wise scatter plots comparing raw pRF size, eccentricity, and polar angle between two adapter conditions (available in shared data repository). In line with previous work on the reliability of pRF estimates (van Dijk, de Haas, Moutsiana, &amp; Schwarzkopf, 2016; Senden, Reithler, Gijsen, &amp; Goebel, 2014), both polar angle and eccentricity maps are very stable between the two adaptation conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Variability in pRF size change</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer pointed out, the pRF size changes show some variability across eccentricities, and ROIs (Figure 5A and 5B). It is likely that the variability could relate to the varying tuning properties of different regions and eccentricities for the specific SF we used in the mapping stimulus. So one reason V2 is most consistent could be that the stimulus is best matched for the tuning there. However, what factors contribute to this variability is an interesting question that will require further study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other recommendations</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed the other recommendations of the reviewer with one exception.

We changed this figure to avoid such confusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Theoretical explanation of adaptation effect</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewerâs explanation for how adaptation should affect the size of pRF averaging across individual RFs is incorrect. When selecting RFs from a fixed range of semi-uniformly distributed positions (as in an fMRI voxel), the average position of RFs (corresponding to pRF position) is naturally near the center of this range. The average size (corresponding to pRF size) reflects the visual field coverage of these individual RFs. This aggregate visual field coverage thus also reflects the individual sizes. When large RFs have been adapted out, this means the visual field coverage at the boundaries is sparser, and the aggregate pRF is therefore smaller. The opposite happens when adapting out the contribution of small RFs. We demonstrate this with a simple simulation at this OSF link: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/ebnky/">https://osf.io/ebnky/</ext-link>. The pRF size of the simulated voxels illustrate the adaptation effect should manifest precisely as we hypothesized.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure S2</p></disp-quote><p>It is not actually possible to compare R<sup>2</sup> between regions by looking at Figure S2 because it shows the pRF size change, not R<sup>2</sup>. Therefore, the arguments Reviewer #2 made based on their interpretation of the figure are not valid. Just as the reviewer expected, V1 is one of the brain regions with good pRF model fits. We included normalized and raw R<sup>2</sup> maps to make this more obvious to the readers.</p><p>V1 appeared essentially empty in that plot primarily due to the sigma threshold we selected, which was unintentionally more conservative than those applied in our analyses and other figures. We apologize for this mistake. We corrected it in the revised version by including a plot with the appropriate sigma threshold.</p><p>Thresholding details</p><p>Thresholding information was included in our original manuscript; however, we included more information in the figure captions to make it more obvious.</p><p>2D plots replaced histograms</p><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. The original manuscript contained histograms showing the distribution of pRF size for both adaptation conditions for each participant and visual area (Figure S1). However, we agree that 2D plots better communicate the difference in pRF parameters between conditions. So we moved the histogram plots to the online repository, and included scatter plots with a color scheme revealing the 2D kernel density.</p><p>We chose to implement 2D kernel density in scatter plots to display the distribution of individual pRF sizes transparently.</p><p>(proportional) pRF size-change map</p><p>The reviewer requests pRF size difference maps. Figure S2 in fact demonstrates the proportional difference between the pRF sizes of the two adaptation conditions. Instead of simply taking the difference, we believe showing the proportional change map is more sensible because overall pRF size varies considerably between visual regions. We explained this more clearly in our revision.</p><p>pRF eccentricity plot</p><p>âI suspect that the difference in PRF size across voxels correlates very strongly with the difference in eccentricity across voxels.â</p><p>Our original manuscript already contained a supplementary plot (Figure S4 B, now Figure S4 C) comparing the eccentricity between adapter conditions, showing no notable shift in eccentricities except in V3A - but that is a small region and the results are generally more variable. In addition, we included participant-wise plots in the online repository, presenting raw comparisons of pRF size, eccentricity, and polar angle estimates between adaptation conditions. These 2D plots provide further evidence that the SF adapters resulted in a change in pRF size, while eccentricity and polar angle estimates did not show consistent differences.</p><p>To the reviewerâs point, even if there were an appreciable shift in eccentricity between conditions (as they suggest may have happened for the example participant we showed), this does not mean that the pRF size effect is âdue [...] to shifts in eccentricity.â Parameters in a complex multi-dimensional model like the pRF are not independent. There is no way of knowing whether a change in one parameter is causally linked with a change in another. We can only report the parameter estimates the model produces.</p><p>In fact, it is conceivable that adaptation causes both: changes in pRF size <italic>and</italic> eccentricity. If more central or peripheral RFs tend to have smaller or larger RFs, respectively, then adapting out one part of the distribution will shift the average accordingly. However, as we already established, we find no compelling evidence that pRF eccentricity changes dramatically due to adaptation, while pRF size does.</p><p>Other recommendations</p><p>We have addressed the other recommendations of the reviewer, except for the y-axis alignment. Different regions in the visual hierarchy naturally vary substantially in pRF size. Aligning axes would therefore lead to incorrect visual inferences that (1) the absolute pRF sizes between ROIs are comparable, and (2) higher regions show the effect most</p><p>prominently. However, for clarity, we now note this scale difference in our figure captions. Finally, as mentioned earlier, we also present a proportional pRF size change map to enable comparison of the adaptation effect between regions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>pRF model</p></disp-quote><p>Top-up adapters were not modelled in our analyses because they are shared events in all TRs, critically also including the âblankâ periods, providing a constant source of signal. Therefore modelling them separately cannot meaningfully change the results. However, the reviewer makes a good suggestion that it would be useful to mention this in the manuscript, so we added a discussion of this point in Section 3.1.5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>pRF size vs eccentricity</p></disp-quote><p>We added a plot showing pRF size in the two adaptation conditions (in addition to the pRF size difference) as a function of eccentricity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Correlation with behavioral effect</p></disp-quote><p>In the original manuscript, we pointed out why the correlation between the magnitude of the behavioral effect and the pRF size change is not an appropriate test for our data. First, the reviewer is right that a larger sample size would be needed to reliably detect such a between-subject correlation. More importantly, as per our recruitment criteria for the fMRI experiment, we did not scan participants showing weak perceptual effects. This limits the variability in the perceptual effect and makes correlation inapplicable.</p></body></sub-article></article>
