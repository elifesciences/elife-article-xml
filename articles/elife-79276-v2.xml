Here, we addressed how neurons from different stem cell lineages wire with each other to form a specific circuit motif. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae, we combined developmental genetics (twin-spot mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker, multi-color flip out, permanent labeling) with circuit analysis (calcium imaging, connectomics, network science). For many lineages, neuronal progeny are organized into subunits called temporal cohorts. Temporal cohorts are subsets of neurons born within a tight time window that have shared circuit-level function. We find sharp transitions in patterns of input connectivity at temporal cohort boundaries. In addition, we identify a feed-forward circuit that encodes the onset of vibration stimuli. This feed-forward circuit is assembled by preferential connectivity between temporal cohorts from different lineages. Connectivity does not follow the often-cited early-to-early, late-to-late model. Instead, the circuit is formed by sequential addition of temporal cohorts from different lineages, with circuit output neurons born before circuit input neurons. Further, we generate new tools for the fly community. Our data raise the possibility that sequential addition of neurons (with outputs oldest and inputs youngest) could be one fundamental strategy for assembling feed-forward circuits.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The nervous system of an animal consists of complex arrangements of nerve cells or neurons. These arrangements are called neuronal circuits, and they contain both input and output neurons. Input neurons sense signals, such as external cues, and output neurons pass these signals on to the brain, for example. The nerve cells in a circuit connect to each other through so-called synapses in specific patterns. Neuronal circuits first assemble during the development of an animal. The assembly process starts when a nerve stem cell divides and gives rise to more specialized neurons, its progeny.</p><p>A lot of what we know about neuronal circuit assembly comes from studying the nerve cord of fruit fly larva, which shares many features with the spinal cord of vertebrates. Previous studies had used experimental techniques to trace, or follow, the fate of the progeny of specific nerve stem cells. These approaches provided information about which nerve stem cells contribute to which neuronal circuits. However, major questions in developmental neurobiology remain about how exactly these neuronal circuits assemble. For example, it was not clear in what order input and output neurons build a circuit.</p><p>Here Wang, Wreden et al. took a different approach by starting with a specific circuit in the fruit fly nerve cord – a circuit that detects vibrations – and looking for the stem cells contributing to that circuit. Using a number of techniques, Wang, Wreden et al. determined when particular nerve cells were ‘born’, what they looked like, and what other nerve cells they formed synapses with.</p><p>Although nerve stem cells gave rise to many different neurons during development, those neurons did not change gradually over time. Instead, neurons were born in short bursts, and those in the same ‘temporal cohort’ were similar to each other, while neurons in different cohorts were different. The neuronal circuit that detects vibrations assembled itself from three temporal cohorts of neurons coming from different stem cells. The output neurons, which send information from the nerve cord to the brain, were born before the input neurons, which detect vibrations in the surroundings.</p><p>All in all, these experiments offer more detailed insights into how neuronal circuits assemble during development. The study also provides experimental resources for other scientists working with fruit flies, and poses new research questions for developmental biologists studying vertebrates.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neuroblast</kwd><kwd>somatosensation</kwd><kwd>lineage</kwd><kwd>connectomics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS105748</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heckscher</surname><given-names>Ellie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY022338</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>MacLean</surname><given-names>Jason</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 HD044164</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marshall</surname><given-names>Zarion D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DGE-1746045</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meng</surname><given-names>Julia L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A newly identified pattern of circuit assembly shows connectivity between small groups of neurons born in tight time windows from different stem cells, with outputs from one lineage born before inputs from other lineages.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neuronal circuits are the fundamental functional units of the nervous system, and neuronal stem cell lineages are the fundamental developmental units. Determining lineage–circuit relationships is essential for deciphering the developmental logic of circuit assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Meng and Heckscher, 2021</xref>). So far, lineage–circuit relationships have been described in an ad hoc, lineage-by-lineage basis in a handful of model circuits. For example, in the vertebrate neocortex, excitatory neurons from a single stem cell preferentially populate individual neocortical microcolumns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yu et al., 2009a</xref>). In the vertebrate hippocampus, excitatory neurons from a single stem cell share input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). In the insect visual system, synchronous production of neurons from a single stem cell underlies the retinotopy of direction-selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pinto-Teixeira et al., 2018</xref>). Together, these studies demonstrate that lineage–circuit relationships differ depending on circuit anatomy. However, it remains unknown how neurons from different stem cell lineages wire with each other to form specific circuit motifs. In this study, we took a new approach, the converse of previous studies, starting from circuit and identifying the developmental origins of the neurons. This allows us to identify developmental rules governing circuit self-assembly.</p><p>As a model, we use the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval nerve cord. Circuits in the nerve cord, like those in the spinal cord, processes multiple somatosensory stimuli and generate patterned muscle contractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Meng and Heckscher, 2021</xref>). In addition, spinal cords and nerve cords share gross morphology (left-right symmetrical, segmented), and both contain neurons with shared function and homologous gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heckscher et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Catela and Kratsios, 2021</xref>). However, only for the nerve cord is a connectome available. This connectome is a high-resolution, transmission electron microscopic image of all central nervous system (CNS) neurons and synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ohyama et al., 2015</xref>). The larval connetcome enables anatomical circuit tracing at cellular and synaptic resolution. Nerve cord stem cells (neuroblasts) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae are extremely well-characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doe, 2017</xref>). In each segment, there are 30 left–right pairs of neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), and combinatorial expression of spatial transcription factors (e.g., row and column genes) make each neuroblast unique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Broadus et al., 1995</xref>). Further, each neuroblast produces a unique, invariant lineage of neurons (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schmid et al., 1999</xref>). In general, neuroblasts divide multiple times using a type 1 division pattern. In type 1 divisions, the neuroblast divides asymmetrically to self-renew and generate a ganglion mother cell (GMC). The GMC divides to produce two neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), which are differentiated from each other by Notch signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Skeath and Doe, 1998</xref>). All Notch ON neurons populate an A hemilineage, and all Notch OFF neurons populate a B hemilineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Truman et al., 2010</xref>). Some neuroblasts switch to a type 0 division pattern (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In type 0 divisions, the neuroblast divides asymmetrical to self-renew and to generate a Notch OFF neuron (B hemilineage) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baumgardt et al., 2014</xref>). Within a hemilineage, neurons have unique temporal identities, or birth orders (e.g., first-born, second-born, etc.). Temporal identity is specified by temporal transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Isshiki et al., 2001</xref>). In summary, neuronal stem cells, the lineages of neurons they produce, and the molecular mechanisms underlying the generation of neuronal diversity are extremely well characterized in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> nerve cord.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Twin-spot mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker (ts-MARCM) determines the birth order and morphology of NB3-3A1L/R neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Illustrations of <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblasts. (<bold>A</bold>) The nerve cord is left–right symmetrical and segmented. Each circle represents one neuroblast with NB3-3 in maroon. Segment A1 (boxed) is enlarged in (<bold>A’</bold>). It contains 30 types of neuroblasts. (<bold>B</bold>) NB3-3 lineage progression is shown with an example ts-MARCM clone overlaid. Each circle represents one cell and each arrow represents a cell division. First, NB3-3 divides to self-renew and generate a ganglion mother cell, which divides to generate a motor neuron (solid circle) and an undifferentiated cell (dashed circle). Then, NB3-3 directly generates ELs. In ts-MARCM, a heat shock is provided (red lightning bolt) as NB3-3 divides. In this example, a singly labeled neuron is shown in green (A08e3), and two alternatively labeled neurons are shown in red. Because the total number of neurons in the lineage is known, counting labeled neurons allows inference of neuronal birth order. The identity of the singly labeled neuron is determined by matching the labeled neuron to the corresponding neuron in the connectome using morphological criteria (see ‘Materials and methods’). (<bold>C, D</bold>) Illustration of ts-MARCM genetic constructs used in this study. Our updated version of ts-MARCM system has four components (<bold>C, D</bold>). (1) It uses a pair of genetically modified chromosomes. On one chromosome is an FRT recombinase site (yellow triangle) followed by a <italic>UAS-GFP</italic> (solid green box) and a <italic>UAS-RFP-RNAi</italic> (hollow red box) construct. On the other chromosome is an FRT site followed by a <italic>UAS-RFP</italic> (solid red box) and a <italic>UAS-GFP-RNAi</italic> (hollow green box) construct. When cells are heterozygous for these chromosomes, the GFP- and RFP- RNAi constructs ensure repression of GFP and RFP protein expression, respectively (black curves, <bold>C’</bold>). (2) It has a heat-shock-inducible FLP recombinase (red lightning bolt). By varying the heat shock protocol, we control both the timing and amount of FLP supplied. Heat shocks induce FRT-based chromosomal recombination in dividing cells (red X, M-phase cell, <bold>C’’</bold>). A subset of recombination events produce a pair of post-mitotic progeny, one of which is homozygous for the <italic>UAS-GFP, UAS-RFP-RNAi</italic> construct, and the other homozygous for the <italic>UAS-RFP, UAS-GFP-RNAi</italic> construct. In these cells, RNAi is no longer able to repress GFP or RFP expression (<bold>C’’’</bold>). (3) A cell-type-specific GAL4 line, (e.g., <italic>EL-GAL4,</italic> light gray box in <bold>B</bold>) is used to drive expression of <italic>UAS-RFP</italic> or <italic>UAS-GFP</italic> (<bold>C’’’’</bold>). (4) To get robust ts-MARCM labeling in early-stage larvae, it was often necessary to amplify GAL4 expression. To do so, we generated a new permanent labeling construct (<bold>D</bold>). Specifically, a neuron-specific nSyb promoter (white box) is upstream of a Stop (red box) flanked by KDRT (blue triangles) recombination sights. When the KDR recombinase (from UAS-KD, dark gay box) is supplied, the Stop is removed, and nSyb drives expression of a the new GAL4 (yellow box). This new GAL4 is the GAL4 DNA binding domain tethered to the strong transcriptional activator VP16. (<bold>E, F</bold>) Image of a ts-MARCM clone and a corresponding neuron in the connectome.

Evidence to supports this idea comes from the identification of temporal cohorts in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval nerve cord. Temporal cohorts are sets of neurons in a hemilineage that are born within a tight time window. Initially, temporal cohorts were correlated with circuit membership using functional approaches. Specifically, neuroblast NB3-3 generates a series of EL interneurons (<italic>E</italic>ven-skipped [eve] neurons with <italic>L</italic>aterally placed cell bodies) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wreden et al., 2017</xref>). Molecularly, ELs are subdivided into early-born EL and late-born EL temporal cohorts based on the expression of an enhancer called 11F02 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wreden et al., 2017</xref>). EL interneurons of the early-born temporal cohort respond to vibrational stimuli, whereas EL interneurons of the late-born temporal cohort do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wreden et al., 2017</xref>). Further, activation of early-born ELs triggers escape rolling, whereas activation of late-born ELs alters left–right symmetrical crawling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wreden et al., 2017</xref>). Together, these data linked temporal cohorts with differential circuit function. More recently, in additional hemilineages (i.e., NB1-2, NB2-1, NB3-1, NB4-1, NB5-2, NB7-1, NB 7-4), neurons within temporal cohorts were shown to have similar synaptic partnerships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Meng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mark et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, the number of neurons in a hemilineage that are segregated into a given temporal cohort could be altered by manipulating temporal transcription factor expression in neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Meng et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, temporal cohorts are developmental units likely specified early during neurogenesis by molecular programs known to generate neural diversity.</p><p>Notably, however, previous studies that described temporal cohorts lacked the resolution to distinguish between graded and sharp wiring transition models. For many neuronal features, such as morphology, gene expression, and neurotransmitter phenotype, there can be sharp changes in lineage progression. For example, a neuroblast can abruptly change from producing motor neurons to interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Meng et al., 2020</xref>) or from producing Eve(+) to Eve(−) neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pearson and Doe, 2003</xref>). The idea that temporal cohorts have distinct circuit-level function suggests that there are also sharp changes in the patterns of synaptic partnerships formed by neurons in a lineage, and that these sharp changes are correlated with temporal cohort borders. However, available data are also consistent with an alternative, graded transition model. In the graded transition model, during lineage progression, changes in wiring would slowly transition such that neurons with more similar birth times would have more similar synaptic partnerships. Distinguishing between graded and sharp transition models is fundamental for understanding lineage progression in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblasts.</p><p>The overall objective of this article is to test the hypothesis that <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval nerve cord circuits are assembled by preferential connectivity between distinct temporal cohorts. Although an attractive hypothesis, there is limited supporting evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mark et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Meng et al., 2020</xref>). Before we can address this hypothesis, in the first part of this article, we needed to distinguish between graded and sharp wiring transition models. Using lineage tracing, connectomics, and network science-based statistical analysis, we find support for a sharp transition model. And so, the first part of this article brings into alignment the concepts of temporal cohorts, circuit function, and circuit anatomy at single-neuron resolution. In the second part of this article, we use the circuit containing the early-born EL temporal cohort as a model. Connectomics and calcium imaging show that early-born ELs are embedded in a feed-forward circuit (e.g., A connects to B and to C, B also connects to C). This circuit is found in the nerve cord, and it encodes the onset of vibration stimuli. The early-born ELs are the outputs of the circuit, transmitting information to the brain via their long projection axons. Next, we combine lineage tracing, single-neuron labeling approaches, and connectomics to identify the developmental origins for the majority of major interneuron inputs (i.e., those synapsing 10 or more times) onto early-born ELs. Specifically, we identify the neuroblast parent, birth order within a lineage, and birth time relative to early-born ELs. Our data support the hypothesis that this feed-forward circuit is assembled by preferential connectivity between distinct temporal cohorts from different lineages. We find connectivity among temporal cohorts from the same lineage in different anterior–posterior segments. For neurons from different lineages, our data show that circuit outputs (early-born ELs) are born before circuit inputs (i.e., Ladders, Basins). Ultimately, these data show that sequential addition of temporal cohorts, with outputs oldest and inputs youngest, is one strategy for assembling feed-forward circuits.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>NB3-3 lineage contains two temporal cohorts, early-born ELs and late-born ELs, which are distinctive both in morphology and connectivity</title><p>This study aims to understand how neurons from different stem cell lineages wire with each other to form a specific circuit motif. In particular, we wanted to test the hypothesis that <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval nerve cord circuits are assembled by preferential connectivity between temporal cohorts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Meng and Heckscher, 2021</xref>). First, however, we needed to better understand the relationship between temporal cohorts, circuit function, and circuit anatomy. Specifically, we needed to distinguish between graded and sharp wiring transition models (see ‘Introduction). To do so, we need to determine the relationship between neuronal birth order and synaptic connectivity at single neuron resolution.</p><p>As a model, we use the NB3-3 lineage in the first abdominal segment (A1) of the nerve cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In A1, there is a left–right pair of NB3-3 neuroblasts that are thought to be identical. We will refer to these neuroblasts as NB3-3A1L/R. First, NB3-3A1L/R undergoes a type 1 division to self-renew and generate a GMC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baumgardt et al., 2014</xref>). The GMC divides to produce two neurons of unknown function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schmid et al., 1999</xref>). Next, NB3-3 begins to divide using a type 0 division pattern to self-renew and generate EL interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baumgardt et al., 2014</xref>). The birth timing of ELs has been characterized using three different methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tsuji et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wreden et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mark et al., 2021</xref>). Nonetheless, the precise relationship between morphology and birth order for NB3-3A1L/R progeny remains unknown. Here, we determined the birth order and morphology of every neuron produced by NB3-3A1L/R. Using morphology, we identified matching neurons in the connectome. Using the connectome, we found all upstream synaptic partners. Finally, we analyzed the patterns of wiring using network science approaches.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Birth order and morphology of each neuron in the NB3-3A1L/R lineage</title><p>First, we needed to determine birth order and morphology of EL interneurons at the single-neuron level. To do so, we used the gold standard in the field for lineage tracing, Twin-spot mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker (ts-MARCM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yu et al., 2009b</xref>). Briefly, in ts-MARCM, heat shocks are delivered to dividing cells, rendering their progeny competent to express either a UAS-red or -green fluorescent reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). Reporter expression is driven by a cell-type-specific GAL4 line. Providing heat shocks at various times is used to reconstruct lineage progression. The morphology of singly labeled neurons is used to determine neuron identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E’’’’</xref>) and counting the number of alternatively labeled, subsequently born cells determines birth order (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E’–E’’’</xref>). To drive ts-MARCM reporter expression, we used <italic>EL-GAL4</italic> that drives in all EL neurons, together with a newly generated genetic cassette that amplifies GAL4 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We find that in segment A1, ELs are produced in the following order: A08x, A08j1, A08j3, A08j2, A08m, A08o, A08c, A08s, A08e3, A08e1, and A08e2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Notably, all these ELs have been suggested to be NB3-3A1L/R progeny, and our data provides the first confirmation for several (A08o, A08j1-j3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mark et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wreden et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heckscher et al., 2015</xref>).

To locate neurons of interest in the connectome we used two criteria: first, lineage-related neurons often have cell bodies that cluster and neurites that form a tight bundle entering the neuropil (i.e., the axon, dendrite and synapse-rich, cell body-free region of the CNS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schmid et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mark et al., 2021</xref>). We generated a new <italic>NB3-3-GAL4</italic> line, which selectively labels NB3-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Using both <italic>NB3-3-GAL4</italic> and <italic>EL-GAL4</italic> to drive membrane GFP, we confirmed that the GFP-labeled neurons have clustered soma and bundled neurites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). Second, we used ts-MARCM data as ground truth to identify neurons with corresponding morphologies in the connectome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). With these two criteria, we identified a lineage bundle that contained all the ELs plus two other non-EL neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The non-EL neurons were an undifferentiated neuron, which has never been reported before, and a motor neuron, which is consistent with previous reports (i.e., MN 22/23, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, top row; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schmid et al., 1999</xref>). Then, with the high-resolution morphology data, we asked to what extent is EL morphology correlated with birth order and temporal cohort borders. We found one morphological group of early-born ELs, which included A08x, A08j1, A08j3, A08j2, and A08m (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, second row). The axons of these ELs project to the central brain, with one exception, A08m, which projects to the thorax. Their dendrites are found on both sides of the midline (ipsilateral and contralateral to the soma) with one exception, A08m, which has only contralateral dendrites. All project dendrites ventrally from the main neurite, and of these, two had been previously identified as early-born ELs (A08x and A08m) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wreden et al., 2017</xref>). The second morphological group contained late-born ELs and included A08o, A08c, A08s, A08e3, A08e1, and A08e2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, third and fourth rows). The axons of these ELs project to the central brain or remain local. Their dendrites are ipsilateral to the soma and project dorsally from the main neurite, with one exception, A08c, which projects dendrites both dorsally and ventrally. All of these ELs, except A08o, had been previously identified as late-born ELs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wreden et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, we find morphological groupings of neurons in the NB3-3A1L/R lineage that are strongly correlated with neuron birth time and that reflect previous grouping of ELs into early-born and late-born temporal cohorts.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>The morphology of all NB3-3A1L/R neurons in the connectome.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Images of NB3-3A1L neurons with clustered soma and bundled neuritis.

This measure is called ‘cortex neurite length.’ Here, we sought to quantify the relationship between cortex neurite length and neuron birth order because for the first time we had a complete lineage with both precisely defined birth order information and cortex neurite length data. We plotted cortex neurite length for each neuron in the NB3-3A1L/R lineage as well as their average and found a strong positive correlation as measured by Pearson’s correlation (r(11) = 0.88, p&lt;0.0001 and r(11) = 0.85, p=0.002 and r(11) = 0.92, p&lt;0.0001 for A1L, A1R, and average, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>).

First, we characterized the relationship between birth order and sensory neuron input. In the NB3-3A1L/R lineage, the earliest born, non-EL neurons get no input from sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata2">Figure 4—source data 2</xref>). All early-born ELs receive input from chordotonal sensory neurons (CHOs), which agrees with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wreden et al., 2017</xref>) and characterizes the sensory input onto A08j1-3 for the first time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). All late-born ELs get input from proprioceptive and other sensory neurons, but not CHOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This agrees with previous finding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heckscher et al., 2015</xref>) and newly shows that A08o gets a low amount of proprioceptive input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Thus, we conclude that based on input from sensory neurons, there are two sharp transitions in NB3-3A1L/R lineage progression, from non-EL neurons to early-born ELs and from early-born ELs to late-born ELs.</p><p>Next, we asked if there were similarly sharp transitions in NB3-3A1L/R lineage progression when looking at inputs from nerve cord interneurons. However, first, we wanted to understand how many synaptic contacts each interneuron made onto neurons in the NB3-3A1L/R. This is because neurons contributing few synapses may represent biological noise (promiscuous wiring) or technical noise (annotation errors). In our dataset, the number of contacts from one interneuron onto a NB3-3A1L/R neuron varied from 1 to 28 synapses. To examine the full distribution of interneuron inputs onto neurons inNB3-3A1L/R, we generated a histogram with number of neurons on the Y-axis and number of synapses onto a NB3-3A1L/R on the X-axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata3">Figure 4—source data 3</xref>). A majority (79%) of interneurons contributed only one synapse onto an NB3-3A1L/R neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). To avoid analyzing potentially noisy data, we focused on the subset of nerve cord interneurons for which left–right (L/R) pairs formed a minimum of two synapses onto a NB3-3A1 neuron on one side and four synapses onto the corresponding NB3-3A1 on the other side (see ‘Materials and methods’ for details, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata4">Figure 4—source data 4</xref>). We identified 198 ‘L/R paired’ interneurons, which together provided 1990 synapses onto NB3-3A1L/R neurons. From these L/R paired interneurons, undifferentiated neuron gets no synaptic input, and MN22/23 gets inputs that largely do not synapse onto ELs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). For early-born ELs, many L/R paired interneurons synapse onto multiple neurons within the temporal cohort, but not other neurons in the lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Similarly, for late-born ELs, L/R paired interneurons synapse onto multiple neurons within the temporal cohort, but not other neurons in the lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). We conclude that based on L/R paired interneuron input, NB3-3A1L/R lineage progression undergoes sharp transitions in patterns of input connectivity. Further, these transitions are correlated with temporal cohort borders.</p><p>The qualitative analysis above suggested that early-born and late-born ELs have distinct connectivity patterns. To quantitatively test this suggestion, we analyzed all input data, not selected subsets, using a network science-based approach, specifically distance analysis. Briefly, we treated inputs to a neuron as a vector that contained the number of synaptic contacts. The order of inputs was the same for every neuron. For every pair of neurons, we calculated the Euclidean distance between the two vectors, which produced a metric for the difference in connectivity between two neurons. We call this the ‘real’ value. For the distance of the real value to be zero, not only would the input partners need to completely overlap, but the number of synapses contributed by each of these partners would need to be identical. To provide an estimate of how the same set of neurons could be wired by chance, we computationally permutated the input vector for each neuron independently, preserving number of inputs, but shuffling input identity. We did this 100 times for each neuron to produce a ‘shuffled’ dataset. For shuffled datasets, Euclidian distances were computed. Real values were normalized to shuffled values to generate a z-score that allowed us to determine statistical significance (see ‘Materials and methods’). In examining the distribution of z-scores, early-born ELs have significantly <italic>similar</italic> patterns compared to other neurons in their temporal cohort, but not compared to other neurons in the lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). Late-born ELs have significantly <italic>similar</italic> patterns compared to other neurons in their cohort, but not compared to other neurons in the lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

Distance analysis allowed us to asses this idea by helping to visualize connectivity patterns between early-born versus late-born ELs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). To quantify patterns of connectivity we measured two features—similarity among left–right pairs of neurons and similarity among following pairs. An example of similarity among left–right pairs is A08j3 A1L and A08j3 A1R, both of which have significantly similar connectivity compared to A08x A1L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In contrast, A08c A1L, but not A08c A1R, has significantly similar connectivity compared to A08o A1L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In general, early-born ELs have significant similarities between left–right pairs of neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, open purple circles), whereas late-born ELs did not ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, open magenta circles). An example of similarity among following pairs is that A08c A1L has significantly similar connectivity compared to A08s A1L, which is adjacent to A08c in birth order (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Both early-born and late-born ELs have similarities among following pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, filled circles). The idea that neurons within a temporal cohort are more similar to neurons next born in the sequence shows that <italic>within</italic> a temporal cohort there are graded transitions in connectivity patterns. Additionally, early-born ELs have similarities with many neurons within their temporal cohort, whereas late-born neurons only tend to be similar to neurons that were born next in the sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We conclude that temporal cohorts are not merely copies of each other and the computations performed by early-born and late-born ELs may differ.</p><p>Finally, we used distance analysis to ask what drives the clustering of EL interneurons into two cohorts—connectivity with sensory neurons, interneurons, or both? We repeated the distance analysis, dropping out either sensory neuron or interneuron inputs. For drop out of interneurons, only sensory neuron connections remain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata3">Figure 5—source data 3</xref>). In this case, there were still significant similarities in inputs specifically between neurons of a temporal cohort. However, for early-born ELs, the total number of neuron pairs with significant similarities was increased, whereas for late-born ELs, it was reduced. This suggests that interneuron input diversifies the early-born cohort, but unifies the late-born cohort. Data for drop out of sensory neurons is consistent with this idea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata4">Figure 5—source data 4</xref>). This may hint at differing developmental strategies for temporal cohort assembly.</p><p>In summary, we find that the NB3-3A1L/R lineage undergoes two sharp transitions during lineage progression—from non-EL neurons to early-born ELs and from early-born ELs to late-born ELs. Sharp transitions are seen with respect to morphology and patterns of input connectivity, supporting a sharp transitions model. Further, sharp transitions are correlated with previously defined early-born and late-born ELs temporal cohort borders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wreden et al., 2017</xref>). Ultimately, these data bring into alignment the concepts of temporal cohorts, circuit function, and circuit anatomy at single-neuron resolution.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Early-born ELs are embedded in a feed-forward circuit and encode the onset of vibrational stimulation</title><p>For the rest of this study, we focus on early-born ELs as a model to understand circuit assembly. Early-born ELs and late-born ELs contribute to different circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wreden et al., 2017</xref>). In comparison to late-born ELs, the anatomical circuit motif in which early-born ELs are embedded is poorly characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heckscher et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mark et al., 2021</xref>).

And so, we needed to characterize the early-born EL circuit.</p><p>To understand the circuit to which early-born ELs contribute, we started by grouping neurons that synapse onto early-born ELs in A1L/R into classes based on morphology. We analyzed 1945 synapses formed on early-born ELs by 331 neurons (sensory neurons and nerve cord interneurons) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>). We grouped neurons into classes based on morphology. We calculated the total number of neurons within a class and the percentage of total synaptic input onto early-born ELs provided by neurons in each class. 6% of input came from 21 Basin interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and E</xref>). Basins are a previously described class of excitatory neurons that have ipsilateral axons and dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ohyama et al., 2015</xref>). 12% of input are from 20 A08 interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and E</xref>). In experiments described below, we find that A08 interneurons are early-born ELs from segments other than A1. 17% of synaptic inputs come from 32 Ladder interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and E</xref>). Ladders are a previously described group of unpaired inhibitory neurons with cell bodies in the midline and left–right symmetrical arbors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jovanic et al., 2016</xref>). 31% of synaptic inputs come from 72 CHOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and E</xref>), which respond to vibration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wreden et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ohyama et al., 2013</xref>). The remaining 34% of inputs come from 186 other interneurons, which fall into a wide variety of morphological classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).

This is important from a functional perspective because neurons that provide multiple synaptic contacts onto a downstream are thought to be more effective in driving downstream neuronal activity. To investigate this quantitatively, we grouped CHOs, Ladders, Basins, and ELs into one group and all other neurons into a second group. We generated histograms for each group, binning by number of synapses onto early-born ELs, and counting the total number of neurons in each bin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata2">Figure 6—source data 2</xref>). Comparing these two histograms shows a significant difference in the distribution of synapse number (Kolmogorov–Smirnov, p&lt;0.0001). For example, 36% of all neurons in the group containing CHOs, Ladders, Basins, and ELs, provide 10 or more synapses onto early-born ELs. For other neurons, it is 5%. Put another way, of all the neurons that provide 10 or more synapses onto early -born ELs in A1, &gt;80% are CHOs, Ladders, Basins, or early-born ELs. We conclude that, in general, individual neurons in this group are more highly connected with early-born ELs in A1 compared to other neurons, and neurons in this group are also more likely to be important early-born EL activity.</p><p>After identifying these four classes of inputs, we next asked how they were anatomically arranged at the level of circuit motif. We consider early-born ELs to be the circuit outputs because they are excitatory and project to the central brain (or, for A08m, thorax) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source data 1</xref>).

First, we induced ts-MARCM clones using brief heat shocks at early times in development. This produced one or two clones per CNS (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>) consistent with the idea that recombination levels were low. We counted the number of Basin neurons in each clone and found that most often all four Basins were labeled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B’ and K</xref>). This is consistent with the idea that recombination occurred in a single dividing neuroblast and that neuroblast produces all Basin interneurons. Next, we used ts-MARCM to determine the relative birth timing of Basins within the lineage. In this set of experiments, we provided heat shocks at a variety of developmental time points and scored the resulting progeny. We find that Basins are born in the following order: Basins 2, 1, 3, 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–J</xref>). Additionally, based on the types of clones produced at different times (see ‘Materials and methods’ for details), our data suggest Basins are born within a middle-to-late window during NB3-5 lineage progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8K</xref>).

First, we observe Basin cell bodies are clustered and their neurites form a bundle both in light microscopy images and in the connectome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A and E</xref>). This provides further support for the idea that Basins are a lineage-related set of neurons. Second, we assayed Basin birth order using cortex neurite length as a proxy. To do so, in connectome, we identified all neurons in the lineage bundle that contained Basin neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref><italic>,</italic> yellow) because these neurons are likely to be part of the NB3-5 lineage. Then, we measured and plotted the cortex neurite lengths of putative NB3-5 neurons in the hemilineage that included Basins. In this set, Basins possess cortex neurite lengths that are among the longest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9H</xref>). These data are consistent with our ts-MARCM data, which suggest that Basins are middle-to-late born.

This provides strong evidence that Basins are a temporal cohort.</p><p>In the first section of this article, we found that between neurons in the NB3-3A1L/R lineage there are sharp transitions in input connectivity patterns correlated with temporal cohort boundaries. However, it remained unclear if this was true for early-born and late-born temporal cohorts only, or if this represented a more general ‘rule.’ Because we identified Basins as a temporal cohort, we next examine the relationship between patterns of connectivity and Basin temporal cohort borders. As described in the first section of this article, using distance analysis, we quantified the significant similarities in neuronal input, this time analyzing neurons in the Basin hemilineage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).

In all cases, Ladder and MNB lineage markers are found in the same cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C–E</xref>). In addition, we used distance analysis to evaluate input connectivity between Ladders in the A1 segment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) and find statistically significant similarities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig10sdata1 fig10sdata2">Figure 10—source data 1–2</xref>).

Therefore, we tested the idea that these A08 interneurons could be NB3-3 progeny in segments other than A1.

We found inter-segmental connections between Basins and Ladders, but not late-born ELs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).

One commonality between early-born, Basins, Ladders, but not late-born ELs, is that they receive synapses from CHOs. This raises the possibility that inter- and intra-segmental synaptic connectivity between these temporal cohort is a feature important for the processing of vibrational stimuli. Further, these data reveal differences in connectivity between temporal cohorts, hinting at complexity in mechanisms driving their wiring.</p><p>In summary, we find that Basins neurons are a mid-to-late-born temporal cohort from NB3-5. Ladders are late-born temporal cohort from MNB. And A08 interneurons are early-born ELs from segment other than A1. This supports the hypothesis that in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval nerve cord circuits are assembled by preferential wiring between temporal cohorts. Further, we note that temporal cohorts that form synapses on early-born ELs come from 3 of the 30 neuroblast in the nerve cord. This finding rules out the following two models: (1) that morphologically similar neurons from different lineages synapse onto early-born ELs, and (2) that multiple temporal cohorts from a single neuronal stem cell synapse onto early-born ELs. Instead, it shows that neurons from a limited number of neuronal stem cell lineages selectively synapse onto early-born ELs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Presynaptic interneurons are born after their postsynaptic interneuron partners</title><p>To more fully understand assembly of this feed-forward circuit, we needed to understand the relative birth timings of early-born ELs, Basin, and Ladder interneurons. One model for motor circuit development suggests that early-born neurons wire with each other to generate circuits driving fast movements, whereas later-born neurons wire with each other to generate circuits driving refined movement (i.e., early-to-early and late-to-late model) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fetcho and McLean, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ampatzis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mark et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, we found that early-born ELs from different segments synapse with each other, raising the possibility that an early-to-early model could also explain the observed pattern of wiring. However, there is suggestive evidence that an exclusive early-to-early model cannot explain the full complexity of wiring patterns seen in motor circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kishore et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Menelaou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Song et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, here, we test the hypothesis that early-born ELs wire with neurons from other lineages, which are born at the same time as early-born ELs. Note that in the experiments described above we determined the birth order of neurons within a given lineage, but had no information about the relative birth timing of neurons between different lineages.</p><p>To determine the relative birth timing of early-born ELs, Basins, and Ladders, we started by asking when during neurogenesis each EL could be generated. We used ts-MARCM with <italic>EL-GAL4</italic>. We supplied heat shocks at different time points and scored the identity of singly labeled neurons. Heat shock supplied after 7 hr of development labeled a mixture of early-born and late-born ELs, whereas heat shock supplied after 9 hr labeled exclusively late-born ELs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12A and B</xref>). Thus, heat shocks after ~9 hr failed to label early-born ELs. Next, we asked when during neurogenesis the Basins and Ladders are generated. We used ts-MARCM with GAL4 lines that labeled individual Basin or Ladder neurons (Basin-1 or Ladder-D) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12C and D</xref>). We supplied heat shocks at different time points and scored for the proportion of CNS in which clones were induced. In both cases, heat shocks provided at 11 hr of development, or later, failed to label these neurons. Whereas heat shocks provided at 10 hr of development, or earlier, resulted in labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12E</xref>). Thus, heat shocks at ~10 hr are sufficient to label Basins and Ladders. Taken together these data strongly suggest that Basins and Ladders are generated after the early-born ELs. Notably, this is inconsistent with the model in the field.</p><fig id="fig12" position="float"><label>Figure 12.</label><caption><title>Basin and Ladder interneurons are born after early-born EL interneurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Illustration of neurons labeled by various heat shock protocols.

Specifically, we performed dual ts-MARCM using both <italic>Basin-GAL4</italic> and <italic>EL-GAL4</italic> in the same larva. This approach allows for direct comparison of neurons generated at a given time in a single animal. We provided a series of heat shocks and scored the resulting clones as follows: EL clones were scored for neuron identity (e.g., A08j2), and this was used to assign ELs as early-born or late-born. Basin clones were scored for clone type (e.g., 1:3 or 1 neuron labeled in one color, 3 neurons in another color), and this was used to determine the time window of Basin production. Specifically, if all Basins were labeled in a single color (0:4 clone), the heat shock was provided before the neuroblast began to divide to produce Basins. Alternatively, if Basins were singly labeled (e.g., 1:3, 1:2, etc.), the heat shock was provided to cells as they were dividing to produce Basins. Within our dataset, three animals had labeled early-born ELs. In all of these animals, Basins were labeled in a single color, consistent with the idea that the neuroblast had not yet begun generating Basins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12F</xref>). In 17 animals, we found singly labeled Basin neurons, suggesting that Basins were being generated. In 16 of these 17 animals, late-born ELs were labeled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12F</xref>). Together, these data provide strong evidence that early-born ELs are born earlier than the Basin interneurons.</p><p>In summary, we find that between neurons in the feed-forward circuit, early-born EL are born before Basin and Ladder interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12G</xref>). More generally, this demonstrates that circuit outputs from one lineage are born before circuit inputs from other lineages. Further, this rules out an exclusive early-to-early hypothesis that states that neurons born at the same time are circuit partners.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Other neurons that are highly connected to early-born ELs come from multiple different lineages and most are born after early-born ELs</title><p>In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval nerve cord, individual neurons make different numbers of synapses onto their various downstream partners. In this section, we focus on neurons that are highly connected to early-born ELs, but not in the three lineages previously discussed. We considered a neuron to be highly connected if it has 10 or more synapses onto early-born ELs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). We choose this criterion for highly connected neurons, first, because a majority of synapses onto early-born ELs are made by these neurons, and second, because these neurons are likely to be important drivers of the activity of early-born ELs. In the sections above, we focused on Ladder, Basin, and Early-born EL interneurons, which, together with CHOs, account for the majority of neurons highly connected to early-born EL in A1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig13sdata1">Figure 13—source data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). From these data, we learned two ‘rules.’ First, interneurons in the feed-forward circuit come from temporal cohorts in three lineages. Second, output interneurons from one lineage are born before input interneurons from other lineages. Additionally, there are six other highly connected neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13A–C</xref>). Here, we characterize the developmental origins of these other neurons to understand the extent to which the rules apply.</p><fig id="fig13" position="float"><label>Figure 13.</label><caption><title>Other interneurons that are highly connected onto early-born ELs in A1 come from multiple lineages, and a majority are born after early-born ELs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Quantification of neurons highly connected to early-born ELs.

To assign lineage identity, we examined their cell body position and neurite fasciculation pattern. The six other neurons likely come from six different lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13B and C</xref>). Of these, one is NB3-5, which generates Basin neurons. This means that NB3-5 neurons contribute more synapses onto early-born ELs than we had previously appreciated. We conclude that together NB3-5, MNB, and NB3-3 generate a majority (75%) of interneurons that are highly connected to early-born ELs. However, the relationship is not exclusive, and interneurons from other lineages do also synapse multiple times onto early-born ELs.</p><p>Next, we wanted to understand the extent to which the six other highly connected interneurons could be born after early-born ELs. To do so, we examined the cell body position of each along the medio-lateral axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13B’</xref>). Of the six, one had a medial cell body close to the neuropil, suggesting that it was early-born within its lineage; four had cell body positions on or close to the lateral edge of the CNS, suggesting that they were late-born with their respective lineages; and one had an intermediate cell body position that is difficult to interpret (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13C</xref>). These data, along with our previous birth dating from Basins, Ladders, and ELs, suggest that 70% of highly connected interneurons are born after early-born ELs. We conclude that the large majority of highly connected neurons in this circuit are born after the circuit output neurons (early-born ELs), but that there are exceptions to this ‘rule’.</p><p>Finally, for one of the other highly connected other interneurons, we wanted to experimentally validate our lineage assignment and more directly determine its birth time relative to early-born ELs. We chose to focus on neuron <italic>A03 upstream of A08m</italic> because it is inferred to be progeny of NB7-1, and the lineage NB7-1 is extremely well-characterized. NB7-1 delaminates early during neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Broadus et al., 1995</xref>). The first six divisions of NB7-1 generate motor neurons and undifferentiated motor neuron siblings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Seroka and Doe, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lacin et al., 2009</xref>). Then, NB7-1 divides approximately 14 more times, generating interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meng et al., 2019</xref>), one of which is thought to be neuron <italic>A083 upstream of A08m</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mark et al., 2021</xref>). We labeled neuron <italic>A03 upstream of A08m</italic> using a <italic>NB7-1-GAL4</italic> driver line to create MCFO clones, which validates the lineage assignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14A and B</xref>). Then, in the connectome, we measured the cortex neurite length of neuron <italic>A03 upstream of A08m</italic> and the other interneurons within the same hemilineage as a proxy for birth order (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig14sdata1">Figure 14—source data 1</xref>). At the earliest, neuron <italic>A03 upstream of A08m</italic> is the sixth-born <italic>interneuron</italic>, and because there are six divisions of NB7-1 before interneurons are made, neuron <italic>A03 upstream of A08m</italic> must be born on or after the 12th division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14E</xref>). To compare the birth timing of neuron <italic>A03 upstream of A08m</italic> to the birth timing of early-born ELs, we present the following logic. NB3-3 and NB7-1 are generated at ~400 min and ~230 min after egg laying, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Doe, 1992</xref>). Neuroblasts divide every 45 min. And so, NB3-3 is four divisions behind of NB7-1 ([400 min –230 min]/45 divisions/minute = 3.8 divisions). Early-born ELs are made during the second to sixth divisions of NB3-3, which corresponds to the fifth to ninth divisions of NB7-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14E</xref>). Because NB7-1 produces neuron <italic>A03 upstream of A08m</italic> no earlier than the 12 divisions, we conclude that it must be born after the early-born ELs. In addition, we noticed that three other interneurons in the same hemilineage as ‘A03 upstream of A08m’ synapse onto early-born ELs, albeit less strongly. The cortex neurite length of these neurons shows that they largely have birth times adjacent to neuron <italic>A03 upstream of A08m</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14D</xref>), which is consistent with the idea that these neurons are a temporal cohort. Using the same logic as described earlier, we find that all the NB7-1 interneurons that synapse onto early-born ELs are born after the early-born ELs themselves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14E</xref>). Thus, analysis of NB7-1 shows that neurons from a third lineage follows the patterns identified for Ladder and Basin temporal cohorts. Furthermore, these data show that additional temporal cohorts have neurons that synapse onto early-born ELs, but not as extensively as neurons in the Ladder, Basin, or early-born EL temporal cohorts.</p><fig id="fig14" position="float"><label>Figure 14.</label><caption><title>Interneurons from the NB7-1 Notch OFF hemilineage synapse onto early-born ELs and are born after early-born ELs.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Images of neuron <italic>A03 upstream of A08m</italic>, an interneuron from the Notch OFF NB7-1 hemilineage.

First, what is the relationship between neuronal birth order within a lineage and patterns of synaptic connectivity at the single-neuron level? Second, how do neurons from different lineages wire with each other? We characterized the birth order, morphology, and input connectivity of all neurons in the NB3-3A1L/R lineage at single-neuron and single-synapse resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We identified a feed-forward circuit that encodes the onset of vibrational stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). And, for a majority of nerve cord interneurons within this circuit, we identified their stem cell parent, birth order within their lineage, and birth timing relative to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2 supp3 supp4">Supplementary files 2-4</xref>). Together, this identifies four temporal cohorts, all of which have sharp connectivity boundaries. For most, but not all, there is inter-segmental connectivity between segmentally homologous temporal cohorts (e.g., early-born ELs in other segments connect to early-born ELs in A1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11G</xref>). Further, neurons of different temporal cohorts from different lineages assemble sequentially, with circuit output neurons born before circuit input neurons. Additionally, this study provides new tools to study stem cell-based assembly of a fundamental circuit motif.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>New resources for analysis of connectome data</title><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval connectome is a resource that can be used to understand circuit assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Meng and Heckscher, 2021</xref>). However, because the connectome is an anatomical dataset, a major challenge is to develop approaches that connect anatomy to development. In this article, we develop several approaches. For example, we optimized ts-MARCM for use in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). ts-MARCM is the gold standard for determining birth order in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yu et al., 2009b</xref>). However, for technical reasons, ts-MARCM has been used only in adults. We discovered ts-MARCM clones can be robustly generated in early stage larvae with the addition of an amplifying and immortalizing gene cassette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In addition, we independently validated several recently developed methods for inferring developmental origin based on anatomical features in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval connectome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mark et al., 2021</xref>). Specifically, our validations include use of neurite bundles as a proxy for lineage-relatedness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B, C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9A, E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">14C</xref>) and use of cortex neurite length as a rough proxy for birth order within a lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">14B</xref>). Finally, we adapted network science methods (distance analysis) to characterize the patterns of connectivity in connectome data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref>). These approaches should be useful for <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurobiologists and beyond.</p><p>We also developed NB3-3A1L/R as the first entire lineage for which birth order, morphology, and input connectivity is known at single neuron and synapse precision (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). One reason this is important is because NB3-3 has been extensively studied in embryos and much is known about molecular marker expression of NB3-3 progeny at the single-neuron level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tsuji et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wreden et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baumgardt et al., 2014</xref>). Because our dataset achieves cellular resolution, good guesses about the embryonic molecular–larval morphological pairings can be made using single-neuron birth order as a point of cross-reference. Such integrated data generates detailed and testable predictions. For example, our data predict that Castor expression in the late-born ELs promotes projection neuron morphology. Additionally, here, we generated a new <italic>NB3-3-GAL4</italic> line that can be used to manipulate gene expression in NB3-3 (Figure S1). Thus, NB3-3A1L/R is a model lineage in which transcription factor expression in neuronal stem cells can be linked to circuit assembly and tested for function, and we have generated tools that will enable hypothesis testing in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Early-born ELs are embedded in a potentially conserved, feed-forward circuit motif</title><p>A circuit motif is a pattern of synaptic connections between a set of specific neuron types that can be found across brain areas and across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Braganza and Beck, 2018</xref>). Circuit motifs have been suggested to represent the physical substrates of ‘computational primitives’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Marcus et al., 2014</xref>). There a are small number of fundamental, recurring circuit motifs (e.g., feed-forward, feedback, lateral inhibition, etc.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Luo, 2021</xref>). And so, a new conceptual approach in this article is to ask how are specific circuit motifs assembled during development. In this study, we identified a new feed-forward circuit motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Generally, feed-forward motifs are characterized as a pattern of connectivity in which one neuron (or neuron type) provides both direct and indirect input onto a second neuron (or neuron type). Feed-forward circuit motifs are common, found in many animals (e.g., nematodes, insects, mouse) and in many brain regions (e.g., somatosensory systems, olfactory systems, neocortex) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schafer, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anton and Homberg, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harris and Shepherd, 2015</xref>). Thus, feed-forward motifs are fundamental to neural signal processing. Feed-forward motifs can be further subdivided into feed-forward inhibitory or feed-forward excitatory circuit motifs, depending on the transmitter types of the neurons involved(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Luo, 2021</xref>). Notably, anatomically the pattern of synaptic connectivity between neurons is the same in either motif subtype, and so in this study we do not distinguish between the two.</p><p>Here, we find that, in general, early-born ELs get direct excitatory synapses from CHOs and indirect (excitatory or inhibitory) input from chordotonals via Basins and Ladder interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Notably, there are differences in connectivity patterns between early-born ELs. For example, although all early-born ELs get direct input from chordotonals and Ladders, A08j1-3s get left–right symmetrical inputs, whereas A08x and A08m get asymmetrical inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This could correspond to functional differences. For example, A08x and A08m may be involved in left–right asymmetrical signal detection. Teasing apart the diversity of computations performed by each individual EL interneurons is the domain of future studies.</p><p>Because we characterized the development of a feed-forward circuit in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we have information that allows us to search for similar circuits in other insect species. For example, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, ELs express the transcription factor, Even-skipped (Eve, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). In Locust and other insects, lateral interneurons also express Eve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bevan and Burrows, 2003</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, MNB generates H-shaped, inhibitory interneurons (Ladders), which get input from sound/vibration sensitive, CHOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). In Locust, MNB generates H-shaped, inhibitory interneurons, which encode sound stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thompson and Siegler, 1991</xref>). Further, in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and Locusts, MNB interneuron progeny express the transcription factor Engrailed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schmid et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kearney et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Patel et al., 1989</xref>). Thus, the neuronal components of the Ladder to early-born EL circuit are conserved, which raises the possibility of circuit-level conservation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Deepening our understanding of temporal cohorts</title><p>A major unanswered question in developmental neuroscience is how the mechanisms that generate neuronal diversity contribute to the formation of functional neuronal circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sagner and Briscoe, 2019</xref>). Part of the answer lies in the observation that temporal cohorts are subunits of lineages, linked both to larval circuit anatomy/function as well as to the embryonic gene expression programs that generate neuronal diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Meng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Seroka and Doe, 2019</xref>). Thus far, temporal cohorts had been looked for and found in 8 out of 30 lineages in the nerve cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wreden et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Meng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mark et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we identify three additional temporal cohorts—Basins, Ladders, and Notch OFF NB7-1 interneurons—in three lineages—NB3-5, MNB, and NB7-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14</xref>), bringing the number to 11. This underscores the idea that temporal cohorts are common.</p><p>One open question about temporal cohorts was to what extent are temporal cohort borders associated with sharp changes in connectivity. Previous studies had identified temporal cohorts and linked them with function and connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wreden et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Meng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mark et al., 2021</xref>). However, these studies lacked the resolution to distinguish between a ‘graded’ or ‘sharp’ wiring transition models. We identified four temporal cohorts (early-born ELs, late-born ELs, Basins, Ladders) in three lineages (NB3-3, NB3-5, MNB), all of which have sharp changes in connectivity correlated with temporal cohort borders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref>). For the Basin temporal cohort, we note that Basins have similar connectivity patterns with two additional NB3-5 progeny, ‘Down and Back’ and ‘Crescent’ neurons. Crescent is adjacent to Basins in birth order, whereas Down and Back is born much earlier. From this, we learn two things: (1) there can be significantly similar connectivity between neurons in one hemilineage that have nonadjacent birth times. (2) There can be significantly similar connectivity between neurons with adjacent birth times, but of different morphological classes. Another example of morphological variants with similar connectivity are late-born ELs, which can be either local or projection neurons. This underscores the idea that temporal cohorts are subunits of hemilineages defined by birth within a tight time window, rather than defined by similar neuronal morphology per se. Further, we note that within a temporal cohort, sequentially born neurons are often, but not always, the most similar in terms of connectivity. For example, within the early-born EL temporal cohort, the fifth-born neuron (A08m) is more similar to the first-born neuron (A08x) than its temporal neighbor (A08j2), the fourth-born EL. Thus, our data, combined with previous studies, show how temporal cohorts are developmental units related to circuits both at the functional and anatomical levels.</p><p>A second open question about temporal cohorts was the extent to which they are copies of each other. One reason this is an interesting question relates to circuit evolution. For the evolution of gene function, a popular model is a ‘duplicate and diverge’ model. Similarly, temporal cohorts could be duplications within a lineage whose function could then diverge, thereby driving circuit evolution. Such an idea motivated us to ask to what extent are temporal cohort copies. For example, do early-born ELs process chordotonal stimuli in a manner identical to how late-born ELs process proprioceptive stimuli? Our data suggest a more complex picture. Early-born and late-born ELs differ in their connectivity patterns—including left–right and following pair similarities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) and inter-and intra-segmental connectivity patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11G–H</xref>), suggesting that early-born and late-born ELs are likely to process information differently. Independent of the evolutionary implications, our data reveal previously unknown diversity in the structure of connectivity between neurons within adjacent temporal cohorts, which may indicate a diversity in underlying circuit assembly mechanisms.</p><p>A third open question is what sets up the borders of temporal cohorts. Previous work used motor neuron temporal cohorts of NB7-1 and NB3-1 as a model to address this question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Meng et al., 2020</xref>). In these stem cells, mis-expression of temporal transcription factors, Hunchback, Pdm, and Castor, modulates the number of motor neurons in a temporal cohort, without changing the size of the lineage. Thus, temporal transcription factors are able to regulate motor neuron temporal cohort borders. But it remains unclear how temporal transcription factors do so. Two, not mutually exclusive possibilities are that they act as transcriptional co-factors to induce differential gene expression programs and/or that they act as pioneer factors to alter the chromatin landscape. For NB3-3, we note that during the 7th to 11th divisions, which generate late-born ELs, NB3-3 expresses Grainyhead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tsuji et al., 2008</xref>), which raises the possibility that Grainyhead may define the late-born EL cohort. Testing this idea is an important future direction.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>A feed-forward circuit is assembled from a select set of temporal cohorts</title><p>It has been hypothesized that nerve cord circuits are assembled by preferential connectivity between distinct temporal cohorts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Meng and Heckscher, 2021</xref>). Our data provide experimental support for this hypothesis. Specifically, we find that interneurons from three temporal cohorts wire together to form a feed-forward circuit—early-born ELs from NB3-3, mid-to-late-born Basins from NB3-5, and late-born Ladders from MNB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref>). Although a vast majority of both the total synaptic input and the strongly connected individual neurons come from these lineages, there are also neurons from other lineages that synapse on early-born ELs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figures 13</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">14</xref>).</p><p>Notably, one other study provided limited supported for the hypothesis that <italic>Drosophila</italic> nerve cord circuits are assembled by preferential connectivity between distinct temporal cohorts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mark et al., 2021</xref>). This study focused on the Jaam-to-late-born EL-to-Saaghi circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heckscher et al., 2015</xref>). Jaams are later-born interneurons in the NB5-2, Notch OFF hemilineage, and Saaghis are later-born interneurons in the NB5-2 Notch ON hemilineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mark et al., 2021</xref>). These data raised several possibilities: (1) there could be global alignment between lineages (e.g., all NB3-3 neurons get synapses from NB5-2 neurons). (2) Notch ON/OFF pairs of neurons might be pre-/postsynaptic partners of neurons within a temporal cohort. (3) Birth order-matched temporal cohorts from different lineages might selectively wire together (e.g., early-to-early and late-to-late connectivity). However, our data demonstrate that none of these possibilities are generally true. Instead, we find a diversity in the manner in which temporal cohorts associate. The one consistent theme is that a limited number of temporal cohorts highly interconnect.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Circuit outputs from one lineage are born before circuit inputs from other lineages</title><p>For most of this discussion, we labeled neurons as ‘early-born’ and ‘late-born.’ These labels refer to the birth order of neurons within a lineage. However, these labels do not refer to the absolute time at which a neuron is born. This is because in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> nerve cord neuroblasts are generated over a large span of embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Broadus et al., 1995</xref>). Thus, early-born neurons from one lineage can be generated at the same time as later-born neurons from a different lineage. Our study is unique in that it determined both neuronal birth order and birth time.</p><p>One of our unexpected findings is that circuit outputs in one lineage are most often born before circuit inputs from other lineages. Broadly speaking, nerve cord and spinal cord contain many local circuits, which output to the brain (e.g., circuits processing somatosensory stimuli) or which output to muscles (e.g., circuits that generate motor patterns). Here, early-born ELs are the outputs of a somatosensory processing circuit and transmit information to the brain. Early-born ELs are born before their local, nerve cord inputs—Ladders, Basins, NB7-1 Notch OFF interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figures 12</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">14</xref>). However, from a first principles perspective, we would expect the opposite. This is because 22 of 30 neuroblasts in the nerve cord are born before NB3-3, and many of them divide multiple times to produce neurons before NB3-3 begins to generate early-born neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Doe, 1992</xref>). Therefore, there should be more neurons born before early-born ELs compared to those born after early-born ELs. And so, by chance alone we would expect early-born ELs to get more input from neurons born earlier or at the same time.</p><p>What are the hypotheses about the importance of birth order of output versus input neurons? In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, birth order is linked to two things: (1) lineage-intrinsic factors such as dynamically changing programs of gene expression in the stem cell, and (2) lineage-extrinsic factors or the dynamic environmental context into which neurons are born. Intrinsic factors, or extrinsic factors, or both may be playing a role in the assembly of this feed-forward circuit. A potential intrinsic mechanism is that of a temporal transcription factor ‘matching code,’ in which early-born ELs, Ladders, and Basins would all be derived from the same temporal transcription factor window. For NB3-5 and MNB, temporal transcription factor expression is only partially characterized. But tantalizingly both early-born ELs and a subset of Ladders are born during a period in which their respective neuroblasts express the temporal transcription factor, Castor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tsuji et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kearney et al., 2004</xref>). A potential extrinsic mechanism is that early-born EL dendrites may provide some type of signal that promotes later born neurons to synapse. There is evidence for such communication among <italic>Drosophila</italic> nerve cord neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Valdes-Aleman et al., 2021</xref>). Finally, it will be interesting to understand if sequential assembly is an absolute requirement, or if instead it facilitates rapid, efficient, or robust circuit assembly.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>In what circumstances does sequential addition of temporal cohorts from different lineages occur?</title><p>Studies of circuit assembly are still in their infancy. It is known that lineage–circuit relationships differ depending on circuit anatomy. But the converse is not known. That is, do all circuits of the same anatomy have a common lineage–circuit relationship? In the case of this study, we focused on a single feed-forward circuit in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval nerve cord. And the specific question it raises is: To what extent is sequential addition of temporal cohorts from different lineages the only mechanism used to assembly all feed-forward motifs? Currently, our answers are only partial and speculative. We note that there are so many connections made among neurons, it is unlikely that just one simple phenomenon that can explain the full complexity. The goals of the current research must be to identify rules and the circumstances where those rules apply. For example, our data rule out a ‘strict’ early-to-early, late-to-late model, meaning that this model alone cannot explain the wiring we observe in this circuit. And yet, an early-to-early model does apply to inter-segmental wiring among temporal cohorts of the same lineage. Further, this early-to-early wiring phenomenon occurs alongside a sequential addition phenomenon. We speculate there could be additional phenomena underlying assembly of this simple motif. For example, beyond local interneurons, we did not determine the birth date of sensory neurons, which provide the initial input to the circuit, nor did we investigate the developmental origins of central brain neurons, which receive the output from the circuit. We do note there is some evidence to support the generality that for assembly of feed-forward circuit motifs, presynaptic interneurons are born after their postsynaptic partners. Specifically, motor neurons are always circuit outputs (to muscle), and, in general, they are among the first neurons to be born during neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Meng and Heckscher, 2021</xref>). Moreover, this pattern holds true in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> nerve cord and spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schmid et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fetcho and McLean, 2010</xref>). Therefore, our data raise the possibility that one of many fundamental rules for circuit assembly is that feed-forward circuits are assembled sequentially from circuit output to circuit input.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> strains and culture</title><p>Fly stocks were maintained at 25°C on standard cornmeal molasses medium.

Determining neuronal birth timing provides context into which a neuron is born (e.g., availability of other early-born neurons, transient signaling cues). In <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos, neuron birth timing and birth order are not identical because during embryogenesis neuroblasts start to divide at different times. For example, NB3-5 is generated relatively early in embryogenesis and generates a large number of neurons, whereas MNB is generated much later and generates fewer neurons. And so, MNB can be generating first-born neurons at the same time that NB3-5 is generating much later-born neurons. We tried to birth date neurons using photo-activation and EdU/BrdU labeling, but were unsuccessful. So, instead, we estimated Basin birth timing using a series of carefully timed heat shocks to generate ts-MARCM clones.

Heat shock stochastically induces FLP expression, which ultimately generates ts-MARCM clones. Heat-shocked samples were incubated at 29°C to boost GAL4 activity. Larvae were dissected at late L1 stage. Individual Al EL clones were visualized in samples with extremely sparse labeling (usually 1–2 clones per CNS) to obtain a clear morphology.

The specific identity of each singly labeled EL neuron was determined by matching the morphology to connectome data (see below). Singly labeled neurons are the sole neuron expressing one fluorophore (either GFP or RFP). The remaining neurons expressed the opposite fluorophore, and we call these alternatively labeled neurons. To determine birth order of singly labeled ELs, we counted the number of alternatively labeled Eve(+) neurons. As a confirmation of assigned birth order, we also counted the number of unlabeled ELs (i.e., GFP[-], RFP[-], Eve[+]). To order A08e3, A08e2, and A083e1, we use the following logic. In our dataset, A08e2 was always singly labeled, and so A08e2 is mostly likely that last-born EL. Further, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> (and other examples) clearly shows both that A08e3 is the third from last-born and that later-born neurons are local. Therefore, we conclude A08e1 must be the second from last-born. The ts-MARCM clonal experiments were performed repeatedly until we assigned the birth order of all the A1 ELs. A total of 58 CNS were scored.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-2"><title>Birth time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>)</title><p>The logic behind using ts-MARCM to determine birth timing is as follows: If a heat shock treatment occurred in embryos at the developmental stage either prior to during the cell division that generated a particular neuron type, then a clone will be induced. On the other hand, if the heat shock treatment occurred in embryos at the developmental stage after a neuroblast divides to give rise to a particular neuron, no clones will be generated. Therefore, determining birth timing requires more accurate staging of the developing embryos compared to experiments used to determine birth order.</p><p>Notably, in our ts-MARCM experiments there is a delay between when the heat shock is delivered to the embryo and the time when FLP recombinase protein has been produced and is active in dividing cells. To estimate this delay, we used ELs to ‘calibrate’ our assay. Specifically, we crossed ts-MARCM transgenes to <italic>EL-GAL4</italic>. We let flies lay eggs for 1 hr, then aged the egg collection for 7 or 9 hr before delivering a heat shock. In embryos aged 7 hr, the most frequently produced single-labeled EL is A08m. A08m is the fifth-born EL. The fifth-born EL is formed at ~9 hr of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tsuji et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gunnar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Demilly et al., 2011</xref>). In embryos aged 9 hr, the most frequently produced single-labeled EL was A08s. A08s is the eighth-born EL. The eighth-born EL is formed at ~11 hr of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gunnar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tsuji et al., 2008</xref>). From these data, we infer that in our assay there is an ~2 hr delay between the time of heat shock and the time of FLP-induced recombination in a dividing cell.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title><italic>BASIN-GAL4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>)</title><p>To determine the birth order and birth timing of Basins, we used the pan-Basin driver, <italic>72F11-GAL4</italic>.

Basins are progeny of NB3-5. NB3-5 divides from stages 9–16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schmid et al., 1999</xref>). Each NB3-5 division gives rise to a GMC, which divides once to produce two progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Monedero Cobeta et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moris-Sanz et al., 2014</xref>). For embryos of each age, we scored the number of hemisegments displaying the following clonal morphologies:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>0:4 clones. In 0:4 clones, all Basins have the same label, indicating the heat shock occurred before NB3-5 divided to generate the first Basin. 0:4 was the most common clone type for heat shocks applied at 6 or 7 hr. This corresponds to stage 12 embryos.</p></list-item><list-item><p>1:3, 1:2, and 1:1 clones. In 1:3 clones, three Basins are labeled with one marker, and the other Basin is singly labeled with the other marker. This indicates the heat shock occurred as NB3-5 was dividing to make the first Basin. In 1:2 clones, NB35 was dividing to make the second Basin. In 1:1 clones, NB3-5 was dividing to make third Basin. Clones of the 1:3, 1:2, and 1:1 types were most frequently observed in when heat shock was performed at 8, 9, and 10 hr. This corresponds to stages 13–15.</p></list-item><list-item><p>0:1 clones. In 0:1 clones, heat shock occurred either as NB3-5 was dividing to make the final Basin or as a GMC was dividing to make a Basin. In embryos heat-shocked at 11 hr, we find only 0:1 clones, suggesting at this time point only GMCs are dividing to produce Basins. This corresponds to late stage 15. We note that there are examples of 0:1 clones in all experiments that provided heat shocks from 6 to 11 hr. This could indicate some stochastic labeling. However, we also note that in embryos heat-shocked at ages 12 and 13 hr, Basin clones were never observed. Lack of clones indicates no cells were dividing to generate Basins.</p></list-item></list><p>Thus, peak Basin production occurs in embryos that have been heat-shocked after they were aged 8–10 hr. Taken together with the idea that there is an estimated delay of 2 hr from time of heat shock to FLP-induced recombination (see ‘EL-GAL4’ section above), this suggests that, in general, the majority of Basin interneurons are generated from NB3-5 between 10 and 12 hr of development, or late stage 13 to stage 15. Furthermore, these data suggest that peak Basin production is likely to occur within a 2-hr time window. This means in 2 hr NB3-5 produces four Basins, or one Basin every 30 min. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae, neuroblasts are thought to divide with a frequency of once every 45 min. Although we cannot definitively rule out the idea that production of one or more neuron type could sneak in, these data are consistent with the idea that Basins are continuously born.</p><p>To gain confidence that our heat shock experiment timing was robust across experiments and genotypes, we performed a similar set of experiments with <italic>Basin-1-GAL4</italic> (aka, <italic>78F07-GAL4</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>). <italic>Basin-1-GAL4</italic> labels only one Basin, which is distinct from <italic>Basin-GAL4</italic>, which labels all four Basins.

We scored neuronal clones in segments A1–A7 based on the assumption that individual neurons should develop roughly at the same time in different abdominal segments, that is, Basin 1 in A1 and in A7 should form roughly simultaneously. This broader scope of scoring, together with the stronger clonal induction, maximized our capability to capture any larval CNS that had at least one stem cell or GMC undergoing division out of seven abdominal segments (or 14 hemi-segments).

We found that all EL interneurons form a bundle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), and that the two non-EL neurons are also part of that bundle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Therefore, in the connectome, we looked for a bundle that contained 13 neurons and that included all previously identified EL interneurons.

Of these, 10 neurons had a medial trajectory upon entering the neuropil. We excluded these neurons from further analysis for two reasons. (1) They are of a number and morphology that is consistent with their being from NB2-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schmid et al., 1999</xref>). (2) The NB3-5 lineage is reported to have the capability of generating as many as 36 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Monedero Cobeta et al., 2017</xref>).

Excluding the 10 putative NB2-4 neurons from the lineage bundle left 24 neurons, which matched the number reported by Schmidt. Of these neurons, five were undifferentiated—with neurites ending prematurely with no synapse input or output. We excluded these from further analysis. The remaining 19 neurons fell into to broad morphological categories—neurons with dorsally projecting neurites and neurons with ventrally projecting neurites. Recently, for many lineages in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> nerve cord, dorsally projecting neurons were shown to belong to a Notch ON hemilineage and ventrally projecting neurons to a Notch OFF hemilineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mark et al., 2021</xref>).

This information was then compared to previous studies that examined neuron lineage assignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bossing et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schmidt et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schmid et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mark et al., 2021</xref>). For neurons outside of A1, where connectome annotations are not as complete as in A1, a similar methodology was used except that the shape of the neuron and the shape, size, and position of the neuron bundle were compared to lineages in A1 to identify the lineage.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Distance analyses</title><sec id="s4-14-1"><title>Nonbinary analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5A, C–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9F and G</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10F</xref>)</title><p>We treated inputs to a neuron as a vector, which contained the number of synaptic contacts. The order of inputs was the same for every neuron. We calculated the Euclidean distance between the two inputs vectors. These distance vectors summarize how similar the two neurons’ inputs are. To test for significance, we created 100 surrogate vectors. We permuted the inputs of each neuron independently, preserving the number of inputs (in degree) but shuffling their identity. We then calculated the Euclidean distances of pairs in the shuffled vectors, building a distribution of Euclidean distances expected by chance. We normalized real data to shuffled data as follows: real-(mean[shuffled])/(standard deviation [shuffled]), which generated z-scores. Z-scores of &gt;+1.96 or &lt;–1.96 were considered significantly more similar or different, respectively, than would be observed by chance (at the alpha = 0.05 level). Significant pairwise differences and similarities were defined as significant positive and negative (respectively) z-scores of the real Euclidean distance, at p&lt;0.05 (two-tailed).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Binary analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>)</title><p>Since we observed a broad variation in synaptic strengths and input onto ELs, to disambiguate the identity of inputs from their respective strength, we repeated distance analyses using input identity only. To do so, we treated inputs to a neuron as a binary vector, with 1 for the presence and 0 for the absence of input, respectively. Otherwise, analysis was identical to nonbinary. Broadly speaking, results from binary and nonbinary analyses were similar. One notable exception is that binary analysis did not identify statistically significant differences.</p><sec id="s4-15-1"><title>Left–right and following pair analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>)</title><p>We examined the normalized (z) Euclidean distance scores obtained from binary connectomes regardless of their significance in two types of neuron pairs separately: Left–right pairs are comprised of the same neurons in the left and right hemisegment, for example, A08j2 A1L and A08j2 A1R.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including P Robin Hiesinger as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Ronald Calabrese as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviews agreed on the high quality of the data, but also raised very similar concerns, leading to clear suggestions for a revision as outlined below.</p><p>The reviewers' shared concerns regard (1) the generalized statements on the role of birth order for connectivity, and (2) the generalized statements about output neurons being born first.</p><p>Regarding concern (1) reviewer #2 suggested: 'To show that birth-time is important for the assembly of the feedforward circuit, can the authors manipulate the relative birth time of the output vs input neurons (e.g. using mis-expression of TTFs) and see whether the feedforward circuit can still be assembled?'</p><p>Regarding concern (2) reviewer #3 suggested '~34% of the interneuron inputs to the EL-early neurons remain unmapped. This includes six neurons that synapse onto the EL-early neurons over 10 times each. It is therefore likely that other lineages contribute neurons that synapse onto the EL-early neurons. […] Lineage-mapping and birth-dating the six neurons with significant synaptic input onto the EL-early neurons would be very helpful as this data would either validate or challenge the conclusions that (1) output neurons are born first and (2) only three lineages contribute to this circuit. As a first step, one could determine whether the cell bodies of the six unidentified neurons are clustered together (which would suggest that they are generated by the same neuroblast). '</p><p>On balance, the reviewers felt that the experimental suggestion regarding concern 1 above would very substantially strengthen the paper, but it is not quaranteed that this experimental approach would be feasible. The authors are thus encouraged to explore this possibility, but a success of such an experiment is not deemed essential.</p><p>Regarding concern (2), the reviewers agreed that an experimental attempt should be made to determine lineage-mapping and birth-dating for at least one or some of the other significant input neurons to support the core conclusion of the paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>On balance, the quality and relevance of the findings clearly outbalance the weaknesses, which I think can mostly, or completely, be addressed with textual changes. Specifically, I would like the authors to address the following points:</p><p>(1) Regarding main conclusion (2), the data showing most synapses with three inputs (Basin, Ladder, A08) onto the chosen early-born Els appears clear, as does their lineage analysis. The interpretation of 'highly selective wiring among temporal cohorts' appears less clear to me. First, the wording 'among' may still be read as preferential connectivity within each of the temporal cohorts, so the intended meaning of preferential connectivity between different temporal cohorts could be written with more clarity.</p><p>Conceptually, the discovery that the three main partners are derived from different lineages, seems a little less surprising to me than presented. Specifically, the authors note that 'Further, we note that temporal cohorts that form synapses on early-born ELs come from just three of the 30 neuroblast in the nerve cord, demonstrating high selectivity.' seems an odd emphasis. The three main synaptic cell types have to each come from some neuroblast lineage. They come from three different ones. That there are 27 others does not argue for or against any specificity. My more simplistic interpretation would be that neurons that are from the same lineage and born around the same time are more similar to each other than other neurons (as shown by authors) simply because their transcriptional program is still more similar. Why this should lead to connectivity amongst themselves is, at least to me, even theoretically entirely unclear (and is indeed not the case). Hence, I would say the findings are rather expected than surprising – synaptic partnerships are between neurons from some not necessarily related lineages – and amongst 30 lineages, the likelihood of three being from three different ones is rather high…</p><p>To generalize this idea, a larger number of neurons would need to be investigate, which I consider beyond the scope of this study. So maybe the authors can just adjust the presentation, discussion, or educate me!</p><p>(2) Regarding main conclusion (3), i.e. output neurons are born first, I find the statement 'Further, this rules out the strict (early-early late-late) hypothesis that neurons born at the same time are circuit partners.' also too strong.</p><p>First, 1 of only 3 input neurons they looked at, the A08 interneurons, are also early-born Els and thus born at the same time – in accordance with the zebrafish example/hypothesis. This is really a low sampling rate – if 2 of the 3 were born at the same time the authors would have had to conclude that the majority behaved like the principle presented in the zebrafish data… Not sure how 'dogmatic' this zebrafish model really is – it is not exactly my field – but it seems to be just an example of a set of principles found in fish, not a dominant model in the field? It seems to me the authors present a new, well-documented instance where two out of three presynaptic neurons are later born than the downstream connected neurons. I really do not see what can be generalized from these numbers.</p><p>Another rather strongly worded conclusion is the notion of input/output. Yes, in this specific partnership under investigation Basin, Ladder and A08 are presynaptic to these early-born Els, but they are all interneurons with further inputs and outputs. Do the authors think that the next output level will again be born earlier? How general is this principle supposed to be? AS it is, this (interesting and well-documented) finding is way too far from (quote: ' a fundamental strategy for assembling feed-forward circuits'). I think the authors' study is important and should be published without the need for such claims. Again, happy to learn if I am missing something.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) The authors can discuss what might underlie the sharp transition between temporal cohorts. What is the correlation between TTF (Hb, Kr, Pdm, Cas) expression with the border of the temporal cohorts, specifically between the transition from early EL or late ELs?</p><p>2) The authors showed that in a feed-forward circuit, early-born EL neurons which are the output neurons are born before input neurons (Ladder and Basin interneurons). They also mentioned in the discussion that motor neurons which are output neurons are among the first-born neurons in the ventral nerve cord and spinal cord. However, questions still remain whether output neurons are born before input neurons in feed-forward circuits is a general mechanism or not. What are the hypotheses about the importance of the birth-order of output vs input neurons? To show that birth-time is important for the assembly of the feedforward circuit, can the authors manipulate the relative birth time of the output vs input neurons (e.g. using mis-expression of TTFs) and see whether the feedforward circuit can still be assembled?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) Figure 1: the ts-MARCM clones should be moved to the main results (from supplemental) since the birth order of neurons in the EL lineage is an important finding of the paper.</p><p>2) Lines 217-235, Figure 4: The network science-based approach is difficult to follow in the text and the figure. A clearer explanation of the methodology and results is needed to help the reader follow along. Figure 4B is particularly hard to understand.</p><p>3) The calcium imaging data (Figure 5 J-L) could be moved to supplemental (especially since similar data was shown in a previous paper, though with a less sensitive tool).</p><p>4) Lineage-mapping and birth-dating the six neurons with significant synaptic input onto the EL-early neurons would be very helpful as this data would either validate or challenge the conclusions that (1) output neurons are born first and (2) only three lineages contribute to this circuit. As a first step, one could determine whether the cell bodies of the six unidentified neurons are clustered together (which would suggest that they are generated by the same neuroblast).</p><p>5) Are the temporal cohorts of the EL-early, Basin and Ladder neurons that wire together generated from the same tTF window? This would be very interesting to investigate as it could provide a model for how neurons find each other in the developing circuit.</p><p>6) The definition of a feed-forward circuit should be included in the Results discussion when it is first reported (currently it is defined in the Discussion). This will help readers who may not be familiar with the term.</p><p>7) Transparent black boxes are visible in the panels of Fig6 C and D. This is likely a formatting error but should be corrected.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79276.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviews agreed on the high quality of the data, but also raised very similar concerns, leading to clear suggestions for a revision as outlined below.</p><p>The reviewers' shared concerns regard (1) the generalized statements on the role of birth order for connectivity, and (2) the generalized statements about output neurons being born first.</p><p>Regarding concern (1) reviewer #2 suggested: 'To show that birth-time is important for the assembly of the feedforward circuit, can the authors manipulate the relative birth time of the output vs input neurons (e.g. using mis-expression of TTFs) and see whether the feedforward circuit can still be assembled?'</p><p>Regarding concern (2) reviewer #3 suggested '~34% of the interneuron inputs to the EL-early neurons remain unmapped.

As you likely know, we have already published two full <italic>eLife</italic> papers in which we manipulate temporal transcription factors and examine motor neuron to muscle connectivity patterns (Meng et al., 2019, 2020). In the context of interneuron to interneuron connectivity, as described in this paper, temporal transcription factor manipulations would be highly informative. However, on a technical level, these experiments would require complex stock building, which would take months. Additionally, exactly how we would assay any resulting changes in synaptic connectivity is a non-trivial problem, likely involving more connectomics work. Thus, experiments could take years to complete. Furthermore, from an intellectual perspective, when we think of temporal transcription factor manipulations, they help us understand how the system responds to specific types of perturbations, but not the naturally-occurring correlations between connectivity, lineage, birth order, and birth timing, which is the goal of this work. Further, as it stands now this paper is fourteen figures long. We do hope to do these experiment soon, and will report on those experiments.</p><p>Regarding concern 2, there were six neurons in question, each of which had substantial input onto early-born ELs. We used a connectomic approach to infer the lineage origin and birth timing within the lineage for each. We find that likely they each belong to a different lineage and most are later-born (Figure 13). One of the neurons, “A03 upstream of A08m” was inferred to be progeny of NB7-1. To confirm this inference, we made single neuron clones using an available NB7-1-GAL4 driver (Figure 14). Then, to birth date the neuron, we used a connectomics approach, measuring the cortex neurite length as a proxy for birth time within the lineage (Figure 14). We find that “A03 upstream of A08m” is born on or after the 12th division of NB7-1 (Figure 14). The early-born ELs are born from NB3-3 at the time when NB7-1 is performing the fifth to ninth division. We conclude that “A03 upstream of A08m” must be born after early-born ELs (Figure 14). Furthermore, we find that three other interneurons from the NB7-1 lineage also synapse onto early-born ELs, albeit weakly. And these NB7-1 interneurons must also be later born than early-born ELs. Unfortunately, there are not good reagents available for us to conduct similar experiments for the remaining five neurons, which come from other lineages.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>On balance, the quality and relevance of the findings clearly outbalance the weaknesses, which I think can mostly, or completely, be addressed with textual changes.

Hence, I would say the findings are rather expected than surprising – synaptic partnerships are between neurons from some not necessarily related lineages – and amongst 30 lineages, the likelihood of three being from three different ones is rather high…</p><p>To generalize this idea, a larger number of neurons would need to be investigate, which I consider beyond the scope of this study. So maybe the authors can just adjust the presentation, discussion, or educate me!</p></disp-quote><p>The old text on lines 410-412 read: “Further, we note that temporal cohorts that form synapses on early-born ELs come from just three of the 30 neuroblast in the nerve cord, demonstrating high selectivity”.

What we meant by using the word “strict” was that early-early and late-late was the only mechanism at play and that our data rule out such a possibility.

Furthermore, we found that early-born ELs from different segments synapse with each other, which raised the possibility that an early-to-early model could also explain the observed pattern of wiring. However, there is suggestive evidence that an exclusive early-to-early model cannot explain the full complexity of wiring patterns seen in motor circuits (Kishore et al., 2014)(Menelaou et al., 2014)(Song et al., 2020). Thus, here, we test the hypothesis that early-born ELs wire with neurons from other lineages, which born at the same time as early-born ELs.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>First, 1 of only 3 input neurons they looked at, the A08 interneurons, are also early-born Els and thus born at the same time – in accordance with the zebrafish example/hypothesis. This is really a low sampling rate – if 2 of the 3 were born at the same time the authors would have had to conclude that the majority behaved like the principle presented in the zebrafish data… Not sure how 'dogmatic' this zebrafish model really is – it is not exactly my field – but it seems to be just an example of a set of principles found in fish, not a dominant model in the field? It seems to me the authors present a new, well-documented instance where two out of three presynaptic neurons are later born than the downstream connected neurons. I really do not see what can be generalized from these numbers.</p></disp-quote><p>When thinking about sampling rate, consideration of units is important. For the unit of lineages, we had previously examined 3. But, for the unit of neurons, we examined over 300, and for the unit of synapses, we examined over 1900 (Figure 6E, Table S2). Nonetheless, even when focusing at the unit of lineages, we now include new data (Figures 13, 15), which pushes the observation to 5 of ~7 lineages (71%). We also include further context about the observation that most neurons that synapse onto early-born ELs are born after early-born ELs. In the Discussion, on lines 759-764:</p><p>“However, from a first principles perspective, we would expect the opposite. This is because 22 of 30 neuroblasts in the nerve cord are born before NB3-3, and many of them divide multiple times to produce neurons before NB3-3 begins to generate early-born neurons (Doe 1992). Therefore, there should be more neurons born before early-born ELs compared to those born after early-born ELs. And so, by chance alone we would expect early-born ELs to get more input from neurons born earlier or at the same time.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another rather strongly worded conclusion is the notion of input/output. Yes, in this specific partnership under investigation Basin, Ladder and A08 are presynaptic to these early-born Els, but they are all interneurons with further inputs and outputs. Do the authors think that the next output level will again be born earlier? How general is this principle supposed to be? AS it is, this (interesting and well-documented) finding is way too far from (quote: ' a fundamental strategy for assembling feed-forward circuits'). I think the authors' study is important and should be published without the need for such claims. Again, happy to learn if I am missing something.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment.

Previous work used motor neuron temporal cohorts of NB7-1 and NB3-1 as a model to address this question (Meng et al., 2019)(Meng et al., 2020). In these stem cells, mis-expression of temporal transcription factors, Hunchback, Pdm, and Castor modulates the number of motor neurons in a temporal cohort, without changing the size of the lineage. Thus, temporal transcription factors are able to regulate motor neuron temporal cohort borders. But, it remains unclear how temporal transcription factors do so. Two, not mutually exclusive possibilities are that they act as transcriptional co-factors to induce differential gene expression programs, and/or that they act as pioneer factors to alter the chromatin landscape. For NB3-3, we note the during the seventh to eleventh divisions, which generates late-born ELs, NB3-3 expresses Grainyhead (Tsuji et al., 2008), which raises the possibility that Grainyhead may define the late-born EL cohort. Testing this idea is an important future direction.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors showed that in a feed-forward circuit, early-born EL neurons which are the output neurons are born before input neurons (Ladder and Basin interneurons). They also mentioned in the discussion that motor neurons which are output neurons are among the first-born neurons in the ventral nerve cord and spinal cord. However, questions still remain whether output neurons are born before input neurons in feed-forward circuits is a general mechanism or not. What are the hypotheses about the importance of the birth-order of output vs input neurons? To show that birth-time is important for the assembly of the feedforward circuit, can the authors manipulate the relative birth time of the output vs input neurons (e.g. using mis-expression of TTFs) and see whether the feedforward circuit can still be assembled?</p></disp-quote><p>We address the question of whether the phenomenon observed in this study applies to other circuits in a new section of the Discussion (lines 781-806):</p><p>“In what circumstances does sequential addition of temporal cohorts from different lineages occur?

In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, birth order is linked to two things: (1) lineage intrinsic factors such as dynamically changing programs of gene expression in the stem cell, (2) lineage extrinsic factors or the dynamic environmental context into which neurons are born. Intrinsic factors, or extrinsic factors, or both may be playing a role in the assembly of this feed forward circuit. A potential intrinsic mechanism is that of a temporal transcription factor “matching code”, in which early-born ELs, Ladders, and Basins would all be derived from the same temporal transcription factor window. For NB3-5 and MNB, temporal transcription factor expression is only partially characterized. But, tantalizingly both early-born ELs and a subset of Ladders are born during a period in which their respective neuroblasts express the temporal transcription factor, Castor (Tsuji et al., 2008)(Kearney et al., 2004). A potential extrinsic mechanism is that early-born EL dendrites may provide some type of signal that promotes later born neurons to synapse. There is evidence for such communication among Drosophila nerve cord neurons (Valdes-Aleman et al., 2021). Finally, it will be interesting to understand if sequential assembly is an absolute requirement, or if instead it facilitates rapid, efficient, or robust circuit assembly.”</p><p>We love the idea of manipulating temporal transcription factors in the context of the early-born EL feed-forward circuit.

Lines 253-269 now read:</p><p>“To quantify patterns of connectivity we measured two features—similarity among left-right pairs of neurons and similarity among following pairs. An example of similarity among left-right pairs is A08j3 A1L and A08j3 A1R, both of which have significantly similar connectivity compared to A08x A1L (Figure 5A). In contrast, A08c A1L, but not A08c A1R, has significantly similar connectivity compared to A08o A1L (Figure 5A). In general, early-born ELs have significant similarities between left-right pairs of neurons (open purple circles in Figure 5B), whereas late-born ELs did not (open magenta circles, in Figure 5B). An example of similarity among following pairs is that A08c A1L has significantly similar connectivity compared to A08s A1L, which is adjacent to A08c in birth order (Figure 5A). Both early-born and late-born ELs have similarities among following pairs (filled circles in 5B). The idea that neurons within a temporal cohort are more similar to neurons next born in the sequence shows that within a temporal cohort there are graded transitions in connectivity patterns. Additionally, early-born ELs have similarities with many neurons within their temporal cohort, whereas late-born neurons only tend to be similar to neurons that were born next in the sequence (Figure 5A).

We have included two new Figures, Figure 13 and 14 and a new Results section. Lines 508-574:</p><p>“Other neurons that are highly connected to early-born ELs come from multiple different lineages and most are born after early-born Els</p><p>In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval nerve cord, individual neurons make different numbers of synapses onto their various downstream partners. In this section, we focus on neurons that are highly connected to early-born ELs, but not in the three lineages previously discussed. We considered a neuron to be highly connected if it has 10 or more synapses onto early-born ELs (Table S6). We choose this criterion for highly connected neurons, first, because a majority of synapses onto early-born ELs are made by these neurons, and second, because these neurons are likely to be important drivers of the activity of early-born ELs. In the sections above, we focused on Ladder, Basin, and Early-born EL interneurons, which together with Chordotonal sensory neurons, account for the majority of neurons highly connected to early-born EL in A1 (Figure 13A, Table S6). From these data, we learned two “rules”. First, interneurons in the feed forward circuit come from temporal cohorts in three lineages. Second, output interneurons from one lineage are born before input interneurons from other lineages. Additionally, there are six other highly connected neurons (Figure 13A-C). Here, we characterize the developmental origins of these other neurons to understand the extent to which the rules apply.</p><p>First, we wanted to understand the extent to which the six other highly connected interneurons could be lineage-related. To assign lineage identity, we examined their cell body position and neurite fasciculation pattern. The six other neurons likely come from six different lineages (Figure 13B-C). Of these one is NB3-5, which generates Basin neurons. This means NB3-5 neurons contribute more synapses onto early-born ELs than we had previously appreciated. We conclude that together NB3-5, MNB, and NB3-3 generate a majority (75%) of interneurons that are highly connected to early-born ELs. However, the relationship is not exclusive, and interneurons from other lineages do also synapse multiple times onto early-born ELs.</p><p>Next, we wanted to understand the extent to which the six other highly connected interneurons could be born after early-born ELs. To do so, we examined the cell body position of each along the medio-lateral axis (Figure 13B’). Of the six, one had a medial cell body close to the neuropile, suggesting it was early-born within its lineage; four had cell body positions on or close to the lateral edge of the CNS, suggesting they were late-born with their respective lineages; and one had an intermediate cell body position that is difficult to interpret (Figure 13C). These data, along with our previous birth dating form Basins, Ladders, and ELs, suggest 70% of highly connected interneurons are born after early-born ELs. We conclude that large majority of highly connected neurons in this circuit are born after the circuit ouput neurons (early-born ELs), but that there are exceptions to this “rule”.</p><p>Finally, for one of the other highly connected other interneurons, we wanted to experimentally validate our lineage assignment and to more directly determine its birth time relative to early-born ELs. We chose to focus on neuron A03 upstream of A08m because it is inferred to be progeny of NB7-1, and NB7-1 is an extremely well-characterized lineage. NB7-1 delaminates early during neurogenesis (J. J. Broadus et al., 1995). The first six divisions of NB7-1 generate motor neurons and undifferentiated motor neuron siblings (Seroka and Doe, 2019)(Lacin et al., 2009). Then, NB7-1 divides approximately 14 more times, generating interneurons (Meng et al., 2019), one of which is thought to be neuron A083 upstream of A08m (Mark et al., 2021). We labeled neuron A03 upstream of A08m using a NB7-1-GAL4 driver line to create Multi Color Flip Out clones, which validates the lineage assignment (Figure 14A-B). Then, in the connectome, we measured the cortex neurite length of neuron A03 upstream of A08m and the other interneurons within the same hemilineage as a proxy for birth order (Figure 14C-D). At the earliest, neuron A03 upstream of A08m is the sixth-born interneuron, and because there are six divisions of NB7-1 before interneurons are made, neuron A03 upstream of A08m must be born on or after the 12th division (Figure 14E). To compare the birth timing of neuron A03 upstream of A08m, to the birth timing of early-born ELs, we present the following logic. NB3-3 and NB7-1 are generated at ~400 minutes and ~230 minutes, respectively (Doe, 1992). Neuroblasts divide every 45 minutes. And so, NB3-3 is four divisions behind of NB7-1 ([400 minutes -230 minutes]/45 divisions / minute = 3.8 divisions). Early-born ELs are made during the second to sixth divisions of NB3-3, which corresponds to the fifth to ninth divisions of NB7-1 (Figure 14E). Because NB7-1 produces neuron A03 upstream of A08m no earlier than the 12 division, we conclude it must be born after the early-born ELs. In addition, we noticed that three other interneurons in the same hemilineage as “A03 upstream of A08m” synapse onto early-born ELs, albeit less strongly. The cortex neurite length of these neurons shows they largely have birth times adjacent to neuron A03 upstream of A08m (Figure 14D), which is consistent with the idea that these neurons are a temporal cohort. Using the same logic as described earlier in this paragraph, we find all the NB7-1 interneurons that synapse onto early-born ELs are born after the early-born ELs themselves (Figure 14E). Thus, analysis of NB7-1 shows us that neurons from a third lineage follows the patterns identified for Ladder and Basin temporal cohorts. Furthermore, these data show additional temporal cohorts have neurons that synapse onto early-born ELs, but not as extensively as neurons in the Ladder, Basin, or early-born EL temporal cohorts.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Are the temporal cohorts of the EL-early, Basin and Ladder neurons that wire together generated from the same tTF window?
