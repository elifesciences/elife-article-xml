stochastic, noisy, and multi-step process, in which fluctuations at every step can cause variations in RNA synthesis, and affect physiology and differentiation decisions in otherwise identical cells. However, it has been an experimental challenge to directly link the stochastic events at the promoter to transcript production. Here we established a fast fluorescence in situ hybridization (fastFISH) method that takes advantage of intrinsically unstructured nucleic acid sequences to achieve exceptionally fast rates of specific hybridization (∼10e7 M<sup>−1</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>), and allows deterministic detection of single nascent transcripts. Using a prototypical RNA polymerase, we demonstrated the use of fastFISH to measure the kinetic rates of promoter escape, elongation, and termination in one assay at the single-molecule level, at sub-second temporal resolution. The principles of fastFISH design can be used to study stochasticity in gene regulation, to select targets for gene silencing, and to design nucleic acid nanostructures.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01775.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01775.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01775.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The body produces proteins by transcribing DNA (genes) to make messenger RNA, which is then translated to make a protein. Transcription begins when an enzyme called RNA polymerase binds to the DNA and catalyzes the process by which genetic information from the double helix is copied to a complementary RNA transcript, which subsequently becomes the messenger RNA.</p><p>Because a living cell usually contains only one or a few copies (alleles) of a given gene, molecular fluctuations play a crucial role in cellular transcription. Therefore, studying transcription kinetics at the level of single molecules may provide critical insights into how cells deal with—or even take advantage of—molecular fluctuations. A number of different single-molecule techniques can be used to follow transcription, but these techniques are often relatively slow compared to transcription in living cells, or they suffer from other problems such as only being able to study one step in the transcription process.</p><p>Now, Zhang, Revyakin et al. have systematically devised a technique called ‘fastFISH’ that is fast enough to track the production of single RNA molecules directly and instantaneously. FastFISH builds on an existing technique called FISH—short for fluorescence in situ hybridization—in which fluorescent molecules are attached to single strands of DNA or RNA. These single strands pair with specific regions of complementary DNA or RNA molecules, and they can be visualized with a fluorescence microscope. However, conventional FISH is a ‘snap-shot’ technique that is not suitable for making real-time observations under physiological conditions.</p><p>FastFISH relies on single strands of fluorescently labeled DNA and RNA that bind to complementary strands of DNA or RNA extremely quickly, even under physiological conditions, because they contain only three of the four ‘regular’ nucleotides that make up DNA or RNA. As a proof of principle, Zhang, Revyakin et al. used fastFISH to study the kinetics of transcription by the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase and were able to measure multiple stages of the transcription cycle in a single-molecule experimental setup.</p><p>By allowing each stage of transcription to be tracked in real-time at the level of single-molecules, fastFISH will permit a more in-depth analysis of the factors that regulate how genes are expressed as proteins in our cells. Moreover, the ability to design single-strand probes that bind rapidly to DNA and RNA targets could have many additional applications, including new strategies for more efficient gene silencing.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01775.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01775.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>single-molecule</kwd><kwd>real-time</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>fluorescence</kwd><kwd>in situ hybridization</kwd><kwd>unstructured nucleic acid</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lavis</surname><given-names>Luke D</given-names></name><name><surname>Tjian</surname><given-names>Robert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new technique called fastFISH enables nearly real-time and stoichiometric detection of nascent RNA and the tracking of individual stages of transcription at the level of single-molecules.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transcription is the first, and frequently the most regulated step in the flow of genetic information from DNA to protein. Transcription is a dynamic, multi-step process in which RNA polymerase (RNAP) (i) binds to the promoter to form the closed complex (RP<sub>c</sub>); (ii) melts the promoter to form the open complex (RP<sub>o</sub>); (iii) performs several abortive cycles of synthesis and release of short 2–12 nt RNA products as the initial transcribing complex (RP<sub>itc</sub>); (iv) escapes the promoter; (v) undergoes some promoter-proximal pausing; (vi) forms an elongating complex (RD<sub>e</sub>) whose processivity can either be interrupted by more pauses or stimulated by trailing RNAPs and elongation factors; and, finally (vii) terminates at the end of the transcription unit (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">DeHaseth et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Murakami and Darst, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheung and Cramer, 2012</xref>). Due to the low copy number of genes in a cell (usually one in prokaryotes and two in eukaryotes), molecular fluctuations at any of the above steps may cause large cell-to-cell variability in the amount of the final RNA transcript produced in populations of otherwise genetically identical cells grown under identical conditions, and thus can affect gene expression, and cell physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ogawa, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Raj and Van Oudenaarden, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yamanaka, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gupta et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lionnet and Singer, 2012</xref>). Therefore, understanding how molecular fluctuations at different steps of the transcription cycle alter transcriptional outcomes is required to dissect the mechanism of gene regulation.</p><p>Single-molecule techniques are ideally suited to directly monitor molecular fluctuations in multi-step reactions in real-time, without averaging out their inherent stochasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Weiss, 1999</xref>), and have provided important insights into the dynamics of transcription, unattainable by conventional ensemble methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bai et al., 2006</xref>). For instance, single-molecule assays based on optical nanomanipulation have revealed pausing and backtracking of RD<sub>e</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Neuman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shaevitz et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Galburt et al., 2007</xref>) and measured the force and the torque generated by RD<sub>e</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ma et al., 2013</xref>). Methods based on magnetic nanomanipulation and single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer have probed conformational changes in DNA and RNAP within RP<sub>o</sub>, and RP<sub>itc</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kapanidis et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Revyakin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chakraborty et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Robb et al., 2013</xref>). Finally, single-molecule localization studies have probed the dynamics of the initial promoter search by RNAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Friedman et al., 2013</xref>). However, most current single-molecule methods focus on only one step of transcription, and are not well suited to relate protein-DNA complex assembly and dynamics during multiple stages of the transcription cycle to RNA production. In addition, most methods do not measure RNA production directly, but rather infer it from changes in DNA conformation or movement of RNAP along the DNA. Most recently, single-molecule tracking of key protein-DNA interactions coupled with detection of the RNA production has been demonstrated in the bacterial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Friedman and Gelles, 2012</xref>) and human transcription systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Revyakin et al., 2012</xref>). The former study achieved time resolution for RNA detection on the order of ∼10 s, and thus provided a dynamic, quantitative view of the full transcription cycle of bacterial RNAP. However, time scales of many events in transcription are on the order of ∼1 s, particularly under physiological conditions (for instance, the residence time of transcription factors on DNA (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hager et al., 2009</xref>), the rate of initiation and promoter clearance by RNAPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Revyakin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tang et al., 2009</xref>), and the expected time delay between cooperatively elongating RNAPs molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Epshtein and Nudler, 2003</xref>)). Thus, a real-time method for nascent transcript detection at ∼1 s time scales would significantly enhance our ability to dissect the dynamics of the transcription process, and to correlate stochastic fluctuations at different steps with transcriptional outcomes.</p><p>Currently, the most sensitive and specific methods for detecting RNA transcripts continue to rely on complementary nucleic acid hybridization. However, oligonucleotide probes typically hybridize several orders of magnitude slower than diffusion under physiological conditions (effective rate constant <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>on</italic></sub> less than 10<sup>5</sup> M<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chan et al., 1995</xref> and references therein]) and, as a result, do not permit real-time nascent RNA detection with common single-molecule setups, such as total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. Here we present a fast fluorescence in situ hybridization method (fastFISH) to detect synthesis of nascent RNA transcripts at sub-second time resolution, at the single-molecule level. The method takes advantage of our finding that single-stranded nucleic acid probes with sequences comprised of just three of the four bases (A, U and C for RNA probes, and A, T, and G for the complementary DNA targets) are intrinsically unstructured and, as a result, hybridize at exceptionally fast rates (∼10<sup>7</sup> M<sup>−1</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>) without compromising sequence specificity. As a proof of concept, we applied fastFISH to probe the production of nascent RNA transcripts by the speedy bacteriophage T7 RNA Polymerase (T7 RNAP) in vitro. Furthermore, by using fastFISH in combination with fluorescently labeled RNAP, we dissected the full T7 RNAP transcription cycle (promoter binding, promoter escape, elongation, and termination). FastFISH can be used to study transcription by multi-subunit prokaryotic and eukaryotic RNA polymerases at the level of stochastic molecular interactions. The rules for generating fastFISH probe-target pairs can also be used for gene silencing, gene profiling and bottom-up assembly of nucleic acid nanostructures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rothemund, 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Design and characterization of fastFISH hybridization probes</title><p>To achieve real-time nascent RNA detection, we set out to find a general rule for designing RNA-probe pairs that hybridize at the fastest possible rates. Hybridization of two single-stranded nucleic acid fragments requires unfolding of the fragments into unstructured coils, which then anneal to form an intermolecular base paired helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lima et al., 1992</xref> and references therein). In support of this notion, nucleic acid probes with less stable secondary structures show faster hybridization rates to complementary nucleic acid targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lima et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kushon et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang and Drlica, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yilmaz et al., 2006</xref>). Likewise, decreasing the length of hairpins in conventional molecular beacons increases their hybridization rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tsourkas et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, we reasoned that intrinsically unstructured nucleic acid oligonucleotide pairs of optimal lengths should have the fastest hybridization kinetics under physiological conditions without compromising specificity.</p><p>To systematically examine the propensity of RNA sequences to form base-paired secondary structures, we used the nucleic acid structure prediction tool Mfold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zuker, 2003</xref>) to calculate the free energy of self-folding, <italic>ΔG</italic><sub><italic>37°C</italic></sub>, of randomly selected short RNA sequences (N = 338,417). We chose RNA sequence with length of 19 nt and GC content between 0.4 and 0.6 as representative of a typical oligonucleotide primer. We found that <italic>ΔG</italic><sub><italic>37°C</italic></sub> values were mostly negative and widely distributed (−1.7 ± 1.7 kCal mol<sup>−1</sup>), indicating that an average random 19-mer RNA sequence is mostly structured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Next, we closely examined a subset of 19-mer RNA sequences that had positive <italic>ΔG</italic><sub><italic>37°C</italic></sub> (&gt;+2 kCal mol<sup>−1</sup>, N = 2,768, &lt;1% of the total pool of random sequences), and found that these mostly unstructured sequences were composed predominantly of only three bases A, U, and C (∼84% had only 2 G residues or less, significantly less than the 4.75 G residues expected on average, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The bias towards the lower G-content in the unstructured sequences was not surprising, because guanine is the most potent in base-paring interactions: it forms a triple hydrogen bond with cytosine and a wobble pair with uracil. We then calculated <italic>ΔG</italic><sub><italic>37°C</italic></sub> for randomly picked 19-mers composed of only A, U, and C (N = 99,777, GC content between 0.4 and 0.6, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), and found that these AUC-sequences had mostly positive <italic>ΔG</italic><sub><italic>37°C</italic></sub>, with a much narrower distribution (+2.5 ± 0.6 kCal mol<sup>−1</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Analysis of other three-base-derived RNA sequences (AUG, CAG, CUG) indicated that AUC-sequences were unique in their largely positive <italic>ΔG</italic><sub><italic>37°C</italic></sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Calculation of <italic>ΔG</italic><sub><italic>37°C</italic></sub> for random DNA 19-mers (that could be used as complementary probes for RNA targets) indicated that ATG-based and ATC-based DNA 19-mers were also significantly less structured than their four-base counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that the use of the AUC alphabet for RNA targets, and ATG alphabet for DNA probes should allow the fastest annealing reactions under physiological temperature of 37°C.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01775.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Design of fastFISH probe-target pairs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Probability distribution of Mfold-calculated free energies of self-folding of randomly selected, single-stranded 19-mer RNA (left) and DNA (right) oligonucleotides, composed of three or four bases.

This algorithm, commonly used in lossless data compression programs, calculates the minimal number of operations required to reconstruct a sequence of symbols by copying and inserting segments of an existing sub-sequence. Thus, nucleic acid sequences that contain repetitive elements would have a lower LZ complexity (and would be less specific in hybridization) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wright and Church, 2002</xref>). We found that three-letter 19-mer sequences had complexity indices of 8.1 ± 0.8 (N = 99,777), while four-letter 19-mers had complexity indices of 9.3 ± 0.8 (N = 338,417, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). As a comparative reference, we calculated complexity indices for tiling 19-mers in all exons of human chromosome 22 to be 8.9 ± 1.0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Importantly, a significant fraction of three-letter 19-mers (∼31%) had complexity indices of 9 and higher, which matched or exceeded the average complexity of human exons. These calculations indicate that a significant fraction of the random probe sequences composed of only three bases nevertheless retain sequence complexity and specificity that match their physiological, four-base derived counterparts.</p><p>We applied the AUC rule and the complexity filter to generate two candidate probe-target pairs (referred to as F1 and F2). The calculated <italic>ΔG</italic><sub><italic>37°C</italic></sub> for the F1 and F2 pairs were +1.5 and +2.2 kCal mol<sup>−1</sup>, respectively, for the AUC-based RNA targets, and +1.0 and +0.9 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup> for their ATG-based complementary DNA probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), suggesting that the pairs are mostly unstructured and likely to be fast-hybridizing. Indeed, the F1 and F2 probes annealed to their surface-immobilized RNA targets at exceptionally fast rates—6 × 10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>−1</sup>s<sup>−1</sup> and 4 × 10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>−1</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>, respectively, as measured by TIRF-based Colocalization Single-Molecule Spectroscopy (CoSMoS, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Friedman et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). These on-rates were at least 100-fold faster than typical four-base nucleic acid probes of similar lengths reported in literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lima et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kushon et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang and Drlica, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Friedman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yilmaz et al., 2006</xref>). Consistent with the AUC rule, introducing back one or more G residues into the F2 RNA target sequence decreased the rate of its hybridization to the complementary DNA probe (10-fold reduction for one G residue and 300-fold reduction for four G residues), which correlated with the progressively lower free energies of self-folding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). We conclude that the target sequences designed using the AUC rule, combined with the complexity filter, achieved our goal of generating superior hybridization kinetics for fast transcript detection.</p><p>Although the F1 and F2 probes were exceptionally fast, detection of RNA on the sub-second time scales would require the use of fluorescent probe concentrations above 100 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Such concentrations are generally incompatible with common single-molecule detection setups such as TIRF microscopy, due to high fluorescence background from the freely diffusing, unbound probe molecules. We overcame this problem by attaching a quencher to the single-stranded probe at the end opposite of the fluorophore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marras et al., 2002</xref>). This self-quenching strategy enabled the use of free probes at concentrations up to 1 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). We believe that, in the absence of the secondary structure, the self-quenching effect was likely mediated by random polymer motion and/or contact quenching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Johansson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marras et al., 2002</xref>).

The RD<sub>e</sub> complex would then remain on the DNA until it runs off at +295. At the expected average RNAP elongation rate of 240 nt s<sup>−1</sup>, the F1 probe would have a brief ∼1 s window of opportunity to ‘catch’ the nascent transcript at the DNA molecule of origin. Probe hybridization to the RNA product would then be observed as a fluorescent spot co-localizing with the DNA locus.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> shows the co-localization analysis of probe-DNA interactions in a typical single-molecule fastFISH experiment.

Specific probe-DNA interactions were observed, as indicated by a prominent peak at position (0, 0) of the co-localization histogram. In a typical experiment, 10–30% of DNA templates in a field of view co-localized with a probe. This apparent incomplete template utilization was not due to inefficient probe hybridization (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and ‘Discussion’), but, instead, was likely limited by the accessibility of the DNA template due to surface interference. No probe-DNA interactions were observed in a control experiment with a DNA template containing a null mutant promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Raskin et al., 1993</xref>), indicating that the co-localization was due to promoter-specific transcription. We also performed real-time single-molecule transcription experiments using the other unstructured probe, F2, and obtained nearly identical DNA-probe co-localization results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref>).

Therefore, we fluorescently labeled RNAP with Cy5 using HaloTag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), supplied Cy5-RNAP and NTPs to an imaging flow cell containing immobilized DNA templates, and monitored Cy5-RNAP interactions with the DNA molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We observed transient RNAP binding events that lasted between 0.08 and 8 s, and were promoter-specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>). The events were comprised of two distinct populations: short-lived events whose dwell times fit well to a single exponential distribution (mean dwell time <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub> ∼0.14 s); and a long-lived, bell-shaped population skewed towards long-lived events (peak dwell time <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>1</italic></sub> ∼1.7 s).

First, no binding of F1 after RNAP binding was observed in the absence of NTPs (data not shown), or in the presence of only ATP and GTP, which limited initial transcription to positions from +1 to +6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that the probe bound specifically to the nascent RNA, and not to RNAP or to the DNA template. Second, no F1 probe binding was observed in the absence of the target sequence in the transcribed segment of the template, indicating that hybridization was specific for the F1 target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Third, and most importantly, when we moved the F1 target sequence from position +28 to position +181, we found that binding of the probe was delayed by an additional ∼0.5 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>), consistent with the extra time RD<sub>e</sub> needs to transcribe the extra 153 bp DNA segment at 300 nt s<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).</p><p>To estimate the efficiency of nascent RNA detection by fastFISH, we post-synchronized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blanchard et al., 2004</xref>) all RNAP-DNA and probe-DNA interactions by RNAP run-off at the end of productive transcription events (defined as RNAP interactions that lasted ≥0.8 s), and super-imposed them to generate heat maps of all RNAP-DNA and probe-DNA interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). We found that ∼81% of RD<sub>e</sub>s contained an RNA probe immediately before run-off (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). The residual ∼19% of undetected RD<sub>e</sub>s were mostly likely due to the presence of dark fluorophores in the chemically synthesized probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Revyakin et al., 2012</xref>), and the inherent stochasticity of probe hybridization. The heat map analysis of all RNAP-DNA and probe-DNA interactions also showed that, in the majority of cases (∼72%), the probe and RNAP dissociated from the DNA simultaneously upon run-off (<italic>ΔT</italic><sub><italic>off</italic></sub> ∼0).

The hybridization rates of fastFISH probes were near ∼10<sup>7</sup> M<sup>−1</sup>s<sup>−1</sup> which exceeded annealing rates of probe-target sequences reported in literature by up to three orders of magnitude. We followed three simple rules in fastFISH probe-target design. First, the targets and the probes should be unstructured, which we achieved using sequences composed of only three bases—A, U, and C for RNA targets, and A, T, and G for DNA probes. We note that the three-base rule of fast hybridization also applies to DNA–DNA pairs (data not shown). Second, a complexity filter should be applied to ensure specificity and 1-to-1 stoichiometry of hybridization. This is essential for single-molecule counting, and cannot be achieved by using repetitive sequences such as poly (A/T). Third, fastFISH probes should be self-quenched. This reduces the fluorescence background from the free probe, and enables the use of near-micromolar probe concentrations for real-time single-molecule imaging. Self-quenching of fastFISH probes likely occurs through random polymer motion and/or contact quenching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Johansson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marras et al., 2002</xref>), and does not rely on hairpin formation (which is known to compromise hybridization rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tsourkas et al., 2003</xref>]). The choice of probe length of ∼20 nucleotides was based on the end-to-end distance of a 20-mer nucleic acid duplex, expected to separate the fluorophore and the quencher beyond typical Forster distance (4∼6 nm) upon hybridization. Shorter probes in combination with a short-range quencher may be used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhu et al., 2005</xref>) if the potential faster off-rate of the probe is not a concern. We note that probe hybridization rates could be further increased using peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probes, because the neutral charge of the PNA backbone is expected to reduce the electrostatic repulsion between the probe and the target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kuhn et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>To use fastFISH, the three-base target sequence must be inserted within the context of an existing four-base (i.e., ‘structured’) RNA sequence, which, in principle, might sequester the fastFISH target from hybridization. However, in our experience, the presence of adjacent four-base sequences usually does not interfere with co-transcriptional RNA detection, likely because four-letter sequences become kinetically trapped within their own secondary structures. Nevertheless, the use of a secondary structure prediction tool is recommended to ensure that flanking sequences do not interfere with the fastFISH target.</p><p>As a proof of concept, we used fastFISH to dissect the full transcription cycle of the prototypical single-subunit T7 RNAP, and obtained kinetic estimates of promoter search (upper limit of non-specific RNAP-DNA interactions: <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>search</italic></sub> <italic>∼</italic>80 ms), promoter binding, promoter escape, elongation and termination by RNAP (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We recorded several differences between our measurements and previous studies. First, the measured rate of stochastic RP<sub>c</sub> dissociation (<italic>T</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub> <italic>∼0.3 s</italic>, <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>off</italic></sub> ∼3 s<sup>−1</sup>) was higher than what had been reported in previous ensemble and single-molecule studies (<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>off</italic></sub> from 0.4 s<sup>−1</sup> to 1 s<sup>−1</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tang and Patel, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tang et al., 2009</xref>]). Second, the measured rate of promoter escape (<italic>T</italic><sub><italic>abortive</italic></sub> ∼0.2 s, <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>escape</italic></sub> ∼5 s<sup>−1</sup>) was higher than in previous ensemble and single-molecule studies (<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>escape</italic></sub> from 0.25 s<sup>−1</sup> to 1 s<sup>−1</sup>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Skinner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tang et al., 2009</xref>]). Third, the measured peak elongation rate (300 ± 60 nt s<sup>−1</sup>) was somewhat higher than in previous ensemble measurements (∼240 nt s<sup>−1</sup>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bonner et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Golomb and Chamberlin, 1974</xref>), and significantly higher than in previous single-molecule measurements (from 40 nt s<sup>−1</sup> to 120 nt s<sup>−1</sup>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Thomen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Skinner et al., 2004</xref>). The overall faster rates measured in our study are likely due to the use of optimal physiological temperatures (37°C). Indeed, the catalytic rate of the T7 RNAP measured in steady-state conditions is known to increase up to 10-fold in the 20°C–37°C temperature range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maslak and Martin, 1993</xref>). Another potential contributing factor to the faster observed rates could be that our method to dissect the RNAP transcription cycle does not require the use of force, or covalent modification of the DNA templates.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01775.015</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Summary of RNAP transcriptional kinetics measured in this work.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01775.015">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01775.015</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-01775-fig5-v1"/></fig></p><p>We note that the dwell time distribution of productive RNAP-DNA interactions was skewed towards longer-lasting events, likely due to spontaneous RNAP pausing.

A different seed for the Matlab random number generator was used in independent trials to ensure independent sampling. (Sets of 3-base 19-mers were used, because a 19-mer is representative of commonly used hybridization probes, and analysis of k = 3<sup>12</sup> 19-mer sequences could be performed on a modern portable computer.) Built-in Matlab routine dec2base was then used to convert sets of k integers into strings of numeric characters of base 3 (0, 1, and 2—for 3-base sequences) or base 4 (0, 1, 2, and 3—for 4-base sequences). The numeric characters were then replaced with A, U, C, and G, and sequences having GC-content ≥0.4 and ≤0.6 were saved as ASCII files, to be processed with the secondary structure prediction tool Mfold.

For DNA, folding parameters −‘sodium = 0.15 −magnesium = 0.01’ were used to match the composition of hybridization buffer used in single-molecule experiments on probe on-rate measurements. For RNA, default folding parameters were used. The free energies of self-folding were extracted from Mfold output files using a home-written Matlab parsing routine, and plotted as normalized probability histograms with 1 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup> binning. At least three independently randomized sets of 3<sup>12</sup> sequences were analyzed for each alphabet (rAUC, rAUG, rCAG, rCUG, rAUGC, ATC, ATG, CAG, CTG, and ATGC) and results from independent sets were consistent to within 0.5%.</p><p>Sequence complexity was calculated using Matlab routine kolmogorov (provided by Stephen Faul, Radisens Diagnostics, code available at the Mathworks website), modified to output the absolute number of Lempel–Ziv operations, not normalized for the sequence length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kaspar and Schuster, 1987</xref>).

A real-time video of probe binding events (observed as appearance of diffraction-limited fluorescent spots, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) was acquired at 2.5 Hz. For most accurate measurements of the hybridization rates, the concentrations of probes were adjusted empirically to achieve average probe arrival times of 10–100 s. Data analysis was essentially as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Revyakin et al., 2012</xref>). Briefly, single-molecule spots were identified in every frame of the target and probe videos using the software Insight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huang et al., 2010</xref>), and each spot was localized in <italic>(x,y)</italic> by fitting a 5 × 5 pixel spot intensity distribution to a 2D Gaussian. The <italic>(x,y)</italic> coordinates of all identified spots in all video frames were grouped into clusters (‘blobs’) using a 2D histogram (1 pixel binning), and the average <italic>(x,y)</italic> of every blob (indicating the locations of target and probe molecules) was calculated. Then, for every target blob, the closest probe blob was found, the deviations <italic>ΔxΔy</italic> were calculated for all such probe-target pairs, and plotted as a 2D histogram (‘the co-localization plot’). RNA targets that were located within two standard deviations of the central peak at position (0,0) of the co-localization plot (∼40 nm) were selected. Such ‘active’ RNA molecules typically comprised ∼30% of all RNA molecules. Time series of probe-target binding was generated for every active RNA (using the mean fluorescence intensity from a 5 × 5 pixel region of interest (ROI), with the mean intensity of the ROI perimeter pixels subtracted as background). Each time series was examined, and the video frame corresponding to the probe arrival at the target was identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The dataset containing all probe arrival times (<italic>T</italic><sub><italic>wait</italic></sub>, usually 100–500 events) was binned, with the center of the first bin corresponding to the minimal observed <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>wait</italic></sub>, the center of the last bin corresponding to the maximal observed <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>wait</italic></sub>, and the number of bins <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>bins</italic></sub> = <italic>³√(2N</italic><sub><italic>events</italic></sub><italic>)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Scott, 1992</xref>). The first bin was discarded to account for the discontinuity, and for the lag time due to the buffer exchange during probe injection. The probability histogram of <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>wait</italic></sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) was fit to a single exponential function using the Matlab built-in routine <monospace>nlinfit</monospace>, which gave an estimate of the characteristic hybridization time (95% confidence interval), and the goodness of fit (typically, R<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.98).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom, Jim Kadonaga, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This is an outstanding paper that describes a new single-molecule method termed fastFISH, which allows the rapid annealing of a probe to a target mRNA so that the production of the mRNA can be detected with high confidence with minimal false negatives. fastFISH will be useful for the single-molecule analysis not only of general transcription machineries but also of other RNA modifying enzymes such as poly-adenylation enzymes and poly-uridylation enzymes. The amount of work that went into the design of the fastFISH probes is impressive, and the general idea of removing internal structures with individual oligos to accelerate annealing, and in particular using three nucleotides only, will also have a broad appeal.</p><p>The technical quality of the work is high, and the data are clear. The biological insight afforded by the approach, in this study, was limited because T7 RNA polymerase has been studied extensively. Nevertheless, the direct observation of various stages of transcription starting from RNAP binding until its dissociation from the transcript has established important benchmarks for future studies of such systems and point toward exciting future possibilities of more complex systems including those with RNA polymerase II. The fastFISH approach was absolutely necessary for this work because the overall duration of the reaction was about 1–2 s and any slower annealing would have missed the majority of events.</p><p>This work is appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. There are a number of minor comments that should be addressed by the authors.</p><p>Minor comments (in no particular order):</p><p>1) It is clear from the data that their probe design makes the DNA annealing 100 fold faster for probes about 20 nt long. But could they have obtained similarly rapid annealing by simply picking shorter probes, say 12 nt long? Of course, the bound state would have a shorter lifetime but it may still be long enough.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,C</xref>, it is difficult to distinguish between the DNA template and the newly-synthesized RNA. It might be useful to draw the RNA in a different color than the DNA.</p><p>3) In the description of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, it is stated that the long lived events encompass elongation because such events were not observed in the absence of NTPs. This statement is premature since abortive initiation was not addressed. At this stage of the paper, the long lived complexes might have derived from abortive initiation. Conceivably the apparent stability of this complex might also be a function of the DNA template length due to a cage effect. It is clear from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2</xref> that the complex is long lived; perhaps this information could be included and discussed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>.</p><p>4) It should be clearly stated in the main text that the T7RNAP used for most of the experiments is a fusion protein. I believe the halo tag is ∼34 kDa.</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>. This Figure is supposed to show that the fluorophore tagged T7RNAP is functional. From Methods, it appears the RNAP to DNA template ratio is 1:2. I have some doubt that the assay is linear with respect to enzyme concentration. This data needs to be presented as a titration. It would also be good to include the unlabeled halo tagged RNAP in this figure to see if the N-terminal tag itself has some detrimental effect.</p><p>6) It is known (published) that bacterial and eukaryotic polymerases are slow to release from the ends of DNA during runoff transcription. This may also be true for T7RNAP. If such results are published, it would be best to cite the work on this phenomenon to avoid the appearance of inventing an ad hoc explanation for the data.</p><p>7) “Hybridization of two short NA fragments, in the simplest case, is a two-step process that begins with the unfolding of the ss fragments into a random polymer conformation, followed by complementary base-pairing.”</p><p>Random sequences are typically much more dynamic than this sentence suggests, as evidenced by the fact that the unfolding force for random ss sequences is on the order of 5 pN, threefold lower than the unzipping force of structured NA such as hairpins.</p><p>8) “Consistent with this notion, NA sequences with intrinsically higher self-folding energies have faster hybridization rates.”</p><p>This is confusing and is possibly just mis-written. Taken to the extreme it is obviously untrue. A long, perfectly matched hairpin will essentially not melt spontaneously and allow for strand invasion. Please clarify.</p><p>9) “Likewise, decreasing the length of hairpins in conventional MB increases their hybridization rate.”</p><p>Decreasing the length of a hairpin lowers its self-folding energy, so this is in contradiction with the previous statement. Again, please clarify.</p><p>10) Overall this discussion does not do a great job of separating the discussion of rate-limiting effects (unfolding vs base-pairing with target...)</p><p>11) −1.6 +/− 1.7; is the latter number the SD?</p><p>12) The description of the complexity index is not straightforward to understand (what does “by cutting and insertion” mean exactly; cutting of what, where, and insertion of what?).</p><p>13) Could the authors specify the rate of initiation of T7 RNAP in units of M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> rather than just s<sup>-1</sup>?</p><p>14) Are the regions up and downstream of the hybridization target for the DNA probe also unstructured?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01775.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) It is clear from the data that their probe design makes the DNA annealing 100 fold faster for probes about 20 nt long. But could they have obtained similarly rapid annealing by simply picking shorter probes, say 12 nt long? Of course, the bound state would have a shorter lifetime but it may still be long enough</italic>.</p><p>We agree that similarly rapid annealing can be obtained using shorter probes, as long as the target sequence in the transcript is not sequestered by secondary structure. Thus, we believe that the three-letter rule is important for selection of hybridization pairs, regardless of the probe length. In addition, as the reviewers point out, we were concerned about fast off-rates of short probes, particularly at the temperature optimal for transcriptional activity. Thus we added two sentences in the first paragraph of the Discussion section: “The choice of probe length of ∼20 nucleotides was based on the end-to-end distance of a 20-mer nucleic acid duplex (∼6.8 nm), expected to separate the fluorophore and the quencher out of the range of resonance energy transfer upon hybridization. Shorter probes in combination with a short-range quencher may be used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhu et al. 2005</xref>) if the potential faster off-rate of the probe is not a concern.”</p><p>In the same paragraph, we also removed the last sentence on the potential use of super quenchers to further reduce fluorescence background at higher probe concentration, since this was not supported by our latest result with probes containing three quencher moieties (probably because the current self-quenching is already very efficient).</p><p><italic>2) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2A,C</italic></xref><italic>, it is difficult to distinguish between the DNA template and the newly-synthesized RNA.

We believe that any caging effect was unlikely to play a role in these experiments, because (i) the duration of non-specific T7 RNAP-DNA interaction was very short (non-detectable at our time resolution ∼80 ms), and (ii) caging cannot explain the decrease of the fluorescence signal from the label on the T7 RNAP molecule towards the end of each individual long-lived interaction.</p><p><italic>4) It should be clearly stated in the main text that the T7RNAP used for most of the experiments is a fusion protein.

If such results are published, it would be best to cite the work on this phenomenon to avoid the appearance of inventing an ad hoc explanation for the data</italic>.</p><p>We have now included two references documenting formation of long-lived, arrested ternary complexes of bacterial and eukaryotic RNAP at the end of linear DNA templates during run-off. We are not aware of published biochemical work documenting formation of long-lived, arrested T7 RNAP ternary complexes at the ends of linear DNA templates during run-off. Such end-arrested complexes would be difficult to ‘catch’ biochemically: our data puts the upper limit on their lifetime at 0.5 s. The following sentences were added to the end of the Results section: “Pausing/arresting at free DNA ends has been previously observed with multi-subunit bacterial and eukaryotic RNA polymerases in ensemble assays, and likely involved backtracking by these RNAPs (lifetimes of &gt;1 min, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arndt and Chamberlin 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Izban et al. 1995</xref>). It remains to be tested whether T7 RNAP dwells at the end of the DNA via a similar mechanism, and whether the pause is part of a natural termination process.”</p><p><italic>7–10) […] Overall this discussion does not do a great job of separating the discussion of rate-limiting effects (unfolding vs base-pairing with target...</italic>)</p><p>Questions 8-11 are closely related and we revised the first paragraph of the Results section accordingly. First, we agree that hybridization of two random sequences likely proceeds through several intermediates. We have now simplified the process to emphasize the need for disrupting internal secondary structures for hybridization to occur. Second, we agree that the discussion on high self-folding energy did not covey the intended message well. By “high self-folding energy” we meant algebraically high (i.e., positive) <italic>?</italic><italic>G</italic> of the reaction. Using this definition, a positive value of <italic>?</italic><italic>G</italic> indicates that the equilibrium of the folding reaction is shifted to the left: that is on average, the sequence tends to exist in an unstructured state:</p><p>Unstructured ⇌ Folded</p><p><italic>?</italic><italic>G = −RT</italic> ln<italic>(k</italic><sub><italic>folding</italic></sub><italic>/k</italic><sub><italic>unfolding</italic></sub>)</p><p>We have now replaced the phrase “sequences with high self-folding energy” with “unstructured sequences” throughout the text for simplicity.</p><p><italic>11) −1.6 +/− 1.7; is the latter number the SD</italic>?</p><p>In the expression “-1.6 +/− 1.7”, “1.7” is the standard deviation (which shows that the self-folding free energy <italic>?</italic><italic>G</italic><sub><italic>37°C</italic></sub> of a random 4-base 19-mer has a broad distribution).</p><p><italic>12) The description of the complexity index is not straightforward to understand (what does “by cutting and insertion” mean exactly; cutting of what, where, and insertion of what?)</italic>.</p><p>We added two sentences and two references to better explain the Lempel Ziv complexity measure.</p><p><italic>13) Could the authors specify the rate of initiation of T7 RNAP in units of M</italic><sup><italic>-1</italic></sup> <italic>s</italic><sup><italic>-1</italic></sup> <italic>rather than just s</italic><sup><italic>-1</italic></sup>?</p><p>In this work we measured the rate of promoter escape, which is the rate of promoter-bound T7 RNAP entering productive elongation in the presence of NTPs.

To emphasis this, we inserted one sentence into the second paragraph of the Discussion section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
