These isoforms are differentially localized to pyramidal cell compartments, and as such are thought to contribute to different aspects of neuronal excitability. But determining their precise roles in pyramidal cell excitability has been hampered by a lack of tools that allow for selective, acute block of each isoform individually. Here, we leveraged aryl sulfonamide-based molecule (ASC) inhibitors of Na<sub>V</sub> channels that exhibit state-dependent block of both Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6, along with knock-in mice with changes in Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 or Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 structure that prevents ASC binding. This allowed for acute, potent, and reversible block of individual isoforms that permitted dissection of the unique contributions of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 in pyramidal cell excitability. Remarkably, block of each isoform had contrastingâand in some situations, opposingâeffects on neuronal action potential output, with Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 block decreasing and Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 block increasing output. Thus, Na<sub>V</sub> isoforms have unique roles in regulating different aspects of pyramidal cell excitability, and our work may help guide the development of therapeutics designed to temper hyperexcitability through selective Na<sub>V</sub> isoform blockade.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sodium channel</kwd><kwd>epilepsy</kwd><kwd>dendrite</kwd><kwd>pyramidal cell</kwd><kwd>action potential</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH134674</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Garcia</surname><given-names>Joshua D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH125978</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bender</surname><given-names>Kevin J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH126960</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bender</surname><given-names>Kevin J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006792</institution-id><institution>Hartwell Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ben-Shalom</surname><given-names>Roy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>FamiliesSCN2A Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ben-Shalom</surname><given-names>Roy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 have unique functional roles in neocortical pyramidal cells, regulating dendritic and axonal excitability, respectively.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Voltage-gated sodium channels (Na<sub>V</sub>) are critical for all aspects of neuronal excitability, from action potential (AP) initiation to axonal propagation, transmitter release, and dendritic excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Meeks and Mennerick, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Palmer and Stuart, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Spratt et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Spratt et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nelson et al., 2024</xref>). In mature neocortical pyramidal cells, electrogenesis and subsequent propagation of APs is systematically regulated with Na<sub>V</sub> recruitment first initiated in the axon initial segment (AIS), with forward propagation along the axon and backpropagation into soma and dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Palmer and Stuart, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baranauskas et al., 2013</xref>). This coordinated process is supported by membrane expression of the Na<sub>V</sub> isoforms Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.2. Current models, based on immunostaining of channels and empirical measurements of excitability, suggest that Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 are differentially expressed across neurites. In the AIS, Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 predominates, with the highest membrane density in the AP initiation region of the AIS most distal to the soma. Na<sub>V</sub>1.2, by contrast, has higher relative membrane density in the proximal AIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tian et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ye et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jenkins and Bender, 2025</xref>). Along the axon, Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 appears enriched at nodes of Ranvier and terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caldwell et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kaplan et al., 2001</xref>). Somatodendritic densities are far lower, and current models suggest that the somatic and perisomatic membrane expresses equal levels of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.2, whereas dendritic regions more distal to the soma are enriched exclusively with Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Spratt et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Spratt et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nelson et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fleidervish et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, each channel isoform likely has a unique role in AP initiation and propagation simply based on their differential distribution in neuronal compartments.</p><p>To date, efforts to understand the unique contributions of different Na<sub>V</sub> isoforms have relied largely on experiments in which channel genetic expression has been manipulated, either through constitutive or conditional knockout approaches. While these approaches have strong merit, interpretation is complicated by compensatory changes in other Na<sub>V</sub> isoforms or other ion channel classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Spratt et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Spratt et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Katz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). Pharmacological approaches, which are both acute and reversible, would be preferred, but identifying highly selective compounds that target particular Na<sub>V</sub> isoforms is difficult, as <italic>ScnXa</italic> gene family isoforms have high degrees of amino acid sequence homology. Some compounds exhibit high potency, but differences in the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) for individual isoforms can be limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ragsdale and Avoli, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Denomme et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bosmans et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Filipis et al., 2023</xref>). This is especially true for the separation of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 from Na<sub>V</sub>1.6, as these two channels have especially high sequence similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Catterall et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Lera Ruiz and Kraus, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Aryl sulfonamide compounds (ASCs) constitute a unique class of Na<sub>V</sub> inhibitors that potently bind activated Na<sub>V</sub> isoforms, resulting in a stabilization of the inactivated state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahuja et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goodchild et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johnson et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johnson et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Roecker et al., 2017</xref>). The binding pocket is shielded from ASCs when channels are closed due to the positioning of the S4 voltage sensing domain, but is bound rapidly by ASMs when exposed. Unbinding is promoted by strong hyperpolarization, but occurs much more slowly at physiological voltages (e.g., tau of 10<sup>2</sup>â10<sup>3</sup> s at â80 and â40 mV, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahuja et al., 2015</xref>). In spiking neurons, this essentially imparts use dependence to ASC block (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahuja et al., 2015</xref>), as the probability of channel block will increase in proportion with AP rates.</p><p>ASCs exhibit high potency for a subset of Na<sub>V</sub> isoforms: Na<sub>V</sub>1.2, Na<sub>V</sub>1.6, and Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahuja et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goodchild et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johnson et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johnson et al., 2022</xref>). These isoforms share sequence homology at the binding pocket, each containing a tyrosineâtryptophan (YW) motif that helps stabilize ASC binding. By contrast, Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.3 harbor a serineâarginine (SR) sequence at the same site. Mutagenesis of Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 from YW to SR results in a 145-fold decrease in ASC binding without affecting channel biophysical properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahuja et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we engaged a similar strategy for Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6, using knock-in mice with YWâSR substitutions in either or both channels. This allows for selective, potent ASC-mediated block of YW-containing channels while preserving the function of SR-containing channels. With these tools, we dissected the individual roles of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 in neocortical pyramidal cell excitability. We found that Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 have uniqueâand at times conflictingâeffects on overall AP excitability. Moreover, results suggest that ASCs can function as âon-demandâ pharmacological inhibitors that help normalize cellular excitability in seizure-like conditions. Together, this work highlights the importance of distinct Na<sub>V</sub> isoforms localized to specific cellular domains and their respective contribution to AP properties to help facilitate activity across pyramidal neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Scn2a</italic> Human tagged ORF clone</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Origene</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NM_021007</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Na<sub>V</sub>1.2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Scn8a</italic> Human tagged ORF clone</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Origene</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NM_014191</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Na<sub>V</sub>1.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>, both sexes)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">C57BL/6J</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jackson Laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:IMSR_JAX:000664">IMSR_JAX:000664</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Wildtype mice</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>, both sexes)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">C57BL/6N</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Janvier Labs</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:IMSR_RJ:C57BL-6NRJ">IMSR_RJ:C57BL-6NRJ</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Mating with founders</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>, both sexes)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Scn8a</italic> YWâSR KI</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genentech;<break/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deng et al., 2023</xref>;<break/>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37352856/">37352856</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 GNE-4076 insensitive mice</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>, both sexes)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Scn2a</italic> YWâSR KI</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genentech;

These cells were not generated from the original source of the parental line ND7/23; therefore, we are unable to authenticate with ATCC. LoNa<sub>V</sub> ND7/23 cells have been tested for mycoplasma and show no detection of contamination.</p><p>Na<sub>V</sub> channel currents were recorded from HEK293 or ND7/23 cells via whole-cell patch clamp using a Molecular Devices Axopatch 200B amplifier. The recording pipet intracellular solution contained (in mM): 120 CsF, 10 NaCl, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.2 with CsOH. The extracellular recording solution contained (in mM): 155 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH. Currents were recorded at a 20-kHz sampling frequency and filtered at 5 kHz. Series resistance compensation was applied at 80%. Solutions containing GNE-4076 were applied using a Fluicell Dynaflow perfusion system.</p><p>We characterized doseâresponse curves in both WT and mutant Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 channels by pulsing cells from â80 to â12 mV for 20 ms at a rate of 0.5 Hz to establish a baseline current. Cells were then perfused with GNE-4076 starting at 30 nM and increased up to 100 Î¼M. To allow adequate GNE-4076 onboarding to NaV isoforms/mutants at each successive dose, cells were depolarized to â12 mV for 10 s followed by similar test pulses used to acquire baseline current. Between dose increases, cells were held at â80 mV to allow adequate unbinding of GNE-4076.</p><p>We also characterized the activation and steady-state inactivation properties of both WT and mutant Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 channels. To measure activation, we used a holding voltage of â80 mV, a short 20ms pre-pulse to â120 mV, and a 30-ms pulse to voltages ranging from â100 to â20 mV in steps of 5 mV at a rate of once per 3 s. P/4 leak subtraction was used to reduce leak currents. The peaks of the resulting Na<sub>V</sub> currents were measured. Conductance was calculated using the equation: <italic>G</italic> = <italic>I</italic>/(<italic>V</italic> â <italic>V</italic><sub>Na</sub>), normalized, and plotted as a function of voltage. To measure inactivation, we started at a holding voltage of â120 mV to bring the channels fully into the closed state (about 1 min).

AIS inflection point was defined as the peak of the second derivative (d<sup>2</sup><italic>V</italic>/d<italic>t</italic><sup>2</sup>) that occurs prior to the AIS max or somatic peak. Frequency was defined as the spike number in a train elicited per second (spikes/s or Hz).

In recovery experiments, neurons were held at â12 mV for 30 s (voltage clamp) to depolarize cells, activate Na<sub>V</sub> channels, and expose the ASC binding pocket to maximize GNE-4076 onboarding and Na<sub>V</sub> inhibition. The interstimulus interval given during the recovery period was as follows: 2 s, ~20â30 s duration; 5 s, ~30â45 s duration; 15 s, ~60â90 s duration; 30 s, ~120â180 s duration; and 60 s, ~60â240 s duration. In experiments mimicking cellular activity, a post-synaptic potential train was randomly generated using a Poisson probability distribution function for 60 s with a frequency of 50 Hz and amplitude standard deviation of 200 pA.</p><p>For nucleated patch voltage-clamp experiments, recordings were made at 31â33Â°C in a solution containing 125 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 25 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.25 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 15 mM glucose, 4 mM TEA, 1 mM 4-AP, and 10 ÂµM nifedipine, with or without 200 nM GNE-4076, (bubbled with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>/95% O<sub>2</sub>). A Cs-methanesulfonate-based recording solution was used: 110 mM CsMeSO<sub>3</sub>, 40 mM HEPES, 1 mM KCl, 4 mM NaCl, 4 mM Mg-ATP, 10 mM Na-phosphocreatine, 0.4 mM Na<sub>2</sub>-GTP, and 0.1 mM EGTA; 290 mOsm; pH 7.2â7.25. Whole-cell recordings were established before withdrawing pipettes from the slice, pulling a region of the somatic membrane with the pipette. Neurons were held to â80 mV and stepped to â12 mV every 2 s, 5â10 times. Then neurons were held to â12 mV for 10 s to onboard GNE-4076, then returned to â80 mV and probed for Na<sub>V</sub> recovery with steps to â12 mV every 2 s. Leak currents were subtracted with a P/8 protocol using steps from â80 to â90 mV. All data were corrected for measured junction potentials of 12 mV.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2-5"><title>Compartmental modeling</title><p>A compartmental model was constructed within the NEURON environment to simulate a layer 5 pyramidal neuron as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Spratt et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hallermann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Quinn et al., 2024</xref>).

We modified the model by replacing the aggregated sodium conductances (NaT and NaP) with distinct Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 channels to match empirically observed distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hu et al., 2009</xref>). Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 channels were distributed throughout the cell with equal levels in the soma and 20 Âµm of the proximal dendrites. Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 was solely expressed in dendrites more distal to the soma, inferred based on AP-evoked sodium imaging observations in <italic>Scn2a<sup>+/â</sup></italic> conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nelson et al., 2024</xref>). The two axonal compartments were subdivided into an AIS and distal axon. Within the AIS, Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 were distributed with increased Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 in the proximal AIS and increased Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 in the distal AIS to recapitulate the channel distribution as previously observed empirically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hu et al., 2009</xref>). Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 was not included in the distal AIS or axon where only Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 is present, including an enriched region to model a node of Ranvier. To simulate blocking of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6, each channelâs density was globally reduced in 10% increments from 100% to 0%. Both Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 channels were represented using the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hodgkin and Huxley, 1952</xref>). Parameter optimization for both channels was conducted using an evolutionary algorithm from BluePyOpt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Van Geit et al., 2016</xref>) and adapted for use with the computational resources at the National Energy Research Computing Center similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ladd et al., 2022</xref>.</p><p>To validate parameter sensitivity, we constructed multiple variations of our model with different distributions of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 in the AIS. The crossover point at which the Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 distribution curves intersect was shifted distally in increments of 3.75 Âµm to make five variations of the AIS with increasing density of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2. With the wildtype crossover point located 15 Âµm distal to the soma, the five right-shifted variations have crossover points at 18.75, 22.5, 26.25, 30, and 33.75 Âµm, respectively. Two variations of the AIS with increased Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 density were created by shifting the crossover point proximally in 3.75 Âµm increments to 11.25 and 7.5 Âµm. To see how our model would behave with different AIS sodium channel distributions, we varied the ratio of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2: Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 density in the whole cell to test different conditions at each AIS crossover point and measured the resulting threshold, AIS peak, and somatic peak of the phase plane plot. Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 percentage was decreased from 90% to 0% in 10% increments as Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 percentage was concurrently increased from 10% to 100% in 10% increments. The Na<sub>V</sub>1.2: Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 ratio of 100%:0% did not produce any APs and was therefore not included in the analysis. In instances where the somatic portion of the phase plane was not a true peak that consisted of adjacent values less than a local maxima, the prominence was estimated by taking the index of the second derivative value closest to zero and calculating the d<italic>V</italic>/d<italic>t</italic> value at that index.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><p>Data are reported as absolute values or the absolute difference from baseline (delta, Î).

Within this model, reducing Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 or Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 density had clear, dissociable effects. Progressive reduction of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 produced a progressive depolarization of AP threshold and a corresponding decrement in d<italic>V</italic>/d<italic>t</italic> throughout the entire rising phase of the AP. Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 reduction, by contrast, had no effect on AP threshold or the initial velocity of the AP initiated in the distal AIS. Instead, components of the AP related to backpropagation and recruitment of somatic Na<sub>V</sub> channels were impaired only, with a decrement in peak d<italic>V</italic>/d<italic>t</italic> and peak AP membrane potential. To validate the accuracy of the parameters used in our model, we also performed sensitivity analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

Since it is nearly impossible to achieve full block with ASCs under physiological firing, we developed a hybrid current- and voltage-clamp experiment to study the effects of more complete isoform blockade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In this protocol, neurons were held to â80 mV in current clamp with constant bias current (if necessary), and baseline APs were elicited with brief somatic current injection (300 ms, amplitude adjusted to evoke ~4â5 APs). We then promoted Na<sub>V</sub> activation and inactivation by voltage-clamping neurons to â12 mV for 30 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Following voltage-clamp, neurons were returned to current-clamp with the same bias current as used in baseline conditions. We then evoked APs, first at an interstimulus interval of 2 s, then at successively increasing intervals of 5â60 s, allowing for somewhat consistent sampling on a log-base timescale that aligns well with both channel recovery from inactivation and recovery from GNE-4076 block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D, F</xref>).

Peak d<italic>V</italic>/d<italic>t</italic> recovered to within 87.12 Â± 0.86% by 12â20 s of voltage-clamp offset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F, G</xref>). Subsequent recovery of the residual peak d<italic>V</italic>/d<italic>t</italic> was slower, taking another 15â30 s to recover the next 5% of peak d<italic>V</italic>/d<italic>t</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Identical results were observed in <italic>Scn8a</italic>/<italic>2a<sup>SR/SR</sup></italic> cells treated with 200 nM GNE-4076, suggesting that any effect observed in single knock-in recordings will be due to block of GNE-4076 sensitive channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3BâG</xref>). We therefore focused on the 12â20 s after voltage-clamp offset for subsequent analysis, as it is a period in which most channel-intrinsic recovery has occurred, but also a period in which we would still expect significant block from GNE-4076.</p><p>When individual channel isoforms were blocked more completely with voltage steps to â12 mV, dramatic changes in AP threshold and peak d<italic>V</italic>/d<italic>t</italic> were observed. When Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 was blocked, threshold depolarized by 5.8 Â± 0.7 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). When Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 was blocked instead, threshold was unaffected (â <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>: â0.1 Â± 0.2). Thus, AP threshold and AP initiation appear to be initiated in an Na<sub>V</sub>1.6-rich region in control conditions; but when Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 is inhibited, APs can occur at more depolarized potentials, likely mediated predominately by Na<sub>V</sub>1.2.</p><p>To examine these relative contributions further, we analyzed the rising phase of APs more closely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). As described above, the first component of the rising phase of the AP reflects recruitment of Na<sub>V</sub> channels localized to the AIS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A</xref>, middle). Based on changes in voltage acceleration (second derivative) within this period, the AIS component can be further divided into initiation and AIS backpropagation components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Favero et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A</xref>, right). These periods were divided based on a time point during the AIS phase where voltage acceleration first peaked (AIS inflection point) or afterwards decreased, creating a trough in an acceleration versus time graph (AIS max; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). The d<italic>V</italic>/d<italic>t</italic> at the AIS inflection point was affected only by Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1C</xref>), whereas the d<italic>V</italic>/d<italic>t</italic> at the trough was affected by block of either isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1D, E</xref>). This reinforces the model where APs are initiated via the Na<sub>V</sub>1.6-enriched distal AIS, and where the depolarization produced by these distally localized channels recruits Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 in the more proximal AIS. Absolute values are also reported for threshold, peak d<italic>V</italic>/d<italic>t</italic>, and AIS max for all recorded cells in recovery experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2AâF</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Acute block of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 increases pyramidal cell AP output</title><p>Previously, we showed that conditional knockout of <italic>Scn2a</italic> increased AP output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Spratt et al., 2021</xref>). We hypothesized that this was due to the lack of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 in dendrites. When they are absent from this compartment, the dendrite does not depolarize as effectively, leading to a corresponding decrease in the recruitment of dendrite-localized potassium channels (K<sub>V</sub>). Consequently, neurons repolarize less between APs, making it easier to evoke the next AP in the Na<sub>V</sub>1.6-enriched AIS.</p><p>Though this hypothesis was supported by compartmental modeling demonstrating that acute block of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 mirrored empirical observations, we could not eliminate the possibility that some form of cellular compensation occurred in the weeks between conditional knockout induction and acute slice experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miralles and Patel, 2022</xref>).

Wildtype, no drug and <italic>Scn8a/2a<sup>SR/SR</sup></italic> conditions observed no change in firing rate, while dual or selective Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 blockade saw a slight decrease by 60 s of postsynaptic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Interestingly, we did see a slight increase in baseline firing by 60 s when Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 was selectively targeted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1A, B</xref>), further highlighting a paradoxical shift to hyperactive neurons when Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 availability decreases. By contrast, a slight depolarization in AP threshold was observed at baseline when both channels were sensitive to GNE-4076 (e.g., WT plus drug) and to a lesser extent with selective block of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Given that this dose can completely block both Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 in HEK cells, a small amount of drug block was expected at baseline.</p><p>Seizure-like activity induction depolarized AP threshold markedly in all genotypes, and threshold depolarization persisted into the recovery phase for all neurons experiencing Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 or dual inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C, D</xref>). Seizure-like activity increased spike rate across all genotypes at the onset of seizure-like activity induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C, E</xref>). All cells exhibited some degree of AP accommodation during this stimulus, including drug-naive controls and cases where both Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 were insensitive to GNE-4076 block. WT cells exposed to GNE-4076 accommodated markedly, returning to baseline firing rates at the end of the seizure-like stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C, E</xref>). A less dramatic effect was noted when Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 was blocked alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). By contrast, cells where Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 could be blocked alone were not appreciably different than untreated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Furthermore, some cells that remained hyperactive with selective Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 block compared to control cells throughout the recovery phase. Together, these data suggest that use-dependent pharmacology that targets Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 may be most beneficial if designed for higher potency at Na<sub>V</sub>1.6.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we combined genetic and pharmacological strategies to transiently, selectively, and reversibly inhibit either Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 or Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 function using activity-dependent ASCs, which bind channels in the inactivated state. We show that acute blockade of either isoform has opposing effects on neuronal output: inhibition of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 decreases AP output, whereas Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 increases AP output. Given this, we found that the block of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 rather than Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 was more effective at tempering spiking activity in cells driven to seizure-like levels of AP output. This suggests that pharmacology tuned to preferentially block Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 over Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 in a use-dependent manner may be useful as an anti-epileptic.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Functional implications of differential compartmental Na<sub>V</sub> isoform expression</title><p>Electrophysiological recordings of AP propagation delays between somatic and axonal recordings demonstrate that APs initiate ~35â50 Âµm from the soma, in the distal AIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Palmer and Stuart, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baranauskas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hu et al., 2009</xref>). This region is enriched with Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tian et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Royeck et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lorincz and Nusser, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akin et al., 2015</xref>). Consistent with this, we find that inhibition of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 alone alters AP initiation, with an increase in AP threshold and a decrease in total AP number from block of this isoform. Following distal AIS AP initiation, APs sequentially propagate across different neuronal compartments to influence local excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Palmer and Stuart, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baranauskas et al., 2013</xref>). Forward propagation was not examined here, but prior reports demonstrate that it is supported almost exclusively by Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 in nodes of Ranvier and boutons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tian et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caldwell et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kaplan et al., 2001</xref>). By contrast, backpropagation through the proximal AIS and soma recruits a mix of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.2.</p><p>Prior work has suggested that Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels localized to the proximal AIS are critical for backpropagation, with modeling suggesting that APs would fail to effectively backpropagate into the soma in the absence of proximal AIS Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hu et al., 2009</xref>). While some efforts have been made to test this empirically with conditional <italic>Scn2a</italic> knockout, such experiments are imperfect, as Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 redistributes in the AIS of cells that lack Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Spratt et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we were able to test the role of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 in backpropagation without compensatory effects, using acute pharmacological inhibition. Backpropagation failures were not observed, consistent with results from conditional <italic>Scn2a</italic> knockout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Spratt et al., 2021</xref>). However, we did observe a reduction in the velocity at which the AIS component of the AP depolarized when Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 was blocked selectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B, C</xref>). This suggests that proximal AIS-localized Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 does aid in boosting backpropagating APs as they transit from the distal AIS to the soma. Nevertheless, Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels are still dispensable for recruitment of somatic Na<sub>V</sub> channels, at least in mouse mPFC layer 5b pyramidal cells. Whether similar effects are observed in other cells, including those with larger somata that may be more difficult to depolarize in the absence of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2, remains to be tested.</p><p>Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 expression in pyramidal cell dendrites appears to have two roles in neuronal excitability. Intuitively, these channels provide local inward current that boosts dendritic excitability, leading to a recruitment of voltage-gated calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Spratt et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nelson et al., 2024</xref>). But this depolarization also appears to be critical for the recruitment of dendritically localized voltage-gated potassium channels that contribute to AP repolarization and net membrane potential between spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Spratt et al., 2021</xref>). Indeed, conditional knockout of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 paradoxically increases AP output, and we suggested previously that this was due in large part to loss of interactions between dendritic Na<sub>V</sub> channels and K<sub>V</sub> channels. But given observed changes in Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 function as well as potential for other compensatory changes in non-Na<sub>V</sub> ion channels, it was difficult to ascribe hyperexcitability purely to the loss of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miralles and Patel, 2022</xref>). Here, we showed that identical increases in excitabilityâassociated with depolarization of membrane potential between APsâcould be observed with acute Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 block. This indicates that such effects can be due purely to the interplay between dendritic Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and K<sub>V</sub> channels, and that modifications to potassium channel distribution or function are not necessary for such effects.</p><p>Similar to Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 conditional knockout, where Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 is upregulated, knockout of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 results in an increase in Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 expression, at least in the AIS. In pyramidal cells from mice constitutively lacking Na<sub>V</sub>1.6, Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 occupies the entirety of the AIS rather than just the region proximal to the soma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ye et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Katz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Royeck et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, it has not been possible to evaluate the role of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 in its normal distribution using genetic manipulations. Here, we find that acute Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 block reduces AP output with a concomitant increase in AP threshold. This contrasted markedly with block of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2, which had no effect on threshold. Of note, this distinction can be leveraged to assess the specificity of other Na<sub>V</sub>-targeting pharmacology that has been suggested to have specificity at select isoforms, as any change in threshold indicates that drugs are interacting with Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ye et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Filipis et al., 2023</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>ASC pharmacology for suppression of neuronal hyperexcitability</title><p>Epilepsy can arise from genetic and non-genetic factors, often with unexplained etiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lindy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deng et al., 2014</xref>). Seizure onset is broadly classified as an electrical imbalance of cellular and network activity that favors hyperexcitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agbo et al., 2023</xref>), whether it be cell intrinsic, synaptic, or due to complex network effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Greenfield, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yin et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, seizure suppression can be targeted at multiple levels. Nevertheless, proper dosing can be difficult, as one aims to provide drug concentrations that temper excess activity but limit side effects like sedation associated with elevated drug concentrations.</p><p>For genetically defined sodium channelopathies, attention has been directed to neuronal cell types that express each isoform (e.g., <italic>SCN1A</italic>: Na<sub>V</sub>1.1, <italic>SCN2A</italic>: Na<sub>V</sub>1.2, and <italic>SCN8A</italic>: Na<sub>V</sub>1.6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Encinas et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Menezes et al., 2020</xref>). Seizures resulting from <italic>SCN1A</italic> loss of function limit inhibitory neuron excitability, thereby disinhibiting excitatory pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Favero et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tran et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Strzelczyk and Schubert-Bast, 2022</xref>). <italic>SCN2A</italic> gain-of-function results in hyperexcitability in pyramidal cells, especially in early development when Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels are the sole isoform expressed in the AIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jenkins and Bender, 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gazina et al., 2015</xref>). Later in development, <italic>SCN8A</italic>-encoded Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 channels are expressed more ubiquitously in the AIS of most cell classes, supporting AP initiation in both excitatory and inhibitory cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Favero et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lopez-Santiago et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boiko et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>With these cellular distributions and mechanisms of action, guidelines have emerged for treatment. For <italic>SCN1A</italic> loss-of-function, sodium channel blocking anti-epileptics are typically contraindicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kalume et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Oakley et al., 2013</xref>). This is because currently prescribed sodium channel blockers are non-selective, with little preference for Na<sub>V</sub>1.1, 1.2, or 1.6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bai et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, further blocking of the remaining Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 leads to even more disinhibition of excitatory cells before any beneficial effects of blocking Na<sub>V</sub> channels in excitatory cells are realized. Similarly, nonspecific sodium channel blockers are contraindicated for <italic>SCN2A</italic> loss-of-function seizures, as they tend to increase seizure severity. Instead, non-selective Na<sub>V</sub> inhibitors are useful when channel gain-of-function affects excitatory cells, as is the case for both <italic>SCN2A</italic> and <italic>SCN8A</italic> gain-of-function cases.</p><p>ASCs may be useful within each of these domains, as their chemistry can be adjusted to bias binding to specific isoforms in an activity-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahuja et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goodchild et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johnson et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johnson et al., 2022</xref>). Indeed, compounds similar to those used here that inhibit both Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 (but not other Na<sub>V</sub> channels) are effective at suppressing chemoconvulsant-induced seizures in ex vivo models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goodchild et al., 2024</xref>). This parallels our observations, where excess activity was dampened most effectively by dual block of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). This effect appears due in large part to the block of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6, since, ultimately, this is the isoform responsible for AP initiation. Consistent with this, Na<sub>V</sub>1.6-preferring ASCs show promise in protecting from chemoconvulsant-induced seizures in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johnson et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johnson et al., 2022</xref>). Similar to our results, Johnson et al. also show that a selective ASC for Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 (NBI-921352) preferentially targets cortical pyramidal cells, unlike carbamazepine that non-selectively targets many Na<sub>V</sub> isoforms leading to impaired interneuron activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johnson et al., 2022</xref>). In fact, drug therapies using agents like carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and phenytoin that have little to no selectivity for Na<sub>V</sub> isoforms can have adverse effects in certain situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agbo et al., 2023</xref>). Thus, it may be that preferential block of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 would be beneficial in multiple sodium channelopathy conditions, including those associated with channel loss, since network hyperexcitability is ultimately dictated by Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 function in the AIS of excitatory neurons after the first months of life.</p><p>Beyond selectivity, there may also be advantages to ASC activity-dependent properties. The ASC-binding pocket is hidden from drug in a channelâs closed state. This feature, combined with on- and off-rate kinetics, results in an accumulation of block primarily for highly active neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). Similar to on-demand, closed-loop electrical or optogenetic approaches for seizure intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Krook-Magnuson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nagaraj et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ledri et al., 2023</xref>), ASCs are essentially biased to suppress prolonged, high-frequency activity, including the type of activity commonly observed during seizures. In this study, our focus centered mainly on seizure-like activity across individual neurons. Future studies can extend this approach to examining networks ex vivo and systems in vivo.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Is an employee of Genentech</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing â original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Writing â original draft, Project administration, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Visualization, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Project administration, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Project administration, Writing â review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

The activation/inactivation curves in Figure 1E show differences in both activation and inactivation at physiologically relevant membrane voltages, which may be significant even though the V1/2 and slope factors are roughly similar.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed new experiments testing how YW-&gt;SR mutations affect spiking on their own. The reviewerâs intuition was correct; the small changes in voltage-dependence in NaV1.6 identified in heterologous expression systems translated into a ~2 mV hyperpolarization in threshold in neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Additional discussion of the fact that channels are only partially blocked by the ASC and that ASCs act in a use-dependent manner would improve the manuscript and help readers interpret these results.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated text extensively to address this concern. Details are found in the author suggestions below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) NaV1.6 was described as being exclusively responsible for the change in action potential threshold, but when NaV1.6 alone was inactivated, the effect was significantly reduced from the condition in which both channels were inactivated (Figure 4E). Similarly, Figure 6C shows that blockade of both channels causes threshold depolarization prior to the seizure-like event, but selective inactivation of NaV1.6 does not. As NaV1.2 does not appear to be involved in action potential initiation and threshold change, what is the mechanism of this dissimilarity between the NaV1.6 inactivation and combined NaV1.6/ NaV1.2 inactivation?</p></disp-quote><p>We believe the dissimilarity is due to interactions between NaV1.2 and other channel classes (e.g., potassium channels) throughout the cell, including the somatodendritic domain. NaV1.6 that initiates APs, localized to the AIS, do not live in isolation, and AP threshold can be affected by the recent membrane potential history. Loss of NaV1.2-mediated depolarization in the dendrites begets less potassium channel-mediated repolarization, as described in Figure 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The idea that use-dependent VGSC-acting drugs may be effective antiseizure medications is well established. Additional discussion or at least acknowledgement of the existing, widely used, use-dependent VGSC drugs should be included (e.g. Carbamazepine, Lamotrigine, Phenytoin). Also, the idea that targeting NaV1.6 may be effective for seizures is established by studies using genetic models, knockdown, and partially selective pharmacology (e.g. NBI-921352). Additional discussion of how the results reported here are consistent with or differ from studies using these alternative approaches would improve the discussion</p></disp-quote><p>We agree; the concept of use-dependent block as a means to treat seizure is not new, and we have updated the discussion to include commentary on other medications currently in use. What is new here is our ability to explore the role of NaV1.2 and NaV1.6 in electrogenesis with a level of drug selectivity that could not be achieved without the addition of the YW-&gt;SR mutations. This approach in itself will not be useful in the clinic, but it may help guide drug design in the future. One major interpretation of this work is that NaV1.6 block is more effective than NaV1.2 block in general, and may even be effective for non-SCN8A genetic conditions. This is indeed one of the reasons that we believe that drugs like NBI-921352, itself an aryl-sulfonamide, is being tested in seizure models.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>The authors used a clever and powerful approach to explore how Nav1.2 and Nav1.6 channels, which are both present in neocortical pyramidal neurons, differentially control firing properties of the neurons. Overall, the approach worked very well, and the results show very interesting differences when one or the other channel is partially inhibited. The experimental data is solid and the experimental data is very nicely complemented by a computational model incorporating the different localization of the two types of sodium channels.</p><p>In my opinion the presentation and interpretation of the results could be improved by a more thorough discussion of the fact that only incomplete inhibition of the channels can be achieved by the inhibitor under physiological recording conditions and I thought the paper could be easier to digest if the figures were re-organized. However, the key results are well-documented.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a concern raised by multiple reviewers, and we thank you all for your help in improving the way in which we discuss the results. We have revised the manuscript extensively, moving figures around per your advice and the advice of R1 in their comments to authors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors used powerful and novel reagents to carefully assess the roles of the voltage gated sodium channel (NaV) isoforms in regulating the neural excitability of principal neurons of the cerebral cortex. Using this approach, they were able to confirm that two different isoforms, NaV1.2 and NaV1.6 have distinct roles in electrogenesis of neocortical pyramidal neurons.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Development of very powerful transgenic mice in which NaV1.2 and/or NaV1.6 were modified to be insensitive to ASCs, a particular class of NaV blocker. This allowed them to test for roles of the two isoforms in an acute setting, without concerns of genetic or functional compensation that might result from a NaV channel knockout.</p><p>Careful biophysical analysis of ASC effects on different NaV isoforms.</p><p>Extensive and rigorous analysis of electrogenesis - action potential production - under conditions of blockade of either NaV1.2 or NaV1 or both.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Some results are overstated in that the representative example records provided do not directly support the conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We have swapped out example records to better capture the median effect observed and to better capture our discussion of these results. Please see below, in recommendations for authors, for details.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results from a computational model are provided to make predictions of outcomes, but the computational approach is highly underdeveloped.</p></disp-quote><p>Modeling has been elaborated upon extensively, with more detail in methods, a new sensitivity analysis supplemental figure, and a deposition into ModelDB. Please see below, in recommendations for authors, for details.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Regarding the concern about the potential impact of the YWÃ SR mutation: All results in Figures 2-6 report only within-subject changes before and after drug-activating protocols. These results show that the drug has no effect on the mutant channel, but whether the mutant channel itself has any effect on neuronal properties is not clear. This deficiency could be rectified by reporting raw values for AP threshold, spike rate, etc. in the pre-drug condition and statistically analyzing the apparent differences in the activation/inactivation curves.</p></disp-quote><p>Data in our original submission only included data in the presence of GNE-4076. We now present new data showing how the YWÃ SR mutation affects baseline activity of neurons. These data are in Supplemental Figure 1. Compared to wildtype (no drug control) neurons, we observe no change in peak dV/dt. However, threshold is hyperpolarized by approximately 2 mV in dual knockin neurons (median values: -57.4 mV for dual knockin and -55 mV for wildtype). This is consistent with measures from heterologously expressed channels, where we observed somewhat subtle shifts in voltage-dependence of inactivation and activation in NaV1.6 as a result of YWÃ SR incorporation.</p><p>In addition to these data, we also include the baseline dataset from Figure 3, where GNE-4076 is present throughout recording, and report that neither threshold nor peak dV/dt are influenced by the presence of GNE at baseline. This suggests that any drug binding at baseline (i.e., before firing APs via somatic current injection) is negligible, consistent with the concept that GNE-4076 has low affinity for the closed channel state.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>While the single-cell response to &quot;seizure-like&quot; input aptly demonstrates the change in action potential threshold and firing rate induced by NaV1.6 inhibition, this component of the paper could be enhanced by a network-level assay that assesses the impact of this drug on an actual seizure-like event in acute slices or on seizure susceptibility in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent thought, and the work near the end of this manuscript is an effort to mimic network-like activity in a controlled way in single cells. To expand this to bona fide seizure-like activity in acute slices or in vivo is something that we are considering for future studies. To do this properly requires extensive validation of dosing and seizure induction that will require several yearsâ effort.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig 1e caption says &quot;circles&quot; but the markers are squares</p></disp-quote><p>This has been corrected, thank you for catching it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Color scheme in S2B is not intuitive to me</p></disp-quote><p>Weâve now updated the caption to better describe the color scheme used within.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig S2: graph or show change in threshold</p></disp-quote><p>Empirical threshold data are in main figure 3D.

We have updated the language to be more accurate to the following: âAP threshold and AP initiation appears to be initiated in an NaV1.6-rich region in control conditions; when NaV1.6 is inhibited, APs can occur at more depolarized potentials, likely mediated predominately by NaV1.2.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig S3C missing WT/Scn8aSR/SR significance marking.

I will be blunt about the ways in which I found the presentation and discussion to be frustrating and even annoying, in the spirit of frank feedback by one interested and appreciative reader that the authors can consider or reject as they wish.</p><p>From the start, I had the feeling that the authors were presenting and discussing the results in a sanitized &quot;never-mind-about the details&quot; fashion such as might be appropriate for a seminar to a general audience not interested in details, but not appropriate for a research paper.</p></disp-quote><p>Our intent certainly was not to frustrate or annoy readers. We are very grateful that you have provided these comments, which have certainly improved the manuscript, hopefully mitigating some of the frustration for future readers. We appreciate that there are complex drug and voltage effects occurring within these studies, and in an effort to distill these effects into digestible prose, we appear to have been too earnest. We have expanded on the requested topics below and please note that, for the aficionados, every figure displays individual data. Further, we have made a special effort to ensure that features of excitability are presented throughout the drug and manipulation timecourse, including time-points before and after periods subject to statistical comparison, so that the reader may draw their own conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>General:</p><p>There were two major ways in which I found the presentation and discussion frustrating and even annoying: First, not clearly discussing early in the presentation the fact that it is impossible to achieve complete inhibition with this agent during measurements of physiological firing and second, presenting so much of the effects as deltas of various parameters rather than showing effects on absolute values of the parameters.</p></disp-quote><p>Our response to the first issue will follow the next comment, as it relates to this statement. Regarding use of deltas and absolute values for changes in threshold and dV/dt across figures. Every cell has a unique AP threshold and peak dV/dt, and we found that displaying data zeroed to baseline values best illustrated the effects of GNE-4076. Without this, GNE-based effect could be buried within the cell-to-cell variability. This helped most when trying to make the case that threshold was unaffected in 2a/8a YWÃ SR knockin animals. We continue to believe that this is the best way to display the data in the primary figures, but to provide a more complete account, we now present absolute values in supplemental tables and supplemental figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The first issue, the incomplete inhibition by the agent, was the most annoying because the authors obviously thought a lot about this and even closed the paper by proposing this as a positive feature of this class of inhibitors, yet discussed it only piecemeal - and with most of the key experimental data in the Supplement. There are two fundamental characteristics of this (and other) sulfonamide inhibitors that complicate interpretation of experiments, especially when applied in a slice experiment: they only bind to the channel when the channel is depolarized, and even when the channel is depolarized for many seconds, bind very slowly to the channel.</p><p>That makes it almost impossible to know exactly what fraction of channels is being inhibited during measurements of firing. Obviously, the authors are well-aware of this issue and they allude to it and even make use of it in some of the protocols, but they never really discuss it in a very clear manner.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it is impossible to know the precise fraction of channels inhibited in acute slice preparations. But the reason for this is likely different than what has been interpreted by this reviewer. To state that ASMs âonly bind to the channel when the channel is depolarized, and even when the channel is depolarized for many seconds, bind very slowly to the channel.â is not consistent with prior data on ASMâchannel interactions. Clarification on these points may help the reviewer and a broader audience better understand the effects occurring here, and we appreciate being able to both address this concept here and by revising the manuscript.</p><p>First, ASMs bind activated channels and stabilize the inactivated state. It is correct that channels are more likely to enter these states when subject to voltage depolarization, but channel state is stochastic and can enter activated states near resting membrane potentials. The on-rate is fast enough that channels are blocked immediately in recordings in heterologous systems (Figure 1C). It is more likely that channel biophysical state stochasticity, along with drug concentration used herein, are likely dictating the rate at which channels accumulate block during repetitive spiking.</p><p>To address this in text, we have revised the 3rd paragraph of the introduction to better incorporate these ideas. This also helps with comments in the reviewer paragraph below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The key experimental data on this is relegated to the Supplemental Figures. When the reader is first shown results of the effects of the inhibitor on firing in Fig 2, the presentation has been set up as if everything is perfect, and the inhibitor will be completely inhibiting either both or only one channel according to the mouse. With this presentation, it is then exceptionally striking that the cell in the middle panel of Fig 2A, labeled &quot;Nav1.2/1.6 Inhibited&quot; is firing action potentials very nicely even with both channels &quot;inhibited&quot;. For a reader not already aware that there is likely only partial inhibition of each channel, the reaction will be &quot;Huh? Shouldn't blocking both channels simply completely block excitability?&quot;. The authors do preface Fig 2 by a very brief allusion to the incomplete inhibition: &quot;In spiking neurons, ASCs would therefore be predicted to exhibit use-dependence, progressively blocking channels in proportion to a neuron's activity rate&quot; but this comes out of nowhere after the over-simplified picture of complete inhibition up to that point, and without any estimation of how much inhibition there is likely to be before activity, or how much induction of inhibition there is likely to be during the activity. Without this, interpreting the data in Fig 2 is basically impossible.</p><p>The key experimental data on this issue is really in Supplemental Figures 1-2 and Fig 4, and I found myself immediately ping-ponging back and forth between the Supplemental figures and the main text trying to understand what is going on with the partial inhibition. This was frustrating.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these suggestions; they help with readability appreciably. We have re-organized the figures presented in the manuscript and emphasized details about ASCs to ensure readers can discern between near-complete blockade of channels (Figures 1-4) and activity-dependent ASC onboarding (Figures 5-7). We now present near-complete block experiments <italic>first</italic>, detailing the current clamp-&gt; voltage clamp (-12 mV)-&gt; current clamp experiments. We incorporated Supp. Fig. 1 into main Figure 1 and moved Supp. Fig. 2 into main Fig. 2.</p><p>As the reviewer notes, there are clear time-dependent effects on channel function when stepping to -12 mV, independent of GNE-4076 block. As stated previously, âWe therefore focused on the 12-20 sec after voltage-clamp offset for subsequent analysis, as it is a period in which most channel-intrinsic recovery has occurred, but also a period in which we would still expect significant block from GNE-4076.â We hope that reordering the manuscript as suggested and placing these results near the beginning will help with discerning between near-complete block and activity depending onboarding. By beginning with these experiments, which underscore that 100% block cannot be studied without âcontaminationâ from native slow inactivation, we hope that the readers can better understand why data was done as presented.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In my opinion, the paper would be greatly improved by a detailed discussion of the voltage- and time-dependence of the inhibitor at the very beginning of the paper. For me, reading and digesting the paper would have been far easier if Fig 1 included a discussion of the voltage- and time-dependence of inhibition, and next Figs were then Supplemental Figs 1-2, and main Fig 4. The key questions are: how much inhibition is there before a 10-s current injection from the resting potential, and how much additional inhibition is there produced during either the 10-s bout of firing or the &quot;on-boarding&quot; depolarization protocol, and how long does that additional inhibition last? The most direct information on that is in the plots in Fig. 4D and Fig 4F in combination with Supplemental Fig 1, which shows that the on-boarding depolarization reduces current to about 30% of current before on-boarding. This is so central to the interpretation of all the results that I think Supp Fig 1 should be in the main paper as the first piece of data in neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>We originally had the nucleated patch data in supplement due to space constraints in an already large figure 1. Based on your recommendation we have moved it to the main figure. We have also changed the ordering of the paper and related figures to present data as suggested. Hopefully this better guides readers through the questions you are raising above, which are addressed in the (now reordered) figures mentioned above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific:</p><p>(1) Fig.1 I can find no information on the voltage protocol used to generate the dose-response curves. In the literature characterizing sulfonamide blockers, most protocols use very unphysiological strong, long depolarization to induce inhibition, usually with equally unphysiological short hyperpolarizations to produce recovery from inactivation. One assumes something like that was used here. Obviously, the protocol needs to be explained.</p></disp-quote><p>We updated the methods section to better describe the voltage protocol used to generate the dose response curves. In contrast to the literature characterizing sulfonamide blockers, we used pulses that closely mimic physiological activation from -80 mV (rest) to 0 mV (depolarized) for 20 msec. GNE-4076 was perfused onto cells at increasing concentrations throughout the experiment. At each successive dose, cells were held at 0 mV to allow adequate GNE-4076 onboarding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Supp Fig1. This shows the effect of depolarization to enhance inhibition, but not how much inhibition there was before the depolarization. Presumably, there were measurements during the application of drug? How much inhibition is there before the depolarization? Why does the time only go to 20-s, when the times in Figs 4 go to 10 minutes?</p></disp-quote><p>Nucleated patch recordings are notoriously difficult to maintain for long durations, especially when subjecting the patch to large voltage deflections. These recordings extend to 20s recovery periods because that is the duration for which we maintained all recordings, though some exhibited rather impressive longevity and allowed for several minutes of recording thereafter. Regardless, the goal here was to assess block within the 12-20 sec recovery window we utilized in current clamp recordings from intact neurons. This was achieved.</p><p>Please note that GNE-4076 was present throughout all recordings. This was in part due to time constraints, as we could not maintain patches long enough to also perform wash-in. The degree of inhibition can be inferred by comparing peak dV/dt and threshold of cells in the absence and presence of GNE-4076. These data are presented in a new Supplemental figure 1, showing no difference in threshold or peak dV/dt.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Fig. 4. Similar question here - this is a very nice and informative figure, but we see only the delta in threshold and dv/dt, but how were the initial absolute values different in the drug compared to control?</p></disp-quote><p>These data are presented in a new Supplemental Figure 1, showing no difference in threshold or peak dV/dt.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Fig 2. As far as I can tell, we have no idea how much inhibition there is at rest, before the current injection -what is the dv/dt in the drug compared to in the control? Were there experiments in which the current injections were delivered before and after applying drug? If not, at least it would be useful to see population data on dv/dt of the first spike in control and with drug.</p></disp-quote><p>These data are presented in a new Supplemental Figure 1, showing no difference in threshold or peak dV/dt.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5). Fig. 2. Do the authors have any quantitative information on how much extra inhibition would be produced at 200 nM drug using physiological waveforms of firing?</p></disp-quote><p>These types of analyses are part of later figures using EPSC-like waveforms to evoke spiking.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I was unconvinced that the changes in threshold and dv/dt during the firing in the drug necessarily represent time-dependent use-dependent effects of drug. Partial inhibition by TTX would probably produce greater progressive changes in spike shape and reduced ability to fire robustly.</p></disp-quote><p>TTX is not use-dependent, so it is a good contrast to GNE-4076. We experimented with a few cells at 2 and 10 nM TTX concentrations and found that concentrations required to mimic the block of spiking that occurs with 200 nM GNE-4076 in WT cells was associated with a marked use-independent elevation in AP threshold, with an inability to maintain ~10 Hz spiking rates with the baseline EPSC-like stimulation pattern. These effects are very different from those produced by GNE-4076, but were expected given the use-independence of TTX. We did not pursue this line of inquiry fully, so we present these data only as individual examples in the reviewer figure below:</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Data from Figure 6B, D, E are replicated here with individual lines of 2 nM and 10 nM TTX shown in dashed lines.</title><p>Note marked changes in threshold not observed with GNE-4076.

Without more rigorous development the results of the computational model appear to provides little additional insight beyond that expected from the known axodendritic localizations of NaV 1.2 and 1.6. If the authors wish to use the computational results to make rigorous predictions, then this section needs to be either be expanded to be more complete and promoted to a regular figure, with full details of the model, and how it was evaluated for accuracy. Alternatively, this point regarding computational insight could be de-emphasized and or removed from the paper.</p><p>Modeling:</p><p>(1) I don't see any methods describing the precise model parameters that were used.</p></disp-quote><p>Apologies, this is a model that we have built and tested extensively over the years (PMID: 38290518, 35417922, 34348157, 31995133, 31230762, 28256214), though there have been some small updates over these works. We have deposited this model at ModelDB and provide data there regarding model construction (access #2019342).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) There appears to be no robustness test to assess whether the particular results/conclusions were unduly dependent on particular model construction decisions.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now generated a new supplemental figure 2 that explores the robustness of these observations to changes in NaV1.2 and NaV1.6 position within the AIS and changes in relative density of NaV1.2 and NaV1.6. As shown there, the model is tolerant to all but extreme, non-physiological manipulations to these parameters.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Figure S2 does not really provide convincing evidence of a biologically relevant model. Probably the model itself needs to be redesigned to better replicate the biological response and be validated by testing parameter sensitivity.</p><p>a) All of the results in S2C show that there is a huge reduction in the first action potential (black?) followed by relatively little change in subsequent spikes. This is not seen in any of the models. The progressive changes in threshold as predicted by the model for dual and NaV1.6 block are not at all evident in the results of C, except perhaps for the the very first and the very last spikes.</p><p>b) The baseline action potential in B is different than the recorded action potentials. In particular, the somatic depolarization occurs much later and over a more extended time frame than the real neuron, and the phase plot shows an actual dip in depolarization at the transition to the somatic spike, which is not representative of naturally occurring action potentials.</p></disp-quote><p>To address both (a) and (b), please note that in empirical experiments there are two parallel processes occurring: block by GNE-4076 and channel recovery from inactivation. In the model we can isolate the effects of block to test that parameter fully and in isolation. This is something that we could never achieve biologically. The important take home here in both cases is to observe that with NaV1.6 block there is a change in threshold, whereas with NaV1.2 block there is none.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The one finding that seems to be robust is that the changes in NaV1.2 have little effect on threshold.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes! This is a major take-home message from both the model and the use of these knockin mice in combination with GNE-4076. In mature pyramidal cells, NaV1.6 is the major determinant of AP threshold. And to editorialize on this observation, changes in threshold are a useful metric to test if other pharmacology are truly selective for NaV1.2 over NaV1.6. We note that phrixotoxin-3, which is described as NaV1.2 specific in multiple papers, was never tested for specificity over NaV1.6 in its original description, and we find that it fails this test in our hands.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Data presentation:</p><p>(1) The phase plots in Figure 3B (left and right) appear to be visually identical, and as such don't strongly support any particular conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We changed the representative example record (specifically for Fig. 3A-B) to more directly support the conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) It is unclear to me what is meant by AP speed (title of Figure 3 legend). Do the authors mean propagation speed along the axon, or perhaps the rate of action potential firing?</p></disp-quote><p>Apologies, we are referencing dV/dt when we mention AP speed. We updated AP speed to AP velocity throughout the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
