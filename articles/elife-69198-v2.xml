responses to the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) modulator dalcetrapib, however, the mechanism behind this interaction is still unknown. Here, we characterized selective signals at the locus associated with the pharmacogenomic response in human populations and we show that rs1967309 region exhibits signatures of positive selection in several human populations. Furthermore, we identified a variant in <italic>CETP</italic>, rs158477, which is in long-range linkage disequilibrium with rs1967309 in the Peruvian population. The signal is mainly seen in males, a sex-specific result that is replicated in the LIMAA cohort of over 3400 Peruvians. Analyses of RNA-seq data further suggest an epistatic interaction on <italic>CETP</italic> expression levels between the two SNPs in multiple tissues, which also differs between males and females. We also detected interaction effects of the two SNPs with sex on cardiovascular phenotypes in the UK Biobank, in line with the sex-specific genotype associations found in Peruvians at these loci. We propose that <italic>ADCY9</italic> and <italic>CETP</italic> coevolved during recent human evolution due to sex-specific selection, which points toward a biological link between dalcetrapib’s pharmacogene <italic>ADCY9</italic> and its therapeutic target <italic>CETP</italic>.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>population genetics</kwd><kwd>pharmacogenomics</kwd><kwd>transcriptomics</kwd><kwd>phenotype associations</kwd><kwd>cardiovascular disease</kwd><kwd>linkage disequilibrium</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012679</institution-id><institution>Institut de Cardiologie de Montréal</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gamache</surname><given-names>Isabel</given-names></name><name><surname>Legault</surname><given-names>Marc-André</given-names></name><name><surname>Grenier</surname><given-names>Jean-Christophe</given-names></name><name><surname>Sanchez</surname><given-names>Rocio</given-names></name><name><surname>Rhéaume</surname><given-names>Eric</given-names></name><name><surname>Trochet</surname><given-names>Holly</given-names></name><name><surname>Tardif</surname><given-names>Jean-Claude</given-names></name><name><surname>Dubé</surname><given-names>Marie-Pierre</given-names></name><name><surname>Hussin</surname><given-names>Julie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005242</institution-id><institution>Université de Montréal</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gamache</surname><given-names>Isabel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Legault</surname><given-names>Marc-André</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001804</institution-id><institution>Canada Research Chairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tardif</surname><given-names>Jean-Claude</given-names></name><name><surname>Dubé</surname><given-names>Marie-Pierre</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000156</institution-id><institution>Fonds de Recherche du Québec -

It is a complex disease caused by the accumulation of cholesterol-loaded plaques that block blood flow in the coronary arteries. The cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) mediates the exchange of cholesterol esters and triglycerides between high-density lipoproteins (HDL) and lower density lipoproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lagrost, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Shinkai, 2012</xref>). Dalcetrapib is a CETP modulator that did not reduce cardiovascular event rates in the overall dal-OUTCOMES trial of patients with recent acute coronary syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Schwartz et al., 2012</xref>). However, pharmacogenomic analyses revealed that genotypes at rs1967309 in the <italic>ADCY9</italic> gene, coding for the ninth isoform of adenylate cyclase, modulated clinical responses to dalcetrapib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Tardif et al., 2015</xref>). Individuals who carried the AA genotype at rs1967309 in <italic>ADCY9</italic> had less cardiovascular events, reduced atherosclerosis progression, and enhanced cholesterol efflux from macrophages when treated with dalcetrapib compared to placebo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Tardif et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tardif et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, those with the GG genotype had the opposite effects from dalcetrapib. Furthermore, a protective effect against the formation of atherosclerotic lesions was seen only in the absence of both <italic>Adcy9</italic> and <italic>CETP</italic> in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rautureau et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting an interaction between the two genes. However, the underlying mechanisms linking <italic>CETP</italic> and <italic>ADCY9,</italic> located 50 Mb apart on chromosome 16, as well as the relevance of the rs1967309 non-coding genetic variant are still unclear.</p><p>Identification of selection pressure on a genetic variant can help shed light on its importance. Adaptation to different environments often leads to a rise in frequency of variants, by favoring survival and/or reproduction fitness. An example is the lactase gene (<italic>LCT</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bersaglieri et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Enattah et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gamba et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Itan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Poulter et al., 2003</xref>), where a positively selected intronic variant in <italic>MCM6</italic> leads to an escape from epigenetic inactivation of <italic>LCT</italic> and facilitates lactase persistence after weaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Labrie et al., 2016</xref>). Results of genomic studies for phenotypes such as adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia in Tibetans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Yi et al., 2010</xref>), fatty acid metabolism in Inuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fumagalli et al., 2015</xref>) or response to pathogens across populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hollenbach et al., 2001</xref>) have also been confirmed by functional studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Reynolds et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Tashi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Meyer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Blais et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, population and regulatory genomics can be leveraged to unveil the effect of genetic mutations at a single non-coding locus and reveal the biological mechanisms of adaptation.</p><p>When two or more loci interact during adaptation, a genomic scan will likely be underpowered to pinpoint the genetic determinants. In this study, we took a multi-step approach on the <italic>ADCY9</italic> and <italic>CETP</italic> candidate genes to specifically study their interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We used a joint evolutionary analysis to evaluate the potential signatures of selection in these genes (Step 1), which revealed positive selection pressures acting on <italic>ADCY9</italic>. Sex-specific genetic associations between the two genes are discovered in Peruvians (Step 2), a population in which natural selection for high-altitude was previously found on genes related to cardiovascular health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crawford et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, our know-down experiments and analyses of large-scale transcriptomics (Step 3) as well as available phenome-wide resources (Step 4) bring further evidence of a sex-specific epistatic interaction between <italic>ADCY9</italic> and <italic>CETP</italic>.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Flowchart of experimental design and main results.</title><p>The four main steps of the analyses conducted in this study are reported along with the datasets used for each step and the genetic loci on which the analyses are performed.

Its intronic location makes it difficult to assess its functional relevance but exploring selective signals around intronic SNPs in human populations can shed light on their importance. In African populations (AFR), the major genotype is AA, which is the homozygous genotype for the ancestral allele, whereas in Europeans (EUR), AA is the minor genotype. The frequency of the AA genotype is slightly higher in Asia (EAS, SAS) and America (AMR) compared to that in Europe, becoming the most frequent genotype in the Peruvian population (PEL). Using the integrated haplotype score (iHS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Voight et al., 2006</xref>) (Step 1 a, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), a statistic that enables the detection of evidence for recent strong positive selection (typically when |iHS| &gt; 2), we observed that several SNPs in the LD block around rs1967309 exhibit selective signatures in non-African populations (|iHS<sub>SAS</sub>| = 2.66, |iHS<sub>EUR</sub>| = 2.31), whereas no signal is seen in this LD block in African populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>, Appendix 1). Our analyses suggest that this locus in <italic>ADCY9</italic> has been the target of recent positive selection in several human populations, with multiple, possibly independent, selective signals detectable around rs1967309. However, recent positive selection as measured by iHS does not seem to explain the notable increase in frequency for the A allele in the PEL population (f<sub>A</sub> = 0.77), compared to the European (f<sub>A</sub> = 0.41), Asian (f<sub>A</sub> = 0.44), and other American populations (f<sub>A</sub> = 0.54 in AMR without PEL).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Natural selection signature at rs1967309 in <italic>ADCY9</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Genotype frequency distribution of rs1967309 in populations from the 1000 Genomes (1000G) Project and in Native Americans (NAGD).

This statistic has been developed to locate selection signals by summarizing differentiation between populations using a three-way comparison of allele frequencies between a specific group, a closely related population, and an outgroup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Yi et al., 2010</xref>). It has been shown to increase power to detect incomplete selective sweeps on standing variation. Applying this statistic to investigate rs1967309 allele frequency in PEL, we used Mexicans (MXL) as a closely related group and a Chinese population (CHB) as the outgroup (Methods). Over the entire genome, the CHB branches are greater than PEL and MXL branches (mean<sub>CHB</sub> = 0.020, mean<sub>MXL</sub> = 0.008, mean<sub>PEL</sub> = 0.009), which reflects the expectation under genetic drift. However, the estimated PEL branch length at rs1967309 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>), which reflects differentiation since the split from the MXL population (PBS<sub>PEL,rs1967309</sub>=0.051, empirical p-value = 0.014), surpasses the CHB branch length (PBS<sub>CHB,rs1967309</sub>=0.049, empirical p-value &gt; 0.05), which reflects differentiation since the split between Asian and American populations, whereas no such effect is seen in MXL (PBS<sub>MXL,rs1967309</sub>=0.026, empirical p-value &gt; 0.05), or for any other AMR populations. Furthermore, the PEL branch lengths at several SNPs in this LD block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>) are in the top 5 % of all PEL branch lengths across the whole genome (PBS<sub>PEL,95th</sub> = 0.031), whereas these increased branch lengths are not observed outside of the LD block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). These results are robust to the choice of the outgroup and the closely related AMR population (Materials and methods).</p><p>The increase in frequency of the A allele at rs1967309 is also seen in genotype data from Native American populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Reich et al., 2012</xref>), with Andeans showing genotype frequencies highly similar to PEL (f<sub>A</sub> = 0.77, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). The PEL population has a large Andean ancestry (Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2a and b</xref>) and almost no African ancestry, strongly suggesting that the increase in AA genotype arose in the Andean population and not from admixture with Africans. The PEL individuals that harbor the AA genotype for rs1967309 do not exhibit a larger genome-wide Andean ancestry than non-AA individuals (p-value = 0.30, Mann-Whitney U test). Overall, these results suggest that the ancestral allele A at rs1967309, after dropping in frequency following the out-of-Africa event, has increased in frequency in the Andean population and has been preferentially retained in the Peruvian population’s genetic makeup, potentially because of natural selection.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Evidence for co-evolution between <italic>ADCY9</italic> and CETP in Peru</title><p>The pharmacogenetic link between <italic>ADCY9</italic> and the CETP modulator dalcetrapib raises the question of whether there is a genetic relationship between rs1967309 in <italic>ADCY9</italic> and <italic>CETP</italic>, both located on chromosome 16. Such a relationship can be revealed by analyzing patterns of long-range linkage disequilibrium (LRLD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lewontin and Kojima, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Rohlfs et al., 2010</xref>), in order to detect whether specific combinations of alleles (or genotypes) at two loci are particularly overrepresented. To do so, we calculated the genotyped-based linkage disequilibrium (r<sup>2</sup>) (Step 2 a, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) between rs1967309 and each SNP in <italic>CETP</italic> with minor allele frequency (MAF) above 0.05. In the Peruvian population, there are four SNPs, (including two in perfect LD in PEL) that exhibit r<sup>2</sup> values with rs1967309 that are in the top 1 % of r<sup>2</sup> values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>) computed for all 37,802 pairs of SNPs in <italic>ADCY9</italic> and <italic>CETP</italic> genes with MAF &gt;0.05 (Materials and methods). Despite the r<sup>2</sup> values themselves being low (r<sup>2</sup><sub>rs158477</sub>=0.080, r<sup>2</sup><sub>rs158480;rs158617</sub>=0.089, r<sup>2</sup><sub>rs12447620</sub>=0.090), these values are highly unexpected for these two genes situated 50 Mb apart (<italic>ADCY9/CETP</italic> empirical p-value &lt; 0.006, <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>) and thus correspond to a significant LRLD signal. This signal is not seen in other 1000G populations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>). We also computed r<sup>2</sup> between the four identified SNPs’ genotypes and all <italic>ADCY9</italic> SNPs with MAF above 0.05 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). The distribution of r<sup>2</sup> values for the rs158477 <italic>CETP</italic> SNP shows a clear bell-shaped pattern around rs1967309 in <italic>ADCY9</italic>, which strongly suggests the rs1967309-rs158477 genetic association detected is not simply a statistical fluke, while the signal in the region for the other SNPs is less conclusive. The SNP rs158477 in <italic>CETP</italic> is also the only one that has a PEL branch length value higher than the 95th percentile, also higher than the CHB branch length value (PBS<sub>PEL,rs158477</sub>=0.062, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3a</xref>), in line with the observation at rs1967309.

No significant enrichment is seen at either locus and significant LRLD is also seen in the Andean source population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a, b</xref>, Appendix 1). Furthermore, we see no enrichment of Andean ancestry in individuals harboring the overrepresented combination of genotypes, AA at rs1967309+ GG at rs158477, compared to other combinations (p-value = 0.18, Mann-Whitney U test). These results show that admixture patterns in PEL cannot be solely responsible for the association found between rs1967309 and rs158477. Finally, using a genome-wide null distribution which allows to capture the LRLD distribution expected under the admixture levels present in this sample (Appendix 1), we show that the r<sup>2</sup> value between the two SNPs is higher than expected given their allele frequencies and the physical distance between them (genome-wide empirical p-value = 0.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that the AA/GG combination is being transmitted to the next generation more often (i.e. is likely selectively favored) which reveals a signature of co-evolution between <italic>ADCY9</italic> and <italic>CETP</italic> at these loci.</p><p>Still, such a LRLD signal can be due to a small sample size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Park, 2019</xref>). To confirm independently the association between genotypes at rs1967309 of <italic>ADCY9</italic> and rs158477 of <italic>CETP</italic>, we used the LIMAA cohort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Asgari et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Luo et al., 2019</xref>), a large cohort of 3509 Peruvian individuals with genotype information, to replicate our finding. The ancestry distribution, as measured by RFMix (Methods) is similar between the two cohorts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2a</xref>), however, the LIMAA cohort population structure shows additional subgroups compared to the 1000G PEL population sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2c-e</xref>): to limit confounders, we excluded individuals coming from these subgroups (Appendix 1). In this dataset (N = 3,243), the pair of SNPs rs1967309-rs158477 is the only pairs identified in PEL who shows evidence for LRLD, with an r<sup>2</sup> value in the top 1 % of all pairs of SNPs in <italic>ADCY9</italic> and <italic>CETP</italic> (<italic>ADCY9/CETP</italic> empirical p-value = 0.003, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1c, d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>). The r<sup>2</sup> test used above is powerful to detect allelic associations, but the net association measured will be very small if selection acts on a specific genotype combination rather than on alleles.

We therefore explored further the effect of sex on the LRLD association found between rs1967309 and rs158477 and performed sex-stratified LRLD analyses. These analyses revealed that the correlation between rs1967309 and rs158477 is only seen in males in PEL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a and b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">Appendix 1—figure 4a and b</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>): the r<sup>2</sup> value rose to 0.348 in males (<italic>ADCY9/CETP</italic> empirical p-value = 8.23 × 10<sup>–5</sup>, genome-wide empirical p-value &lt; 2.85 × 10<sup>–4</sup>, N = 41) and became non-significant in females (<italic>ADCY9</italic>/<italic>CETP</italic> empirical p-value = 0.78, genome-wide empirical p-value = 0.80, N = 44). In the Andean population, the association between rs1967309 and rs158477 is not significant when we stratified by sex (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>), but we still see significant association signals with rs158477 at other SNPs in <italic>ADCY9</italic> LD block in both sexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">Appendix 1—figure 5a,b</xref>).

In order to be under selection, mutations typically need to modulate a phenotype or an endophenotype, such as gene expression. We have shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rautureau et al., 2018</xref>) that CETP and <italic>Adcy9</italic> interact in mice to modulate several phenotypes, including atherosclerotic lesion development.

When looking across tissues in GTEx, <italic>ADCY9</italic> and <italic>CETP</italic> expressions negatively correlate in almost all the tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig6">Appendix 1—figure 6</xref>, Appendix 1), which is consistent with the effect observed during the <italic>ADCY9-KD</italic> experiment, showing increased expression of <italic>CETP</italic> expression when <italic>ADCY9</italic> is lowly expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a, b</xref>). We evaluated the effects of the SNPs on expression levels of <italic>ADCY9</italic> and <italic>CETP</italic> by modelling both SNPs as continuous variables (additive model) (Methods). The <italic>CETP</italic> SNP rs158477 was reported as an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) in GTEx v7 and, in our models, shows evidence of being a <italic>cis</italic> eQTL of <italic>CETP</italic> in several other tissues (Appendix 1), although not reaching genome-wide significance. To test specifically for an epistatic effect between rs1967309 and rs158477 on <italic>CETP</italic> expression, we included an interaction term in eQTL models (Materials and methods). We note here that we are testing for association for this specific pair of SNPs only, and that effects across tissues are not independent, such that we set our significance threshold at p-value = 0.05. This analysis revealed a significant interaction effect (p-value = 0.03, ß = −0.22) between the two SNPs on <italic>CETP</italic> expression in GEUVADIS lymphoblastoid cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig7">Appendix 1—figure 7a</xref>). In rs1967309 AA individuals, copies of the rs158477 A allele increased <italic>CETP</italic> expression by 0.46 (95% CI 0.26–0.86) on average. In rs1967309 AG individuals, copies of the rs158477 A allele increased CETP expression by 0.24 (95% CI 0.06–0.43) on average and the effect was null in rs1967309 GG individuals (p-value<sub>GG</sub> = 0.58). This suggests that the effect of rs158477 on <italic>CETP</italic> expression changes depending on genotypes of rs1967309. The interaction is also significant in several GTEx tissues, most of which are brain tissues, like hippocampus, hypothalamus, and substantia nigra, but also in skin, although we note that the significance of the interaction depends on the number of PEER factors included in the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig8">Appendix 1—figure 8</xref>). These factors are needed to correct for unknown biases in the data, but also potentially lead to decreased power to detect interaction effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brynedal et al., 2017</xref>). In CaG whole blood samples, the interaction effect using additive genetic effect at rs1967309 was not significant, similarly to results from GTEx in whole blood samples. However, given the larger size of the dataset, we evaluated a genotypic encoding for the rs1967309 SNP in which the interaction effect is significant (<italic>P</italic>-value = 0.008, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig7">Appendix 1—figure 7b</xref>) in whole blood, suggesting that rs1967309 could be modulating rs158477 eQTL effect, in this tissue at least, with a genotype-specific effect. We highlight that the sample sizes of current transcriptomic resources do not allow to detect interaction effects at genome-wide significance, however the likelihood of finding interaction effects between our two SNPs on <italic>CETP</italic> expression in three independent datasets is unlikely to happen by chance alone, providing evidence for a functional genetic interaction.</p><p>Given the sex-specific results reported above, we stratified our interaction eQTL analyses by sex. We observed that the interaction effect on <italic>CETP</italic> expression in CaG whole blood samples (N<sub>male</sub> = 359) is restricted to male individuals, and, despite low power due to smaller sample size in GEUVADIS, the interaction is also only suggestive in males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig7">Appendix 1—figure 7c and d</xref>). In GTEx, most well-powered tissues that showed a significant effect in the sex-combined analyses also harbor male-specific interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig9">Appendix 1—figure 9</xref>). For instance, GTEx skin male samples (N<sub>male</sub> = 330) show the most significant male-specific interaction effects, with the directions of effects replicating the sex-combined result in GEUVADIS (an increase of <italic>CETP</italic> expression for each rs158477 A allele in rs1967309 AA individuals) albeit with an observable reversal of the direction in rs1967309 GG individuals (decrease of <italic>CETP</italic> expression with additional rs158477 A alleles) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2a</xref>). However, significant effects in females are detected in tissues not previously seen as significant for the interaction in the sex-combined analysis, in the tibial artery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>) and the heart atrial appendage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig9">Appendix 1—figure 9</xref>). For tissues with evidence of sex-specific effects in stratified analyses, we also tested the effect of an interaction between sex, rs158477 and rs1967309 (Materials and methods) on <italic>CETP</italic> expression: the three-way interaction is only significant for tibial artery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Epistatic effects on phenotypes</title><p>The interaction effect of rs1967309 and rs158477 on <italic>CETP</italic> expression in several tissues, found in multiple independent RNA-seq datasets, coupled with the detection of LRLD between these SNPs in the Peruvian population suggest that selection may act jointly on these loci, specifically in Peruvians or Andeans. These populations are well known for their adaptation to life in high altitude, where the oxygen pressure is lower and where the human body is subjected to hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Beall, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brutsaert et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Julian and Moore, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Moore, 2017a</xref>).

For CAD, we see a significant three-way interaction effect, meaning that for individuals carrying the AA genotype at rs1967309, the association between rs158477 and CAD is in the opposite direction in males and females. In other words, in rs1967309-AA females, having an extra A allele at rs158477, which is associated with higher <italic>CETP</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>), has a protective effect on CAD. Conversely, in rs1967309-AA males, each A allele at rs158477 increases the probability of having an event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). Little effect is seen in either sex for AG or GG at rs1967309, although the heterozygotes AG behave differently in females (which further justifies the genotypic encoding of rs1967309). The beneficial effect of the interaction on CAD thus favors the rs1967309-AA+ rs153477 GG males and the rs1967309-AA+ rs153477 AA females, two genotype combinations which are respectively enriched in a sex-specific manner in the LIMAA cohort (Appendix 1).

Again, given the differences observed between the sexes, we tested the effect of an interaction between sex, rs158477 and rs1967309 (genotypic coding, Materials and methods) on biomarkers, and only Lp(a) was nominally significant in a three-way interaction (p-value = 0.049). The pattern is similar to the results for CAD, ie. a change in the effect of rs158477 depending on the genotype of rs1967309 in males, with the effect for AA females in the opposite direction compared to males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). These concordant results between CAD and Lp(a) support that the putative interaction effect between the loci under study on phenotypes involves sex as a modifier.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we used population genetics, transcriptomics and interaction analyses in biobanks to study the link between <italic>ADCY9</italic> and <italic>CETP</italic>. Our study revealed selective signatures in <italic>ADCY9</italic> and a significant genotypic association between <italic>ADCY9</italic> and <italic>CETP</italic> in two Peruvian cohorts, specifically between rs1967309 and rs158477, which was also seen in the Native population of the Andes. The interaction between the two SNPs was found to be nominally significant for respiratory and cardiovascular disease outcomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Additionally, a nominally significant epistatic interaction was seen on <italic>CETP</italic> expression in many tissues, including the hippocampus and hypothalamus in the brain. Despite brain tissues not displaying the highest <italic>CETP</italic> expression levels, CETP that is synthesized and secreted in the brain could play an important role in the transport and the redistribution of lipids within the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Albers et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yamada et al., 1995</xref>) and has been associated with Alzheimer’s disease risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Murphy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Oestereich et al., 2020</xref>). These findings reinforce the fact that the SNPs are likely functionally interacting, but extrapolating on the specific phenotypes under selection from these results is not straight forward. Identifying the phenotype and environmental pressures that may have caused the selection signal is complicated by the fact that the UK Biobank participants, on which the marginally significant associations have been found, do not live in the same environment as Peruvians. In Andeans from Peru, selection in response to hypoxia at high altitude was proposed to have effects on the cardiovascular system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crawford et al., 2017</xref>). The hippocampus functions are perturbed at high altitude (eg. deterioration of memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lieberman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Shukitt-Hale et al., 1994</xref>), whereas the hypothalamus regulates the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and controls the heart and respiratory rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Horiuchi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rahmouni, 2016</xref>), phenotypes which are affected by hypoxia at high altitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bärtsch and Gibbs, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hainsworth et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, high altitude-induced hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bigham and Lee, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Moore, 2017b</xref>) and cardiovascular system disturbances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abe et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lee et al., 2019</xref>) have been shown to be associated in several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Faeh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Naeije, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ostadal and Kolar, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Riley and Gavin, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Savla et al., 2018</xref>), thus potentially sharing common biological pathways. Therefore, our working hypothesis is that selective pressures on our genes of interest in Peru are linked to the physiological response to high-altitude, which might be the environmental driver of coevolution.</p><p>The significant interaction effects on <italic>CETP</italic> expression vary between sexes in amplitude and direction, with most signals driven by male samples, but significant interaction effects observed in females only, despite sample sizes being consistently lower than for males. Notably, in the tibial artery and heart atrial appendage, two tissues directly relevant to the cardiovascular system, the female-specific interaction effect on <italic>CETP</italic> expression is reversed between rs1967309 genotypes AA and GG, compared to the effects seen in males in skin and brain tissues. Given our <italic>ADCY9-KD</italic> were done in liver cell lines from male donors, future work to fully understand how rs1967309 and rs158477 interact will focus on additional experiments in cells from both male and female donors in these relevant tissues. In a previous study, we showed that inhibition of both <italic>Adcy9</italic> and <italic>CETP</italic> impacted many phenotypes linked to the ANS in male mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rautureau et al., 2018</xref>), but in the light of our results, these experiments should be repeated in female mice. The function of ANS is important in a number of pathophysiological states involving the cardiovascular system, like myocardial ischemia and cardiac arrhythmias, with significant sex differences reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abhishekh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dart et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Nugent et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The interaction effect between the <italic>ADCY9</italic> and <italic>CETP</italic> SNPs on both respiratory and cardiovascular phenotypes differs between the sexes, with effects on respiratory phenotypes limited to females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>) and cardiovascular disease phenotype associations showing significant three-way sex-by-SNPs effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Furthermore, the LRLD signal is present mainly in males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), although the genotype association is also seen in female for a different genotype combination, suggesting the presence of sex-specific selection. This type of selection is very difficult to detect, especially on autosomes, with very few empirical examples found to date in the human genome despite strong theoretical support of their occurrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Morrow and Connallon, 2013</xref>). However, sexual dimorphism in gene expression between males and females on autosomal genes has been linked to evolutionary pressures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Connallon and Clark, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Parsch and Ellegren, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Williams and Carroll, 2009</xref>), possibly with a contribution of epistasis. As the source of selection, we favor the hypothesis of differential survival over differential ability to reproduce, because the genetic combination between <italic>ADCY9</italic> and <italic>CETP</italic> has high chances to be broken up by recombination at each generation. Even in the case where recombination is suppressed in males between these loci, they would still have equal chances to pass the favored combination to both male and female offspring, which would not explain the sex-specific LRLD signal. We see an enrichment for the rs1967309-AA+ rs158477 GG in males and rs1967309-AA+ rs158477 AA in females, which are the beneficial combination for CAD in the corresponding sex, possibly pointing to a sexually antagonistic selection pressure, where the fittest genotype combination depends on the sex.</p><p>Such two-gene selection signature, where only males show strong LRLD, can happen if a specific genotype combination is beneficial in creating males (through differential gamete fitness or in utero survival, for example) or if survival during adulthood is favored with a specific genotype combination compared to other genotypes. In the case of age-dependent differential survival, the genotypic association is expected to be weaker at younger ages, however the LRLD signal between rs1967309 and rs158477 in the LIMAA cohort did not depend on age neither in males nor in females (Appendix 1). Since very few individuals were younger than 20 years old, it is likely that the age range in this cohort is not appropriate to distinguish between the two possibilities. This age-dependent survival therefore remains to be tested in comparison with pediatric cohorts of Peruvians: if the LRLD signal is absent in newborns for example, it will suggest a strong selective pressure acts early in life on boys. To specifically test the in utero hypothesis, a cohort of stillborn babies with genetic information could allow to evaluate if the genotype combination is more frequent in these. Lastly, it may be that the evolutionary pressure is linked to the sex chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cox et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">McGlothlin et al., 2019</xref>), and a three-way interaction between <italic>ADCY9</italic>, <italic>CETP</italic> and Y chromosome haplotypes or mitochondrial haplogroups remains to be explored.</p><p>Even though we observed the LRLD signal between rs1967309 and rs158477 in two independent Peruvian cohorts, reducing the likelihood that our result is a false positive, one limitation is that the individuals were recruited in the same city (Lima) in both cohorts. However, we show that both populations are heterogeneous with respect to ancestry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2</xref>), suggesting that they likely represent accurately the Peruvian population. As recent admixture and population structure can strongly influence LRLD, we performed several analyses to consider these confounders, in the full cohorts and in the sex-stratified analyses. All analyses were robust to genome-wide and local ancestry patterns, such that our results are unlikely to be explained by these effects alone (Appendix 1). Unfortunately, we could not use expression and phenotypic data from Peruvian individuals, which makes all the links between the selection pressures and the phenotype associations somewhat indirect. Future studies should focus on evaluating the phenotypic impact of the interaction specifically in Peruvians individuals, in cohorts such as the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wojcik et al., 2019</xref>), in order to confirm the marginally significant associations found in European cohorts. Indeed, the Peruvian/Andean genomic background could be of importance for the interaction effect observed in this population, which reduces the power of discovery in individuals of unmatched ancestry. Furthermore, not much is known about the strength of this type of selection, and simulations would help evaluate how strong selection would need to be in a single generation to produce this level of LRLD. Another limitation is the low number of samples per tissue in GTEx and the cell composition heterogeneity per tissue and per sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Battle et al., 2017</xref>), which can be partially captured by PEER factors and can modulate the eQTL effects. Therefore, our power to detect tissue-specific interaction effects is reduced in this dataset, making it quite remarkable that we were able to observe multiple nominally significant interaction effects between the loci.</p><p>Despite these limitations, our results support a functional role for the <italic>ADCY9</italic> intronic SNP rs1967309, likely involved in a molecular mechanism related to <italic>CETP</italic> expression, but this mechanism seems to implicate sex as a modulator in a tissue-specific way, which complicates greatly its understanding. In the dal-OUTCOMES clinical trial, the partial inhibitor of CETP, dalcetrapib, did not decrease the risk of cardiovascular outcomes in the overall population, but rs1967309 in the <italic>ADCY9</italic> gene was associated to the response to the drug, which benefitted AA individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Tardif et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, rs1967309 AA is found in both the male and female beneficial combinations of genotypes for CAD, the same that are enriched in Peruvians, but without taking rs158477 and sex into account, this association was masked. The modulation of <italic>CETP</italic> expression by rs1967309 could impact CETP’s functions that are essential for successfully reducing cardiovascular events. The rs158477 locus could be a key player for these functions, and dalcetrapib may be mimicking its impact, hence explaining the pharmacogenomics association. Furthermore, in the light of our results, some of these effects could differ between men and women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Metzinger et al., 2020</xref>), which may need to be taken into consideration in the future precision medicine interventions potentially implemented for dalcetrapib.</p><p>In conclusion, we discovered a putative epistatic interaction between the pharmacogene <italic>ADCY9</italic> and the drug target gene <italic>CETP</italic>, that appears to be under selection in the Peruvian population. Our approach exemplifies the potential of using evolutionary analyses to help find relationships between pharmacogenes and their drug targets. We characterized the impact of the <italic>ADCY9/CETP</italic> interaction on a range of phenotypes and tissues. Our gene expression results in brain tissues suggest that the interaction could play a role in protection against challenges to the nervous system caused by stress such as hypoxia. The female-specific eQTL interaction results in arteries and heart tissues further suggest a link with the cardiovascular system, and the phenotype association results support further this hypothesis. In light of the associations between high altitude-induced hypoxia and cardiovascular system changes, the interaction identified in this study could be involved in both systems: for example, ADCY9 and CETP could act in pathways involved in adaptation to high altitude, which could influence cardiovascular risk via their interaction in a sex-specific manner. Finally, our findings of an evolutionary relationship between <italic>ADCY9</italic> and <italic>CETP</italic> during recent human evolution points towards a biological link between dalcetrapib’s pharmacogene <italic>ADCY9</italic> and its therapeutic target <italic>CETP</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

Second, the Genotype-tissue Expression v8 (GTEx) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">GTEx Consortium, 2013</xref>) was accessed through dbGaP (phs000424.v8.p2, dbgap project #19088) and contains gene expression across 54 tissues and 948 donors, genetic and phenotypic information. Phenotype analyses are described in Appendix 1. The cohort contains mainly of European descent (84.6%), aged between 20 and 79 years old. Analyses were done on 699 individuals, 66 % of males and 34 % of females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig10">Appendix 1—figure 10a</xref>). Third, we used the data from the CARTaGENE biobank (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Awadalla et al., 2013</xref>) (CAG project number 406713) which includes 728 RNA-seq whole-blood samples with genotype data, from individuals from Quebec (Canada) aged between 36 and 72 years old (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig10">Appendix 1—figure 10b</xref>).

Additional genetic quality control was done using pyGenClean (v.1.8.3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lemieux Perreault et al., 2013</xref>). Variants or individuals with more than 2 % missing genotypes were filtered out. Individuals with discrepancies between the self-reported and genetic sex or with aneuploidies were removed from the analysis. We considered only individuals of European ancestry based on PCs, as it is the largest population in the UK Biobank, and because ancestry can be a confounder of the genetic effect on phenotypes. We used the PCs from UK Biobank to define a region in PC space using individuals identified as ‘white British ancestry’ as a reference population. Using the kinship estimates from the UK Biobank, we randomly removed individuals from kinship pairs where the coefficient was higher than 0.0884 (corresponding to a third-degree relationship). The resulting post QC dataset included 413,138 individuals. For the reported phenotypes, the date of baseline visit was between 2006 and 2010. The latest available hospitalization records discharge date was June 30th 2020 and the latest date in the death registries was February 14th 2018. We used algorithmically defined cardiovascular outcomes based on combinations of operation procedure codes (OPCS) and hospitalization or death record codes (ICD9/ICD10). A description of the tested continuous variables can be found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table2">Appendix 1—table 2</xref>. We used age at recruitment defined in variable #21,022 and sex in variable #31. We ignored self-reported events for cardiovascular outcomes as preliminary analyses suggested they were less precise than hospitalization and death records.</p><p>In association models, each SNP analyzed is coded by the number of non-reference alleles, G for rs1967309 and A for rs158477. SNP rs1967309 was also coded as a genotypic variable, to allow for non-additive effects. For continuous traits (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table2">Appendix 1—table 2</xref>) in the UK Biobank, general two-sided linear models (GLM) were performed using SAS software (v.9.4). A GLM model was first performed using the covariates age, sex and PCs 1–10. The externally studentized residuals were used to determine the outliers, which were removed. The normality assumption was confirmed by visual inspection of residuals for most of the outcomes, except <italic>birthwt</italic> and <italic>sleep</italic>. For biomarkers and cardiovascular endpoints, regression analyses were done in R (v.3.6.1). Linear regression analyses were conducted on standardized outcomes and logistic regression was used for cardiovascular outcomes. Marginal effects were calculated using margins package in R. In both cases, models were adjusted for age at baseline and top 10 PCs, as well as sex when not stratified. In models assessing two-way (rs1967309 by rs158477) or three-way (rs1967309 by rs158477 by sex) interactions, we used a 2 d.f. likelihood ratio test for the genotypic dummy variables’ interaction terms (genotypic model) (Appendix 1).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>RNA-sequencing of ADCY9-knocked-down Hepg2 cell line</title><p>The human liver hepatocellular HepG2 cell line was obtained from ATCC, a cell line derived from the liver tissue of a 15-year-old male donor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">López-Terrada et al., 2009</xref>).

Preparation of sequencing library and sequencing was performed at the McGill University Innovation Center. Briefly, ribosomal RNA was depleted using NEBNext rRNA depletion kit. Sequencing was performed using Illumina NovaSeq 6000 S2 paired end 100 bp sequencing lanes. Basic QC analysis of the 10 samples was performed by the Canadian Centre for Computational Genomics (C3G).

For <italic>ADCY9</italic> and <italic>CETP</italic> gene-level differential expression analyses, we compared the mean of each group of replicates with a t-test for paired samples. The transcriptome-wide differential expression analysis was done using limma, on all genes having an average of at least 10 reads across samples from a condition.

Prior to iHS computation, ancestral alleles were retrieved from six primates using the EPO pipeline (version e59) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Herrero et al., 2016</xref>) and the filtered 1000 Genomes vcf files were converted to change the reference allele as ancestral allele using bcftools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Li et al., 2009</xref>) with the fixref plugin. The hapbin program (v.1.3.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Maclean et al., 2015</xref>) was then used to compute iHS using per population-specific genetic maps computed by Adam Auton on the 1000G OMNI dataset (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/working/20130507_omni_recombination_rates/">http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/working/20130507_omni_recombination_rates/</ext-link>). When the genetic map was not available for a subpopulation, the genetic map from the closest sub-population was selected according to their global FST value computed on the phase three dataset.</p><p>We scanned the <italic>ADCY9</italic> and <italic>CETP</italic> genes using the population branch statistic (PBS), using 1000G sub-populations data. PBS summarizes a three-way comparison of allele frequencies between two closely related populations, and an outgroup. The grouping we focused on was PEL/MXL/CHB, with PEL being the focal population to test if allele frequencies are especially differentiated from those in the other populations. The CHB population was chosen as an outgroup to represent a Eurasian population that share common ancestors in the past with the American populations, after the out-of-Africa event. Using PJL (South Asia) and CEU (Europe) as an outgroup, or CLM as a closely related population (instead of MXL) yield highly similar results. To calculate F<sub>ST</sub> for each pair of population in our tree, we used vcftools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Danecek et al., 2011</xref>) by subpopulation. We calculated normalized PBS values as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crawford et al., 2017</xref>, which adjusts values for positions with large branches in all populations, for the whole genome. We use this distribution to define an empirical threshold for significance based on the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile of all PBS values genome-wide for each of the three populations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Long-range linkage disequilibrium</title><p>Long-range linkage disequilibrium (LRLD) was calculated using the function geno-r2 of vcftools (v.0.1.17) which uses the genotype frequencies. LRLD was evaluated in all subpopulations from 1000 Genomes Project Phase III, in LIMAA and NAGD, for all biallelic SNPs in <italic>ADCY9</italic> (chr16:4,012,650–4,166,186 in Hg19 genome reference) and <italic>CETP</italic> (chr16:56,995,835–57,017,756 in Hg19 genome reference). We analyzed loci from the phased VCF files that had a MAF of at least 5 % and a missing genotype of at most 10%, in order to retain a maximum of SNPs in NAGD which has higher missing rates than the others. We extracted the 99th percentile of all pairs of comparisons between <italic>ADCY9</italic> and <italic>CETP</italic> genes to use as a threshold for empirical significance and we refer to these as <italic>ADCY9/CETP</italic> empirical p-values. In LIMAA, we also evaluated the genotypic association using a <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf10"><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>χ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> test with four degrees of freedom (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf11"><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>χ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:math></inline-formula>) using a permutation test, as reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Rohlfs et al., 2010</xref> (Appendix 1).</p><p>Furthermore, for both cohorts, we created a distribution of LRLD values for random pairs of SNPs across the genome to obtain a genome-wide null distribution of LRLD to evaluate how unusual the genotypic association between our candidate SNPs (rs1967309-rs158477) is while taking into account the cohort-specific background genomic noise/admixture and allele frequencies. We extracted 3513 pairs of SNPs that match rs1967309 and rs158477 in terms of MAF, physical distance (in base pairs) and genetic distance (in centiMorgans (cM), based on the PEL genetic map) between them in both cohorts (Appendix 1), and report genome-wide empirical p-values based on this distribution. For the analyses of LRLD between <italic>ADCY9</italic> and <italic>CETP</italic> stratified by sex, we considered the same set of SNP pairs that we used for the full cohorts, but separated the dataset by sex before calculating the LRLD values. To evaluate how likely the differences observed in LRLD between sex are, we also performed permutations of the sex labels across individuals to create a null distribution of sex-specific effects (Appendix 1).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Local ancestry inference</title><p>To evaluate local ancestry in the PEL subpopulation and in the LIMAA cohort, we constructed a reference panel using the phased haplotypes from 1000 Genomes (YRI, CEU, CHB) and the phased haplotypes of NAGD (Northern American, Central American and Andean) (Appendix 1). We kept overlapping positions between all datasets, and when SNPs had the exact same genetic position, we kept the SNP with the highest variance in allele frequencies across all reference populations (Appendix 1). We ran RFMix (v.2.03) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Maples et al., 2013</xref>) (with the option ‘reanalyze-reference’ and for 25 iterations) on all phased chromosomes. We estimated the whole genome average proportion of each ancestry using a weighted mean of the chromosome specific proportions given by RFMix based on the chromosome size in cM. For comparing the overall Andean enrichment inferred by RFMix between rs1967309/rs158477 genotype categories, we used a two-sided Wilcoxon-t-test. To evaluate the Andean local ancestry enrichment specifically at <italic>ADCY9</italic> and <italic>CETP</italic>, we computed the genome-wide 95th percentile for proportion of Andean attribution for all intervals given by RFMix.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Code and source data</title><p>Numerical summary data represented as a graph in main figures, as well as the code to reproduce figures and analyses, can be found here: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gamache, 2021</xref>.

co-authors. The Native American Genetic Dataset (NAGD) dataset being quite sparse and samples coming from many different populations, no missing data threshold nor minor allele frequency or Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium filters were applied prior to the imputation. Harmonization to the hg19 reference genome has been done using GenotypeHarmonizer v.1.4.20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Deelen et al., 2014</xref>) and bcftools v.1.9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Li et al., 2009</xref>) with the fixref plugin (-m flip option). Imputation was done using the Sanger Imputation Server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">McCarthy et al., 2016</xref>) using Haplotype Reference Consortium (r1.1) reference panel, with a pre-phasing using SHAPEIT2 r.837 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Delaneau et al., 2013</xref>) and imputation using PBWT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Durbin, 2014</xref>). Post-imputation quality control was done by keeping sites with an INFO score over 0.8 and keeping genotypes having a posterior probability over 0.9. SHAPEIT2 was run to get phased genotypes (parameters: effective size of 10,000, burn of 10, prune of 10, main of 25, states of 400). The obtained VCF was used in the RFMix analysis (see below). SNPs with missing genotypes higher than 90 % after imputation were removed for LRLD analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s8-2" sec-type="appendix"><title>Pre-processing of the LIMAA cohort</title><p>A pre-imputation step was conducted keeping only positions passing minor allele frequency (MAF) of 1%, 1 % of missing data per site and HWE <italic>P</italic>-value &gt; 1e-5 using PLINK v.1.9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Purcell et al., 2007</xref>).

Imputation was done using the Sanger Imputation Server, using Haplotype Reference Consortium (r1.1) reference panel, with a pre-phasing using SHAPEIT2 and imputation using PBWT. Post-imputation quality control was done by keeping sites with an INFO score over 0.8 and keeping genotypes having a posterior probability over 0.9. Furthermore, positions having less than 5 % missing rate after the genotyping recoding step were kept and duplicated positions were removed. SHAPEIT2 was run to get phased genotypes (parameters: effective size of 10,000, burn of 10, prune of 10, main of 25, states of 400). Another dataset was built to recover one of our SNPs of interest (rs1967309), which was excluded from our previous pipeline because of their INFO score (0.79). In this new dataset, the INFO score threshold was put to 0.7 and the post-imputation position missing data threshold was set to 35%, being less stringent, but recovering our positions.

Another approach we took was to investigate the impact of sex on our PBS results, by splitting the sample between males and females, and recomputing all PBS values using PEL, MXL and CHB for SNPs on chromosome 16 in each subsample. We report result on chromosome 16 that account for chromosome specific population history, as in our analyses of the full cohort, tests on chromosome 16 were more conservative than on the whole genome (i.e. p-values were slightly larger with chromosome 16 alone). Although over the full chromosome, the distribution was not statistically different between males and females (PBS<sub>95th-PEL,male</sub> = 0.043; PBS<sub>95th-PEL,female</sub> = 0.040) as expected, curiously the PEL branch length for all SNPs around rs1967309 increases for males compared to the full-sample results: at rs1967309, the PBS value became 0.096 in males (chromosome 16 empirical p-value = 0.004). On the other hand, for females the value dropped to 0.017 (chromosome 16 empirical p-value = 0.20).

For this genome-wide null distribution of the LRLD matching our SNPs, we generated one set of pairs of SNPs and evaluated LRLD between these random pairs in both LIMAA cohort and PEL from 1000G. Since frequencies in the LIMAA cohort are likely better estimates of allele frequencies in the Peruvian population because of the size of the sample, we started our selection based on SNPs’ characteristic in this cohort: we extracted pairs of biallelic SNPs from chromosome 1–18, (the other chromosomes being too small) with a MAF between 15% and 30%, separated by between 50 and 60 Mb and 61 ± 10 cM based on the PEL genetic map from 1000G. If SNPs in a pair shared coordinates on the genetic map (in cM) with another SNP from another pair, we kept only one of these pairs. We ended up with 3,576 non-overlapping SNP pairs for calculating the LRLD null distribution matching our rs1967309-rs158477 pair obtained from the LIMAA cohort. For analysis in PEL from 1000G, we added an extra frequency filtering step to remove pairs for which one or both SNPs had a MAF below 5 % in PEL, leaving 3513 pairs for analysis for PEL of 1000G. To calculate an empirical p-value in PEL, we evaluated the number of pairs which had a LRLD value larger to the observed value for rs1967309-rs158477 and divided this number by the total number pairs (n = 3513).

In males, the r<sup>2</sup> value between rs1967309 and rs158477 was the highest of the distribution (genome-wide empirical p-value &lt; 2.85 x 10<sup>–4</sup>), but for females, it was in the 20th percentile (genome-wide empirical p-value = 0.80).</p></sec><sec id="s16" sec-type="appendix"><title>Permutation analysis of sex-specific LRLD at the positions rs1967309 and rs158477</title><p>A second null distribution was derived for evaluating if the LRLD difference between sex for the rs1967309-rs158477 pair was significant, given the significant LRLD observed at these loci.

All GTEx data was therefore reprocessed for <italic>ADCY9</italic> and <italic>CETP</italic> by the same pipeline (see below) to obtain transcription levels per sample at the gene level, consistent for the two genes across cohorts.</p><p>For each eQTL dataset (GEUVADIS, GTEx, CARTaGENE), we recalculated the top 5 PCs using genotype data with flashPCA2. For duplicated samples, we kept the sample with the highest read count in the library and removed samples which had a total of less than 10 million of reads. We trimmed the sequencing reads from Illumina adaptors and bad quality ends (BQ &gt;20) using TrimGalore!. We mapped the alignment files on Hg38 human genome reference using STAR v2.6.1a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>) with the Ensembl 87 genome annotation, then estimated count for each gene using RSEM v1.3.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li and Dewey, 2011</xref>). For GTEx, we separated each tissue at this step, then removed tissues with less than 50 samples, leaving samples from 49 different tissues to avoid over-interpretation due to low sample size while maximizing the number of tissues to be tested. We kept the genes which had more than six reads in at least 20 % of the sample. We then normalized expression data using limma (TMM normalization) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Ritchie et al., 2015</xref>) and voom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Law et al., 2014</xref>). We calculated PEER factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Stegle et al., 2012</xref>) on the normalized expressions.

The covariates include the first 5 PCs, age (except for GEUVADIS, information not available), sex, as well as PEER factors, calculated to take into account hidden factors. In GTEx, we added additional covariates: the collection site (SMCENTER), the sequencing platform (SMGEBTCHT) and total ischemic time (TRISCHD). One limitation is there is no standardized way of deciding how many PEER factors to include. We tested the robustness of results to the inclusion of different numbers of PEER factors in the models and we report them all for GEUVADIS, CARTaGENE (CaG) and GTEx for transparency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig7">Appendix 1—figures 7</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig9">9</xref>). The maximum number of PEER factors considered follows recommendation by GTEx based on sample size for each tissue.</p><p>SNP rs1967309 is a <italic>cis</italic> eQTL of <italic>ADCY9</italic> in whole blood in CARTaGENE (p-value = 4.46 × 10<sup>–13</sup>, ß = –0.10, N = 728, 10 PEER factors) with AA individuals having increased <italic>ADCY9</italic> expression compared to GG individuals. This effect is replicated in whole blood samples from GTEx (N = 559), and several other tissues in GTEx (with esophagus being the most significant), but some tissues show an inversion of the direction of the effect, such as lung and thyroid. These results may differ from GTEx reported eQTL results, because of the removal of ADCY9-205 isoform (see above), the different expression normalization method and filters by ethnicity applied here. SNP rs158477 is found as a <italic>cis</italic> eQTL of <italic>CETP</italic> in GEUVADIS (p-value = 1.69 × 10<sup>–4</sup>, ß = 0.26) lymphoblastoid cell lines, replicated in GTEx (EBV transformed lymphocytes) as well as in many other GTEx tissues. Tissues with p-value below 0.05 across most PEER factors values (if not all) are: adipose tissues, hippocampus, liver, lung, small intestine, muscle, stomach, thyroid, with GG genotype having consistently less <italic>CETP</italic> expression than AA.</p><p>We next tested whether the SNPs are <italic>trans</italic> eQTL for the genes. We found nominally significant associations between rs1967309 and <italic>CETP</italic> expression in the ovary (<italic>P</italic>-value = 0.0017, N = 138, max PEER factors = 15) and hippocampus (p-value = 0.049, N = 150, max PEER factors = 30), results that are stable across PEER factors values, two tissues for which rs1967309 is not significantly associated with <italic>ADCY9</italic> expression (<italic>P</italic>-value &gt; 0.05). We found nominally significant associations between rs158477 and <italic>ADCY9</italic> expression in the brain-cerebellar hemisphere and liver.</p><p>We next evaluated the interaction effect between rs1967309 and rs158477 on gene expression levels, despite somewhat low statistical power, especially given the small number of samples by tissue. Because the appropriate value of the number of PEER factors to be included on the model is not obvious, we report all values of PEER until the maximum suggested by GTEx for the GTEx tissues (15 for N &lt; 150, 30 for 150≤ N &lt; 250, 45 for 250≤ N &lt; 350, and 60 for N ≥ 350). We also required that the interaction term rs1967309*rs158477 for a tissue had p-values under 0.1 for a majority of values of the number of PEER factors included, to qualify a result to be suggestive of an interaction effect. In the GEUVADIS dataset, which has 287 samples, the interaction was significant on <italic>CETP</italic> expression and stable across PEER factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig7">Appendix 1—figure 7a</xref>), which could mean that the effect of a SNP could be modulated by the other SNP. To evaluate this effect further and make sure this is not due to outlier effects or other statistical flukes, we stratified by genotypes of each SNP and investigated the effect of the other SNP on <italic>CETP</italic> expression. We used a linear regression with the same covariates mentioned above. We first stratified by the genotype of rs1967309, then evaluated the effect of rs158477 on <italic>CETP</italic> expression. SNP rs158477 is significant in the AA of rs1967309 (p-value = 0.03, ß = 0.45, OR=[1.05–2.36], n = 46) and AG (p-value = 0.009, ß = 0.24, OR=[1.07–1.53], n = 143), but not for GG (p-value = 0.58, ß = 0.07, OR=[0.83–1.40], n = 96) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>), potentially showing a mitigation of the eQTL effect of rs158477 for each alternative allele of rs1967309 on <italic>CETP</italic> expression. We also evaluated the effect of rs1967309 when we stratified by rs158477 on <italic>CETP</italic> expression. SNP rs1967309 is significant only for GG of rs158477 (p-value = 0.05, ß = 0.3, OR=[1.00–1.83], n = 72), and not for GA (p-value = 0.51, ß = −0.06, OR=[0.77–1.14], n = 139) nor AA (p-value = 0.68, ß = −0.07, OR=[0.66–1.30], n = 74). The second dataset that we used was the GTEx, in which we evaluated 49 tissues. Since the effects across tissues are likely not independent, we did not correct for multiple testing, keeping a suggestive threshold at 0.10 and a significant threshold at 0.05, but those values need to be reached for a majority values of the number of PEER factors included to be convincing. Among the 49 tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig8">Appendix 1—figure 8</xref>), those with p-values under 0.10 for several numbers of PEER factors are hippocampus (N = 150), hypothalamus (N = 156), brain spinal cord (cervical c-1) (N = 114), substantia nigra (N = 100) and skin sun-exposed (N = 507). Among those tissues, rs1967309 is only a cis-eQTL of <italic>ADCY9</italic> in the substantia nigra.</p><p>Since the selective pressure differ between sexes, we stratified our expression analysis by sex. For <italic>CETP</italic> expression analysis, there are no consistent signals for GEUVADIS, possibly reflecting lack of power or that there is no sex-specific effect in lymphoblastoid cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig7">Appendix 1—figure 7c</xref>). However, in CaG, the significant interaction found is present only in male (again for the genotypic coding, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig7">Appendix 1—figure 7d</xref>). In GTEx, we see significant interaction effects in males in tissues that had signals with sex-combined, such as brain hippocampus (N<sub>male</sub> = 105), hypothalamus (N<sub>male</sub> = 112) and spinal cord cervical (N<sub>male</sub> = 72), skin sun-exposed for CETP (N<sub>male</sub> = 330) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig9">Appendix 1—figure 9</xref>). We note that for most brain tissues, the low sample size in females does not allow to conclude on the presence of an interaction effect in that sex. In these tissues, the direction of the effect in males is reversed compared to what is observed in GEUVADIS with sexes combined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>), whereas the highly significant result in skin shows an effect consistent with the sex-combined GEUVADIS result (p-value = 0.0017, ß = −0.32). More specifically, in the sun-exposed skin samples, in rs1967309 AA males, copies of the rs158477 A allele increase CETP expression by 0.49 (95% CI 0.12–0.87) on average. In rs1967309 AG males, the effect of rs158477 is null (p-value<sub>AG</sub> = 0.33) and the effect of the rs158477 A allele is suggestive in rs1967309 GG individual (p-value<sub>GG</sub> = 0.10) with a decrease of the CETP expression. Conversely, if we look at the effect of rs1967309 on <italic>CETP</italic> expression in skin sun-exposed when we stratified by rs158477 in males, SNP rs1967309 is neither a significant eQTL of <italic>CETP</italic> in GG of rs158477 in males (p = 0.11, n = 89) nor for GA (p = 0.65, n = 164), but is a significant eQTL for AA males (p = 0.026, ß = −0.46, OR=[-0.87,–0.06], n = 76).</p><p>We also identified new tissues where the interaction is either suggestive or significant in females, in artery tibial (N<sub>female</sub> = 156), heart atrial appendage (N<sub>female</sub> = 97), spleen (N<sub>female</sub> = 69), and stomach (N<sub>female</sub> = 105) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig9">Appendix 1—figure 9</xref>), with an effect reversed compared to the initial GEUVADIS result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig7">Appendix 1—figure 7a</xref>). For the pituitary tissue, it is significant in both sex (additive coding in female and genotypic coding in male, N<sub>male</sub> = 156, N<sub>female</sub> = 63), but the direction of the additive coding is reversed between sexes, possibly explaining why the sex-combined analysis did not show any signal. We note that the newly discovered signals are mainly for females, indicating that the signal was hidden by the male effects (or absence of effects), likely because of higher sample sizes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s19" sec-type="appendix"><title>Experiments</title><sec id="s19-1" sec-type="appendix"><title>Real-time PCR quantification</title><p>Reverse transcription was performed from 500 ng total RNA in a 20 ml reaction using High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems cat #4368814).

This variable is defined as <italic>Heart attack, acute myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome</italic>. GTEx also has phenotypes, including cardiovascular traits. The variable DTHFUCOD (First Underlying Cause Of Death) was used to identify individuals whose cause of death included <italic>Heart Attack/Stroke, Heart Disease, Acute Myocardial Infarction, Possible MI</italic>, who were considered as cases. From the 699 samples kept, we excluded six for which the phenotype was missing or unknown for MHHRTATT variable and for which the cause of death was unrelated to heart disease, yielding a total of 130 cases and 563 controls. We added as covariates: sex, age and top 5 PCs. For this phenotype, neither rs1967309 nor rs158477 are associated with those phenotypes when taken alone. However, the interaction and both SNPs in the equation are significant (p-value ≤ 0.05) or close to be significant (p-value ≤ 0.10) for the phenotype (p-value<sub>MHHRATT</sub> = 0.01, Estimate<sub>MHHRATT</sub> = −0.54) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Like for <italic>CETP</italic> expression, this means that for each G allele for rs1967309, there is a decrease of the effect of rs158477 on cardiovascular outcome. A difference with <italic>CETP</italic>’s expression is that there is an inversion of the direction of effect. In other word, for AA of rs1967309, directions of the effect of rs158477 are positive, with GG having less probability to have an event than AA (Estimate<sub>MHHRATT</sub> = 0.47), but for GG of rs1967309, estimates of rs158477 are negative (Estimate<sub>MHHRATT</sub> = −0.79). Those results are consistent with the direction of dalcetrapib pharmacogenomic analysis. Considering that the GG genotype of rs158477, with less <italic>CETP</italic>’s expression, is a proxy for dalcetrapib, which is an inhibition of CETP, the same gradient is present for rs1967309. In AA of rs1967309, there is less heart disease with dalcetrapib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Tardif et al., 2015</xref>). In GG of rs1967309, there is more heart disease with dalcetrapib. More study of this interaction is needed to understand the mechanism.

Few such interactions have been identified making this a novel finding that motivates more research and methods to look for such effects. The relationship uncovered contributes new insight towards understanding why drug response to a CETP-modulator is affected by genotypes at ADCY9.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A sex-specific evolutionary interaction between ADCY9 and CETP&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and George Perry as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Eduardo Tarazona-Santos (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers identified a number of issues and questions that should be addressed in a revised manuscript. Here is a list of revisions considered essential, many of which come from the individual reviews. The individual reviews are included below, which have both a public review and recommendations for the authors from each reviewer. Please do also respond to all individual reviewers' points and suggestions in your response and revised manuscript.</p><p>1. Please include a figure or flowchart that illustrates the overall experimental design and analyses conducted, and which datasets each were performed with. A clear key for the population datasets with sample sizes and the abbreviations that refer to them would be helpful. Please also carefully define and use consistent terms in how datasets are referred to (e.g., First Nation, LIMAA, NAGD, Andean vs. Peruvian).</p><p>2. Please include a summary table of the male / female sample sizes, LD values and p-values for the datasets where LRLD was analyzed.</p><p>3. Please include the results showing the effect of CETP knockdowns on ADCY9 expression, in addition to the current results showing ADCY9 knockdowns on CETP expression.</p><p>4. Please include an additional analysis that considers the effect of sex on gene expression. Please also clarify which analyses did not consider the effect of sex (and why) and for which it was considered but no effect found.</p><p>5. Please consider the imputation quality across the different datasets, and especially how it differs across populations to address the concern that imputation from non-representative reference panel populations could be problematic.</p><p>6. Please discuss in more detail the proposed interpretation for sex-specific selection. First, the type of selection is not stated in the abstract (only &quot;natural selection&quot;). Second, in the discussion two possibilities are proposed (lines 353-358) but it is not clear if any are supported under the presented evidence. Does the lack of correlation with age rule out a mechanism affecting survival? How strong would selection need to be in a single generation to produce this level of LRLD?</p><p>7. Please improve figure visibility and naming as suggested in the specific recommendations below. Also, where possible indicate on the figures where the annotated genes are located, as is only currently shown in Figure 1B. Use consistent naming, e.g., for populations in Figure 1 and 3 (are 3a and b only PEL although the figure title says 1000G?).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Because the experimental design of the authors is complex, I suggest that they provide a Figure representing and the different steps of the rationales as well as their experiments. It may also help if they number the different steps of the experimental design both in the Figure and the Main Text.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>– the authors should explicitly state which array was used for the genotyping of the LIMAA replication cohort.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>a) I think having a summary figure that goes through and connects the different analyses could potentially be very helpful for the flow of this manuscript. I think the collection of analyses are very impressive, but I find myself continually taking a step back to keep track of the different levels presented. You move from selection analyses, to LD analyses, to gene expression analyses, and finally to phenotype analyses. In addition, at multiple points, there is a further stratification by sex. It may not be immediately intuitive on what a summary figure would be for this, but having something to help readers keep track of how or why these different analyses are connected would be very useful.</p><p>b) In the introduction the authors highlight that one of the open questions to be addressed is: &quot;However, the underlying mechanisms linking CETP and ADCY9, located 50 Mb apart on chromosome 16, as well as the <italic>relevance of the rs1967309 non-coding genetic variant are still unclear</italic>.&quot; However, the authors do not return to this specific point regarding rs1967309 later in the discussion. I think, since the authors do indeed identify and explore some of the relevance of rs1967309, it would benefit the manuscript to reconnect to this point later at the end of the paper.</p><p>c) At the start of the 'sex-specific long-range linkage disequilibrium' section, the authors state the following: &quot;We explored the effect of sex on the LRLD association found between rs1967309 and rs158477. The allele frequencies at rs1967309 were suggestively different between males and females and sex-stratified PBS analyses suggest that the LD block around rs1967309 is differentiated between sexes in the Peruvians…&quot; It is unclear to me if the second sentence is a result of exploring the effect of sex on LRLD associations, or if it is meant to be the justification for exploring the effect of sex. I think clarifying this would be important since it is not otherwise clear why you would move to doing sex-specific analyses, though it does produce an interesting result.</p><p>d) I'm wondering why the data regarding the lack of impact CETP knockdowns have on ADCY9 expression is not shown? I think this is an interesting and important result. It helps demonstrate a directionality to the interaction that continually shows up elsewhere. If possible, showing this data would be helpful.</p><p>e) Now that you have identified some more relevant tissue types and phenotypes from your epistasis analyses, I am wondering if there are any links that can be made back to your mouse knockouts or any other ADCY9 or CETP knockouts? It seems like with a new spectrum of traits to consider, previous knockout results may make more sense now. Are there any OMIM conditions that now may have some connection to these results?</p><p>f) In regards to the CAD outcome findings, I am wondering if you could make use of some of the CAD polygenic risk scores that exist now to further show a link. Specifically, I am wondering whether you could stratify individuals into high and low risk for CAD, and see whether the protective genotype combinations are overrepresented among the low risk individuals vs. high risk (and between the sexes as well). Some example CAD PRSs can be found in the PGS Catalogue: https://www.pgscatalog.org/trait/EFO_0001645/</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have a few comments and questions below on the approach and results.</p><p>1. Population/cohort specific effects. Is there any known ascertainment bias of the cohorts? Skimming the source papers, it looks like for one cohort, they all presented to a clinic for tuberculosis? I'm not sure if I missed it – but is the sex-effect replicated in the UK biobank data? And the linkage missing or apparent in the UK biobank data? One result that is glossed over (again apologies if I missed it in the supplement), but the effect looks reversed/stronger in females in the Andean population (sup Figure 4 d/f)? Is this true or just not significant/too noisy? Also, if this is testable with the other datasets available (since it is a much larger cohort), they could be used as negative controls of sorts. Ie the UK biobank and/or the other native cohorts.</p><p>2. Speculation/comments on why there would be a male/female difference in these population (or any). This circles back to the UK biobank question I had earlier. Are frequencies linked to Mt or Y chromosome haplotypes? Is there a way to measure or view this? I understand the RFMix analysis was meant to test for admixture, but would it also show something like this? As it is hard to say definitively or exclude all potential counterfactuals for these results, without including additional datasets from the same region, along with geographic and historical accounts. I wouldn't want to speculate on this of course, but perhaps characterizing the samples a little further in the supplement might help (like a table of sorts, with totals, split by male/female, and any other known demographics). I found it a little difficult to follow all the different populations tested; and which is the &quot;discovery&quot; and which is the &quot;replication&quot; cohort. There are also some discrepancies in the numbers in the text, supplement and captions.</p><p>PEL (1000G) LIMAA (?) Andean (NAGD) UK Biobank?</p><p>Males 41 2076 ? 2078 54 ?</p><p>Females 44 1433 ? 1434 34 ?</p><p>Total 85 3509 ? 88 413083</p><p>3. Data quality and artefacts. Although this is probably unlikely (but a potential concern/caveat) – wouldn't imputing data from non-represented reference genomes lead to false positives or incorrect phasing? Just curious if there was any check using a different reference panel? I understand this might be out of the scope of this particular analysis to delve into more details about it, but maybe as a sanity check? I'm coming to this from looking through this paper that evaluated potential influences/causes for LRLD:</p><p>https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0080754</p><p>4. Sex-biased gene expression and eQTLs. Was there any sex-biased expression in the assessed data? Noted sample sizes are still limited here, so I agree this might not be powered. But for some tissues, if you repeat the PEER analysis not only by tissue, but by sex? Correct me if I am wrong, but including sex as a covariate would regress out the sex effects? I'd be interested in seeing the split analysis, if there was a modulating effect that was also sex specific.</p><p>Is the expectation that ADCY9 and CETP are negatively correlated with a particular genotype but only in males? Or is there no expectation for sex-specific functional differences too (ie it is either genetic or phenotypic/functional). One way to check could be to look to see if these genes correlated in the GTEx/GEUVADIS/CARTaGENE data.</p><p>5. Epistatic/phenotypic data associations. The difference in genotype and MI association is a very interesting effect, but because the data is from a different population, I believe the message/point is kind of lost in the narrative. What are the distributions of the genotypes in the UK biobank? And how do these differ by sex? And what are the distributions of the two genotype combinations? Furthermore, a lot of these traits are correlated, I'm curious to see what those correlations are for these selected traits? Those that aren't associated with the traits but are associated when split by genotype, is that also a numbers effect? I'm not sure I caught that in the tests.</p><p>Figure suggestions/comments:</p><p>Figure 1 and consistency with labels/IDs. Would it be possible to show the LIMAA cohort here? It is not the &quot;First nation&quot; set -which I believe is the NAGD? The AND subpopulation (Andean) is the one carried on in the analyses, correct? It would be good to highlight these/specify in the caption and/or the figure. Is there a way to also show these frequencies by sex in those subpopulations you later work with? Ie for PEL, AND and LIMAA?</p><p>In Figure 1b – Is the recombination rate the lines? Would it be possible to only plot the AMR? It is hard to see/interpret the results here. The others could be in a supplementary Figure</p><p>In Figure 1 c – the PBS is also hard to see clearly here. One option would be to smooth the lines out or again, only show the PEL population.</p><p>The sex specific results are also super interesting (sup Figure 3 b/d) -&gt; I think moving these also to this main figure shows a clearer point on sex effects.</p><p>iHS and recombination rates. I'm not very aware of this measure, but I was curious as to whether the other SNPs that have highly significant iHS values are of relevance, and what the interpretation would be here? Ie the one near the start of the gene seems to have the highest iHS value for the AMR pop. Is that also in high LD with the main SNP of interest in the ADCY9 gene?</p><p>Figure 2:Figure 2c, also show the LIMAA cohort as suggested for figure 1?</p><p>Figure 4: Could you repeat panel b with the GTEx data at all in the well-powered tissues?</p><p>Figure 5:Points in panel a are a little small, perhaps increasing the point size as in panel b/c?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69198.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers identified a number of issues and questions that should be addressed in a revised manuscript.

Please include an additional analysis that considers the effect of sex on gene expression. Please also clarify which analyses did not consider the effect of sex (and why) and for which it was considered but no effect found.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very important point that we carefully considered in this new version of the manuscript. Initially, we performed a preliminary sex-stratified analysis in our RNAseq discovery cohort (GEUVADIS) which was not very conclusive likely due to low sample size. We did not pursue this in our replication cohorts (GTEx and CaG). Thanks to this request and comment R3.4, we calculated PEER factors by stratifying the datasets by sex (sPEER factors) and performed further analyses in GTEx and CaG that produced very interesting new results, in line with the sex-specific nature of our other results, that we are happy to report.</p><p>We see differences between sex in these datasets. In summary, most sex-combined results were driven by males (including the CaG result) but stratifying by sex in GTEx samples revealed additional tissues in which females only show a significant interaction, and very intriguingly, the sign of the interaction effect is reversed in this case. We tested for a three-way interaction in tissues harboring a convincing sex-specific pattern in stratified analyses. We note that some tissues in GTEx did not have enough samples in one sex (&lt;50 samples), so we did not include them in the sex-stratified analyses. This number was selected to maximize the number of tissues for which we tested the interaction while having high chances to have samples in all genotype combinations. Also, with this N, there are still some tissues where the rarest combinations in Europeans (AA-GG or AA-GA) are missing, so going below is not informative. If the reviewers/editors think that a higher threshold would be better, we can always remove the plots for some of the tissues.

We observed that the interaction effect on CETP expression in CaG whole blood samples (N<sub>male</sub>=359) is restricted to male individuals, and, despite low power due to smaller sample size in GEUVADIS, the interaction is also only suggestive in males (Appendix 1-figure 7c,d). In GTEx, most well-powered tissues that showed a significant effect in the sex-combined analyses also harbor male-specific interactions (Appendix 1-figure 9). For instance, GTEx skin male samples (N<sub>male</sub>=330) show the most significant male-specific interaction effects, with the directions of effects replicating the sex-combined result in GEUVADIS (an increase of CETP expression for each rs158477 A allele in rs1967309 AA individuals) albeit with an observable reversal of the direction in rs1967309 GG individuals (decrease of CETP expression with additional rs158477 A alleles) (Figure 5c, Figure 5—figure supplement 2a). However, significant effects in females are detected in tissues not previously seen as significant for the interaction in the sex-combined analysis, in the tibial artery (Figure 5d, Figure 5—figure supplement 2) and the heart atrial appendage (Appendix 1-figure 9). For tissues with evidence of sex-specific effects in stratified analyses, we also tested the effect of an interaction between sex, rs158477 and rs1967309 (Methods) on CETP expression: the three-way interaction is only significant for tibial artery (Figure 5—figure supplement 2).”</p><p>“The significant interaction effects on CETP expression vary between sexes in amplitude and direction, with most signals driven by male samples, but significant interaction effects observed in females only, despite sample sizes being consistently lower than for males. Notably, in the tibial artery and heart atrial appendage, two tissues directly relevant to the cardiovascular system, the female-specific interaction effect on CETP expression is reversed between rs1967309 genotypes AA and GG, compared to the effects seen in males in skin and brain tissues. Given our ADCY9-KD were done in liver cell lines from male donors, future work to fully understand how rs1967309 and rs158477 interact will focus on additional experiments in cells from both male and female donors in these relevant tissues.”</p><p>“The female-specific eQTL interaction results in arteries and heart tissues further suggest a link with the cardiovascular system, and the phenotype association results support further this hypothesis.”</p><p>– We added in Methods:</p><p>“To take into account hidden factors, we calculated PEER factors (75) on the normalized expressions, on all samples and stratified by sex (sPEER factors). To detect eQTL effects, we performed a two-sided linear regression on ADCY9 and CETP expressions using R (v.3.6.0) (https://www.r-project.org/) with the formula lm(p ∼rs1967309*rs158477+Covariates) for evaluating the interaction effect, lm(p ∼rs1967309+rs158477+Covariates) for the main effect of the SNPs and lm(p ∼rs1967309*rs158477*sex+Covariates) for evaluating the three-way interaction effect.”</p><p>“Reported values in the text are for five PEER factors in GEUVADIS, ten PEER factors in CARTaGENE, 25 sPEER for skin sun exposed in male and 10 sPEER for artery tibial in female in GTEx.”</p><p>We also added several paragraphs in the Appendix 1 in the sections of “ADCY9 and CETP expression quantification from RNAseq data” and “Expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL) analysis for rs1967309 and rs158477”:</p><p>Appendix 1: “For all sex-stratified analysis, we kept sex-stratified tissues that had at least 50 samples, and recomputed PEER factors with samples from only one sex (which we term sPEER factors).”</p><p>Appendix 1: “Since the selective pressure differ between sexes, we stratified our expression analysis by sex. For CETP expression analysis, there are no consistent signals for GEUVADIS, possibly reflecting lack of power or that there is no sex-specific effect in lymphoblastoid cell lines (Appendix 1-figure 7c). However, in CaG, the significant interaction found is present only in male (again for the genotypic coding, Appendix 1-figure 7d). In GTEx, we see significant interaction effects in males in tissues that had signals with sex-combined, such as brain hippocampus (Nmale=105), hypothalamus (Nmale=112) and spinal cord cervical (Nmale=72), skin sun-exposed for CETP (Nmale=330) (Figure 5d, Appendix 1-figure 9). We note that for most brain tissues, the low sample size in females does not allow to conclude on the presence of an interaction effect in that sex. In these tissues, the direction of the effect in males is reversed compared to what is observed in GEUVADIS with sexes combined (Figure 5b), whereas the highly significant result in skin shows an effect consistent with the sex-combined GEUVADIS result (p-value=0.0017, ß=-0.32). More specifically, in the sun-exposed skin samples, in rs1967309 AA males, copies of the rs158477 A allele increase CETP expression by 0.49 (95% CI 0.12-0.87) on average. In rs1967309 AG males, the effect of rs158477 is null (p-valueAG=0.33) and the effect of the rs158477 A allele is suggestive in rs1967309 GG individual (p-valueGG=0.10) with a decrease of the CETP expression. Conversely, if we look at the effect of rs1967309 on CETP expression in skin sun-exposed when we stratified by rs158477 in males, SNP rs1967309 is neither a significant eQTL of CETP in GG of rs158477 in males (p=0.11, n=89) nor for GA (p=0.65, n=164), but is a significant eQTL for AA males (p=0.026, ß=-0.46, OR=[-0.87, -0.06], n=76). We also identified new tissues where the interaction is either suggestive or significant in females, in artery tibial (Nfemale=156), heart atrial appendage (Nfemale=97), spleen (Nfemale=69) and stomach (Nfemale=105) (Appendix 1-figure 9), with an effect reversed compared to the initial GEUVADIS result (Appendix 1-figure 7a). For the pituitary tissue, it is significant in both sex (additive coding in female and genotypic coding in male, Nmale=156, Nfemale=63), but the direction of the additive coding is reversed between sexes, possibly explaining why the sex-combined analysis did not show any signal. We note that the newly discovered signals are mainly for females, indicating that the signal was hidden by the male effects (or absence of effects), likely because of higher sample sizes.”</p><p>As shown in our new Figure 1, most analyses consider the effect of sex (green boxes), except:</p><p>– iHS, this statistic is powerful to detect hard selective sweeps and is not designed to detect sex-specific selection (which will likely look like an incomplete soft sweep) and did not show significant results in the PEL cohort.</p><p>– RFMix inference analyses of local ancestry did not consider males and females separately, it would only result in loss of precision if we split the reference panel in this way. However, we did check whether there are significant differences between males and females in global ancestry and did not find significant results. This was reported in Results.</p><p>– KD/over-expression experiments, which were done in HepG2 cells from a male donor. We have added this information in the Methods and discussed future steps in cell lines from male and female donors in the Discussion.</p><p>“The human liver hepatocellular HepG2 cell line was obtained from ATCC, a cell line derived from the liver tissue of a 15-year-old male donor”</p><p>“Given our ADCY9-KD were done in liver cell lines from male donors, future work to fully understand how rs1967309 and rs158477 interact will focus on additional experiments in cells from both male and female donors in these relevant tissues.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Please consider the imputation quality across the different datasets, and especially how it differs across populations to address the concern that imputation from non-representative reference panel populations could be problematic.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, we had reported that the INFO score for our two SNPs imputed in LIMAA and NAGD with the Haplotype Reference Consortium (HRC) was lower than our 0.8 initial threshold in Appendix, section “Pre-processing of the LIMAA cohort”. This can be expected in an admixed population, when the reference panel does not include a close enough population, and even more for differentiated SNPs as it is the case here, for which the allele frequencies would be misaligned with the reference panel frequencies. Therefore, our approach was to lower the threshold to 0.7 (which is still considered a high score in most studies).</p><p>However, based on this comment and comment R3.3, we performed additional analyses to make sure that the lower INFO score was due to low confidence because of the factors described above, and not to incorrect imputed genotypes. We thus redid the imputation of LIMAA and NAGD with the TOPMED reference panel. For our two SNPs, rs1967309 and rs158477, the r<sup>2</sup> score for imputation with TOPMED is now higher (r<sup>2</sup>&gt;0.9 for both), meaning that a more diversified reference panel helped the imputation of this admixed population. Furthermore, when we look at the allele frequencies and genotypes, they are highly similar (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="sa2table2">Author response table 2</xref>, only 5% and 2% of individual allele mismatches in LIMAA for rs1967309 and rs158477, respectively).

Please discuss in more detail the proposed interpretation for sex-specific selection. First, the type of selection is not stated in the abstract (only &quot;natural selection&quot;). Second, in the discussion two possibilities are proposed (lines 353-358) but it is not clear if any are supported under the presented evidence. Does the lack of correlation with age rule out a mechanism affecting survival? How strong would selection need to be in a single generation to produce this level of LRLD?</p></disp-quote><p>We are delighted that the editors and reviewers agree with us about the importance of the sex-specific result we present here. We preferred to be cautious in our first version in our interpretation of this result, in order not to oversell it. But in the light of the newest gene expression results presented in favor of the sex-specific effects, and given the positive feedback received, we are now more comfortable on expanding on this aspect.</p><p>We agree that our interpretation of the age-dependant result in the discussion was not clear, as the analysis conducted indeed does not really allowed us to conclude: we did this analysis with what we had at hand in LIMAA, and if we had seen an age-dependent effect, it would have been support for the differential survival hypothesis, but in the case of a non-significant result, it does not necessarily exclude this possibility. Indeed, we may be underpower to detect an age-effect, or simply not looking at the appropriate timeframe, and a pediatric cohort may be needed. To test the in-utero hypothesis, a cohort of Peruvian newborns would allow to evaluate if the genotype correlation is already present at birth, or a cohort of stillborn babies would allow to evaluate if a genotype combination is more frequent in those. We now expanded in the text on how this question could be further resolved in the future.</p><p>Finally, we thought a lot about the important question of how strong selection would need to be in a single generation to produce this level of LRLD. Because this is, to the best of our knowledge, the first instance reported of such a phenomenon, there is no theoretical ground on which to base a formal answer to this question and we would need to perform a carefully designed simulation study to answer this question. This is beyond the scope of the present work, but it is an exciting avenue of research. In our opinion however, selection probably needs to be quite strong in order to produce this effect and, despite searching for outstanding causes for infant/children mortality in Peru and looking at male/female ratio statistics for children born in Peru, we did not find any hints on what could be happening. On the other hand, in utero and sperm-specific selection are thought to result from stronger selection, which makes us think that this is the most likely explanation. But why would it differentially impact boys and girls in this case (sex hormones?), and why specifically in Peru (pregnancy in altitude?), remain mysteries.</p><p>The changes made in the text are as follow:</p><p>– In the abstract:</p><p>“rs1967309 region exhibits signatures of positive selection in several human populations”</p><p>“We propose that ADCY9 and CETP coevolved during recent human evolution due to sex-specific selection.”</p><p>– In the discussion:</p><p>“Such two-gene selection signature, where only males show strong LRLD, can happen if a specific genotype combination is beneficial in creating males (through differential gamete fitness or in utero survival, for example) or if survival during adulthood is favored with a specific genotype combination compared to other genotypes. In the case of age-dependent differential survival, the genotypic association is expected to be weaker at younger ages, however the LRLD signal between rs1967309 and rs158477 in the LIMAA cohort did not depend on age neither in males nor in females (Appendix 1). Since very few individuals were younger than 20 years old, it is likely that the age range in this cohort is not appropriate to distinguish between the two possibilities. This age-dependent survival therefore remains to be tested in comparison with pediatric cohorts of Peruvians: if the LRLD signal is absent in newborns for example, it will suggest a strong selective pressure acts early in life on boys. To specifically test the in-utero hypothesis, a cohort of stillborn babies with genetic information could allow to evaluate if the genotype combination is more frequent in these. Lastly, it may be that the evolutionary pressure is linked to the sex chromosomes (69,70), and a three-way interaction between ADCY9, CETP and Y chromosome haplotypes or mitochondrial haplogroups remains to be explored.”</p><p>“Furthermore, not much is known about the strength of this type of selection, and simulations would help evaluate how strong selection would need to be in a single generation to produce this level of LRLD.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.

This is also in response to essential comment E.1 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) In the introduction the authors highlight that one of the open questions to be addressed is: &quot;However, the underlying mechanisms linking CETP and ADCY9, located 50 Mb apart on chromosome 16, as well as the relevance of the rs1967309 non-coding genetic variant are still unclear.&quot; However, the authors do not return to this specific point regarding rs1967309 later in the discussion. I think, since the authors do indeed identify and explore some of the relevance of rs1967309, it would benefit the manuscript to reconnect to this point later at the end of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. Despite our study demonstrating that rs1967309 is likely involved in a functional mechanism related to <italic>CETP</italic> expression, and that this mechanism implicates sex as a modulator, the exact mechanism remains unknown. Therefore, we avoided to speculate too much in our first version of the manuscript, but we agree with the reviewer that we should return to this point to wrap up the article. We have now added a paragraph that goes back to the initial discovery of rs1967309 and discusses what our results bring to this important ongoing research.</p><p>In Discussion:</p><p>“Despite these limitations, our results support a functional role for the intronic SNP rs1967309, likely involved in a molecular mechanism related to CETP expression, but this mechanism seems to implicate sex as a modulator in a tissue-specific way, which complicates greatly its understanding. In the dal-OUTCOMES clinical trial, the partial inhibitor of CETP, dalcetrapib, did not decrease the risk of cardiovascular outcomes in the overall population, but rs1967309 in the ADCY9 gene was associated to the response to the drug, which benefitted AA individuals (4). Interestingly, rs1967309 AA is found in both the male and female beneficial combinations of genotypes for CAD, the same that are enriched in Peruvians, but without taking rs158477 and sex into account, this association was masked. The modulation of CETP expression by rs1967309 could impact CETP’s functions that are essential for successfully reducing cardiovascular events. The rs158477 locus could be a key player for these functions, and dalcetrapib may be mimicking its impact, hence explaining the pharmacogenomics association. Furthermore, in the light of our results, some of these effects could differ between men and women (73), which may need to be taken into consideration in the future precision medicine interventions potentially implemented for dalcetrapib.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) At the start of the 'sex-specific long-range linkage disequilibrium' section, the authors state the following: &quot;We explored the effect of sex on the LRLD association found between rs1967309 and rs158477. The allele frequencies at rs1967309 were suggestively different between males and females and sex-stratified PBS analyses suggest that the LD block around rs1967309 is differentiated between sexes in the Peruvians…&quot; It is unclear to me if the second sentence is a result of exploring the effect of sex on LRLD associations, or if it is meant to be the justification for exploring the effect of sex. I think clarifying this would be important since it is not otherwise clear why you would move to doing sex-specific analyses, though it does produce an interesting result.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for asking to clarify this aspect, we now see how exploring the effect of sex was not well motivated in the text. Yes, the reviewer is right that the reason why we did these analyses was because we observed suggestive differences in allele frequencies at rs1967309 in Peru. We had computed F<sub>ST</sub> between males and females, which was high in the rs1967309 region compared to the rest of the gene (it was in the top 1% of values for PEL, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>, but not genome-wide significant after accounting for allele frequency, p=0.11), but the sex-stratified PBS result was striking: the differentiation signal completely disappeared in females. This is what motivated the LRLD sex-stratified analyses that followed. We have now clarified this in the text.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Weir and Cockerham F<sub>ST</sub> between males and females in PEL.</title><p>Horizontal line represents the 99th percentile value for this population (for chromosome 16).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-69198-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>In “Sex-specific long-range linkage disequilibrium signal” section in Results:</p><p>“Because the allele frequencies at rs1967309 were suggestively different between males and females (Figure 4—figure supplement 1), we performed sex-stratified PBS analyses, which suggested that the LD block around rs1967309 is differentiated between sexes in the Peruvians (Figure 4—figure supplement 2, Appendix 1). We therefore explored further the effect of sex on the LRLD association found between rs1967309 and rs158477 and performed sex-stratified LRLD analyses.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) I'm wondering why the data regarding the lack of impact CETP knockdowns have on ADCY9 expression is not shown? I think this is an interesting and important result. It helps demonstrate a directionality to the interaction that continually shows up elsewhere. If possible, showing this data would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right that this is an important result that led us to the hypothesis of modulation of <italic>CETP</italic> expression through ADCY9 SNP. Our initial knockdowns (KD) experiments included only one replicate, and in that first step, significant results were only detected for ADCY9 KD, which led us to validate this result further (by adding N=5 replicates, performing western blot, and ultimately RNAseq). In the CETP-KD, we did not see any significant ADCY9 expression changes, but as we did not pursue the negative results further, we initially chose not to include a figure with N=1, hence the “data not shown” mention.</p><p>We have now increased the number of replicates to N=4 for CETP-KD and to N=4 for CETP overexpression, to report these results more appropriately. The results remain unchanged, the differences in <italic>ADCY9</italic> expression between CETP-KD/overexpressed and controls are still not significant and are now reported in Figure 5—figure supplement 1. We also repeated with N=4 an experiment for ADCY9 overexpression, which is also not significant (Figure 5—figure supplement 1). We modified the text accordingly, as reported in essential comment E.3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e) Now that you have identified some more relevant tissue types and phenotypes from your epistasis analyses, I am wondering if there are any links that can be made back to your mouse knockouts or any other ADCY9 or CETP knockouts? It seems like with a new spectrum of traits to consider, previous knockout results may make more sense now. Are there any OMIM conditions that now may have some connection to these results?</p></disp-quote><p>Among tissues showing an interaction between <italic>ADCY9</italic> and <italic>CETP</italic> genes, there is the hypothalamus which regulates the central nervous system, including respiratory and pulse rates. In the mice experiment in Rautureau et al., 2018, we previously saw a modulation of both these phenotypes, suggesting a role of both genes in regulation of the autonomic nervous system, which we will prioritize in future work. We did not find any condition in OMIM linked to tissues where the interaction is present for CETP expression. The only condition linked with CETP is the hypercholesterolemia (mainly HDL), which can be associated with cardiovascular disease, but, in our phenotype association, the interaction is not significant for HDL (Figure 6).</p><p>– We added a few sentence in the discussion to link with our previous mice KD:</p><p>“In a previous study, we showed that inhibition of both Adcy9 and CETP impacted many phenotypes linked to the ANS in male mice (6), but in the light of our results, these experiments should be repeated in female mice. The function of ANS is important in a number of pathophysiological states involving the cardiovascular system, like myocardial ischemia and cardiac arrhythmias, with significant sex differences reported (62-64).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>f) In regards to the CAD outcome findings, I am wondering if you could make use of some of the CAD polygenic risk scores that exist now to further show a link. Specifically, I am wondering whether you could stratify individuals into high and low risk for CAD, and see whether the protective genotype combinations are overrepresented among the low risk individuals vs. high risk (and between the sexes as well). Some example CAD PRSs can be found in the PGS Catalogue: https://www.pgscatalog.org/trait/EFO_0001645/</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for sharing this idea, this is a very interesting comment that we will consider in our follow-up work. We however feel this is beyond the scope of the present paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I have a few comments and questions below on the approach and results.</p><p>1. Population/cohort specific effects. Is there any known ascertainment bias of the cohorts? Skimming the source papers, it looks like for one cohort, they all presented to a clinic for tuberculosis?</p></disp-quote><p>The LIMAA cohort is indeed from a tuberculosis study but includes many individuals who did not have tuberculosis. To make sure there was no ascertainment bias in terms of genetic ancestry, we performed PCA and UMAP analyses as QC and saw no separation according to disease state. If there was signal for genetic predisposition to tuberculosis here, this would affect a restricted number of loci, and as there’s no evidence that our loci contribute to tuberculosis, we do not think this is a problem.</p><p>We added the following text to supplementary text, section “Comparison between Peruvian cohorts”</p><p>– Appendix 1: “Also, the LIMAA cohort is initially from a tuberculosis study (32), but our PCA and UMAP analysis showed no separation according to disease state.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I'm not sure if I missed it – but is the sex-effect replicated in the UK biobank data? And the linkage missing or apparent in the UK biobank data? One result that is glossed over (again apologies if I missed it in the supplement), but the effect looks reversed/stronger in females in the Andean population (sup Figure 4 d/f)? Is this true or just not significant/too noisy? Also, if this is testable with the other datasets available (since it is a much larger cohort), they could be used as negative controls of sorts. Ie the UK biobank and/or the other native cohorts.</p></disp-quote><p>We did test the LRLD in the UKB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>), but no significant signal was seen, similarly to the GBR population (or any European population) in the 1000G. The AA genotype frequency at rs1967309 is in line with GBR in UKB White British participants (see details in response to R3.5). We added an Appendix – table 1 containing the r<sup>2</sup> values and their p-values mentioned in the main text, and we also added a few other populations from 1000G and NAGD as negative controls.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>LRLD of rs1967309 with CETP gene and rs158477 in ADCY9 gene in UKB for SNPs with a MAF&gt;5%.</title><p>The horizontal line is the 99<sup>th</sup> percentile of all pairs of SNPs between ADCY9 and CETP genes.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-69198-sa2-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Speculation/comments on why there would be a male/female difference in these population (or any). This circles back to the UK biobank question I had earlier. Are frequencies linked to Mt or Y chromosome haplotypes? Is there a way to measure or view this? I understand the RFMix analysis was meant to test for admixture, but would it also show something like this?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the reviewer is right that Y chromosome and Mt haplotypes are potentially at play here, and this would be presumably testable in the LIMAA cohort, but it is beyond the scope of the present study to evaluate this. It is however something we plan to investigate in follow-up analyses and we added a mention to the discussion:</p><p>“Lastly, it may be that the evolutionary pressure is linked to the sex chromosomes (69,70), and a three-way interaction between ADCY9, CETP and Y chromosome haplotypes or mitochondrial haplogroups remains to be explored.”</p><p>As for the male/female differences, we now discuss in more detail the proposed interpretation for sex-specific selection in this new version (see response to essential comment E.6). About the sex-effects on UKB phenotypes, we prefer not to speculate in the manuscript since more investigation is needed, but cardiovascular disease is known to be sexually dimorphic, and some of these differences are driven by genetics and interaction with sex hormones, so this constitute a possible hypothesis to be tested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As it is hard to say definitively or exclude all potential counterfactuals for these results, without including additional datasets from the same region, along with geographic and historical accounts. I wouldn't want to speculate on this of course, but perhaps characterizing the samples a little further in the supplement might help (like a table of sorts, with totals, split by male/female, and any other known demographics). I found it a little difficult to follow all the different populations tested; and which is the &quot;discovery&quot; and which is the &quot;replication&quot; cohort.

Although this is probably unlikely (but a potential concern/caveat) – wouldn't imputing data from non-represented reference genomes lead to false positives or incorrect phasing? Just curious if there was any check using a different reference panel? I understand this might be out of the scope of this particular analysis to delve into more details about it, but maybe as a sanity check? I'm coming to this from looking through this paper that evaluated potential influences/causes for LRLD:</p></disp-quote><p>https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0080754</p><p>Indeed, we had reported that the INFO score for our two SNPs imputed in LIMAA and NAGD with the Haplotype Reference Consortium (HRC) was lower than our 0.8 initial threshold in Appendix, section “Pre-processing of the LIMAA cohort”. Based on this comment and essential comment E.5, we performed additional analyses to make sure that the lower INFO score was due to low confidence because of the factors described above, and not to incorrect imputed genotypes. We thus redid the imputation of LIMAA and NAGD with the TOPMED reference panel and we recomputed the genotype correlation (LRLD) with these new data in LIMAA, and the value obtained is r<sup>2</sup> = 0.0047 (<italic>vs</italic>. 0.0046 before). Given these very tiny difference, and the time it would require redoing all figures and null distributions with the new imputed data, we decided not to change our analyses in the manuscript and keep imputation with HRC, while adding these considerations to Appendix 1 in the section “Pre-processing of the LIMAA cohort” and “Genotype association between rs1967309 and rs158477 in LIMAA”.</p><p>See response to essential comment E.5 above for details on changes made.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Sex-biased gene expression and eQTLs. Was there any sex-biased expression in the assessed data? Noted sample sizes are still limited here, so I agree this might not be powered. But for some tissues, if you repeat the PEER analysis not only by tissue, but by sex? Correct me if I am wrong, but including sex as a covariate would regress out the sex effects? I'd be interested in seeing the split analysis, if there was a modulating effect that was also sex specific.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment, as this resulted in the most significant addition to the new version of the manuscript. Initially, we performed a preliminary sex-stratified analysis in our RNAseq discovery cohort (GEUVADIS) which were not very conclusive due to low sample size and did not pursue this in other cohorts (GTEx and CaG). But thanks to this comment, we calculated PEER factors by stratifying the datasets by sex (sPEER factors) as suggested and we performed further analyses in GTEx and CaG that produced very interesting new results, in line with the sex-specific nature of our other results, that we are happy to report.</p><p>See response to essential comment E.4 above for summary of results and details on changes made.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is the expectation that ADCY9 and CETP are negatively correlated with a particular genotype but only in males?
