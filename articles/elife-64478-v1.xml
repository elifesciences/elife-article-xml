To illustrate one approach, an arabinan-containing polysaccharide was isolated from pea fiber, its structure defined, and forward genetic and proteomic analyses used to compare its effects, versus unfractionated pea fiber and sugar beet arabinan, on a human gut bacterial strain consortium in gnotobiotic mice. We produced ‘Microbiota Functional Activity Biosensors’ (MFABs) consisting of glycans covalently linked to the surface of fluorescent paramagnetic microscopic glass beads. Three MFABs, each containing a unique glycan/fluorophore combination, were simultaneously orally gavaged into gnotobiotic mice, recovered from their intestines, and analyzed to directly quantify bacterial metabolism of structurally distinct arabinans in different human diet contexts. Colocalizing pea-fiber arabinan and another polysaccharide (glucomannan) on the bead surface enhanced in vivo degradation of glucomannan. MFABs represent a potentially versatile platform for developing new prebiotics and more nutritious foods.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Tens of trillions of microbes living in the gut help humans and other animals digest their food. In the process, the microbes provide necessary nutrients for themselves and the animal. Learning more about the interaction of food components and gut bacteria could help scientists to better understand how different diets affect human health. Currently, studying these complex interactions is challenging, but new technologies that measure microbial nutrient processing in the gut could help.</p><p>Now, Wesener et al. show that swallowable microscopic biosensors can measure how gut bacteria break down nutrients from food. To make the biosensors, Wesener et al. attached complex carbohydrates extracted from peas and fluorescent tags to microscopic beads. In the experiments, mice colonized with human gut microbes were fed the beads along with a traditional low fiber, Western diet. Some of the animals also received fiber supplements.</p><p>The microscopic beads were then recovered from the intestines after digestion and the remaining carbohydrates on the beads were measured. The genetic makeup of the gut microbiome and the expression of microbial genes was also examined. The experiments revealed which pea carbohydrates the gut microbes consumed and showed that pairing certain carbohydrates together on the microbead surface increased their digestion in mice that received fiber supplements.</p><p>If future studies prove that the microbead biosensors created by Wesener et al. are safe for humans to ingest, they could be used to help diagnose how well a person’s gut microbiota can process different foods. Studies using the microbead sensors may also help scientists develop more nutritious foods or supplements that promote the growth of microbes important for health.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>human gut microbiome</kwd><kwd>polysaccharide structure</kwd><kwd>utilization</kwd><kwd>bead-based metabolic biosensors</kwd><kwd>bioconjugate chemistry</kwd><kwd>prebiotic discovery</kwd><kwd>food science</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK70977</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gordon</surname><given-names>Jeffrey I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK078669</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gordon</surname><given-names>Jeffrey I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001021</institution-id><institution>Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DRG-2303-17</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wesener</surname><given-names>Darryl A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F30 DK123838</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Beller</surname><given-names>Zachary W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004322</institution-id><institution>Agilent Technologies</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Thought Leader Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gordon</surname><given-names>Jeffrey I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A method has been developed to characterize the expressed biochemical activities of gut microbial communities using retrievable, microscopic, fluorescent-labeled glass beads containing chemically bound surface biomolecules.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Increasing effort is being directed to determining how components of diets consumed by various human populations impact the composition and expressed functional features of their gut microbial communities (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Johnson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ghosh et al., 2020</xref>). A hoped-for benefit is to gain new insights about how food ingredients and their biotransformation by the microbiota are linked to various aspects of human physiology, and new ways to both define and improve nutritional status. However, there are many formidable challenges. The gut microbiota is complex and dynamic and exhibits considerable intra- and interpersonal variation in its configurations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lloyd-Price et al., 2017</xref>). The chemical compositions of food staples are being cataloged at ever-deepening levels of detail using higher throughput analytical methods, such as mass spectrometry. Even as this knowledge is being acquired, how food components are recognized by members of the microbiota, and the pathways through which these chemical entities are metabolized by community members to influence their functions and those of the host remain challenging to define. Furthermore, much needs to be learned about the effects of current methods of food processing on the representation of bioactive food components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carmody et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wolf et al., 2019</xref>), and about the mechanisms that determine whether and how microbes compete and/or cooperate for them.</p><p>Plant fibers epitomize these challenges. Plant fibers are complex mixtures of biomolecules whose composition varies depending upon their source, method of initial recovery, and the food processing techniques used to incorporate them into food products that have satisfactory organoleptic properties (texture, taste, smell) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shahidi and Ho, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Caffall and Mohnen, 2009</xref>). Plant fibers are composed of but not limited to polysaccharides, proteins, fatty acids, polyphenols, and other plant-derived small molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nicholson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Scalbert et al., 2014</xref>). Isolating and/or purifying component polysaccharides from crude plant fiber mixtures for studies of the mechanisms by which they influence members of the microbiota can be very challenging; even if separation is achieved, painstaking analysis is required to define their structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pettolino et al., 2012</xref>). Nonetheless, knowledge of the genetic underpinnings of how various members of the gut microbiota recognize and metabolize glycans has increased substantially in recent years through a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brown and Koropatkin, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kaoutari et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ndeh and Gilbert, 2018</xref>). Knowing that a given microbiota member has a suitable complement of genes for acquiring and processing a given glycan structure in vitro does not necessarily predict whether that organism will be a consumer in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Flint et al., 2015</xref>). For example, an individual’s microbiota may harbor a number of organisms with the capacity to compete or cooperate with one another for utilization of a given type of glycan. Additionally, the physical and chemical structure of a plant fiber (e.g., its size, surface properties, nutrient composition) in a given region of the gut could influence which set of microbes attach to its surface, how its associated microbes prioritize consumption of its component glycans, and how/whether fiber particle-associated microbes can share products of glycan metabolism with one another.</p><p>The current study illustrates an approach for identifying bioactive molecules from plant fibers and defining how they affect and how they are processed by members of the human gut microbiota. Pea fiber was selected based on results obtained from a screen we conducted of 34 types of food-grade crude plant fibers obtained from various sources, including the byproducts of food manufacturing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Patnode et al., 2019</xref>). The screen was performed in gnotobiotic mice colonized with a defined consortium of cultured sequenced human gut bacterial strains, including several saccharolytic Bacteroides species. Mice were fed a low-fiber diet formulated to represent the upper tertile of saturated fat consumption and lower tertile of fruit and vegetable consumption by individuals living in the USA, as reported in the NHANES database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ridaura et al., 2013</xref>). Supplementation of this ‘HiSF-LoFV’ diet with fiber generated from the seed coat of the pea, <italic>Pisum sativum</italic>, produced a significant increase in the abundance of <italic>Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Patnode et al., 2019</xref>). We have now isolated a bioactive arabinan-enriched fraction from pea fiber, defined its structure, and characterized how a model human gut community, containing human gut Bacteroides established in gnotobiotic mice, responds to the isolated arabinan-enriched fraction versus unfractionated pea fiber. We go on to describe a generalizable method for covalently attaching different glycans to microscopic paramagnetic glass beads with different covalently bound fluorophores, eliminating the proteinaceous component of an approach published by our group that relies on streptavidin-coated beads and bifunctional biotin-conjugated polysaccharides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Patnode et al., 2019</xref>). Introduction of these ‘Microbiota Functional Activity Biosensors’ (MFABs) into gnotobiotic mice fed the HiSF-LoFV diet with or without glycan supplementation followed by their recovery from the gut allowed us to directly compare the capacity of these glycans to be degraded by this community. Chemically colocalizing pea fiber arabinan with glucomannan, another type of polysaccharide not found in the diet, in a monolayer on an MFAB surface enhanced the efficiency of microbial community degradation of bead-associated glucomannan when animals were given a pea-fiber-supplemented HiSF-LoFV diet. These findings illustrate how knowledge of the bioactive components of fibers, and the capacity to directly measure microbiota function with MFABs, could provide new approaches for designing ‘next-generation’ prebiotics and foods that are more accessible to, and have a greater impact on, the gut microbiota (and by extension, the host).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Isolation of a 2-<italic>O-</italic>branched arabinan fraction from pea fiber</title><p>Raw pea fiber was subjected to serial extraction with aqueous buffers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pattathil et al., 2012</xref>). Eight soluble fractions were assayed for total nucleic acid, protein, and carbohydrate content plus monosaccharide composition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The fraction isolated under the harshest conditions (fraction 8; 4M KOH) possessed high carbohydrate and low protein content, high monosaccharide diversity, and a high relative proportion of arabinose. We subsequently developed a scalable abbreviated procedure for preparing this fraction from pea fiber (<italic>see</italic> Materials and methods). The mole percent representation of arabinose in the end product was 71% (corresponding values for xylose, galactose, and glucose were 12%, 11% and 6%, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Xylose was present as a linear xylan polysaccharide (4-substituted xylose) and glucose in the form of residual starch. We named the isolated polysaccharide fraction ‘pea fiber arabinan’ (PFABN) based on (1) these linkage results, (2) the fact that arabinose comprises the majority of its monosaccharide content (71 mole percent), and (3) our observation that ~90% of all non-starch carbohydrate is represented by what is likely a single species of polysaccharide, with the remaining being xylan.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Isolation of an arabinose-rich fraction from pea fiber.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mole fraction of neutral monosaccharides from PFABN and SBABN.

For covalent polysaccharide immobilization on a bead surface, we leveraged a cyano-transfer reaction employed in the synthesis of polysaccharide-conjugate vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lees et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shafer et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref> outlines the procedure for generating fluorescently labeled, polysaccharide-coated beads. <italic>First</italic>, the surfaces of 10 μm diameter glass beads were sialyated by reaction with an amine- and/or phosphonate-organosilane (Step one in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This approach provided us with control over the stoichiometry and properties of surface functional groups (amine and phosphonate) to be used for further derivatization with a fluorophore and ligand immobilization. We found that coating with a 1:1 mole ratio of (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTS) and 3-(trihydroxysilyl)propyl methylphosphonate (THPMP) to install both amine and phosphonate functional groups on the bead surface provided a nucleophilic handle and decreased nonspecific ligand binding and bead aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bagwe et al., 2006</xref>). Surface sialyation and the amount of reactive surface amine functional groups were monitored by measuring the zeta potential of beads following organosilane derivatization with or without amine acetylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Surface amine functional groups were subsequently quantified using a ninhydin-based colorimetric assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Soto-Cantu et al., 2012</xref>). The results revealed that amine plus phosphonate functionalized beads contain 2.18 × 10<sup>10</sup> ± 3.49 × 10<sup>9</sup> (mean ± s.d.) reactive amines per bead versus 1.20 × 10<sup>9</sup> ± 1.92 × 10<sup>8</sup> reactive amines after surface acetylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). By comparison, streptavidin-coated beads used in our previously published procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Patnode et al., 2019</xref>) possess 23-fold fewer potential binding sites (9.21 × 10<sup>8</sup> ± 1.13 × 10<sup>8</sup> molecules of biotin per bead). <italic>Second</italic>, we attached unique fluorogenic tags directly to the bead surface so that multiple bead types with different immobilized polysaccharides could be analyzed simultaneously within a given gnotobiotic animal. To do so, surface-modified beads were reacted with an <italic>N</italic>-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester-activated fluorophore (Step two in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Fluorophore coupling was specific to beads with surface amines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Bead fluorescence could be modulated over four orders of magnitude simply by titration of the reactant fluorophore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Low levels of fluorophore immobilization on beads not coated with APTS or on acetylated beads likely reflect incomplete acetylation with acetic anhydride or nonspecific fluorophore adsorption. <italic>Third</italic>, polysaccharide was activated by reaction with 1-cyano-4-dimethylaminopyridinium tetrafluoroborate (CDAP) to generate an electrophilic cyanate-ester intermediate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>); activated polysaccharide reacts with amines on the surface of the amine plus phosphonate bead. <italic>Lastly</italic>, a hydride reduction was performed to reduce any Schiff base formed with the polysaccharide reducing end and likely the resultant isourea bond (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref> for a schematic of the surface of an arabinan-coated MFAB).</p><p>Using SBABN as a test case, we found that adding 0.2 mg of CDAP per mg polysaccharide resulted in consistent and specific SBABN immobilization without ligand overactivation (manifested by aggregation and carbamoylation of hydroxyl groups) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Immobilization was dependent upon the presence of reactive surface amines; amine acetylation with acetic anhydride reduced surface amine functional groups, fluorophore conjugation, and polysaccharide immobilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>). Therefore, acetylated beads were used as controls in the studies described below. Throughout our experiments, levels of conjugation ranged from 2 to 20 ng of arabinose per 1000 beads when immobilizing SBABN. Conjugation proceeded as expected based on the p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> of the bead amine: pH 7.5–7.8 yielded maximal immobilization (high pH results in cyanate-ester hydrolysis, while low pH favors amine protonation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Conjugation efficiency was not significantly different when different buffer solutes were tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>). A low and inconsistent level of polysaccharide could be conjugated onto a bead surface in the absence of CDAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), likely through reductive amination of the polysaccharide reducing end. Lastly, using maltodextrin as a model, we tested whether oligosaccharides could also be immobilized using CDAP activation and capture onto amine plus phosphonate beads. Maltodextrin (dextrose equivalent 13–17; estimated <italic>M<sub>n</sub></italic> ~1300 Da) was activated with CDAP (0.2 mg/mg oligosaccharide) prior to attachment to the bead surface.

In foods, plant fibers exist mostly as micro-particles. Although it would be desirable to be able compare the dynamics of degradation of glycans on MFABs with glycans in food particles with similar dimensions/characteristics, robust methods for reproducibly recovering food particles from luminal contents are not currently available. Therefore, we reasoned that the MFAB platform could provide a way of testing whether deliberately colocalizing distinct polysaccharides, akin to natural plant fiber particles, would result in ‘synergistic’ polysaccharide degradation by microbial community members.</p><p>To explore this notion, we turned to glucomannan, a hemicellulosic linear β(1-4) polysaccharide composed of <sc>d</sc>-mannose and <sc>d</sc>-glucose.

To test this hypothesis, we synthesized beads coated with PFABN alone, glucomannan alone, or both glycans together, as well as control acetylated beads that lack a bound polysaccharide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). These four bead types, each labeled with a distinct fluorophore, were simultaneously introduced into two groups of mice colonized with the 14-member community – one group was fed the unsupplemented HiSF-LoFV diet, while the other group received a pea fiber-supplemented diet (n = 7–8 mice/group) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Beads were recovered from their cecums 4 hr after gavage; the different bead-types were then isolated using FACS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) and subjected to acid hydrolysis and neutral monosaccharide analysis by GC–MS. We used the amount of mannose remaining on the bead as a proxy of glucomannan degradation because it represents the bulk of monosaccharide present in glucomannan and is absent in PFABN. The results revealed that glucomannan on beads coated with glucomannan alone was degraded to a similar extent in mice receiving the unsupplemented or pea fiber-supplemented HiSF-LoFV diets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>; p=0.87, Mann–Whitney U test).

This finding, and the approach used to obtain these results, have implications for food science and prebiotic/synbiotic discovery efforts.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have used gnotobiotic mice colonized with a defined model human gut microbial community containing 58,537 known or predicted protein-coding genes together with metaproteomic and forward genetic analyses to demonstrate the sensitivity of a microbiota to structural differences in glycans (arabinans) isolated from two distinct plant sources. Robust isolation procedures and analytical characterization are required to isolate grams of polysaccharide and test their biological effects in gnotobiotic mice. The approach we employed allowed us to isolate 50 g of material to ~85% purity with the remaining material comprised of starch and xylan. Starch can be degraded by host enzymes. The xylan present in our PFABN preparation could, in principle, influence the microbiota response. However, there is arabinoxylan already present in the base HiSF-LoFV diet, and we found that expression of known xylan-responsive PULs in <italic>B. cellulosilyticus</italic> WH2 and <italic>B. ovatus</italic> ATCC 8483 was not induced by PFABN supplementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Patnode et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McNulty et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Martens et al., 2011</xref>). The specific activity of each isolated arabinan (in this case the increase in absolute abundance of the responsive Bacteroides per unit mass of diet ingredient consumed per day) was superior to unfractionated pea fiber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), emphasizing, as others have, the importance of characterizing the effects of plant fibers on both the microbiota and host in order to inform future studies at the intersection of food science, nutrition, and human microbial ecology research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gidley and Yakubov, 2019</xref>). Although each of the isolated arabinans had distinct effects on gene expression and organismal fitness, our development of orally administered recoverable and chemically modifiable probes to quantitate community metabolic function revealed their equivalent degradation in specified diet contexts. These findings illustrate how in vivo functional assays can complement and expand current approaches for characterizing microbiomes.</p><p>The bead-based MFABs described in this report represent a technology for measuring biochemical activities expressed by a microbial community of interest in vivo or ex vivo. Future studies where MFABs are used in conjunction with genetic tools that enable rapid deletion of genes or entire multi-kilobase loci could provide new insights about the mechanisms by which community members acquire/degrade nutrients (polysaccharides). We emphasize that in this study, we use MFABs to quantify community degradative activity and not to analyze community consumption of MFAB-bound polysaccharides and its relationship to bacterial growth. Determining the latter is challenging in our animal model; a typical gavage of 10<sup>7</sup> beads contained 100 µg of bead-immobilized polysaccharide, 1000 times more polysaccharide was consumed daily in the diet by mice in the polysaccharide-supplemented arms of our experiments.</p><p>Installing specific functional groups on the surfaces of microscopic paramagnetic glass beads using commercially available organosilane reagents allows ‘modular’ incorporation of different biomolecules. This approach represents an alternative to a procedure we described recently, where bifunctional biotinylated ligands are generated prior to immobilization on glass beads coated with streptavidin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Patnode et al., 2019</xref>). Each of these approaches has distinct advantages and disadvantages. By immobilizing ligand directly on the bead surface, MFABs possess a greater number of sites for ligand attachment than streptavidin-coated beads and include no protein constituents. Higher ligand density enables higher levels of ligand loading, which reduces the absolute number of beads that need to be administered, recovered, and processed, and increases the dynamic range of a functional activity readout.</p><p>A unifying question for food science, microbiome science, and nutrition research is how to decipher the effects of a nutrient and the matrix in which it resides within a food on modulation of microbiota functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gidley and Yakubov, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Leitch et al., 2007</xref>). Crude plant fibers contain various polysaccharides densely intercalated within a cellulose-lignin matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Caffall and Mohnen, 2009</xref>). We found that the absolute abundances of <italic>B. cellulosilyticus</italic> WH2 and <italic>Ruminococcaceae</italic> sp. TSDC 17.2 increase significantly when animals were consuming the crude pea fiber-supplemented diet, but not during supplementation with either of the isolated arabinans. The chemistry for covalent polysaccharide attachment to MFABs not only allows for dense ligand presentation, but also enables multiple ligands to be simultaneously immobilized to create ‘hybrid’ beads to model the effects of physical colocalization of different fiber components on microbial degradation. In principle, a wide range of different glycan combinations with varying stoichiometries can be explored owing to the fact that different hybrid bead types, each with its own fluorophore, can be created and tested simultaneously in vitro and in vivo to investigate the mechanism, generality, and biological significance of colocalization of glycans on their degradation by gut microbes.</p><p>The selection of gut bacterial taxa for in vivo tests of fiber effects in gnotobiotic animal models is critical for yielding ecologically and physiologically relevant results. Characterizing defined communities comprised of organisms beyond those represented in the 14-member consortium will undoubtedly be informative. For example, members of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Faecalibacterium are more tolerant of acidic conditions after carbohydrate fermentation and can outcompete acid intolerant bacteria such as Bacteroides; their inclusion would likely change the response of community members to the presence of different plant fiber preparations and the dynamics of plant fiber degradation documented by various collections of MFABs.</p><p>The approach we describe for ligand immobilization does not require the synthesis of bifunctional ligands (or fluorophores); instead, custom functional groups can be incorporated into the probe through modification of the organosilane donor molecule. As such, the MFAB platform provides an opportunity to develop chemistries for nondestructively releasing ligands for analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bielski and Witczak, 2013</xref>). For example, characterizing microbial degradation of polysaccharides needs to move beyond relatively ‘simple’ GC–MS measurements of monosaccharides released from the surface of recovered beads to readouts of glycan structures recovered from the bead surface (prior to and after exposure to microbes). This information would provide a more informed view of functional properties (saccharolytic activities) expressed by model communities comprised of cultured sequenced members of a microbiota representing a population of interest, or their intact uncultured microbiota, as well as greater insights about structure/activity relationships of existing or new candidate prebiotic and synbiotic formulations.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Isolation of PFABN</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Fractionation of pea fiber</title><p>Raw pea fiber (Rattenmaier) was fractionated using serial extractions with aqueous buffers of increasing harshness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pattathil et al., 2012</xref>).

significantly affected in vivo by pea fiber, PFABN, and SFABN</title><p>To characterize the response of each Bacteroides to the altered nutritional landscape during diet supplementation, we first conducted a meta-proteomic analysis of PUL expression. Fecal communities were sampled 4 days after initiation of diet supplementation (dpg 6) from mice belonging to the three treatment groups receiving supplemented HiSF-LoFV diets and from control animals consuming the unsupplemented diet. Levels of a given protein were cyclic loess-normalized and expressed as a Z-score relative to the abundances of all quantified proteins in each strain and sample: with this approach differences between these protein abundance values in a given community member in mice fed a supplemented compared to unsupplemented diet are not confounded by differences in the abundances of its host bacterium.</p><p>The response of individual proteins to each diet supplement was parameterized using linear models generated in limma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ritchie et al., 2015</xref>). In total, the abundances of 354, 154, and 156 proteins were significantly different during diet supplementation with pea fiber, PFABN, or SBABN, respectively (adjusted p-value&lt;0.05, FDR corrected; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>); of these proteins, 196, 88, and 89, respectively, were encoded within PULs, loci for polysaccharide biosynthesis, and/or were annotated as carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes).</p><p>To identify PULs whose expression were altered significantly, we performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) on normalized fecal metaproteomic data, considering those PULs that had at least five encoded proteins whose abundances were altered in the same direction (adjusted p-value&lt;0.05, unpaired one-sample Z-test, FDR corrected; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luo et al., 2009</xref>). The magnitude of each PUL response was expressed as the average fold-change (log<sub>2</sub>) of each quantified protein in that PUL compared to its abundance in the context of the unsupplemented HiSF-LoFV diet. GSEA identified 14, 12, 11, and 8 PULs that we deemed ‘responsive’ to at least one of the diet supplements in <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> VPI-5482 (BT), <italic>B. ovatus</italic> ATCC 8483 (Bovatus), <italic>B. cellulosilyticus</italic> WH2 (BcellWH2), and <italic>B. vulgatus</italic> ATCC 8482 (BVU), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Plots of fitness score versus change in protein abundance were then generated for all genes in each Bacteroides under each diet condition tested (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). High-protein expression and low mutant fitness are represented in the right lower quadrant of these graphs. A chi-square test was used to assess overrepresentation of genes from a given PUL in this quadrant. Genes within a PUL of interest that fell within an ellipse of the interquartile range of both measurements were omitted from the calculation; all genes other than the tested PUL represented the null.</p><p>Analyzing PULs as gene sets revealed protein abundance responses and effects on fitness that were shared between the three supplements and others that were unique. For <italic>B. thetaioatomicron</italic> VPI-5482, PUL7 was the most highly upregulated PUL with unfractionated pea fiber or isolated PFABN; it contains multiple glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 43 and 51 members with reported arabinofuranosidase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cartmell et al., 2011</xref>). During supplementation with SBABN, <italic>B. thetaioatomicron</italic> VPI-5482 PUL75 was highly upregulated; it specifies multiple GH enzymes, polysaccharide lyases and carbohydrate esterases involved in depolymerizing the repeating disaccharide RGI backbone (α-(1,2)-<sc>l</sc>-rhamnose-α-(1,4)-<sc>d</sc>-galacturonic acid) and is induced in vitro by diverse pectic polysaccharides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Luis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Martens et al., 2011</xref>). BT_PUL7 was identified as having a significant effect on fitness during pea fiber, PFABN, and SBABN supplementation, while BT_PUL75 had a significant effect on fitness only during SBABN supplementation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>) (p&lt;0.05, chi-square test, FDR-corrected). Other PULs in <italic>B. thetaioatomicron</italic> VPI-5482 that respond differently based on supplement type include BT_PUL73 (lower in SBABN) and BT_PUL63 (higher in SBABN) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Previous RNA-Seq studies had indicated that BT_PUL73 is activated by multiple non-arabinan pectic glycans in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Martens et al., 2011</xref>) and is involved in homogalacturonan degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Luis et al., 2018</xref>). BT_PUL63 responds in vitro to arabinogalactan and modestly to arabinan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Martens et al., 2011</xref>) and contains enzymes essential for RGI backbone depolymerization (GH145 and GH105), multiple arabinofuranosidases (GH43 and GH51), and α- and β-galactosidases (GH97 and GH35, respectively). Whether BT_PUL63 is responding to the increased mole percent of galactose, or unique structural features such as 6- or 3,6-substituted galactopyranose in SBABN remains an open question.</p><p><italic>B. vulgatus</italic> ATCC 8482 provided another example of multiple PULs that target arabinan but function as supplement source-specific fitness determinants. BVU_PUL27 and BVU_PUL12 contain genes belonging to GH43, GH51, and GH146 families that have specificity for <sc>l</sc>-arabinofuranosyl structures found in arabinan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Luis et al., 2018</xref>). BVU_PUL27 expression is responsive to all three supplements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), but it only significantly affects fitness in the context of unfractionated pea fiber and PFABN supplementation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>) (p&lt;0.05, chi-square test, FDR corrected). In contrast, BVU_PUL12 responds to and functions as a fitness determinant only during SBABN supplementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>) (p&lt;0.05, chi-square test, FDR corrected).</p><p><italic>B. ovatus</italic> ATCC 8483 PUL97 exhibits significantly greater expression and functions as a fitness PUL with all three supplements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>) (p&lt;0.05, chi-square test, FDR corrected); it is likely involved in RGI utilization based on the presence of multiple polysaccharide lyases, plus GH2, GH28, GH43, and GH105 family enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). <italic>B. ovatus</italic> ATCC 8483 PUL97 is the only fitness PUL we identified in this strain despite increased expression of other PULs, such as Bovatus_PUL40 and Bovatus_PUL96 during unfractionated pea fiber and PFABN supplementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>B. cellulosilyticus</italic> WH2, BcellWH2_PUL5 is induced and functions as a fitness PUL in the context of all three supplements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>) (p&lt;0.05, chi-square test, FDR corrected).

The new methodology has allowed you to begin to explore biochemical activities of gut microbiota in situ. We view this as an important step forward in the area of microbiome research.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for sending your article entitled &quot;Microbiota functional activity biosensors for characterizing nutrient utilization in vivo&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been evaluated by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Wendy Garrett as the Senior Editor.</p><p>There was enthusiasm for acceptance of your work but some concern about focus. The reviewers are quite interested about the fluorogenic bead technology and its application for microbiome studies. They have made recommendations about how you might strengthen the connection between the results describing how Bacteroides degrade these fibers and the technology. Consensus of the reviewers is that this is a manuscript about a powerful tool and its application rather than a deep dive into the underlying biology. If you can recast the work in light of the reviewers' comments and concerns and modify the text so that it is more conservative it its claims, we are of the opinion that it would be quite appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. The reviewers express a desire to add some minor additional supporting data for some of your experiments (for example as regards Figure 5D). We are providing reviewer comments but to clarify are not asking for extensive new experimentation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic></p><p>I agree with the conclusions the authors draw from the enumeration, INSeq, and proteomic measurements presented in Figure 2 (and its supplements) and Figure 5 - in short, that specific PULs harbored by strains in the synthetic community determine the degree of glycan degradation observed on the beads recovered from mice. It might be nice to run a confirmatory experiment with, e.g., a community in which wild-type BT is replaced by a δ-PUL7 or δ-PUL75 mutant, but the data are already convincing in their current form.</p><p>Likely outside the scope of this manuscript, but are the authors able to isolate bacterial cells or genetic material from beads recovered from a mouse? One could imagine an anchor organism that consumes the fiber or simply uses it as a physical niche. Might be especially interesting if bead-associated communities had structure and could be imaged using FISH.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Wesener and colleagues present a method for characterizing biochemical activities of gut microbes in vivo. First, the authors purified and extensively characterized a polysaccharide fraction rich in arabinan (PFABN) and compared the biological activity of PFABN to that of unfractionated pea fiber and arabinan purified from sugar beet (SBABN) using in vitro growth assays/substrate degradation using monocultures of several Bacteroides species, establishing the impact of these on bacterial metabolism. They also characterized responses to these fibers in vivo, in mice colonized with a synthetic community composed of 14 species, consuming diet with/without these fibers. Authors used community-wide proteomic measurements and transposon mutant analyses (TnSeq) for five Bacteroides species to investigate genes involved in the utilization of these fibers and genes important for fitness in these fibers for the 5 Bacteroides species. In the second half of the paper the authors describe methods for generating “Microbiota Functional Activity Biosensors” (MFABs), which consist of glycans covalently-linked to the surface of fluorescent paramagnetic microscopic glass beads. They characterize MFABs and perform validation studies (i.e., quantification of glycan metabolism) in vitro and in gnotobiotic mice. Using unique fluorogenic tags authors analyze simultaneously multiple bead types with different immobilized polysaccharides. Presented results suggest that colocalizing different polysaccharides on the bead surface can have a synergistic effect on their degradation modulated by diet. These newly developed Microbiota Functional Activity Biosensors are a significant contribution to the field as options for measuring gut microbiota biochemical activities in vivo are currently very limited. Also, the study contributes valuable datasets on bacterial (proteomics/InSeq for 5 Bacteroides species) that will be useful to other scientists studying the microbiome. Specific comments:</p><p>The paper comes across as having two major parts that could be better integrated. Testing whether any of the key PULs identified for degradation of PFABN/SBABN (results from INSeq/proteomics) impact degradation of these fibers in the beads in vitro (or vivo) would strengthen the connection between the results describing how Bacteroides degrade these fibers and the new development.</p><p>Not clear how the statistical differences in growth were determined in Figure 1. i.e., what values were used? Growth rate during exponential phase? Should be indicated.</p><p>Bead assays: What fraction of the beads orally-gavaged are recovered from the mice? Also, in the Materials and methods authors mention that beads were collected from cecum and/or from fecal pellets. Does collection site affect the extent to which glycans on the beads are metabolized?</p><p>Beads assays ii. The measurement of glycans that remain bound to the beads informs what it is released from them. It is likely that in the context of a complex community most/all? of the released carbohydrates are also used by microbes. This may not always be true, particularly in monocultures or in experiments in mice with small communities. This should be discussed.</p><p>&quot;The results disclosed that the fitness scores of 332, 195, and 75 genes were significantly altered during diet supplementation with pea fiber, PFABN, or SBABN, respectively (Supplementary file 4) (adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05, FDR-corrected)&quot; Not clear what species is being discussed here. Supplementary file 4 contains 12 tables (3 supplemented substrates/4 Bacteroides strains).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This manuscript represents a technical tour de force, and describes an approach to trace and understand metabolic pathways generated by single compounds in a complex ecosystem such as the mouse gut. An outstanding research team has applied many state of the art methodologies to examine the effects of particular dietary substrates on bacterial growth and gene expression. This represents a technological advance but the extent of the advance is not clear, since the results often are marginal. Although a great deal of work has been performed, the overall significance of the work is not obvious.</p><p>Several specific points should be addressed as well:</p><p>The pea fiber arabinan is only 71% of the purified polysaccharide. What is the significance of the substantial carbohydrate contamination? Can it really be called purified with such extensive contamination? The results in Figure 4 indicate that the xylan component materially affects the results.</p><p>What is is the significance of the long lag phase for <italic>B. ovatus</italic> with glucose as the substrate? That pattern is unlike all other conditions.</p><p>Figure 2. Panels B and C seem to be contradictory.

It might be nice to run a confirmatory experiment with, e.g., a community in which wild-type BT is replaced by a δ-PUL7 or δ-PUL75 mutant, but the data are already convincing in their current form.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that deletion of an entire multi-kilobase PUL would provide confirmatory evidence of the importance of that PUL for polysaccharide utilization and fitness. We are working to develop CRISPR-based tools for removing specified PULs from <italic>Bacteroides</italic>, but this remains a “work in progress”. Therefore, we feel that targeted deletion of these or other PULs is outside the scope of the current study which focuses on development of MFAB technology and its application for quantifying polysaccharide degradation by a gut microbial community.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Likely outside the scope of this manuscript, but are the authors able to isolate bacterial cells or genetic material from beads recovered from a mouse? One could imagine an anchor organism that consumes the fiber or simply uses it as a physical niche. Might be especially interesting if bead-associated communities had structure and could be imaged using FISH.</p></disp-quote><p>We very much appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion and vision. However, quantifying the distribution of each member of our 13-member community within and across different bead-types, within and across different regions of the gut as a function of diet using FISH or other culture-independent methods is technically challenging. We agree with the reviewer at two levels: such an effort is outside the scope of the present work but certainly a future application of the bead technology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Wesener and colleagues present a method for characterizing biochemical activities of gut microbes in vivo. First, the authors purified and extensively characterized a polysaccharide fraction rich in arabinan (PFABN) and compared the biological activity of PFABN to that of unfractionated pea fiber and arabinan purified from sugar beet (SBABN) using in vitro growth assays/substrate degradation using monocultures of several Bacteroides species, establishing the impact of these on bacterial metabolism. They also characterized responses to these fibers in vivo, in mice colonized with a synthetic community composed of 14 species, consuming diet with/without these fibers. Authors used community-wide proteomic measurements and transposon mutant analyses (TnSeq) for five Bacteroides species to investigate genes involved in the utilization of these fibers and genes important for fitness in these fibers for the 5 Bacteroides species. In the second half of the paper the authors describe methods for generating “Microbiota Functional Activity Biosensors” (MFABs), which consist of glycans covalently-linked to the surface of fluorescent paramagnetic microscopic glass beads. They characterize MFABs and perform validation studies (i.e., quantification of glycan metabolism) in vitro and in gnotobiotic mice. Using unique fluorogenic tags authors analyze simultaneously multiple bead types with different immobilized polysaccharides. Presented results suggest that colocalizing different polysaccharides on the bead surface can have a synergistic effect on their degradation modulated by diet. These newly developed Microbiota Functional Activity Biosensors are a significant contribution to the field as options for measuring gut microbiota biochemical activities in vivo are currently very limited. Also, the study contributes valuable datasets on bacterial (proteomics/InSeq for 5 Bacteroides species) that will be useful to other scientists studying the microbiome. Specific comments:</p><p>The paper comes across as having two major parts that could be better integrated. Testing whether any of the key PULs identified for degradation of PFABN/SBABN (results from INSeq/proteomics) impact degradation of these fibers in the beads in vitro (or vivo) would strengthen the connection between the results describing how Bacteroides degrade these fibers and the new development.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted in our response to reviewer 1, we are working to develop CRISPR-based tools for PUL deletions. In the revised Discussion, we have emphasized how application of genetic (e.g. CRISPR-based) tools for single gene or entire PUL deletion, combined with the use of MFABs as a functional readout, could provide new insights about the mechanisms by which community members acquire/degrade nutrients (polysaccharides).</p><p>We have modified the text:</p><p>“Future studies where MFABs are used in conjunction with genetic tools that enable rapid deletion of genes or entire multi-kilobase loci could provide new insights about the mechanisms by which community members acquire/degrade nutrients (polysaccharides).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Not clear how the statistical differences in growth were determined in Figure 1. i.e., what values were used?
