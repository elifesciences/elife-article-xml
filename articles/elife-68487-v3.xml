Here, we discovered an unexpected role of the ubiquitous gasotransmitter hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) in HIV latency and reactivation. We show that reactivation of HIV is associated with downregulation of the key H<sub>2</sub>S producing enzyme cystathionine-γ-lyase (CTH) and reduction in endogenous H<sub>2</sub>S. Genetic silencing of CTH disrupts redox homeostasis, impairs mitochondrial function, and remodels the transcriptome of latent cells to trigger HIV reactivation. Chemical complementation of CTH activity using a slow-releasing H<sub>2</sub>S donor, GYY4137, suppressed HIV reactivation and diminished virus replication. Mechanistically, GYY4137 blocked HIV reactivation by inducing the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway, inhibiting NF-κB, and recruiting the epigenetic silencer, YY1, to the HIV promoter. In latently infected CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from ART-suppressed human subjects, GYY4137 in combination with ART prevented viral rebound and improved mitochondrial bioenergetics. Moreover, prolonged exposure to GYY4137 exhibited no adverse influence on proviral content or CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets, indicating that diminished viral rebound is due to a loss of transcription rather than a selective loss of infected cells. In summary, this work provides mechanistic insight into H<sub>2</sub>S-mediated suppression of viral rebound and suggests exploration of H<sub>2</sub>S donors to maintain HIV in a latent form.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>redox</kwd><kwd>gasotransmitter</kwd><kwd>latency</kwd><kwd>T-cells</kwd><kwd>GYY4137</kwd><kwd>cystathionine-gamma-lyase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Viruses</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009053</institution-id><institution>The Wellcome Trust DBT India Alliance</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IA/S/16/2/502700</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Singh</surname><given-names>Amit</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001407</institution-id><institution>Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BT/PR13522/COE/34/27/2015 BT/PR29098/Med/29/1324/2018 and BT/HRD/NBA/39/07/2018-19</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Singh</surname><given-names>Amit</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001407</institution-id><institution>Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>22-0905-0006-05-987 436</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Singh</surname><given-names>Amit</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007296</institution-id><institution>Infosys Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CIDR</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Singh</surname><given-names>Amit</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Department of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DST-FIST</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Singh</surname><given-names>Amit</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A gaseous signaling molecule hydrogen sulfide stimulates mitochondrial bioenergetics, maintains glutathione redox poise, and suppresses ROS to subvert viral rebound in latently infected CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from HIV subjects.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the causative agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), is responsible for 0.6 million deaths and 1.7 million new infections in 2019 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/hiv-aids">https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/hiv-aids</ext-link>). Despite advances in antiretroviral therapy (ART), the persistence of latent but replication-competent HIV in cellular reservoirs is a major barrier to cure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Finzi et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sengupta and Siliciano, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Cohn et al., 2020</xref>). Understanding host factors and signaling pathways underlying HIV latency and rebound upon cessation of ART is of the highest importance in the search for an HIV cure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Deeks et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Collins et al., 2020</xref>). Host-generated gaseous signaling molecules such as nitric oxide (NO), carbon monoxide (CO), and hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) modulate antimicrobial activity, inflammatory response, and metabolism of immune cells to influence bacterial and viral infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chinta et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pal et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Tinajero-Trejo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rahman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Shiloh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Braverman and Stanley, 2017</xref>). Surprisingly, while circumstantial evidence links NO and CO with HIV-1 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blond et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Devadas and Dhawan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Liu et al., 2016</xref>), the role of H<sub>2</sub>S remained completely unexplored.</p><p>H<sub>2</sub>S is primarily synthesized in mammals, including humans, via the reverse transsulfuration pathway using methionine and cysteine metabolizing enzymes cystathionine-gamma-lyase (CSE/CTH), cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS), and cysteine-aminotransferase (CAT)–3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MPST), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pal et al., 2018</xref>). Because H<sub>2</sub>S is lipophilic, it rapidly permeates through biological membranes without membrane channels (lipid bilayer permeability, P<sub>M</sub>≥0.5±0.4 cm/s), dissociates into HS<sup>–</sup> and S<sup>2–</sup> in aqueous solution, and maintains an HS<sup>–</sup>:H<sub>2</sub>S ratio of 3:1 at physiological pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pal et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, expression and enzymatic activity of CTH was diminished in human CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and hepatic tissues derived from AIDS patients, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hyrcza et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Martin et al., 2001</xref>). Additionally, the levels of H<sub>2</sub>S precursors L-cysteine and methionine were severely limited in AIDS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hortin et al., 1994</xref>). Also, HIV infection reduces the major cellular antioxidant glutathione (GSH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Staal et al., 1992</xref>), whose production is dependent on L-cysteine and H<sub>2</sub>S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kimura et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">McBean, 2012</xref>). Consequently, supplementation with N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), which is an exogenous source of L-cysteine, has been proposed for AIDS treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Roederer et al., 1993</xref>). Since functional CBS and CTH enzymes are known to promote T cell activation and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Miller et al., 2012</xref>), endogenous levels of H<sub>2</sub>S can potentiate T cell-based immunity against HIV. Therefore, we think that the endogenous levels and biochemical activity of H<sub>2</sub>S, which critically depends upon the cysteine and transsulfuration pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mathai et al., 2009</xref>), are likely to be important determinants of HIV infection.</p><p>Calibrated production of H<sub>2</sub>S improves the functioning of various immune cells by protecting them from deleterious oxidants, stimulating mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), and counteracting systemic inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pal et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Modis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Fu et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, supraphysiological concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>S exert cytotoxicity by inhibiting OXPHOS, promoting inflammation, and inducing redox imbalance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pal et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Modis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Fu et al., 2012</xref>). These H<sub>2</sub>S-specific physiological changes are also crucial for HIV-1 infection. First, chronic inflammation contributes to HIV-1 pathogenesis by affecting innate and adaptive immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Deeks et al., 2013</xref>), impairing recovery of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells post-ART (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nakanjako et al., 2011</xref>), increasing the risk of comorbidities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Leng and Margolick, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alzahrani et al., 2019</xref>), and worsening organ function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tattevin et al., 2007</xref>). Second, HIV-1 preferentially infects CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells with high OXPHOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Valle-Casuso et al., 2019</xref>), relies on glycolysis for continuous replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hegedus et al., 2014</xref>), and reactivates in response to altered mitochondrial bioenergetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tyagi et al., 2020</xref>). Third, a higher capacity to resist oxidative stress promotes virus latency, whereas increased oxidative stress levels induce reactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhaskar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Savarino et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Shytaj et al., 2020</xref>). Fourth, H<sub>2</sub>S directly (via S-linked sulfhydration) or indirectly modulates the activity of transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Xie et al., 2016</xref>) that are well known to trigger HIV-1 reactivation from latency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Williams et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brooks et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Duverger et al., 2013</xref>). Finally, the thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase (Trx/TrxR) system crucial for maintaining HIV-1 reservoirs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chirullo et al., 2013</xref>) has been shown to regulate H<sub>2</sub>S-mediated S-persulfidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Dóka et al., 2016</xref>). Altogether, many physiological processes vital for HIV-1 pathogenesis overlap with the underlying mechanism of H<sub>2</sub>S-mediated signaling.</p><p>Based on the role of H<sub>2</sub>S in regulating redox balance, mitochondrial bioenergetics, and inflammation, we hypothesize that intracellular levels of H<sub>2</sub>S modulate the HIV-1 latency and reactivation program. To test this hypothesis, we utilized cell line-based models of HIV-1 latency and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells of HIV-1 infected patients on suppressive ART, which harbors the latent but replication-competent virus. Biochemical and genetic approaches were exploited to investigate the link between H<sub>2</sub>S and HIV-1 latency. Finally, we used NanoString gene expression technology, oxidant-specific fluorescent dyes, and real-time extracellular flux analysis to examine the role of H<sub>2</sub>S in mediating HIV-1 persistence by regulating gene expression, redox signaling, and mitochondrial bioenergetics.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Diminished biogenesis of endogenous H<sub>2</sub>S during HIV-1 reactivation</title><p>To investigate the link between HIV-1 latency and H<sub>2</sub>S, we measured changes in the expression of genes encoding H<sub>2</sub>S-generating enzymes CBS, CTH, and MPST in monocytic (U1) and lymphocytic (J1.1 and J-Lat) models of HIV-1 latency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The U1 and J1.1/J-Lat cell lines are well-studied models of post-integration latency and were derived from chronically infected clones of a promonocytic (U937) and a T-lymphoid (Jurkat) cell line, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Folks et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Perez et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jordan et al., 2003</xref>). Both U1 and J1.1/J-Lat show very low basal expression of the HIV-1 genome, which can be induced by several latency reversal agents (LRAs) such as PMA, TNF-α, and prostratin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Folks et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Perez et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jordan et al., 2003</xref>). First, we confirmed virus reactivation by measuring HIV-1 <italic>gag</italic> transcript in U1 with a low concentration of PMA (5 ng/ml). Treatment of PMA induces detectable expression of <italic>gag</italic> at 12 hr, which continued to increase for the entire 36 hr duration of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Next, we assessed the mRNA and protein levels of CBS, CTH, and MPST in U1 during virus latency (untreated) and reactivation (PMA-treated). The mRNA and protein expression levels of CTH showed a significant reduction at 24 and 36 hr post-PMA treatment as compared to the untreated control, whereas the expression of CBS was not detected and MPST remained unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>). As an uninfected control, we measured the expression of CBS, CTH, and MPST in U937 cells. In contrast to U1, PMA treatment stimulated the mRNA and protein levels of CTH in U937 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–G</xref>), while CBS was barely detectable. Also, we directly measured endogenous H<sub>2</sub>S levels using a fluorescent probe 7-azido-4-methylcoumarin (AzMc) that quantitatively detects H<sub>2</sub>S in living cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). Consistent with the expression data, reactivation of HIV-1 by PMA reduced H<sub>2</sub>S generation in U1, whereas H<sub>2</sub>S levels were significantly increased by PMA in the uninfected U937 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H–I</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>HIV-1 reactivation diminishes expression of H<sub>2</sub>S metabolic enzymes and endogenous H<sub>2</sub>S levels.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic showing H<sub>2</sub>S producing enzymes in mammalian cells.

Therefore, we next asked whether CTH-derived H<sub>2</sub>S regulates the reactivation of HIV-1 from latency. To test this idea, we depleted endogenous CTH levels in U1 using RNA interference (RNAi). The short hairpin RNA specific for CTH (U1-shCTH) silenced the expression of CTH mRNA and protein by 90% as compared to non-targeting shRNA (U1-shNT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). Moreover, using AzMC probe, we confirmed the reduction in endogenous H<sub>2</sub>S levels in U1-shCTH as compared to U1-shNT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A-B</xref>). In addition to H<sub>2</sub>S production, CTH catalyzes the last step in the reverse transsulfuration pathway to generate cysteine. However, levels of cysteine remain comparable in U1-shCTH and U1-shNT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>), indicating that other routes for cysteine biosynthesis (e.g., de novo and assimilatory pathways) compensate for CTH depletion in U1. Next, we investigated the effect of H<sub>2</sub>S depletion via CTH suppression on HIV-1 latency by measuring viral transcription (<italic>gag</italic> transcript), translation (HIV-1 p24 capsid protein), and release (HIV-1 p24 abundance in the cell supernatant).

Several pathways that induce HIV-1 reactivation from latency are also influenced by H<sub>2</sub>S. These include redox signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banerjee, 2011</xref>), NF-κB pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gao et al., 2012</xref>), inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhatia, 2012</xref>), and mitochondrial bioenergetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Szabo et al., 2014</xref>). Hence, we conducted a focused expression profiling of 185 human genes intrinsically linked to HIV-1 reactivation using the NanoString nCounter Technology (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref> for the gene list) to measure absolute amounts of multiple transcripts without reverse transcription. Because depletion of CTH promoted reactivation of the HIV-1 in U1, we compared the expression profile of U1-shCTH with U1-shNT to further understand the link between H<sub>2</sub>S biogenesis and HIV-1 latency. Examination of 84 genes related to oxidative stress response revealed differential regulation of 22 genes in U1-shCTH compared with U1-shNT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c</xref>). Interestingly, more than 90% of genes showing altered expression were downregulated in U1-shCTH. Of these, genes encoding key cellular antioxidant enzymes and buffers such as catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD1), peroxiredoxin family, thioredoxin family (TXN, TXNRD1 and TXNRD2), sulfiredoxin (SRXN1), glutathione metabolism (GCLM, GSS, and GSR), and sulfur metabolism (MPST, AHCY, and MAT2A) were significantly less expressed in U1-shCTH as compared to U1-shNT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Further, while MPST was downregulated upon CTH knock-down, CBS remained undetectable in U1-shCTH and U1-shNT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Since oxidative stress elicits HIV-1 reactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhaskar et al., 2015</xref>), these findings indicate that HIV-1 reactivation through CTH depletion could be a consequence of an altered redox balance. Further, pathways involved in promoting HIV-1 reactivation, such as NF-κB signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Williams et al., 2007</xref>) and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Khan et al., 2015</xref>), were also induced in U1-shCTH as compared to U1-shNT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Notably, multiple HIV-1 restriction factors are important for viral latency including type I interferon signaling (IRF2 and STAT-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sgarbanti et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nguyen et al., 2018</xref>), APOBEC3G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gillick et al., 2013</xref>), CDK9-CCNT1 ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amini et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Budhiraja et al., 2013</xref>), SLP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">McNeely et al., 1995</xref>), and chromatin remodelers (SMARCB1, BANF1, and YY1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rafati et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Coull et al., 2000</xref>) were downregulated in U1-shCTH. HIV-1 proteins are known to target mitochondria to induce mitochondrial depolarization, elevate mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), and apoptosis for replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Badley et al., 2003</xref>). Several genes involved in sustaining mitochondrial function and membrane potential (e.g., BAX, UCP2, LHPP, and MPV17) were repressed in U1-shCTH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), highlighting a potential association between unrestricted virus replication, mitochondrial dysfunction, and CTH depletion.</p><p>Since PMA is known to reactivate HIV-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pardons et al., 2019b</xref>), we examined the gene expression in U1-shNT upon reactivation of HIV-1 by PMA. We found that 80% of genes affected by the depletion of CTH were similarly perturbed in response to PMA. Signature of transcripts associated with oxidative stress response, sulfur metabolism, anti-viral factors, and mitochondrial function was comparable in U1-shCTH and PMA-treated U1-shNT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Based on these similarities, we hypothesized that combining PMA with CTH depletion would have an additive effect on the expression of genes linked to HIV-1 reactivation. Indeed, exposure of U1-shCTH to PMA induced gene expression changes, which surpassed those produced by PMA treatment or CTH-depletion alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Notably, significant expression changes in U1-shCTH upon PMA treatment are consistent with our data showing maximal HIV-1 activation under these conditions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Overall, these results indicate that CTH contributes to HIV-1 latency by modulating multiple pathways coordinating cellular homeostasis (e.g., redox balance and mitochondrial function) and the anti-viral response.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>CTH is required to maintain redox homeostasis and mitochondrial function</title><p>Physiological levels of H<sub>2</sub>S support redox balance and mitochondrial function by maintaining GSH balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kimura et al., 2010</xref>), protecting against ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kimura et al., 2010</xref>), and acting as a substrate for the electron transport chain (ETC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Modis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Fu et al., 2012</xref>). On this basis, we reasoned that the depletion of CTH could contribute to redox imbalance and mitochondrial dysfunction, both of which are known to promote HIV-1 reactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tyagi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhaskar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Singh et al., 2021</xref>). We first measured total glutathione content (GSH+GSSG) and GSSG concentration in U1-shNT and U1-shCTH using chemical-enzymatic analysis of whole-cell extract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhaskar et al., 2015</xref>). Whole-cell glutathione content was not significantly different in U1-shNT and U1-shCTH (p=0.2801) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). However, the GSSG concentration was elevated in U1-shCTH resulting in a concomitant decrease in the GSH/GSSG ratio of U1-shCTH as compared to U1-shNT (p=0.0032) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The increased GSSG pool and reduced GSH/GSSG poise confirm that cells are experiencing oxidative stress upon CTH depletion. We measured total ROS using a fluorescent probe, 5,6-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (CM-H<sub>2</sub>DCFDA), which non-specifically responds to any type of ROS within the cells. Both U1-shNT and U1-shCTH showed comparable levels of cytoplasmic ROS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), which remained unchanged after stimulation with PMA. In addition to cytoplasmic ROS, we also measured mitochondrial ROS (mitoROS) using the red fluorescent dye MitoSOX, which selectively stains mitoROS. Lowering the levels of CTH severely increased mitoROS in U1, which was further accentuated after PMA stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We then studied the effect of CTH depletion on mitochondrial functions using a Seahorse XF Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Agilent) as described previously by us (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tyagi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Szabo et al., 2014</xref>). Both basal and ATP-coupled respiration was significantly decreased in U1-shCTH as compared to U1-shNT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–E</xref>), consistent with the role of endogenous H<sub>2</sub>S in reducing cytochrome C oxidase for respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Szabo et al., 2014</xref>). The maximal respiratory capacity, attained by the dissipation of the mitochondrial proton gradient with the uncoupler FCCP, was markedly diminished in U1-shCTH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). The maximal respiration also facilitated the estimation of the spare respiratory capacity (SRC), which was nearly exhausted in U1-shCTH. Additional hallmarks of HIV-1 reactivation and dysfunctional mitochondria such as coupling efficiency and non-mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (nmOCR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tyagi et al., 2020</xref>) were also adversely affected upon depletion of CTH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). These results indicate that CTH depletion decelerates respiration, diminishes the capacity of macrophages to maximally respire, and promotes nmOCR.

As a control, we used N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) that is known to block HIV-1 reactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Roederer et al., 1990</xref>). Pretreatment of U1 with a non-toxic dose of GYY4137 (5 mM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>) diminished the expression of <italic>gag</italic> transcript by twofold at 24 hr and tenfold at 48 hr post-PMA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The effect of GYY4137 on p24 levels in the supernatant was even more striking as it completely abolished the time-dependent increase in p24 concentration post-PMA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). As expected, pretreatment with NAC similarly prevented PMA-triggered reactivation of HIV-1 in U1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Pretreatment of U1 with spent GYY4137, which comprises the decomposed backbone, showed no effect on PMA induced <italic>gag</italic> transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Because TNF-α is a physiologically relevant cytokine that reactivates HIV-1 from latency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Folks et al., 1987</xref>), we tested the effect of GYY4137 on TNF-α-mediated virus reactivation. Treatment of U1 with TNF-α stimulated the expression of <italic>gag</italic> transcript by 42-fold and 169-fold at 24 and 48 hr, post-treatment, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The addition of GYY4137 or NAC nearly abolished the reactivation of HIV-1 in response to TNF-α treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Earlier, we showed that depletion of CTH stimulated HIV-1 reactivation in U1 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Therefore, we tested if GYY4137 could complement this genetic deficiency and subvert HIV-1 reactivation. The U1-shCTH cells were pre-treated with 5 mM GYY4137 and p24 levels in the supernatant were measured. The elevated levels of p24 in U1-shCTH were reduced by twofold under basal conditions and 3.2-fold upon PMA stimulation in response to GYY4137 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Both RNAi and chemical complementation data provide evidence that H<sub>2</sub>S is one of the factors regulating HIV-1 latency and reactivation in U1.</p><p>Similar to U1, we next examined whether GYY4137 subverts HIV-1 reactivation in the J1.1 T-cell line model. Treatment of J1.1 with PMA for 12 hr resulted in a 38-fold increase in <italic>gag</italic> transcript as compared to untreated J1.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), indicating efficient reactivation of HIV-1. Importantly, pretreatment with various non-toxic concentrations of GYY4137 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>) reduced the stimulation of <italic>gag</italic> transcription by twofold upon subsequent exposure to PMA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Interestingly, low concentration of GYY4137 (0.3 mM) was relatively more effective than high concentration (5 mM) in subverting HIV-1 reactivation. While intriguing, these findings are consistent with the reports that high concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>S induce pro-oxidant effects on cellular physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Olas et al., 2019</xref>), which might have dampened the suppressive action of GYY4137 on HIV-1 transcription in J1.1. However, this needs further experimentation. The inhibitory effect of GYY4137 on HIV-1 reactivation was relatively greater compared to NAC in J1.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Consistent with U1 and J1.1, treatment of J-Lat with 5 μM prostratin for 24 hr induced significant HIV-1 reactivation, which was translated as 100% increase in GFP<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Pretreatment with GYY4137 significantly reduced HIV-1 reactivation in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>We also examined if an endogenous increase in H<sub>2</sub>S by GYY4137 halts the replication of HIV-1 in primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. To this end, we infected primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of three healthy human donors with HIV-1 (pNL4.3) and monitored HIV-1 replication by measuring the levels of p24 in the supernatant at 3 and 5 days post-infection. The p24 ELISA confirmed a time-dependent increase in viral load, which was uniformly reduced upon pretreatment with a non-toxic concentration of GYY4137 (0.8 mM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

Consistent with the role of PMA-mediated oxidative stress in preceding HIV-1 reactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhaskar et al., 2015</xref>), expression of genes encoding ROS, and RNS generating enzymes (e.g., NADPH oxidase [NCF1 and CYBB] and Nitric oxide synthase [NOS2]) were upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Also, the expression of major antioxidant enzymes (e.g., GPXs, PRDXs, and CAT) and redox buffers (GSH and TRX pathways) remained repressed in U1-PMA, indicative of elevated oxidative stress. Additionally, pro-inflammatory signatures (e.g., TGFB1 and SERPINA1) and trans-activators (e.g., FOS) were induced, whereas host factors involved in HIV-1 restriction (e.g., IRF1 and YY1) were repressed in U1-PMA as compared to U1. In agreement with the reduction in endogenous H<sub>2</sub>S levels during HIV-1 reactivation, expression of CTH involved in H<sub>2</sub>S anabolism was downregulated and H<sub>2</sub>S catabolism (SQRDL) was upregulated by PMA.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>GYY4137 modulates Nrf2, NF-κB, and YY1 pathways.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) U1 cells pre-treated with 5 mM GYY4137 for 24 hr or left untreated and then stimulated with 5 ng/ml PMA for 24 hr or left unstimulated.

For example, GYY4137 elicited a robust induction of genes regulated by nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in U1-GYY+PMA compared to U1 or U1-PMA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Nrf2 acts as a master regulator of redox metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pall and Levine, 2015</xref>) by binding to the antioxidant response element (ARE) and initiating transcription of major antioxidant genes (<italic>e.g.,</italic> GSH pathway, TXNRD1, HMOX1, GPX4, and SRXN1). Interestingly, while the expression of Nrf2-dependent CTH gene was induced in U1-GYY+PMA, MPST remained unaffected. The Nrf2 activity has been shown to pause HIV-1 infection by inhibiting the insertion of reverse-transcribed viral cDNA into the host chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Furuya et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, sustained activation of Nrf2-dependent antioxidant response is essential for the establishment of viral latency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Shytaj et al., 2020</xref>). A few genes encoding H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> detoxifying enzymes (e.g., CAT, GPX1, and PRDXs) were repressed in U1-GYY+PMA, indicating that the expression of these enzymes was likely counterbalanced by the elevated expression of other antioxidant systems by H<sub>2</sub>S. In line with the antagonistic effect of GYY4137 on HIV-1 transcription, the expression of HIV-1 trans-activator (FOS) was downregulated, and an inhibitor of NF-κB signaling (NFKBIA) was induced in U1-GYY+PMA as compared to U1 or U1-PMA. Finally, GYY4137 stimulated the expression of several anti-HIV (YY1, STAT1, STAT3, and IRF1) and pro-survival factors (CDKN1A and LTBR) that were repressed by PMA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Altogether, H<sub>2</sub>S supplementation induces a major realignment of redox metabolism and immune pathways associated with HIV-1 reactivation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>GYY4137-mediated modulation of the Keap1-Nrf2 axis, NF-κB signaling, and activity of epigenetic factor YY1</title><p>Our expression data indicate activation of the Nrf2 pathway and modulation of transcription factors such as NF-κB and YY1 upon treatment with GYY4137. We tested if the mechanism of H<sub>2</sub>S-mediated subversion of HIV-1 reactivation involves these pathways. H<sub>2</sub>S has recently been shown to prevent cellular senescence by activation of Nrf2 via S-persulfidation of its negative regulator Keap-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). Under unstimulated conditions, Nrf2 binds to Keap1, and the latter promotes Nrf2 degradation via the proteasomal machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). Nrf2 disassociates from the S-persulfidated form of Keap1, accumulates in the cytoplasm, and translocates to nuclei where it induces transcription of antioxidant genes upon oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). We first examined if GYY4137 treatment accumulates Nrf2 in the cytoplasm. As expected, Nrf2 was not detected in U1 owing to its association with Keap1 under unstimulated conditions. However, a noticeable accumulation of Nrf2 was observed in U1-GYY+PMA compared to U1 or U1-PMA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). As an additional verification, we quantified the levels of an Nrf2-dependent protein HMOX-1. Similar to Nrf2, the levels of HMOX-1 were also induced in U1-GYY+PMA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). These findings are consistent with our NanoString data showing activation of Nrf2-specific oxidative stress responsive genes in GYY4137 treated U1.</p><p>Next, we determined if GYY4137 treatment targets NF-κB, which is a major regulator of HIV-1 reactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Williams et al., 2007</xref>). The cellular level of phosphorylated serine-536 in p65, a major subunit of NF-κB, is commonly measured to assess NF-κB activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zhong et al., 1998</xref>). Since PMA reactivates HIV-1, we observed an increase in p65 ser-536 phosphorylation in U1-PMA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In contrast, pretreatment with GYY4137 significantly decreased PMA-induced p65 ser-536 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). These findings suggest that GYY4137 is likely to affect the DNA binding and transcriptional activity of NF-κB. Consistent with this idea, a two-step chromatin immunoprecipitation and genomic qPCR (ChIP-qPCR) assay showed that GYY4137-treatment significantly reduced the occupancy of p65 at its binding site (ER, enhancer region) on the HIV-1 LTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–E</xref>).</p><p>GYY4137 induces the expression of another transcription factor YY1, which binds to HIV-1 LTR at RBEI and RBEIII and recruits histone deacetylase (HDACs) to facilitate repressive chromatin modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Coull et al., 2000</xref>). Overexpression of YY1 is known to promote HIV-1 latency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bernhard et al., 2013</xref>). We tested if GYY4137 promotes the binding of YY1 at RBEI and RBEIII sites on HIV-1 LTR by ChIP-qPCR. The occupancy of YY1 at RBEI and RBEIII was significantly enriched in the case of U1-GYY+PMA as compared to U1-PMA or U1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that increasing endogenous H<sub>2</sub>S levels by using a slow-releasing donor effectively modulate the Keap1-Nrf2 axis and activity of transcription factors to maintain redox balance and control HIV-1 reactivation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>GYY4137 blocks HIV-1 rebound from latent CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells isolated from infected individuals on suppressive ART</title><p>Having shown that H<sub>2</sub>S suppresses HIV-1 reactivation in multiple cell line models of latency, we next studied the ability of GYY4137 to limit virus transcription in primary CD4<bold><sup>+</sup></bold> T cells derived from virally suppressed patients.

On day 28, we stimulated the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells with the protein kinase C (PKC) activator, prostratin, in the absence of any treatment. The activation of viral transcription was measured 24 hr later by RT-qPCR. The removal of ART uniformly resulted in a viral reactivation by prostratin in CD4<bold><sup>+</sup></bold> T cells of HIV1 patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). In contrast, upon ART+GYY4137 removal followed by prostratin stimulation, viral reactivation was attenuated by 90% (N=5, mean) for all five patient samples, and individual inhibition ranged from 78.9% to 100% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Overall, pretreatment with ART+GYY4137 significantly reduced prostratin-mediated HIV-1 reactivation when compared to ART alone (p&lt;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).</p><p>We also examined the immune-phenotype of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells treated with ART or ART+GYY4137 by monitoring the expression of activation (CD38) and quiescence (CD127) marker. As expected, CD38 expression increased, and CD127 expression decreased at days 7 and 14 during the activation phase, followed by a gradual reversal of the pattern during the resting phase at days 21 and 28 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Interestingly, GYY4137 treatment did not alter the temporal changes in the expression of activation and quiescence markers on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–F</xref>). Since memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are preferentially targeted by HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chomont et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brenchley et al., 2004</xref>), we further analyzed if the status of naive (T<sub>N</sub>), central memory (T<sub>CM</sub>), transitional memory (T<sub>TM</sub>), and effector memory (T<sub>EM</sub>) is affected by the GYY4137 in our ex vivo expansion model. We observed that the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that responded to ex vivo activation were mainly composed of T<sub>TM</sub> and T<sub>EM</sub> in our patient samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B-E</xref>). This is consistent with the study reporting the presence of translation-competent genomes mainly in the T<sub>TM</sub> and T<sub>EM</sub> of ART-suppressed individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pardons et al., 2019a</xref>). Interestingly, the fraction of T<sub>TM</sub> shows a progressive decline, whereas T<sub>EM</sub> displays gradual increase during transition from activation (7–14 days) to quiescence phase (21–28 days) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D-E</xref>). The addition of GYY4137 did not affect dynamic changes in the frequency of T<sub>TM</sub> and T<sub>EM</sub> subpopulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D-E</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we tested if the reduction in viral RNA upon GYY4137 treatment is due to the loss of cells with the ability to reactivate virus or selection of cells subset that is non-responsive to reactivating stimuli. We did not find significant differences in total HIV-1 DNA content between the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells immediately isolated from the patient’s PBMCs (ex vivo) and the expanded cells treated with ART+ GYY4137 or ART alone for the entire duration of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). The viability of cells remained comparable between ART+ GYY4137 and ART treatment groups over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Moreover, we observed that prolonged treatment with GYY4137 in combination ART does not abrogate CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell survival and proliferative capacity in the presence of anti-CD3/anti-28 beads or Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) as T cell activation stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A-D</xref>). Additionally, GYY4137 treatment had no adverse effect on antigen (CMVpp65) specific CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells activation and function upon ex vivo stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2E-J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A-B</xref>).</p><p>Altogether, using a range of cellular and immunological assays, we confirmed that the characteristics of an individual’s viral reservoir remain preserved, and the suppression of viral RNA upon GYY4137 treatment is the result of H<sub>2</sub>S-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 transcription rather than a reduction in proviral content or an altered CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets. In sum, prolonged exposure to GYY4137 results in potent inhibition of viral reactivation, suggesting a new H<sub>2</sub>S-based mechanism to neutralize bursts of virus reactivation under suppressive ART in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>GYY4137 prevents mitochondrial dysfunction in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells of HIV-1 patients during viral rebound</title><p>Because virus reactivation upon depletion of CTH-mediated H<sub>2</sub>S generation resulted in mitochondrial dysfunction and redox imbalance in U1, we tested if the elevation of H<sub>2</sub>S levels by GYY4137 improves mitochondrial health and maintain redox homeostasis of primary CD4<bold><sup>+</sup></bold> T cells during virus reactivation ex vivo. As described earlier, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells harboring latent virus upon prolonged (28 days) treatment of ART and ART+GYY4137 were stimulated by prostratin or left unstimulated and subjected to mitochondrial flux analysis. The unstimulated cells from both ART and ART+GYY4147 cultures did not show any difference in OCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). In contrast, several features reflecting efficient mitochondrial activity such as basal respiration and ATP-coupled respiration were significantly higher in prostratin stimulated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in case of ART+GYY4137 treatment than ART alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–C</xref>). Consistent with this, mitoROS generation upon stimulation with prostratin or other LRAs such as PMA/ionomycin was reduced in ART+GYY4137 treated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells than ART alone (p=0.005 and p=0.014), and was nearly comparable to unstimulated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D–E</xref>). The reduction in mitoROS could be a consequence of GYY4137-mediated increase in the expression of Nrf2-dependent antioxidant systems. We directly tested this by RT-qPCR analysis of a selected set of Nrf2-dependent genes on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells treated with GYY4137 for 28 days. Consistent with our findings in U1, treatment with ART+ GYY4137 uniformly induced the expression of antioxidant genes in the latently infected CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells compared to cell treated with ART alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Effect of H<sub>2</sub>S on mitochondrial respiration and ROS generation in latent CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells derived from HIV-1 patients.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Primary human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from HIV-1 infected subjects were activated and cultured ex vivo with ART or ART+GYY4137.

Decreased H<sub>2</sub>S also impaired the expression of genes involved in the maintenance of redox balance, mitochondrial function, inflammation, and HIV-1 restriction, which correlates with reactivation of HIV-1. This conclusion is supported in multiple cell line models of HIV-1 latency. Chemical complementation with GYY4137 identified H<sub>2</sub>S as an effector molecule. Finally, we confirmed the clinical relevance of our finding in primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells isolated from ART-suppressed patients to recapitulate features of HIV-1 latency and reactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kessing et al., 2017</xref>). Overall, our data show that while H<sub>2</sub>S deficiency reactivates HIV-1, the H<sub>2</sub>S donor GYY4137 can potently inhibit residual levels of HIV-1 transcription during suppressive ART and block virus reactivation upon stimulation. Hence, our findings highlight that H<sub>2</sub>S based therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Szabó, 2007</xref>) can be exploited to lock HIV-1 in a state of persistent latency by impairing the ability to reactivate.</p><p>How does H<sub>2</sub>S promote HIV-1 latency and suppress reactivation? Several studies revealed that HIV-1 reactivation is associated with loss of mitochondrial functions, oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tyagi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhaskar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Khan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Badley et al., 2003</xref>). Several of these biological dysfunctions are corrected by H<sub>2</sub>S. For example, localized delivery of H<sub>2</sub>S in physiological concentrations improves mitochondrial respiration, mitigates oxidative stress, and exerts anti-inflammatory functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Tinajero-Trejo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kimura et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Fu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banerjee, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhatia, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Szabo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Szabó, 2007</xref>). Our NanoString findings, XF flux analysis, and redox measurement support a mechanism whereby H<sub>2</sub>S sufficiency promotes sustenance of mitochondrial health and redox homeostasis to control HIV-1 reactivation. Conversely, genetic depletion of endogenous H<sub>2</sub>S promotes HIV-1 reactivation by decelerating OXPHOS, GSH/GSSH imbalance, and elevated mitoROS. It is widely known that reduced OXPHOS leads to accumulation of NADH, which traps flavin mononucleotide (FMN) in the reduced state on respiratory complex I leading to mitoROS generation by incomplete reduction of O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Murphy, 2009</xref>). Also, H<sub>2</sub>S-depletion increased nmOCR, which indicates elevated activities of other ROS producing enzymes such as NADPH oxidase and cyclooxygenases/lipoxygenase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chacko et al., 2014</xref>). All of these metabolic changes are likely contributors of overwhelming ROS and disruption of GSH/GSSG poise in U1-shCTH, resulting in HIV-1 reactivation. In fact, consistent with our findings, oxidative shift in GSH/GSSG poise, deregulated mitochondrial bioenergetics, and ROI has been reported to promote HIV-1 reactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tyagi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhaskar et al., 2015</xref>). The addition of GYY4137 stimulated OXPHOS and blocked HIV-1 reactivation, which is in line with the known ability of H<sub>2</sub>S in sustaining respiration by acting as a substrate of cytochrome C oxidase (CcO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Szabo et al., 2014</xref>). Also, H<sub>2</sub>S can prevent mitochondria-mediated apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hu et al., 2009</xref>), which is crucial for HIV-1 reactivation and infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Khan et al., 2015</xref>). Finally, activation of Nrf2-specific antioxidant pathways upon exposure to GYY4137 agrees with the potential of H<sub>2</sub>S in augmenting the cellular antioxidative defense machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pal et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kimura et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banerjee, 2011</xref>). Importantly, cell lines (U1 and J1.1) modeling HIV-1 latency and PBMCs of individuals that naturally suppress HIV-1 reactivation (long-term non-progressors [LTNPs]) display robust capacities to resist oxidative stress and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhaskar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Cohen et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Our transcription profiling showed a positive correlation between GYY4137-induced H<sub>2</sub>S sufficiency and HIV-1 restriction factors (e.g., YY1, APOBEC3, IRF1, and Nrf2) and negative correlation with HIV-1 trans-activators (e.g., NFKB and FOS), consistent with an interrelationship between cell metabolism and HIV-1 latency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Valle-Casuso et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Castellano et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, a sustained induction of Nrf2-driven cellular antioxidant response is essential for the successful transition between productive and latent HIV-1 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhaskar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Shytaj et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, inhibition of Nrf2 promoted viral transcription and increased ROS generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Shytaj et al., 2020</xref>), whereas its activation reduced HIV-1 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Furuya et al., 2016</xref>). On this basis, we think that H<sub>2</sub>S-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 is partly related to the activation of Nrf2-dependent antioxidant genes. In HIV-1 infection, the suppression of viral reactivation and pro-inflammatory mediator expression was paralleled by the inhibition of NF-κB. Interestingly, H<sub>2</sub>S inhibited activation of NF-κB in several models of inflammatory diseases, including hemorrhagic shock, lung injury, and paramyxovirus infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Li et al., 2015</xref>). Further, recent studies have highlighted the anti-viral and anti-inflammatory role of H<sub>2</sub>S in SARS-CoV-2 infection and envisage the possibility of including H<sub>2</sub>S donors in COVID-19 therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Renieris et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Citi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pozzi et al., 2021</xref>). Similarly to these findings, we found that exposure of U1 with GYY4137 inhibited the NF-κB p65 subunit and reduced its binding to HIV-1 LTR. Currently, no antiretroviral drugs inhibit basal transcription of provirus and blocks reactivation upon therapy (ART) interruption. It has been suggested that epigenetic silencing will be an important prerequisite for persistent latency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lange et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kumar et al., 2015</xref>). Our expression and ChIP-qPCR data suggest that H<sub>2</sub>S could exert its influence on HIV-1 replication machinery via activating YY1- an epigenetic silencer of HIV-1 LTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Coull et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bernhard et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, another gasotransmitter NO modulates YY1 function via S-nitrosylation of its cysteine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bonavida and Baritaki, 2012</xref>), indicating that YY1 is amenable to thiol-based-modifications and raises the possibility of YY1 S-persulfidation by H<sub>2</sub>S as a mechanism to epigenetically reconfigure HIV-1/promoter LTR.</p><p>The inefficiency of current ART in preventing virus rebound after therapy cessation poses a major hurdle to HIV-1 cure. Using a primary cell system that has been successfully used to recapitulate latency and reactivation seen in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kessing et al., 2017</xref>), we confirmed that pretreatment with GYY4137 attenuated viral rebound in primary human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells upon stimulation with prostratin. Collectively, our results suggest that H<sub>2</sub>S reduces HIV-1 transcriptional activity, promotes silencing of its promoter, and reduces its potential for reactivation. The virus-suppressing effects of H<sub>2</sub>S were observed alongside its beneficial consequences on cellular physiology (e.g., mitochondrial function and redox balance). Both mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are major complications associated with long-term exposure to ART and contribute to inflammation and organ damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ibeh and Emeka-Nwabunnia, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hulgan and Gerschenson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Reyskens et al., 2013</xref>). Future studies will investigate if the prolonged treatment with H<sub>2</sub>S donors results in a better outcome due to recruitment of specific repressor and/or epigenetic silencer of HIV-1 LTR without detrimental consequences on cellular physiology. In this context, it is important to carefully calibrate the concentration of H<sub>2</sub>S donors. The higher concentration of H<sub>2</sub>S is associated with toxicity and side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Shen et al., 2015</xref>), whereas lower micro molar concentrations are beneficial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Szabo et al., 2014</xref>). The absorption and metabolism are reasonably well characterized for exogenously administered high doses of H<sub>2</sub>S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Reiffenstein and Roth, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beauchamp et al., 1984</xref>). The sulfide oxidation pathways are involved in the oxidation of excess H<sub>2</sub>S to thiosulfate and sulfate, which are cleared from the body via the urine in free or conjugated form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kage et al., 1997</xref>). These observations will be important for exploring future possibilities to use H<sub>2</sub>S donors in clinical settings. Importantly, several H<sub>2</sub>S donors are currently being tested in phase 2 and phase 3 human clinical trials for other indications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wallace et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Polhemus et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Blocking HIV-1 rebound by inhibitors of viral factors (e.g., Tat) invariably results in the emergence of resistant mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mousseau et al., 2019</xref>). In this context, blocking HIV-1 rebounds via H2S-directed modulation of host pathways could help in overcoming the problem of evolution of escape variants. In conclusion, we identify H<sub>2</sub>S as a central factor in HIV-1 reactivation. Our systematic mechanistic dissection of the role of H<sub>2</sub>S in cellular bioenergetics, redox metabolism, and latency unifies many previous phenomena associated with viral persistence.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

First, we examined the differential expression of enzymes involved in H<sub>2</sub>S biogenesis and levels of H<sub>2</sub>S upon HIV-1 latency and reactivation. Next, we genetically silenced the expression of the main H<sub>2</sub>S producing gene CTH and showed its importance in maintaining HIV-1 latency. We performed detailed mechanistic studies on understanding the role of CTH in regulating cellular antioxidant response, mitochondrial respiration, ROS generation to maintain HIV-1 latency. Finally, pharmacological donor of H<sub>2</sub>S (GYY4137) was used to reliably increase endogenous H<sub>2</sub>S levels and to study its consequence on HIV-1 latency and rebound. Primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells derived from ART-treated HIV-1 infected patients were used to assess the effect of GYY4137 in modulating HIV-1 rebound by improving mitochondrial bioenergetics and mitigating redox stress.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Mammalian cell lines and culture conditions</title><p>The human pro-monocytic cell line U937, CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytic cell line Jurkat, HEK293T were procured from ATCC, Manassas, VA.

Briefly, 10<sup>7</sup> U1 cells were pre-treated with GYY4137 (5 mM) for 6 hr or left untreated and then stimulated with PMA (30 ng/ml) for 4 hr. Cells were fixed using 1% formaldehyde, neutralized with glycine, and harvested in ice-cold PBS. Cells were lysed and nuclei were sheared by sonication using Bioruptor Pico (Diagenode Inc) to obtain DNA fragments of 200–500 nucleotides. The clarified lysates were immunoprecipitated using ChIP-grade anti-NF-κB p65 (CST-6956) or anti-YY1 (CST-63227), or normal rabbit IgG (as a negative control) for overnight at 4°C followed by incubation with ChIP-grade protein G magnetic beads at 4°C for 4 hr. Chromatin was eluted from protein G beads, reverse-cross linked, and DNA was column purified. Quantitative genomic PCR was done by SYBR green-based real-time PCR using primers spanning the ER, RBE I, and RBE III regions on HIV-1 LTR. The GAPDH gene was used as the reference gene to see non-specific binding. Total input (10%) was used to normalize equal amount of chromatin taken across the samples. The relative proportion of co-immunoprecipitated DNA fragments were determined with the help of threshold cycle (C<sub>T</sub>) values for each qPCR product using the equation (100×2<sup>[CT(input-3.32)- CT(IP)]</sup>). The data obtained were represented as fold enrichment normalized to IgG background for each IP reaction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Subject samples</title><p>PBMCs were collected from five HIV-1 seropositive subjects on stable suppressive ART and three healthy HIV-seronegative donors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1e</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, including Frank Kirchhoff as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor.</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that your work will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic> in the present form.</p><p>We feel that your manuscript is well performed and contains interesting data from a basic research perspective. However, as an inhibitor of HIV reactivation, H2S donors would provide clinical utility if these are more effective and safer than ART. Adding an H2S donor during ART does not really seem to be particularly useful due to viral rebound after treatment interruption. It seems that GYY4137 works essentially as a NFkB inhibitor to suppress reactivation of HIV, which also raises concerns about side-effects. Altogether, we found your findings interesting but better suitable for a more specialized journal.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is best known for it smell of rotten eggs and its high toxicity due to interference with oxygen transport. Recent studies suggest, however, that H2S is involved in various physiological and pathological processes and might exert beneficial therapeutic effects at very low doses. Thus, H2S-releasing compounds are considered for the treatment of e.g. cardiovascular diseases. In the present study, Pal et al. report that H2S also plays an important role in reactivation of HIV from latency. The first show that HIV reactivation reduces the levels of endogenous H2S in cell lines. They further show that suppression of the H2S producing enzyme CTH enhances HIV reactivation and modulates the expression of cellular genes associated with apoptosis and mitochondrial function. The authors also provide evidence that endogenous production of H2S or release from small molecule H2S donors allows U1 and Jurkat cells to maintain normal redox homeostasis and mitochondrial bioenergetics and suggest that this promotes HIV-1 latency. Finally, they provide evidence that the H2S donor GYY4137 modulates Nrf2, NF-κB, and YY1 pathways and suppresses HIV reactivation in latently infected T cells from HIV-infected individuals. The study addresses an important topic from a different angle. It is comprehensive and provides insights into the mechanisms underlying the effect of H2S on HIV latency. In addition, the impact of H2S donors on reactivation of HIV is of significant interest. Limitations of the study are that potential risks and problems associated with H2S as therapeutic agent are not addressed. H2S is highly toxic; thus, dosage will be a major challenge. Treatment would not only affect cells harboring latent HIV but all cells and the H2S-mediated mechanisms proposed to suppress HIV reactivation, such as inhibition of NF-κB and altered metabolism, would be expected to cause side-effects. Finally, the authors propose to combine H2S donors with ART to suppress HIV reactivation. However, effective ART usually prevents viral replication with high efficiency. Thus, rebound after treatment interruption (and not under ART) is the problem. In the end, a functional cure only makes sense if it doesn't need to be combined with ART and does not require daily treatment.</p><p>1. Problems of dosing and side-effects of H2S donors should be critically discussed. The advantage of combining an H2S donor with ART did not become clear to me since the latter very reliably prevents viral replication.</p><p>2. The study is comprehensive and it is appreciated that the authors analyzed the impact of an H2S donor in primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. However, all mechanistic data were obtained in cell lines that may not faithfully represent the status of latently HIV infected cells in vivo. Ideally, some key finding should be confirmed in primary cells. Otherwise this limitation should be mentioned. Similarly, the cell line used harbor copies of T cell line adapted HIV-1 strains that may differ from proviruses representing the latent HIV reservoirs in vivo.</p><p>3.

Your letter of appeal has been considered by a Senior Editor and a Reviewing editor, and we are prepared to consider a revised submission with no guarantees of acceptance.</p><p>Upon careful consideration of your letter and after discussion with reviewers, we have the following recommendations.</p><p>We recognize that there are several strong aspects of the work presented in your manuscript however, the possible clinical implications of the work are overstated. In addition, further clarification is required in terms of the molecular mechanism proposed. We are willing to consider a revised manuscript based on the following provisors:</p><p>1. Regarding the conclusion that the reactivation of HIV-2 associated with CTH knockdown must be due to an absence of H2S: This conclusion is problematic as CTH has other functions as well. In addition, other proteins can produce H2S. The addition of H2S in the form of GYY4137, and associated inhibition of HIV-1 reactivation, does not bring further clarity as the concentrations of H2S used are much higher than anything the cells could produce by themselves. As CTH catalyses the last step in the trans-sulfuration pathway from methionine to cysteine, an important experiment would be to demonstrate that CHT KO is specific for H2S production and does not affect cysteine levels. Also demonstrating that cysteine deprivation does not lead to HIV-1 reactivation due to a generalised stress response would be important.</p><p>2. Cell cultures produce so little H2S that it cannot be measured. As such, in the experiments, addition of GYY4137 produce completely unphysiological H2S concentrations. Given that protein sulfurylation affects thousands of proteins, the addition of GYY4137 is not a biologically relevant reproduction of the presence of CTH, as the experimental system may be associated proteome-wide activity changes. H2S donors are mostly considered for cancer and anti-inflammatory treatments, because they seem to be immunosuppressive. To translate these findings towards clinical relevance for a cure of latent HIV-1 infection, you would have to show that lack of reactivation is not associated with a lack of T cell response. For example, you could demonstrate that T cells, after being cultured in GYY4137 containing medium, still respond to anti-CD3 stimulation with IL-2 secretion or CD25 upregulation. A better assay would be that the extended presence of GYY4137 does not abrogate the ability of T cells to proliferate upon antigen recognition (CMV pp65 should be a good antigen in combination with CFSE stains).</p><p>3. Clinical Relevance: Unless GYY4137 produces a &quot;lock&quot; state of latent HIV-1 infection events, or selectively kills latently HIV-1 infected T cells, there is no clinical relevance for a cure. No one will exchange ART for an immuno-suppressive experimental treatment, that already in vitro is not sufficiently potent to completely block reactivation. We suggest you remove any focus in the discussion on possible clinical implications and approach presenting this study from a fundamental research perspective as you do have some compelling findings.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.68487.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: The authors appealed the original decision.

We appropriately discussed dosing and the side effects of H<sub>2</sub>S donors in the revised manuscript (Line no. 619, page no. 25 in the revised manuscript). The higher concentration of H<sub>2</sub>S is associated with toxicity and side effects (2), whereas lower micro molar concentrations are beneficial (3). The absorption and metabolism are reasonably well characterized for exogenously administered high doses of H<sub>2</sub>S (4,5). The sulfide oxidation pathways is involved in oxidation of excess H<sub>2</sub>S to thiosulphate and sulphate, which are cleared from the body via the urine in free or conjugated form (6). We assessed cytotoxicity of H<sub>2</sub>S donor (GYY4137) in all cell lines and primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell model and selected non-toxic concentrations of GYY4137 to perform assays. As suggested by the editors, we have toned down the clinical potential of H<sub>2</sub>S donor in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The study is comprehensive and it is appreciated that the authors analyzed the impact of an H2S donor in primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. However, all mechanistic data were obtained in cell lines that may not faithfully represent the status of latently HIV infected cells in vivo. Ideally, some key finding should be confirmed in primary cells. Otherwise this limitation should be mentioned. Similarly, the cell line used harbor copies of T cell line adapted HIV-1 strains that may differ from proviruses representing the latent HIV reservoirs in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s concern. For the reasons outlined by the reviewer, we examined the effect of GYY4137 on the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells derived from latent HIV-1 infected patients. Consistent with the cell line data, GYY4137 maintains mitochondrial bioenergetics (OXPHOS), suppresses mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), and induces the expression of the Nrf2-dependent antioxidant genes (Figure 6 and 7 in the revised manuscript). In the revised manuscript, we further extended these observations and showed that the effect of GYY4137 is not due to the impaired CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells activation (Figure 6—figure supplement 2A-J in the revised manuscript).</p><p>To further allay the reviewer’s concern, we isolated primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from healthy donors and assessed the influence of GYY4137 on viral replication.

Consistent with U1 and J1.1, genetic silencing of CTH using CTH-specific shRNA (shCTH) reactivated HIV-1 in J-Lat (Figure 2—figure supplement 1F-G in the revised manuscript). Supporting this, pre-treatment of J-Lat with non-toxic concentrations of a well-established CTH inhibitor, propargylglycine (PAG) further stimulated PMA-induced HIV-1 reactivation (Figure 2—figure supplement 1H-I in the revised manuscript).

CBS, CTH, and MPST produce H<sub>2</sub>S in the sulfur network. CBS and CTH reside in the cytoplasm, whereas MPST is mainly involved in cysteine catabolism and is mitochondrial localized. The lack of compensation of CTH by MPST could be due to the compartmentalization of their activities. Furthermore, CTH and CBS activities are regulated by diverse metabolites, including heme, S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), and nitric oxide/carbon monoxide (NO/CO). In contrast, MPST activity responds to cysteine availability. How substrates/cofactors availability and enzyme choices are regulated in the cellular milieu of J1.1 and U1 is an interesting question for future experimentation.</p><p>Moreover, the tissue-specific expression/activity of CBS and CTH dictates their relative contributions in H<sub>2</sub>S biogenesis and cellular physiology (13). Some of these factors are likely responsible for differential expression of CBS, CTH, and MPST in J1.1 and U1 cells. Regardless of these concerns, viral reactivation uniformly reduces the expression of CTH in U1, J1.1, and J-Lat.

The p24 ELISA detected a similar kinetics of p24 increase in the cell supernatant (Figure 2E in the revised manuscript). The CTH levels show reduction at 24 h and 36 h. Based on these data, we report that HIV-1 reactivation is associated with diminished biogenesis of endogenous H<sub>2</sub>S. We have not made any claims that depletion of CTH precedes HIV reactivation. However, our CTH knockdown data clearly showed that diminished expression of CTH reactivates HIV-1 in the absence of PMA, which is consistent with our hypothesis that H<sub>2</sub>S production is likely to be a critical host component for maintaining viral latency.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2F.

Genetic silencing of CTH resulted in elevated mitochondrial ROS and GSH imbalance, which is in line with a further decrease in the expression of oxidative stress responsive genes as compared to PMA alone.

Treatment with GYY4137 suppressed HIV reactivation in multiple cell lines and primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. As suggested by the reviewer, overexpression of CTH could be another strategy to validate these findings. However, since the transsulfuration pathway and active methyl cycle are interconnected and share metabolic intermediates (e.g., homocysteine), overexpression of CTH could disturb this balance and may lead to metabolic paralysis. Owing to these potential limitations, we used a slow releasing H<sub>2</sub>S donor (GYY4137) to chemically complement CTH deficiency during HIV reactivation.

The suppressive effect of GYY4137 at the lower concentration is intriguing but consistent with the findings that high and low concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>S have profound and distinct effects on cellular physiology (3,17). One possibility is that the high concentration of H<sub>2</sub>S induces mitochondrial sulfide oxidation pathway to avert toxicity. This might modulate mitochondrial activity and ROS, resulting in the suppression of GYY4137 effect. Consistent with this, higher concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>S have been shown to cause pro-oxidant effects, DNA damage and genotoxicity (3,18).

The addition of GYY4137 chemically compensated for the diminished expression of CTH, and prevented HIV-1 reactivation in U1-shCTH. These events are expected to suppress HIV-1 replication and reactivation.

We have incorporated these findings in the revised manuscript (line no. 215, page no. 9 and line no. 375, page no. 15 in the revised manuscript). Given that CBS and CTH catalyzed at least eight H<sub>2</sub>S generating steps and two cysteine-producing reactions, the modulation of CTH by HIV is likely to have a widespread influence on transsulfuration pathway and active methyl cycle intermediates. Our future strategies are to generate a comprehensive understanding of sulfur metabolism underlying HIV latency and reactivation. These experiments require multiple biochemical and genetic technologies with appropriate controls.

Further, we carried in-depth investigation to show that the effect of GYY4137 is not due to impaired activation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p><p>Lastly, since CTH catalyzed multiple reactions during H<sub>2</sub>S production, we cannot rule out the effect of other metabolites in this process. However, we think that this is outside the scope of the present study. Our study focuses on understanding of how H<sub>2</sub>S modulates redox, mitochondrial bioenergetics, and gene expression in the context of HIV latency. These understandings are likely to positively impact future studies exploring the role of H<sub>2</sub>S on HIV cure.</p><p>References:</p><p>1. Zhu, J., Berisa, M., Schwörer, S., Qin, W., Cross, J.

In addition, further clarification is required in terms of the molecular mechanism proposed. We are willing to consider a revised manuscript based on the following provisors:</p><p>1. Regarding the conclusion that the reactivation of HIV-2 associated with CTH knockdown must be due to an absence of H2S: This conclusion is problematic as CTH has other functions as well. In addition, other proteins can produce H2S. The addition of H2S in the form of GYY4137, and associated inhibition of HIV-1 reactivation, does not bring further clarity as the concentrations of H2S used are much higher than anything the cells could produce by themselves. As CTH catalyses the last step in the trans-sulfuration pathway from methionine to cysteine, an important experiment would be to demonstrate that CHT KO is specific for H2S production and does not affect cysteine levels. Also demonstrating that cysteine deprivation does not lead to HIV-1 reactivation due to a generalised stress response would be important.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the editors for raising these concerns. To address these comments, we measured cysteine levels in cell lysates of CTH knock down U1 cells (U1-shCTH) and compared it with the control cells (U1-shNT). The cysteine levels remain comparable in the lysates derived from both the cell lines, suggesting that CTH depletion does not affect cysteine levels (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C in the revised manuscript). The data also indicate that other routes for cysteine biosynthesis (e.g., de novo and assimilatory pathways) likely compensate for CTH depletion in U1 cells. As suggested by the reviewer, we next assessed if cysteine deprivation reactivates HIV. To deprive cells for cysteine, we used RPMI medium lacking cysteine and supplemented with dialyzed FBS (Gibcoä Cat# 26400044, see Materials and methods) as per the published protocol (1). The U1 cells were cultured in complete RPMI medium or cysteine-free RPMI medium and <italic>gag</italic> transcript was measured at 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h. The expression of <italic>gag</italic> transcript was not significantly affected upon cysteine depletion, suggesting that HIV reactivation is not stimulated by deprivation of cysteine (Figure 2—figure supplement 1D in the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Cell cultures produce so little H2S that it cannot be measured. As such, in the experiments, addition of GYY4137 produce completely unphysiological H2S concentrations. Given that protein sulfurylation affects thousands of proteins, the addition of GYY4137 is not a biologically relevant reproduction of the presence of CTH, as the experimental system may be associated proteome-wide activity changes. H2S donors are mostly considered for cancer and anti-inflammatory treatments, because they seem to be immunosuppressive. To translate these findings towards clinical relevance for a cure of latent HIV-1 infection, you would have to show that lack of reactivation is not associated with a lack of T cell response. For example, you could demonstrate that T cells, after being cultured in GYY4137 containing medium, still respond to anti-CD3 stimulation with IL-2 secretion or CD25 upregulation. A better assay would be that the extended presence of GYY4137 does not abrogate the ability of T cells to proliferate upon antigen recognition (CMV pp65 should be a good antigen in combination with CFSE stains).</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent recommendation. Accordingly, we cultured PHA/IL-2 expanded CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell lines for 14 days in presence of ART or ART in combination with 100 μM GYY4137. Cells were then labelled with 0.5 μM cell trace violet (CTV) and stimulated with either CMV, anti-CD3/anti-CD28 beads (at a bead: cell ratio of 1:0.25) or Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB;100 ng/ml). After three days, IL-2 (20 U/ml) supplemented medium was added to the cells and cultured for another two days. Proliferation was measured by CTV dilution and CD25 expression using flow cytometry after 5 days of culture (Figure 6—figure supplement 2A-D in the revised manuscript). We included activation with SEB, as it is a known superantigen that can trigger polyclonal T cell activation by binding to the T cell receptor at the variable region of the β-chain (relevant to our system). Hence, in these long-term polyclonal cultures where frequencies of T cells specific to any given antigen e.g., CMV may hugely vary between samples or CMV-specific cells may not be detected as shown by our data, we chose to more directly test CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell survival and proliferative capacity using SEB and CD3/28 beads as stimuli. The data demonstrate that long-term culture of cells in the presence of GYY4137 does not reduce or interfere with the capacity of the cells to respond to activation by CD3/28 or in response to SEB (Figure 6—figure supplement 2A-D in the revised manuscript).</p><p>To extend the suggestion of the reviewer further, we conducted another series of experiments to test the impact of GYY4137 in a more physiologically relevant short term T cell activation assay. Here PBMCs from HIV+ ART-treated patients were incubated with ART or ART in combination with 100 μM GYY4137 for 18 hr. Cells were analyzed for surface expression of CD25 and CD69 and intracellular staining of IFNγ by flow cytometry. The comprehensive gating strategy and representative flow cytometry plots are depicted in Figure 6—figure supplement 3A-3B of the revised manuscript. The data generated demonstrate no difference between GYY4137-treated versus untreated cultures in terms of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response to CMV peptide stimulation as measured by IFNγ expression or in the capacity of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to express CD25 or CD69 in response to either CD3/28 or CMV stimulation (Figure 6—figure supplement 2E-J in the revised manuscript). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell function in both short-term and long-term cultures is preserved in the presence of GYY4137.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Clinical Relevance: Unless GYY4137 produces a &quot;lock&quot; state of latent HIV-1 infection events, or selectively kills latently HIV-1 infected T cells, there is no clinical relevance for a cure. No one will exchange ART for an immuno-suppressive experimental treatment, that already in vitro is not sufficiently potent to completely block reactivation. We suggest you remove any focus in the discussion on possible clinical implications and approach presenting this study from a fundamental research perspective as you do have some compelling findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer. We have removed the statement indicating possible clinical implications of these findings.</p></body></sub-article></article>
