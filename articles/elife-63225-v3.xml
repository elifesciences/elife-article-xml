Here, we functionally characterize neural circuitry in the fruit fly, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, that conveys polarized light signals from the eye to the central complex, a brain region essential for the fly’s sense of direction. Neurons tuned to the angle of polarization of ultraviolet light are found throughout the anterior visual pathway, connecting the optic lobes with the central complex via the anterior optic tubercle and bulb, in a homologous organization to the ‘sky compass’ pathways described in other insects. We detail how a consistent, map-like organization of neural tunings in the peripheral visual system is transformed into a reduced representation suited to flexible processing in the central brain. This study identifies computational motifs of the transformation, enabling mechanistic comparisons of multisensory integration and central processing for navigation in the brains of insects.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>vision</kwd><kwd>central complex</kwd><kwd>navigation</kwd><kwd>polarized light</kwd><kwd>two-photon calcium imaging</kwd><kwd>circuits</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-NS096290</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hartenstein</surname><given-names>Volker</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-EY026031</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Frye</surname><given-names>Mark A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Circuit tracing and in vivo calcium imaging reveals neurons conveying polarized light information from photoreceptors to the central brain, transforming patterns in the sky into a directional cue for navigation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A critical challenge of active locomotion is knowing the right way to go. Sensorimotor reflexes can influence momentary changes in direction to hold a course or to avoid looming threats, but goal-directed behaviors, such as returning to a previous location from unfamiliar surroundings, require additional information and processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Braitenberg, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gomez-Marin et al., 2010</xref>). External sensory cues must be transformed into an internal representation of position and orientation within the environment, which can also be modified by past experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Collett and Collett, 2002</xref>). In Dipteran flies, as in other invertebrates, a collection of neuropils known as the central complex (CX) is believed to coordinate such behaviors and plays a role in spatial memory, object memory, and action selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Giraldo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Neuser et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ofstad et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Strausfeld and Hirth, 2013</xref>), in addition to homeostatic processes including hunger and sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Donlea et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dus et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Liu et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> have revealed that activity in a network of CX neurons encodes and maintains a representation of the animal’s angular heading relative to its environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Seelig and Jayaraman, 2015</xref>), with similarity to head-direction cells in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Taube et al., 1990</xref>). This neural representation of heading can be updated by internal, proprioceptive estimates of self-motion during locomotion, and by external cues, such as moving visual patterns and directional airflow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fisher et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Green et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Okubo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Shiozaki et al., 2020</xref>). In other insects, including locusts, crickets, bees, butterflies, and beetles, the functional organization of the CX has frequently been studied in the context of navigation via celestial cues, particularly polarized light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Heinze, 2014</xref>). The nearly ever-present pattern of polarization in the sky, formed by scattering of light in the atmosphere, offers an indicator of orientation to organisms able to detect and interpret it, and may be more stable than terrestrial landmarks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cronin and Marshall, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dacke et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Horváth and Varju, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mappes and Homberg, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Frisch, 1949</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Wehner and Müller, 2006</xref>). In these non-Dipteran insects, a multimodal neural circuit transmits polarization signals from the eyes to the central complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">el Jundi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">el Jundi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Heinze, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Heinze and Reppert, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Homberg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pfeiffer et al., 2005</xref>). This circuit is known as the ‘sky compass’ pathway for its proposed role in processing skylight polarization patterns and information about the position of the sun to bestow an animal with a sense of direction. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the anterior visual pathway (AVP), which comprises neurons connecting the medulla, anterior optic tubercle, bulb, and ellipsoid body, has been postulated to represent the homologue of the sky compass pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Omoto et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Timaeus et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Warren et al., 2019</xref>). Visual processing in the AVP appears to be segregated into three topographically organized, parallel streams, of which two have been shown to encode distinct small-field, unpolarized stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Omoto et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Seelig and Jayaraman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Shiozaki and Kazama, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Sun et al., 2017</xref>). The neurons involved in polarization processing in <italic>Drosophila</italic> have not been identified beyond peripheral circuits of the dorsal rim area, a specialized region of the eye for detecting skylight polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fortini and Rubin, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Wada, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Weir et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Weir and Dickinson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Wernet et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Wolf et al., 1980</xref>).</p><p>A detailed mapping of the relevant polarization-sensitive neurons would allow the exquisite genetic tools and connectomic studies available in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Scheffer et al., 2020</xref>) to be leveraged to understand the workings of the CX and its integration of multiple sensory modalities. Behavioral experiments have demonstrated that <italic>Drosophila</italic> orient relative to polarization patterns while walking and in tethered-flight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mathejczyk and Wernet, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Stephens et al., 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Warren et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Weir and Dickinson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Wernet et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Wolf et al., 1980</xref>). A comparative approach would therefore provide insight into the processing strategies employed across taxa as well as species-specific adaptations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Honkanen et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, it may be possible to reconcile the existing evidence of a common, fixed representation of polarization patterns in the CX of non-Dipteran insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Heinze and Homberg, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Heinze and Reppert, 2011</xref>) with the emerging model of a flexible representation of both visual information and heading direction in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> CX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fisher et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Seelig and Jayaraman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Turner-Evans et al., 2020</xref>). Alternatively, fundamental differences in the organization and processing of polarized light signals between species may reflect specialized navigational requirements.</p><p>Here, we set out to test the hypothesis that the anterior visual pathway conveys polarized light signals from the eye to the central complex in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. We used neurogenetic tracing techniques and in vivo calcium imaging to characterize the organization of the neurons at each stage and their coding and transformation of visual features. We show that parallel circuitry in the medulla conducts polarization signals from photoreceptors in the dorsal rim area to a stereotyped domain of the anterior optic tubercle. From there, a postsynaptic population of neurons projecting to the anterior bulb relays polarization signals to ring neurons of the ellipsoid body, and in turn, the ‘compass neurons’ of the central complex. The superior bulb multiplexes polarized and unpolarized light signals, while the inferior bulb does not appear to be involved in polarization processing. Finally, we examine population responses in the central complex and find hallmarks of a flexible encoding of a single angle of polarization which could be used to direct motor output for navigation behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Polarization processing in the medulla dorsal rim area</title><p>In flies, the pair of inner photoreceptors in each ommatidium, R7/R8, are involved in the detection of color and linear polarization of light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hardie, 1984</xref>). Within a narrow strip of skyward-facing ommatidia in each eye, known as the dorsal rim area (DRA), each R7/R8 pair is sensitive to a different angle of polarization (AoP, also referred to as the e-vector orientation), organized in a 'polarotopic' fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This specialized array of polarization detectors covers the complete 180° range of orientations and, with a peak spectral sensitivity to UV light, is well-suited to sensing the patterns of polarized light in the sky (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Feiler et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Salcedo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sharkey et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Weir et al., 2016</xref>).

Two types of these interneurons have been anatomically characterized, DmDRA1 and DmDRA2. Individual DmDRA1 neurons span approximately 10 MEDRA columns and receive input exclusively from DRA R7 photoreceptors while avoiding input from non-DRA columns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sancer et al., 2019</xref>). DmDRA2 receives exclusive input from DRA R8 photoreceptors. Due to their contact with polarization-sensitive photoreceptors, both DmDRA subtypes are thought likely to respond to polarized light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sancer et al., 2019</xref>). To test this, we generated a split-Gal4 driver (R13E04-p65.AD, VT059781-Gal4.DBD) for a population of DmDRA neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Courgeon and Desplan, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Jenett et al., 2012</xref>). To identify which subtype expressed this driver, we co-labeled it with an established Dm8 driver (R24F06-LexA) which is known to be expressed in DmDRA1 and not DmDRA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sancer et al., 2019</xref>). We found highly overlapping expression between these drivers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B’</xref>), indicating that the split-Gal4 is predominantly expressed in DmDRA1. We confirmed that DmDRA neurons in the split-Gal4 were also in close proximity to photoreceptor terminals in the MEDRA, and found clear overlap with the proximal tip of each DRA R7/R8 pair, providing further evidence of exclusive contact with DRA R7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B’’</xref>). Hereafter, we refer to this driver as the DmDRA1-split.</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-2"><title>DmDRA1 responses to polarized light</title><p>After validating a polarized light stimulus by confirming the previously characterized response properties of DRA R7/R8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Weir et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-F</xref>, see Materials and methods), we recorded presynaptic calcium signals in the DmDRA1-split using GCaMP6s localized to synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cohn et al., 2015</xref>) while presenting different angles of polarization (AoP) to the dorsal rim (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-F</xref>). We found that the activity of DmDRA1 neurons varied with the AoP presented and followed an approximately sinusoidal response profile typical of polarization-sensitive neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Heinze, 2013</xref>).</p><p>To quantify the extent to which the neurons were modulated by the AoP, we calculated a polarization-selectivity index (PSI) by comparing the peak response with the response at orthogonal angles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We used absolute fluorescence intensity values to calculate PSI, rather than normalized ΔF/F values (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1–figure 1</xref> for polarization tuning curves using activity normalized to baseline), and found the difference between preferred and anti-preferred responses divided by their sum. This facilitated comparison across neurons with different baseline activity levels and differs from the polarization-sensitivity (PS) metric used in previous studies, which could result in negative values or, in the case of low baseline activity, very large values. PSI values had a minimum possible value of 0, indicating equal responses to all angles presented, and a maximum of possible value of 1, indicating maximum response to two diametrically opposite angles with zero activity at their two respective orthogonal angles. Among DmDRA1 neurons, we found high PSI values throughout the population with an average of 0.74, while background regions in each recording contained an average PSI of 0.20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1–table 1</xref>).</p><p>To verify that the neurons were modulated by the changing AoP and not any other unintended consequence of rotating the stimulus device, we repeated the experiment without the linear polarizer attached to the device. With the polarizer removed, all neurons were suppressed at the initial onset of unpolarized UV light and were no longer modulated by the rotation of the device (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We then calculated the difference in PSI values between experiments performed with and without the polarizer, which we refer to as ΔPSI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). With the polarizer removed, PSI values in DmDRA1 neurons fell by approximately 80% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>), reflecting their lack of modulation and resulting in an average ΔPSI of 0.59, whereas PSI values in the background showed no change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), resulting in an average ΔPSI of 0.</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-3"><title>DmDRA1 polarotopy in the MEDRA</title><p>Within the population of DmDRA1 neurons, we observed preferential responses to different angles of polarized light depending on their position in the MEDRA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,G</xref>). The preferred AoP showed a linear relationship with position, which we refer to as polarotopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Moving anterior to posterior in the right optic lobe, the preferred AoP shifted counter-clockwise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>). This polarotopy was mirrored in the left optic lobe, with a similar range of preferred AoPs represented in the opposite posterior-anterior direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I</xref>). Throughout the MEDRA, the preferred AoPs of DmDRA1 neurons closely matched those of R8 photoreceptors at similar positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Since R7/R8 are likely inhibitory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gao et al., 2008</xref>), we expected that the preferred AoP of a neuron postsynaptic to either R7 or R8 would be shifted by 90°. We therefore posit that it is R7 signals that are responsible for the predominant response characteristics of DmDRA1 neurons, consistent with the anatomical overlap between DmDRA1 and R7 terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B’’</xref>) and the established connectivity of the DmDRA1 subtype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sancer et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-4"><title>Polarization-opponency in DmDRA1 neurons</title><p>We then asked whether DmDRA1 responses demonstrate polarization opponency, with activity increases at preferred angles and inhibition at anti-preferred angles. This would likely require antagonistic processing of local, orthogonally tuned R7 and R8 signals in the MEDRA. Although DmDRA1 does not contact R8, inhibitory interactions between R7/R8 in each column suggest that direct input from R8 may not be necessary to influence activity in DmDRA1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Schnaitmann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Weir et al., 2016</xref>). To explore opponent DmDRA1 responses, we employed brief flashes of polarized light at orthogonal angles. We first identified anterior regions in the MEDRA where the preferred AoP of DmDRA1 was found to be around 0° in the previous tuning experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) and generated ROIs around pixels with similar preferred AoPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We then measured the responses of each ROI to flashes of UV light with 0° and 90° AoP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The preferred AoP of 0° caused an increase in activity relative to baseline, while flashes at 90° caused a decrease of greater magnitude, followed by a slight rebound above baseline after the offset of the flash (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). For light flashes with the polarizer removed we observed inhibition of DmDRA1 at all regions, regardless of position in the MEDRA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Further to this, the normalized tuning curves of DmDRA1 responses demonstrated inhibition over most of the range of angles presented and above-baseline activity for a narrower range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1–figure 1A</xref>). Taken together, these results support a model of polarization-opponent processing, whereby DmDRA1 neurons are inhibited by anti-preferred angles of polarization and by unpolarized light, and ‘excited’ by preferred angles of polarization. This excitation is likely to be a release from R7-mediated inhibition, with R7 and DmDRA1 tuned to orthogonal angles of polarization.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Medulla projection neurons conveying polarization signals from the MEDRA to the AOTU</title><p>In other insect species, polarization-sensitive photoreceptors in the dorsal rim are thought to provide input to transmedulla neurons (also referred to as line-tangential neurons), which project from the optic lobe to the anterior optic tubercle (AOTU) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">el Jundi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Homberg et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Immonen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pfeiffer and Kinoshita, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Zeller et al., 2015</xref>).

To assess this, we examined pixels with above-threshold PSI values (greater than the mean background value + 1 SD, see Materials and methods), which limited the analysis to polarization-sensitive MeTu terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). Across animals, both populations showed a predominant polarotopic organization which matched our prediction: from ventral to dorsal in the right AOTU, the preferred AoP shifted counter-clockwise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>). This polarotopy is consistent with MeTu neurons receiving polarized light responses from either DmDRA1 or DRA R7 in the MEDRA and conveying them to the AOTU with the positional mapping we identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>). Consistent with this mapping, we observed no clear relationship between preferred AoP and horizontal position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). However, we observed vertical organizations of responses which deviated from the norm in approximately 20% of experiments across both drivers. The most common of these resembled an inverted form of the predominant polarotopy (from ventral to dorsal in the right AOTU, the preferred AoP rotated clockwise) and also typically contained tunings to a different range of AoPs than the predominant organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E,E’</xref>). Although we could not determine why one organization was observed over another, this finding suggests that a further transformation of MeTu responses may take place. However, a reversed mapping of responses could be achieved by combining signals originating from the contralateral eye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G,H</xref>), which we explore in the following section.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2-4"><title>Multiple visual features encoded in the AOTU</title><p>We wondered whether functional divisions of MeTu responses exist within the AOTU which could contain, for example, spatially segregated responses to unpolarized visual features, such as narrow vertical bars shown to stimulate downstream neurons.

We then explored the spatial distribution of polarization- and bar-sensitive regions within the AOTU by constructing combined activity maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, right).

We then compared the average PSI value of the brightest pixels in the BUs with their average value in control experiments with the polarizer removed, and repeated this procedure with the brightest pixels in the BUa as a reference. Among active pixels in both the BUs and BUa we found a significant effect of the polarizer on PSI values versus controls, with the effect size larger in the latter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). In sum, we found polarized light responses in TuBu neuron output micro-glomeruli in both the superior and anterior bulb, and no appreciable responses to polarized light in TuBu neuron outputs in the inferior bulb.

We observed that a cluster of micro-glomeruli toward the medial edge of the superior bulb tended to show preferential responses to similar angles of polarization (AoP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, bottom). When we examined the distribution of preferred AoPs in the BUs we found a non-uniform distribution with the highest frequency of preferred AoPs around −45° in the left bulb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>) and +45° in the right bulb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F’</xref>). Conversely, in the anterior bulb (BUa) on both sides we found an approximately uniform representation of preferred AoPs in TuBu<sub>a</sub> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G,G’</xref>). Preferential responses to certain AoPs therefore appear to be more common than others in the BUs. We expected that a uniform representation of the full range of polarization space would be necessary for decoding heading direction from skylight polarization patterns. The over-representation of certain AoPs in BUs micro-glomeruli resembles a detector for a particular feature, such as horizontally polarized reflections from the surface of water, rather than the main input to a system for polarized light-based navigation.</p><p>Without further investigation of the downstream circuitry in the central complex that processes these polarized light inputs from the bulb, our interpretations of possible functional roles are somewhat speculative. For the neuron populations examined here, our light microscopy images and the hemibrain connectome data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Scheffer et al., 2020</xref>) show that each TuBu neuron (BU input) connects exclusively with one ring neuron (BU output), suggesting that the distribution of preferred AoPs in the TuBu populations should be homogeneously sampled by populations of postsynaptic ring neurons. However, due to the physical shape of the bulb and the organization of micro-glomeruli within it, combined with the relatively low resolution of our functional imaging experiments, we could not ascertain whether all TuBu neurons were individually separable and their spatial locations accurately captured within the imaging volume, and these issues could have affected the uniformity of the distributions that we observed. Nevertheless, we found no clear linear organization of preferred AoPs in either the BUs or the BUa, a marked contrast to the consistent, linear organization in TuBu dendrites in the AOTU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H,I</xref>). Circular, rather than linear, organizations of neurons in the BU have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Timaeus et al., 2020</xref>) and we explore these in the BUa in the next section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>TuBu neurons have previously been shown to respond to unpolarized visual stimuli presented to regions of the eye outside the DRA, including the narrow vertical bars which we found to stimulate MeTu neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Omoto et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Shiozaki and Kazama, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Sun et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). We also recorded the responses of TuBu neurons to these stimuli (data not shown, included in dataset). As a simple, representative way to compare the responses of the three groups of TuBu neurons to unpolarized stimuli, we present the responses of each TuBu population to a wide-field flash of unpolarized blue light, recorded in both the AOTU and BU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). TuBu<sub>s</sub> and TuBu<sub>i</sub> neuron populations showed responses to the flash in the AOTU and, more strongly, in the BU, while TuBu<sub>a</sub> neurons recorded in either neuropil were inhibited by the unpolarized light stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We note that a previous study appeared to show excitation of BUa micro-glomeruli in response to unpolarized small-field stimuli presented in the contralateral visual field and inhibition in response to ipsilateral stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Shiozaki and Kazama, 2017</xref>). These results may reflect excitatory and inhibitory receptive fields of TuBu<sub>s</sub> neurons, while our recordings indicate that inhibition dominates the response of the population to wide-field visual stimuli.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Polarization signals entering the central complex via the bulb</title><p>Taken together, our recordings of TuBu neurons indicate that polarized light signals are potentially delivered to the central complex via two parallel pathways: one through the superior bulb (BUs), containing a limited representation of polarization space in addition to other visual information, and a second channel through the anterior bulb (BUa). In the bulb, TuBu neuron presynaptic terminals innervate the globular dendrites of ring neurons (ER) in a largely one-to-one fashion, forming individual micro-glomeruli. ER ring neurons project medially to the ellipsoid body (EB) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>), where their arborizations have a circular form and are both dendritic and axonal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hanesch et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Omoto et al., 2018</xref>). We recorded calcium activity in the dendrites of two populations of ring neurons in the bulb, which we expected would include postsynaptic partners of polarization-sensitive TuBu neurons: one population innervating the medial two-thirds of the BUs, containing ER2 neurons (R19C08-Gal4), and one innervating the BUa, containing ER4m neurons (R34H10-Gal4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>).

Low PSI values were common throughout the ER2 population and average values were not significantly different from average values in background regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). We attribute this to a small proportion of polarization-sensitive ring neurons within a driver which expresses in a population of largely insensitive neurons. By contrast, in ER4m neurons in the BUa, average PSI values were greater than 0.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>) and the overall distribution of values in the population was similar in shape to the distribution in TuBu<sub>a</sub> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).

Although the BUs appears to contain polarization-sensitive elements, they are pervasive neither in the populations of BUs-projecting ring neurons we recorded, nor their putative presynaptic partners, the TuBu<sub>s</sub> neurons, and hereafter we focus on the BUa, where all micro-glomeruli seem to be involved in polarization processing.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5-2"><title>Polarotopy in the anterior bulb</title><p>In contrast to the linear polarotopic organization of tunings observed in the AOTU, which was consistent across animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F,H</xref>), the spatial organization of polarization tunings in the BUa was less clear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G,H</xref>). We tested whether there was a common relationship between the horizontal (medial-lateral), vertical (ventral-dorsal), or angular position of micro-glomeruli within the BUa and their preferred AoP, for both TuBu<sub>a</sub> and ER4m neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). We also considered whether there was a relationship within a population of neurons in an individual animal which was not common across animals. We found no indication of a relationship between position and preferred AoP except in recordings of TuBu<sub>a</sub> neurons in the left BUa, which showed a common vertically organized polarotopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and circularly organized polarotopies in individual animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1E</xref>). However, we found no significant polarotopy in the corresponding TuBu<sub>a</sub> neurons in the right BUa, or in postsynaptic ER4m neurons. Hence we cannot firmly conclude that either a vertical or circular organization of tunings exists in the anterior bulb. Furthermore, our assessment of circular organization is only valid for the dorso-posterior imaging plane used here, and we cannot exclude the possibility of a circular organization around a different axis of the bulb.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Polarization processing in the ellipsoid body and protocerebral bridge</title><p>We next wanted to understand how polarized light signals are represented in the ellipsoid body (EB), where the tangential ring neurons supply visual information around its circular structure.

This observation, although not explored thoroughly, indicates localized calcium dynamics within the arborization trees of the ring neurons and a non-homogenous distribution of output signaling.

This increasing vector length, first from TuBu<sub>a</sub> to ER4m in the bulb, then from the dendrites of ER4m in the bulb to the terminals in the EB, indicates a reduction in the range of AoPs found at each stage. Since uneven sizes or quantities of neurons could affect these results, we repeated the analysis with ROIs drawn on individual micro-glomeruli in the bulb.

We found a statistically significant effect of the polarizer on PSI values versus controls in both populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E</xref>), yet the effect size was small in E-PG neurons with an average ΔPSI of 0.06, and an average PSI value that was generally lower than in background regions of recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1–figure 1</xref>). To explore this discrepancy, we examined the responses of individual glomeruli in the PB in response to cycles of the polarizer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10F</xref>). Here, in the PB, we observed characteristics which distinguished E-PG responses from those of all other polarization-sensitive elements that we recorded in the upstream pathway. First, the amplitude of responses was often found to be inconsistent over multiple rotation cycles of the polarizer (arrowhead, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10F</xref>, top). Second, the peak response was often found to occur at different positions of the polarizer over multiple cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10F</xref>, bottom). For both of these response characteristics, variations were synchronized across the left and right PB glomerulus pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10F</xref>). When we analyzed responses to individual cycles of the polarizer separately, these characteristics manifested as PSI values and preferred AoPs which varied over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10G</xref>).</p><p>To quantify how variable these polarization-tuning properties were, we obtained a measure of synchronicity between E-PG activity and the polarizer stimulus. We examined the auto-correlation function of all individual glomerular responses and compared them with those of ER4m and TuBu<sub>a</sub> neurons recorded in the anterior bulb (BUa) (we could not perform the same test for ER4m responses in the EB since we could not distinguish individual neurons from each other). For E-PG neurons, we found that less than half of all glomeruli recorded exhibited a periodicity which matched the stimulus, while almost all ER4m and TuBu<sub>a</sub> neurons matched the stimulus (E-PG: 43.3%, ER4m: 98.4%, TuBu<sub>a</sub>: 100%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Therefore, although E-PG activity was in some cases periodic and likely induced by the rotating angle of polarization, when observed over multiple cycles less than half of all E-PG glomeruli showed responses that were phase-locked with the stimulus. For comparison, the noisy fluctuations of activity recorded in E-PG neurons with the polarizer removed produced similar levels of synchronization for the majority of glomeruli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>This finding is reminiscent of the observation of ‘conditional’ polarization-sensitivity in the locust central complex, whereby certain columnar neuron types (although notably not the homologue of E-PG neurons) were found to be sensitive to polarized light in some but not all animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Heinze and Homberg, 2009</xref>), an effect attributed by the authors to the varying internal state of each animal. It should be noted that the activity we recorded and analyzed as a single glomerulus in the PB potentially represents multiple E-PG neurons which could have been differentially active. This is one alternative explanation for the variable tuning properties that we found, although it would still necessitate a degree of flexibility in the overall circuit and a mechanism for selective engagement of a single E-PG neuron from multiple candidates within the same glomerulus. The differences between ER4m and E-PG responses, in their periodicity and average PSI values, certainly imply that a transformation or gating of signals occurred at their synapses, and the behavior of the system may be qualitatively different in animals during locomotion and navigation behaviors. Other recent work has proposed that plasticity at ring neuron to E-PG synapses in the EB is also likely required for the heading direction network to operate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fisher et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kim et al., 2019</xref>). The variable responses to polarized light that we observed in E-PG neurons may therefore reflect their recent stimulation history, and even the laboratory conditions under which the animals were reared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">el Jundi et al., 2011</xref>). The plasticity of these synapses, together with the reciprocal synapses from E-PG neurons back onto ER4m neurons, invites the question of whether the observed preference of ER4m populations for particular AoPs in the EB might also have a complex dependence on internal state or previous visual experience.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6-7"><title>E-PG neurons in neighboring columns exhibit similar responses, with no fixed polarotopic organization</title><p>Across different animals, glomeruli at corresponding positions in the PB exhibited different preferred angles of polarization (AoPs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>).

We therefore limited our analysis to individual cycles of the stimulus, essentially capturing snapshots of tuning properties over a shorter timescale (30 s).

We then identified the glomerulus pair with the maximum average PSI value, which we refer to as G0, and expressed all PB positions, preferred AoPs and PSI values relative to G0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Smooth transitions in preferred AoP across glomeruli were observed infrequently, and in 6 out of 19 animals this resulted in a weak relationship between PB position and preferred angle of polarization (asterisks, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1F</xref>).</p><p>More generally, we found that glomeruli neighboring G0, at ±1 PB position, were likely to exhibit a similar preferred AoP to G0, to within 15° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1G</xref>).

These data support our initial observation of clusters of glomeruli with similar PSI values and preferred AoPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B,C</xref>), contrasting with the polarotopic organization of tunings across the PB found for CPU1 neurons in locusts (likely homologous to P-F-R neurons in flies) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Heinze and Homberg, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Honkanen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pegel et al., 2019</xref>).

This may be key in understanding the central complex, where dynamic responses reflect circuit plasticity and depend on numerous factors, such as proprioceptive inputs, internal states and goal-direction. Next, targeted expression of calcium indicators allowed us to isolate specific anatomical groups of neurons, such as specific TuBu or ring neuron populations, greatly increasing the repeatability of functional characterizations. Crucially, the identification of corresponding genetic drivers will enable silencing experiments, optogenetic stimulatio,n and multi-population recordings to probe circuit function in the future. Imaging of calcium indicators also facilitated the characterization of neurons whose axons are prohibitively thin for recording intracellularly. MeTu-like neurons, for example, have long been assumed to deliver polarization signals from the medulla to the anterior optic tubercle, and here we were able to confirm this by direct observation for the first time.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Skylight polarization features extracted by the MEDRA</title><p>Since each detector for polarized light in the DRA essentially has a different field of view, the success of this approach depended on the ability to stimulate a sizable number of DRA ommatidia. Surprisingly, almost the full extent of the DRA was stimulated by polarized light originating from a single point in the visual field with a common angle of polarization. A wide range of polarization tunings was subsequently revealed in downstream neurons, supporting the idea that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> medulla dorsal rim area (MEDRA) analyzes the overall pattern of polarized light in the sky and extracts a predominant angle of polarization (AoP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Labhart, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rossel and Wehner, 1986</xref>), rather than performing many local AoP estimates. During the morning and evening when <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> are most active, the pattern of polarization in the sky can be well approximated by a single, predominant AoP. DmDRA1 neurons appear to spatially integrate polarization signals from multiple columns of the MEDRA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), and individual neurons heavily overlap each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sancer et al., 2019</xref>). This could provide an additional robustness to occlusions of the sky or of the DRA itself and average out inconsistencies in the available light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Labhart et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rossel and Wehner, 1986</xref>).</p><p>The parallel circuitry between DRA R7, DmDRA1, and MeTu neurons in MEDRA columns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), resembles the color-processing pathway found in non-DRA columns involving R7, Dm8, and Tm5c (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Karuppudurai et al., 2014</xref>). MeTu neurons in the MEDRA may also integrate color signals, as their dendritic fields extend into the non-DRA medulla, indicating that color and polarization processing are compatible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Parallel circuits may support antagonistic processing of the color and polarization pathways downstream, potentially providing a means to selectively process polarization cues for navigation from the anti-solar hemisphere where they are strongest. We have not functionally described the responses of DmDRA2 neurons that contact R8 in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sancer et al., 2019</xref>), and these neurons may be differently integrated with color processing. Both parallel functions will likely need to be incorporated to build a complete conceptual model of skylight polarization processing in the medulla.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Sensory transformations through the AVP</title><p>In the anterior optic tubercle (AOTU), we found polarization-sensitive neuron populations entering and leaving the tubercle via the intermediate-lateral domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). We also observed polarization responses in the lateral domain, although it is unclear whether this is a result of separate polarization-sensitive MeTu types projecting from the MEDRA to different AOTU domains. Alternatively, since MeTu neurons are also postsynaptic in the AOTU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Omoto et al., 2017</xref>), signals from a single polarization input channel could be redistributed to different regions of the AOTU for integration with other visual modalities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) or bilateral interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The AOTU in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is also likely to be a site for modulation of signals depending on time or internal states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">el Jundi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Guo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lamaze et al., 2018</xref>), and a capacity to modify responses may explain why we observed multiple polarotopic organizations in a MeTu neuron population in the AOTU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, there may also be multiple functional subtypes within the population that more tailored experiments may be able to distinguish.</p><p>Intriguingly, none of the polarotopies found in presynaptic MeTu neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>) matched the polarotopy of postsynaptic TuBu dendrites in the AOTU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G,I</xref>), which was extremely consistent across animals. Our findings suggest that TuBu neurons extract a processed form of the signals in the AOTU, encoding visual features within fewer neurons than the MeTu populations. TuBu neurons appear to divide signals into functional groups, and the anterior bulb-projecting TuBu<sub>a</sub> group in every fly contained a set of around six tunings covering −90° to +90° of polarization space in approximately 30° steps, tightly packed in a micro-glomerular structure with no apparent polarotopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The question remains open as to whether a sun position system and skylight polarization system are independent in the bulb. Unlike the TuLAL neurons in locusts (homologous to TuBu), where there is convergence on the dendrites of postsynaptic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">von Hadeln et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pegel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pfeiffer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Träger et al., 2008</xref>), TuBu neurons appear to form one-to-one contact with individual ring neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Omoto et al., 2017</xref>). Hence, we posit that the site of integration of celestial cues is not at the synapse between TuBu and ring neurons. Although we found evidence that angles of polarization are represented in the superior bulb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), where unpolarized cues are also known to be represented, the populations we recorded contained a limited range of tunings and resembled a system for detecting visual features with a particular polarization signature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Labhart, 2016</xref>), such as horizontally polarized light reflected from surfaces like water, rather than a system for accurate estimation of orientation. Such responses would likely be mediated by more ventral regions of the eye than the DRA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Velez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Wernet et al., 2012</xref>). It should be noted that our polarized light stimulus broadly illuminated the eye from a dorsal position and, although we attempted to minimize reflections, we did not measure whether reflected polarized light fell on the ventral eye during our experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Stereotypic polarotopy in the periphery gives way to idiosyncratic plasticity in the CX</title><p>By recording the ensemble response of a population of ER4m ring neurons, both in the anterior bulb and ellipsoid body (EB), we determined that they do not simply relay the responses of presynaptic TuBu<sub>a</sub> neurons to the EB. Instead, they appear to deliver a subset of signals more prominently than others, bestowing the population with an ensemble response tuned to a specific angle of polarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Furthermore, we found that this population tuning conveys a different angle of polarization in individual animals, and one exciting possibility is that this represents a flexible heading signal relative to polarized light cues, which could direct behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Warren et al., 2018</xref>). A question to address in future work is whether the preferred angle of polarization of an individual ring neuron is itself fixed, in which case we may have observed the result of a winner-take-all competition among the ER4m population in the EB, or if the whole population flexibly re-tunes to preferentially respond to a common AoP. Recordings from individual neurons will be required to resolve this.</p><p>It is clear that among ER4m and E-PG neurons, polarization tunings are not represented with a retinotopic map in the EB or PB which is common between individual animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). This is in contrast with the consistent polarotopic organizations found upstream in the MEDRA or AOTU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>), but in agreement with a previous study which showed that the azimuthal position of unpolarized visual stimuli is also not represented retinotopically in E-PG neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fisher et al., 2019</xref>). The lack of organization in E-PG responses also matches previous findings in the corresponding CL1a neurons in locusts, but contrasts with the polarotopic organization found in other columnar neurons in the locust CX, such as CPU1, and the tangential TB1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Heinze and Homberg, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Heinze and Homberg, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pegel et al., 2019</xref>). A potential explanation for the lack of consistent polarotopy in CL1a, or indeed E-PG neurons, was offered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Heinze and Homberg, 2009</xref>: at least two of each neuron type innervates an individual glomerulus in the PB. Could each of these have differential responses to polarized light to enable different configurations across the PB? Intriguingly, the TB1-like Δ7 neurons in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> PB appear to synapse onto only a subset of the E-PG neurons in a single glomerulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Turner-Evans et al., 2020</xref>), perhaps indicating independent functional groups. We may therefore yet find a polarotopic organization of responses in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> CX. Alternatively, such an organization may reflect a common, genetically pre-programmed directional goal to facilitate migration, which flies may lack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Honkanen et al., 2019</xref>), instead using polarization cues to follow a fixed course and disperse along idiosyncratic headings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dickinson, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Our data suggest that in a given fly, E-PG neurons may respond to one of two approximately orthogonal angles of polarization, effectively dividing the population into two groups. Interestingly, when data from locust CPU1 neurons (likely homologues of P-F-R neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) were pooled with tunings obtained from a number of other polarization-sensitive columnar CX neuron types, including CL1b (P-EG), CL2 (P-EN), CPU2, and CPU4 (P-FN), the organization of tunings in the locust PB could be interpreted as clustering around two orthogonal preferred angles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Heinze and Homberg, 2009</xref>). A binary system such as this would be well suited to influence downstream processes in a motor-centered coordinate frame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rayshubskiy et al., 2020</xref>). For example, the eventual output of the compass network may be a command signal to activate one descending neuron of a bilateral pair to initiate a turn to either the left or right, and thus maintain a heading specified by polarization patterns in the sky.</p><p>An important next step will be to understand how polarized light influences the activity bump in columnar neurons and whether the activity of columnar neurons reciprocally influences the tunings of ER4m neurons. We did not observe an activity bump in E-PG neurons in the PB, likely due to the open-loop stimulus presentation and recordings performed in immobilized animals, although we could see evidence of flexible encoding of polarization information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). According to our mappings of E-PG responses in the PB, the influence of a rotating polarized light stimulus might be to move the activity bump discontinuously between two positions, not dissimilar to observations in a recent investigation of the influence of airflow on the bump in E-PG neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Okubo et al., 2020</xref>). However, a limitation of the polarization stimulus used here is that the intensity gradient and position of the light source did not change as the angle of polarization rotated, as they would be seen to by an animal turning under a natural sky. If the ambiguity between 0/180° polarization cues is resolved by integrating light intensity information, then the stimulus we used here presented contradictory, unnatural changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gkanias et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Behavioral studies in ants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Wehner and Müller, 2006</xref>) and dung beetles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">el Jundi et al., 2015</xref>) have demonstrated that skylight polarization cues can have a greater influence than other visual features in guidance and navigation behaviors. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, intensity gradients have been shown to have a greater behavioral significance than polarized light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Warren et al., 2018</xref>), yet recent connectome analysis of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> CX highlights the polarization-sensitive ring neurons that we identified here as potentially being at the top of a hierarchy of sensory inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hulse et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, the unique pattern of asymmetrical connectivity between the ER4m populations from each brain hemisphere and the E-PG network hints at an attractively simple system for obtaining 360° heading information from ambiguous 0/180° polarization cues, by using signals from one population or the other depending on which side of the animal the sun is on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hulse et al., 2020</xref>). A key challenge for future studies will be to uncover such mechanisms for integrating and selecting from the multiple sensory modalities and visual qualities represented in the central brain in order to navigate complex environments.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>Rh3/Rh4-Gal4</td><td>Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center</td><td>FLYB:FBti0058802;RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:BDSC_8603">BDSC_8603</ext-link></td><td>Synonym: pan-R7-Gal4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Wernet et al., 2006</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>DmDRA1 split (R13E04-p65.AD; VT059781-Gal4.DBD)</td><td>This paper</td><td>FLYB:FBti0187820;FLYB:FBti0194675</td><td>Available upon request.

Imaging experiments were performed between ZT0–14, although time of day was not a factor in our experimental design or analysis. We imaged 1–7 day old female flies expressing either UAS-GCaMP6s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2013</xref>) for dendritic regions or UAS-sytGCaMP6s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cohn et al., 2015</xref>) for axon terminals, together with UAS-tdTomato (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Shaner et al., 2004</xref>) for image registration (for genotypes see <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 2—table 1.</xref>). Flies were cold anesthetized and mounted on a custom fly holder, modified from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Weir et al., 2016</xref>, with the head pitched forward so that its posterior surface was approximately horizontal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Surfaces of the fly holder visible to the fly were covered in matte white paint (Citadel) and roughened to reduce confounding reflected polarized light cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Foster et al., 2018</xref>). We fixed the fly to the holder using UV-curing glue (Fotoplast) around the posterior-dorsal cuticle of the head and at the base of the wings on either side of the thorax. To reduce movement of the brain, we fixed the legs, abdomen, and proboscis with beeswax. We used forceps to remove the cuticle and air-sacs above the optic lobe or central brain, depending on the recording site, and cut muscle 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Demerec, 1950</xref>) to reduce movement. Physiological saline (103 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 1.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 26 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 10 mM trehalose, 10 mM glucose, 5 mM TES, 2 mM sucrose) was perfused continuously over the brain at 1.5 ml/min via a gravity drip system and the bath was maintained at 22°C for the duration of experiments by an inline solution heater/cooler (SC-20, Warner Instruments) connected to a temperature controller (TC-324, Warner Instruments).</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-2"><title>Imaging setup</title><p>We used a two-photon excitation scanning microscope controlled by Slidebook (ver. 6, 3i) with a Ti:sapphire laser (Chameleon Vision, Coherent) at 920 nm and a 40× objective (0.8 numerical aperture, NIR Apo, Nikon). For each brain area imaged, we aimed to capture the full extent of the volume of labeled neurons, using a maximum step-size of 4 μm between imaging planes, and maintained a volume-rate of at least 1 Hz. Image resolution varied depending on the number of planes captured but was not less than 100 pixels in the longest dimension. We recorded frame capture markers and stimulus events on a DAQ (6259, NI) sampling at 10 kHz.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-3"><title>Polarized light stimulus</title><p>We used a custom polarized light stimulus device comprising a UV LED (M340D3, Thorlabs), a 7.5 mm diameter aperture, a ground glass diffuser (DGUV10-1500, Thorlabs), a low-pass filter (FGUV11, Thorlabs), and a removable linear polarizer (BVO UV, Bolder Optic). The UV LED was controlled through MATLAB 2017a (Mathworks, MA) via a DAQ (6259, NI) and LED driver (LEDD1B, Thorlabs). The polarizer was rotated with a bipolar stepper motor (ROB-10551, SparkFun) and spur gears (1:1), and a motor driver (ROB-12779, SparkFun) controlled through MATLAB (2017a, Mathworks) via a DAQ (USB1208, MCC), with a minimum step-size of 7.5°. The motor was operated in open-loop and a Hall effect sensor (A1324, Allegro) was used to detect the proximity of a magnet which passed once per revolution, in order to verify correct operation. Angles of polarization and directions of rotation are expressed from an external viewpoint looking toward the fly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). 0°/180° corresponds to a vertical orientation in the transverse plane and an alignment with the fly’s long-axis in the horizontal plane. We investigated the reproducibility of the polarizer’s angular positions and measured &lt;1° variation over multiple revolutions and &lt;1° of position hysteresis (backlash) after reversing the direction of rotation. The surface of the polarizer was positioned frontally, 110 mm from the fly’s head at an elevation of approximately 65° above the eye-equator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The light subtended a solid angle of approximately 4° and the entirety of the fly, including the dorsal rim area of both eyes, was illuminated. We measured approximately 0.8 μW/cm<sup>2</sup> irradiance at the fly’s head at the spectral peak of 342 nm (8.7 nm FWHM) with the polarizer attached (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We calibrated the LED power in order to maintain a similar irradiance value with the polarizer removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We measured a ± 5% modulation in light intensity over a full revolution of the device (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), due to a slight off-axis tilt of the diffuser and polarizer. This intensity modulation was of similar magnitude both with the polarizer attached and removed, and was therefore unlikely to be an effect of polarization. We reasoned that if calcium activity in neurons was modulated by the rotation of the device with the polarizer attached, but not with the polarizer removed, then the varying angle of polarization throughout the revolution was its cause, rather than the varying light intensity. To quantify the difference in modulation between these two polarizer conditions, we report the change in polarization-selectivity index (ΔPSI) throughout (see <italic>Polarization-selectivity index</italic>).</p><p>We verified that the polarized light stimulus elicited an expected response in the dorsal rim photoreceptors by recording calcium signals in R7/R8 terminals in the medulla dorsal rim area (MEDRA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>). We observed preferential responses to different angles of polarized light across the MEDRA and approximately orthogonal preferred angles within R7/R8 pairs in individual columns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>). Moving anterior to posterior across the right MEDRA, the preferred angle of polarization rotated counter-clockwise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>), matching a previous characterization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Weir et al., 2016</xref>). We estimated that at least 80% of MEDRA columns were stimulated and conveyed polarization tunings that matched predictions based on the anatomy of photoreceptors at corresponding positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Weir et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E–G</xref>), with weak responses or deviations observed only in the anterior-most columns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E,F</xref>) likely due to their posterior receptive fields which faced away from the stimulus. With the polarizer removed, we observed no spatial organization of tunings in photoreceptor terminals and PSI values close to zero (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1J</xref>), indicating reduced modulation of activity by the stimulus.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-4"><title>LED display</title><p>We used a 32 × 96 pixel display, composed of 8 × 8 panels of LEDs (470 nm, Adafruit) with controllers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Reiser and Dickinson, 2008</xref>), arranged in a half-cylinder spanning ±90° azimuth from visual midline and approximately ±30° elevation from the eye-equator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Each LED pixel subtended a solid angle of approximately 1.5° at the eye-equator. At their maximum intensity, we measured approximately 0.11 μW/m<sup>2</sup> irradiance at the fly’s head at the spectral peak of 460 nm (243 nm FWHM).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Experimental protocols</title><p>Visual stimuli were presented in sets as described below. Between each stimulus set, 10 s of spontaneous activity was recorded in darkness with no visual stimulation. The polarizer could only be removed or attached between recordings, but could be done so while maintaining the same imaging parameters and field-of-view under both conditions.</p><sec id="s4-2-1"><title>Angle of polarization tuning</title><p>To characterize responses to different angles of polarization, we rotated the polarizer discontinuously in 30° steps with the UV LED on throughout. Each of the 12 positions (six unique angles of polarization) was maintained for 4–4.5 s and we used 4 s of imaging data collected during this period in our analysis. With a volume-rate of at least 1 Hz, this ensured that at least four time-points were captured for every plane in the imaging volume. The polarizer was then rotated through 30° in 0.5 s. At least two complete revolutions of the polarizer were made. For recordings with the polarizer removed, the procedure was repeated and one revolution of the stimulus was made. The discontinuous rotation of the polarizer differs from most previous studies of polarization-sensitive neurons in insects, which have typically analyzed spike frequency modulated by continuously rotating stimuli, and as such the data obtained using this protocol may not be directly comparable.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2"><title>Polarized light flash</title><p>To characterize responses to individual wide-field flashes of polarized light, the polarizer was first rotated to 0° (vertical) in darkness. A series of three flashes of the UV LED were presented, 4 s on:4 s off. After 10 s, the same procedure was repeated with the polarizer at 90° (horizontal). The light was the same used in the angle of polarization tuning protocol. For recordings with the polarizer removed, the procedure was repeated with flashes at the 0° position.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-3"><title>Unpolarized light flash</title><p>To characterize responses to individual wide-field flashes of unpolarized light, the entire LED display was illuminated following the same procedure as for polarized light flashes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-4"><title>Bars</title><p>To characterize retinotopic responses to unpolarized stimuli, a single bright, vertical bar was presented on the LED display (32 × 1 pixel) with all other LEDs off (0.78 Weber contrast). Bars initially remained stationary for 3 s, then jittered left and right (±1 pixel) for 3 s, followed by an inter-trial period of 4 s with all LEDs off. Bars were presented at five equally spaced azimuth positions spanning ±90°, presented sequentially from left to right around the fly. This procedure was repeated twice.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-5"><title>Dot-field expansion</title><p>To characterize responses to unpolarized motion stimuli, a sparse random dot pattern was presented on the LED display that simulated forward translational optic-flow (thrust), with the frontal point of expansion approximately at the eye-equator. Approximately 1% of LEDs in the display were illuminated in each frame of the pattern, with all other LEDs off (0.83 Weber contrast). Windowed regions of this pattern were presented sequentially (lateral-left: −90°:−50° azimuth; frontal: −40°:+40° azimuth; lateral-right: +50°:+90° azimuth; each covering the full elevation extent of ±30°) followed by the whole pattern (−90°:+90° azimuth). Motion was presented in each region for 4 s, with an inter-trial period of 4 s with all LEDs off. This procedure was repeated twice.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Data analysis</title><sec id="s4-3-1"><title>Data export</title><p>Recorded imaging data was exported as 16-bit tiff frames. We compiled all time-points for a single imaging plane and a maximum average intensity projection (MIP, detailed below) across all planes at each time-point.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2"><title>Image registration</title><p>We used a DFT-based registration algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Guizar-Sicairos et al., 2008</xref>) to first correct for motion in the MIP of the activity-independent tdTomato channel across all time-points. We then applied the same registration displacements (<italic>x</italic>,<italic>y</italic>) to all individual planes of the activity-dependent GCaMP channel.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-3"><title>Maximum intensity projection</title><p>We constructed a maximum intensity projection (MIP) based on each imaging plane’s time-averaged fluorescence intensities during periods of inactivity, which avoided a bias towards including neurons that were bright throughout an experiment but did not necessarily show modulation (versus neurons which were inhibited for the majority of an experiment but were modulated nonetheless). The time-series of each pixel in the projection also originated from a fixed plane throughout the recording. In summary: for each imaging plane, we found an average intensity image sampling only frames captured during periods of inactivity between stimulus sets. We then found the imaging plane (<italic>z</italic>) with the highest average intensity at each position (<italic>x</italic>,<italic>y</italic>). The intensity time-series (<italic>t</italic>) from this location (<italic>x</italic>,<italic>y</italic>,<italic>z</italic>) was then inserted into a new array (<italic>x</italic>,<italic>y</italic>,<italic>t</italic>) to form the projection. Neighboring pixels in the projection could therefore contain signals from different imaging planes, but individual pixels contained signals from only one plane. All analyses were conducted on this projection unless otherwise stated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-4"><title>Angle of polarization tuning</title><p>For each pixel, we found the average fluorescence intensity across the frames captured during each angle presentation to obtain a polarization tuning curve. Since a polarization-tuned analyzer should respond identically to parallel angles of polarization (e.g. 0°/180°), we expected bimodal data with diametrically opposite modes. We therefore found the axial mean resultant vector, correcting for grouped data, and took its angle as the preferred angle of polarization, defined modulo 180° (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Batschelet, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berens, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Zar, 1999</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-5"><title>Polarization-selectivity index</title><p>For each pixel, we found the average fluorescence intensity (ranging from 0 to 2<sup>16</sup>, arbitrary units) during the first two presentations of the angles closest to and diametrically opposite its preferred angle of polarization in the tuning experiment (F<sub>pref</sub>). We then found the average intensity at orthogonal angles (F<sub>ortho</sub>) and calculated the polarization-selectivity index (PSI) as the difference between F<sub>pref</sub> and F<sub>ortho</sub>, divided by their sum, with possible values ranging from 0 to 1. Where average PSI values are reported for a driver line, we used a broad ROI drawn around all labeled neurons in the brain area recorded, which we refer to as the ‘overall ROI’. To draw the overall ROI, we used an average intensity image from frames between stimulus sets as a guide. We also used this average intensity image to define additional regions: we defined regions of ‘neurons’ as the brightest 10% of pixels within the overall ROI, unless otherwise stated (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,C</xref>), and ‘background’ as the dimmest 10% of pixels outside of the overall ROI. For the overall ROI, neurons and background regions, the distribution of PSI values within a recording tended to be non-normal; for average values we report the median value for an individual animal and the mean of the median values across animals. Where ΔPSI values are reported, we subtracted the mean PSI values within the same region across all tuning experiments recorded with the polarizer removed. Where we applied a PSI-threshold to filter polarization-selective pixels in a recording (e.g. tuning maps, polarotopy analysis), we used the mean + 1 SD of PSI values within its background. This typically resulted in a PSI threshold between 0.3 and 0.4. This threshold was modified for E-PG recordings in the protocerebral bridge where PSI values of neurons tended to be lower than the background when averaged over multiple presentations; instead we used the mean + 1 SD of PSI values within neurons across all tuning experiments with the polarizer removed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-6"><title>Polarization tuning maps</title><p>To construct spatial maps of polarization tuning, we combined a color-coded representation of preferred angle of polarization and a grayscale representation of average intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1J</xref>). Pixels falling within the overall ROI which had an above-threshold PSI value (see <italic>Polarization-selectivity index</italic>) were assigned a color consistent with those used previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Weir et al., 2016</xref>) to convey their preferred angle of polarization. All other pixels with below-threshold PSI value or falling outside of the overall ROI convey their average intensity during periods of inactivity with a normalized grayscale color-code (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1J</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-7"><title>Polarization tuning curves</title><p>For polarization tuning curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1–figure 1A</xref>), we used the responses of pixels in the region of ‘neurons’ in each animal (see <italic>Polarization-selectivity index</italic>). For each pixel, we calculated the average fluorescence intensity (F<sub>m</sub>) at each angle of polarization presented and normalized values by calculating ΔF/F = F<sub>m</sub>/F<sub>0</sub>-1, where F<sub>0</sub> was the average intensity during periods of inactivity between stimulus sets. We interpolated each pixel’s resulting tuning curve in the Fourier domain, resampling to 360 data points, then shifted the curve according to the pixel’s preferred angle of polarization (rounded to the closest degree) so that all tuning curves were aligned. We then found the average tuning curve for all pixels in each individual animal.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-8"><title>Automatically generated ROIs</title><p>In addition to manually drawn ROIs, we generated ROIs based on polarization tuning maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Briefly, we discretized tuning maps so that they contained only six preferred angles of polarization, corresponding to those presented in the tuning experiment ±15°, plus null values for excluded pixels. For each angle, we identified contiguous areas of 20 or more pixels with that tuning and retained the largest area as an ROI.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-9"><title>Time-series</title><p>We found the mean fluorescence intensity of pixels within a given ROI in each frame to obtain its time-series (F<sub>t</sub>), which we normalized to a baseline value as follows. For polarization tuning experiments, we calculated ΔF/F = F<sub>t</sub>/F<sub>0</sub>-1, where F<sub>0</sub> was the root mean square value of the time-varying intensity across the entire experiment. For all other experiments, F<sub>0</sub> was the mean of F<sub>t</sub> during the 0.5 s preceding stimulus onset. To find the average time-series across multiple recordings with mismatched sampling times, we resampled values at a common rate using linear interpolation. This procedure produced no discernible alteration of the original data points.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-10"><title>Polarotopy and scatter plots</title><p>For recordings in the medulla and AOTU, we included only the set of polarization-selective pixels, as described for the tuning maps (see <italic>Polarization tuning map</italic>). For recordings in the bulb and protocerebral bridge, we used ROIs drawn manually on individual glomeruli. We projected pixel or ROI positions (<italic>x</italic>,<italic>y</italic>) onto a single horizontal axis (anterior-posterior in the medulla, medial-lateral in the central brain) or vertical axis (ventral-dorsal throughout) and then normalized to give a linear position ranging from 0 to 1. The majority of recordings were performed in the right brain hemisphere; where left hemisphere recordings were included, we inverted their positions along both axes (i.e. in the medulla, anterior positions on the left were pooled with posterior positions on the right), since we expected the mirror-symmetric polarotopy found in the dorsal rim (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G,H</xref>) to be preserved downstream. We then pooled the normalized positions and corresponding preferred AoP across all recordings and created a scatter plot with a random subset of 1000 data points, displaying either the corresponding PSI value or preferred AoP as the color of each point in the plot.</p><p>We quantified circular-linear associations between preferred angle (multiplied by two to correct for axial data) and normalized position by finding the slope and phase offset of a regression line, and then a correlation coefficient, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kempter et al., 2012</xref>. We found the correlation coefficient for the population by pooling all data points, then performed a permutation test on the pooled dataset with shuffled combinations of position and preferred AoP and recalculated the correlation coefficient 10,000 times. We report an upper-bound on the p-value as the proportion of shuffled datasets with a correlation coefficient exceeding that found for the experimental dataset plus one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Phipson and Smyth, 2010</xref>). We also found the correlation coefficients for individual recordings and an associated p-value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kempter et al., 2012</xref>). Where indicated, the regression lines for the pooled dataset and for individual recordings with a sufficient number of pixels to give a meaningful correlation (p &lt; 0.05) are shown on scatter plots.</p><p>We applied the Fisher z-transformation to correlation coefficients to find a mean correlation coefficient across flies. We used a hierarchical bootstrap method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Saravanan et al., 2020</xref>) to find 95% confidence intervals for the mean correlation coefficient found. We resampled with replacement from the population of flies, then resampled with replacement from all recordings made from those flies and recalculated the mean correlation coefficient after applying the Fisher z-transformation, repeated 10,000 times. From the bootstrapped population of mean correlation coefficients we found confidence intervals using the bias-corrected and accelerated method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Efron, 1987</xref>). In all cases, the correlation coefficient for the pooled dataset from all recordings was found to be close to the mean coefficient for individual flies and within the confidence interval calculated. For recordings in the bulb and protocerebral bridge, we also calculated the circular-circular correlation coefficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berens, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Zar, 1999</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-11"><title>Combined polarization and bar activity maps</title><p>For each pixel, we found the standard deviation of its fluorescence intensity across the frames captured during the angle of polarization tuning experiment. We then repeated this for the frames captured during the unpolarized bar experiment, resulting in maps of activity during each experiment. We normalized the values in each activity map individually, then subtracted the bar map from the polarization map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-12"><title>Polar histograms</title><p>We found the normalized probability distribution of preferred angles of polarization with a bin width of 15°. We then constructed polar histograms with each bin’s probability depicted as the area of a wedge, rather than its radial length. We included in this analysis either all pixels within the overall ROI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) (see <italic>Polarization-selectivity index</italic>) or the region of neurons only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) (see <italic>Polarization tuning maps</italic>), in which case we excluded recordings with few above-threshold pixels (less than 10% of the overall ROI). The results were qualitatively similar in both cases.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-13"><title>Population tuning vectors</title><p>For individual recordings, we found the direction and length of the population tuning in an individual animal by calculating the axial mean resultant vector of its preferred angles of polarization. For the pixel-based approach, we included all pixels within the overall ROI and weighted individual preferred angles by their PSI value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berens, 2009</xref>), rather than applying a threshold. Since individual neurons with a larger area provided a greater contribution in this analysis we compared it with an ROI-based approach, using ROIs drawn manually on individual micro-glomeruli in the bulb. We excluded recordings with fewer than four ROIs, and weighted the individual preferred angle of an ROI by its mean PSI-value. The results were qualitatively similar for both approaches.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-14"><title>Cross-correlation</title><p>For E-PG recordings in the protocerebral bridge, we manually drew ROIs on the 16 individual glomeruli visible in each recording (one additional column on either end of the PB does not contain E-PGs). We then paired each ROI on the left side with an ROI on the right side, using a pairing scheme which wrapped on either side independently (i.e. 1L/1R, 8L/2R, 7L/3R, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1D</xref>). For each pair, we obtained the time-series for the ROIs across all frames in the recording and found their normalized cross-correlation coefficient at zero lag, ranging from −1 to 1. We plot the coefficient values for each pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1E</xref>) and the mean coefficient across all pairs from all recordings after applying the Fisher z-transformation. We then shifted the pairing scheme by one position on the right side and repeated the procedure until all pairing schemes had been evaluated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-15"><title>Auto-correlation</title><p>For recordings in the bulb, we used ROIs manually drawn on individual micro-glomeruli. For E-PG recordings in the protocerebral bridge, we used ROIs drawn on pairs of left and right glomeruli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B-C</xref>). For each ROI, we obtained the time-series across the first two cycles of the tuning experiment. We detrended the time-series and calculated its normalized auto-correlation function. We then found the time difference between the first peak in the function and the period of the stimulus presented during the tuning experiment. We plot the value of these time differences for each ROI, which we refer to as a ‘peak shift’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1C</xref>), along with limits for the maximum expected peak shift for a phase-locked response to the stimulus (±2 s, half the duration of each angle presentation).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Confocal imaging</title><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>Immunostaining</title><p>Flies were raised at 25°C on a standard cornmeal/molasses diet in bottles or vials, under a 12:12 hr dark:light cycle, and we dissected 3–4 day old female flies (for genotypes see <xref ref-type="table" rid="app2table1">Appendix 2—table 1.</xref>).

Briefly, brains were dissected in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and fixed in ice–cold 4% EM–grade paraformaldehyde in PBS for 2.5 hr. They were subsequently washed for 4 × 15 min in ice–cold PBS followed by cold ethanol dehydration (5 min washes in 5, 10, 20, 50, 70, 100% EtOH). After incubation for approximately 12 hr in 100% EtOH at −20°C, brains were subjected to a rehydration procedure with EtOH in the reverse sequence. Brains were then washed for 4 × 15 min in ice–cold PBS and 4 × 15 min in ice-cold 0.3% PBT (PBS with 0.3% Triton X–100), followed by 4 × 15 min in room temperature (RT) 0.3% PBT. They were then incubated in blocking buffer (10% Normal Goat Serum in 0.3% PBT) for 30 min at RT. Following this, the brains were incubated in primary antibodies, diluted in blocking buffer at 4°C for approximately three days. They were subsequently washed 4 × 15 min in RT 0.3% PBT and placed in secondary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer at 4°C for approximately 3 days. They were finally washed 4 × 15 min in RT 0.3% PBT and placed in VectaShield (Vector Laboratories) at 4°C overnight before imaging. <italic>trans</italic>–Tango and GRASP analyses required separate staining of neuropil and respective fluorophores due to different incubation times.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-2"><title>Confocal microscopy and image analysis</title><p>Processed brains were mounted on glass slides and imaged in either the anteroposterior (A–P) or dorsoventral (D–V) axis with a Zeiss LSM 700 Imager M2 using Zen 2009 (Carl Zeiss), with a 40× oil objective.

Your article has been reviewed by four peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Ronald Calabrese as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Stanley Heinze (Reviewer #1); Romain Franconville (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed at length the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162).

I feel that this could easily have been three separate papers and reading it was a bit overwhelming at times, but it is a truly remarkable manuscript. It starts with describing polarization sensitive circuits in the optic lobe, then moves on to the processing stages along the anterior optic pathway and eventually focuses its attention to the central complex. While the first two parts are comparatively straight forward, the central complex part is by far the most interesting (to me). This is mostly because there is a wealth of surprising findings that go far beyond what is known in other species and additionally provide many fascinating access points for future studies, both in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and in insects that have been classical subjects of polarized light vision research.</p><p>The work follows a nice narrative, covers a wide range of anatomical and functional methods, is meticulously done, the methods are sound and the data are highly informative and relevant. While I cannot comment on the fly genetics part of the work (not my expertise), all other aspects of the work are excellent in my view.</p><p>Regarding the presentation of the data, I found the figures too small and overwhelming, with not all panels being referred to in the text. Maybe less information would make the message clearer at times, but in any case, I recommend making the figures much larger.</p><p>I much liked the Discussion, and it was refreshing to see that the authors are keenly aware of the work in non-fly species and integrate this work in their interpretation whenever needed.</p><p>I cannot wait to see follow up work, especially the interaction between the heading direction bump in the EPG neurons and the E-vector responses.</p><p>1) The authors only follow up one of the two parallel pathways into the CX, given that the polarization signal is less clear in the superior bulb. Yet parallel processing in the AOT is a seemingly highly conserved feature and it would be fantastic to know at least anatomically, if these neurons (R4m and R2) maintain this separation on the level of the CX or if they converge on the same E-PG cells. This would not require physiology, but a short look at the hemibrain data. It would generate strong predictions about the functional significance of these parallel pathways.</p><p>2) The authors use the classic division of the PB into eight glomeruli, yet data from <italic>Drosophila</italic> shows that there are nine glomeruli in the PB, including for the EPG neurons imaged in this study. This should be reflected in the analysis in this study. If the ninth neuron pair is not stained in the used driver line (as appeared in Wolff et al., 2015), this needs to be at least discussed. Judging by the projection patterns of column 1 and 9, the physiology of both should be identical, so no effect on the distribution of the data is likely. However, the reported discrepancy in columnar pairing across the midline between locusts and flies will have to be revised accordingly. It should be noted that the innermost column (near the midline) is the one that exists additionally in flies), as apparent by the lack of PEN and PFN neurons in this region.</p><p>3) The focus of activity in one quadrant of the EB when stimulating the ring neurons is highly intriguing! This means that there are local calcium dynamics at work that are restricted to parts of the arborization trees of the ring neurons. This to me is very unexpected and exciting. Also, this would not be reflected in the electrophysiology of these cells, when recording the spiking rates in response to the stimuli and might therefore be a general mechanism relevant also for locusts etc. I suggest to emphasize this a bit more, as it literally changed my way of thinking about the entire system! Also, it is intuitively very much in line with the recent papers on plasticity between ring neurons and EPG cells, where coincident activity in both cell types leads to synaptic depression and hence disinhibition of EPG cells and the generation of a visually driven EPG activity bump. Integrating this recent work would benefit the paper in general, but seems crucial for interpreting data on this critical part of the pathway.</p><p>4) along the lines of point three above; the recent work on plasticity of the synapse between ring neurons and EPG cells demonstrates that the stimulation history of these cells is critically important for their activity profiles. What role could this effect have on the tuning distribution in EPG cells?</p><p>5) Finally, data on other species nearly always used continuously rotating E-vectors as stimuli rather than stationary E-vectors. As the rotation direction strongly affects the tuning angle (see for example Stone et al., 2017, Figure 1), the data might not be entirely comparable. Especially when dynamic processes like in the transformation of the ring neuron code to the EPG neuron code are important, these difference might have large effects on the results. Could the authors comment on this differences in the Discussion?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This is an important and impressive study filling a critical gap in the literature. The authors trace polarization vision pathways in <italic>Drosophila</italic> from the periphery all the way to the central complex – a structure involved in orientation behaviors in insects. This will allow to synthesize two streams of research on the subject: that polarization is an essential orientation cue used by many insects, mapped onto central complex neurons in some species on one side, and that the central complex circuits contain representations of the animal heading that is used to guide flexible behaviors, the dissection of which has been rendered possible by the <italic>Drosophila</italic> toolkit in recent years on the other side. The authors mix careful anatomical work with circuit tracing and in vivo imaging to delineate the polarization pathway while characterizing the transformations taking place at each stage. The manuscript is clear, systematic, and does not shy away from the complexity of the data. This is undoubtedly going to be an important resource for researchers in the field. I also do appreciate that code and data are made easily accessible.</p><p>1) Figure 7 would be more convincing to me if the Bulb data, rather than the EB data, was shown. As the author point out, EB imaging of densely packed ring neurons axonal processes is conducive to more artefacts than the Bulb cleanly separated glomeruli (besides area, the signal in the EB could be dominated by neurons randomly expressing higher concentration of the indicator, etc)</p><p>2) E-PG responses: the authors are upfront with the fact that the data are not entirely conclusive, but I think they could discuss a number of other possibilities of why that might be so. First, ER4m ring neuron synapses onto E-PG are likely inhibitory. Given that in that immobilized preparation the EB attractor network is not &quot;engaged&quot; and therefore the activity level possibly low, this might make ER4m driven responses in the EPG challenging to detect. Second, if one imagine that a mechanism similar to the one described in Fisher et al., 2020, and Kim et al., 2020, is at play at the ER4m to EPG synapses, then it's possible that the mapping between ER4m activity profiles and EPG bump position has not taken place as the animals were reared in conditions where polarized light plays little role, and that moreover, once immobilized while a polarizer is rotated, this mapping would deteriorate even further. I think the paper would gain from discussing such possibilities, as well as qualifying the findings made on EPG responses in that light.</p><p>3) Throughout the manuscript, it might be helpful to show some tuning curves (meaning response amplitude vs. polarization angle) as for now it is pretty hard to compare responses of the various types to each other.</p><p>4) Figure 1A could be improved by more hand holding for the reader unfamiliar with the DRA. It is currently hard to relate the inset to the rest of the panel.</p><p>5) Even more discussion/speculation about the various transformations happening could make the manuscript more appealing to a wider readership. For example:</p><p>– What is dmDRA1 for? why are its responses &quot;cleaner&quot; than the ones of the MeTu neurons?</p><p>– Where is the difference between the responses of MeTu and TuBu neurons coming from (looks like the range of MeTu is more limited. Do TuBu sample from several MeTu?)?</p><p>6) Figure 5 and arguments about the distribution of preferred angles (Figure 5F, G). This might need to be qualified: first, the possible functional role of such a distribution can only be inferred if one knows how the post-synaptic partners sample it. Is there an argument for the sampling being homogeneous? Second, this is not impossible for some of this to be imputable to the imaging angle/projection used, where some part of the volume of the BU are less accessible/blurred by others.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Although the importance of polarized light for animal navigation has been recognized for years , the functional organization of the underlying sensory map in the central brain is largely unknown. Using a combination of trans-synaptic labeling and imaging techniques for defined neuronal populations, the manuscript by Frye and colleagues is describing a detailed analysis of the neural pathway for polarized light in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> visual system. The series of high-quality analyses not only uncovered a novel type of circuit design, polarotopy, at the peripheral optic lobes but also revealed how polarization identity is represented and transformed across multiple neuropils to the central brain. Especially the segregation of retinotopic visual features and polarization identities in distinct conserved AOTU domains, the innervation of the bulb region by parallel pathways with different visual features and the transformation in a more flexible CX representation is a major advance to the current morphological descriptions in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and the electrophysiological studies in other insects. Furthermore, with the identification of novel experimental tools for cell type-specific manipulations the new study by Hardcastle et al., will also support the dissection of non-linear circuit design for multimodal integration within the CX.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4:</italic></p><p>Hardcastle and colleagues present work tracing polarized light signals through <italic>Drosophila</italic>'s visual system, from the dorsal rim into the central complex. This work is important because it identifies pathways in <italic>Drosophila</italic> using synaptic tracing and employing tools that target specific neural populations. It ties its work in nicely to the extensive work on polarization vision in other insects. It is clearly written and its experiments are well conceived and explained.</p><p>I noted three areas where I think the paper could be strengthened:</p><p>1) The tracing and anatomical work is well done and convincing. However, since trans-tango's specificity to functional synapses remains a little uncertain, I think it would be very helpful to use the hemibrain dataset published earlier this year to confirm synapses between the neuron classes identified here. As a second part of this, and perhaps more important, it would be great to identify the correspondence between the TuBu type they reported and what is labeled in the hemibrain dataset. As of now on the hemibrain, there are 10 TuBu types (from TuBu01 to TuBu10) and TuBu01 seems to be specifically connected to R4m. This would be very important and useful information for readers who would want to further investigate these neurons.</p><p>2) The PSI is defined as (R<sub>para</sub> – R<sub>ortho</sub>)/(R<sub>para</sub> + R<sub>ortho</sub>). This maxes out at \pm 1 when all the responses are positive, but if any are negative, this formulation for an index doesn't work as well (for instance, allowing a divide by 0). I'm a bit confused about how this index was computed throughout, given that, for instance, the DmDRA1 neurons are inhibited by R7 via ort at anti-preferred angles, so there are nominally negative responses. Moreover, in the Materials and methods, it says F0 was computed as RMS F(t), to computed dF/F, but I don't see how this wouldn't lead to negative response values. I think the methodology for computing DSI needs to be clarified. In particular, how are the authors computing the responses – deviations from a baseline (computed how?) or are they setting the minimum measured dF/F to be a new 0 response?</p><p>3) It was quite surprising to me that a small source of polarized light could activate so much of the dorsal rim, as the authors also note. Were the flies w-/w- with the white gene only showing up as miniwhite on insertion constructs? If they had only orange or pink eyes, rather that wildtype red eyes, then that could explain it. As part of addressing this, the Materials and methods should include full genotypes for all experimental flies, not just stock references, to be able to evaluate this sort question directly.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.63225.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The four reviewers found the work to be of high significance for a pathway that plays an important role in flying insects but has not yet received the attention it deserves.

Especially when dynamic processes like in the transformation of the ring neuron code to the EPG neuron code are important, these differences might have large effects on the results. Could the authors comment on these differences in the Discussion?</p></disp-quote><p>To clarify, our procedure did contain rotations with the light on, between the static presentations – although these sections were not analyzed, the direction of rotation could still have affected the responses. We performed additional experiments with the rotation direction reversed (not explicitly mentioned in the manuscript) and found no observable differences in responses or polarotopic organization upstream of the CX. In E-PG neurons, the responses were variable even for the same rotation direction, hence interpreting the effect of reversing the rotation alone was tricky, however we intend to follow up this line of investigation in future work. We agree that the data may not be comparable with those obtained from a continuous rotation and we have added a note on this difference:</p><p>“The discontinuous rotation of the polarizer differs from most previous studies of polarization-sensitive neurons in insects, which have typically analyzed spike frequency modulated by continuously rotating stimuli, and as such the data obtained using this protocol may not be directly comparable.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This is an important and impressive study filling a critical gap in the literature. The authors trace polarization vision pathways in <italic>Drosophila</italic> from the periphery all the way to the central complex -- a structure involved in orientation behaviors in insects. This will allow to synthesize two streams of research on the subject: that polarization is an essential orientation cue used by many insects, mapped onto central complex neurons in some species on one side, and that the central complex circuits contain representations of the animal heading that is used to guide flexible behaviors, the dissection of which has been rendered possible by the <italic>Drosophila</italic> toolkit in recent years on the other side. The authors mix careful anatomical work with circuit tracing and in vivo imaging to delineate the polarization pathway while characterizing the transformations taking place at each stage. The manuscript is clear, systematic, and does not shy away from the complexity of the data. This is undoubtedly going to be an important resource for researchers in the field. I also do appreciate that code and data are made easily accessible.</p><p>1) Figure 7 would be more convincing to me if the Bulb data, rather than the EB data, was shown. As the author point out, EB imaging of densely packed ring neurons axonal processes is conducive to more artefacts than the Bulb cleanly separated glomeruli (besides area, the signal in the EB could be dominated by neurons randomly expressing higher concentration of the indicator, etc)</p></disp-quote><p>We present the data for both the EB and the bulb in panels E and F, whereby the bulb data represent responses obtained from individual neurons. The effect of an overall population tuning was less pronounced in the bulb than in the EB, but still larger than that found for the population of TuBu neurons in the anterior bulb. However, as the reviewer notes in point 6, the imaging angle/projection used may make some parts of the bulb volume obscured/less accessible, and so neither approach is ideal. We also considered it an advantage to be able to demonstrate the responses of ER4m neurons deriving from both hemispheres together by showing example recordings from the EB.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) E-PG responses: the authors are upfront with the fact that the data are not entirely conclusive, but I think they could discuss a number of other possibilities of why that might be so. First, ER4m ring neuron synapses onto E-PG are likely inhibitory. Given that in that immobilized preparation the EB attractor network is not &quot;engaged&quot; and therefore the activity level possibly low, this might make ER4m driven responses in the EPG challenging to detect. Second, if one imagine that a mechanism similar to the one described in Fisher et al., 2020, and Kim et al., 2020, is at play at the ER4m to EPG synapses, then it's possible that the mapping between ER4m activity profiles and EPG bump position has not taken place as the animals were reared in conditions where polarized light plays little role, and that moreover, once immobilized while a polarizer is rotated, this mapping would deteriorate even further. I think the paper would gain from discussing such possibilities, as well as qualifying the findings made on EPG responses in that light.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above (Editorial, reviewer #1 section), we have expanded the discussion and interpretation of these results. We have incorporated the interpretation proposed by the reviewer, which we also consider as an entirely likely scenario.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Throughout the manuscript, it might be helpful to show some tuning curves (meaning response amplitude vs. polarization angle) as for now it is pretty hard to compare responses of the various types to each other.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above (Editorial section), we have included a new figure (Appendix 1—figure 1) which presents tuning curves for each neuron population together.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 1A could be improved by more hand holding for the reader unfamiliar with the DRA. It is currently hard to relate the inset to the rest of the panel.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this assessment and have completely revised the panel.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 5 and arguments about the distribution of preferred angles (Figure 5F, G). This might need to be qualified: first, the possible functional role of such a distribution can only be inferred if one knows how the post-synaptic partners sample it. Is there an argument for the sampling being homogeneous? Second, this is not impossible for some of this to be imputable to the imaging angle/projection used, where some part of the volume of the BU are less accessible/blurred by others.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising these good points and have added the following section to address them:</p><p>“Without further investigation of the downstream circuitry in the central complex that processes these polarized light inputs from the bulb, our interpretations of possible functional roles are somewhat speculative. […] However, due to the physical shape of the bulb and the organization of micro-glomeruli within it, combined with the relatively low resolution of our functional imaging experiments, we could not ascertain whether all TuBu neurons were individually separable and their spatial locations accurately captured within the imaging volume, and these issues could have affected the uniformity of the distributions that we observed.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #4:</p><p>Hardcastle and colleagues present work tracing polarized light signals through <italic>Drosophila's</italic> visual system, from the dorsal rim into the central complex. This work is important because it identifies pathways in <italic>Drosophila</italic> using synaptic tracing and employing tools that target specific neural populations. It ties its work in nicely to the extensive work on polarization vision in other insects. It is clearly written and its experiments are well conceived and explained.</p><p>I noted three areas where I think the paper could be strengthened:</p><p>1) The tracing and anatomical work is well done and convincing. However, since trans-tango's specificity to functional synapses remains a little uncertain, I think it would be very helpful to use the hemibrain dataset published earlier this year to confirm synapses between the neuron classes identified here. As a second part of this, and perhaps more important, it would be great to identify the correspondence between the TuBu type they reported and what is labeled in the hemibrain dataset. As of now on the hemibrain, there are 10 TuBu types (from TuBu01 to TuBu10) and TuBu01 seems to be specifically connected to R4m. This would be very important and useful information for readers who would want to further investigate these neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above (Editorial section), we have made numerous revisions to weave in the hemibrain dataset. In particular, we have added a table (Appendix 1—table 1) where we specify the driver lines used, match them to specific neuron types as annotated in the hemibrain dataset, and include data on the number of individual neurons assigned to each neuron type in the hemibrain/driver line.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The PSI is defined as (R<sub>para</sub> – R<sub>ortho</sub>)/(R<sub>para</sub> + R<sub>ortho</sub>). This maxes out at \pm 1 when all the responses are positive, but if any are negative, this formulation for an index doesn't work as well (for instance, allowing a divide by 0). I'm a bit confused about how this index was computed throughout, given that, for instance, the DmDRA1 neurons are inhibited by R7 via ort at anti-preferred angles, so there are nominally negative responses. Moreover, in the Materials and methods, it says F0 was computed as RMS F(t), to computed dF/F, but I don't see how this wouldn't lead to negative response values. I think the methodology for computing DSI needs to be clarified. In particular, how are the authors computing the responses – deviations from a baseline (computed how?) or are they setting the minimum measured dF/F to be a new 0 response?</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above (Editorial section), we have clarified these details in the text where first introduced.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It was quite surprising to me that a small source of polarized light could activate so much of the dorsal rim, as the authors also note. Were the flies w-/w- with the white gene only showing up as miniwhite on insertion constructs? If they had only orange or pink eyes, rather that wildtype red eyes, then that could explain it. As part of addressing this, the Materials and methods should include full genotypes for all experimental flies, not just stock references, to be able to evaluate this sort question directly.</p></disp-quote><p>That’s correct, and an interesting explanation. We cannot rule out the possibility that light hitting the rhabdomeres side-on or obliquely, as opposed to axially after entering via the lens, could have been responsible for some portion of the responses observed. However in that case we would expect that R7 and R8 responses would be similar for a given AoP, and neither would show a strong selectivity for a particular AoP. We therefore don’t believe that this effect alone could be responsible for the responses we observed.</p></body></sub-article></article>
