molecules playing a role in signal propagation through G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). However, exploration of the hydration features of GPCRs is still in its infancy. Here, we combined site-specific labeling with unnatural amino acids to molecular dynamics to delineate how local hydration of the ghrelin receptor growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR) is rearranged upon activation. We found that GHSR is characterized by a specific hydration pattern that is selectively remodeled by pharmacologically distinct ligands and by the lipid environment. This process is directly related to the concerted movements of the transmembrane domains of the receptor. These results demonstrate that the conformational dynamics of GHSR are tightly coupled to the movements of internal water molecules, further enhancing our understanding of the molecular bases of GPCR-mediated signaling.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>GPCR</kwd><kwd>hydration</kwd><kwd>signaling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-17-CE11-0011</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Banères</surname><given-names>Jean-Louis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-17-CE18-0022</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fehrentz</surname><given-names>Jean-Alain</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004100</institution-id><institution>Labex</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EpiGenMed</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ben haj salah</surname><given-names>Khoubaib</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006537</institution-id><institution>Campus France</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Ph-C882/17</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Floquet</surname><given-names>Nicolas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-17-CE11-0022</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Banères</surname><given-names>Jean-Louis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>European Union’s Horizon 2020</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement No 799376</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Casiraghi</surname><given-names>Marina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A combination of state-of-the-art biochemical, biophysical, and computational methods revealed that water molecules play a central role in signal propagation through G protein-coupled receptors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are major players in many central biological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lagerström and Schiöth, 2008</xref>). The diversity in the signaling properties of GPCRs indicates that this process cannot be fully described by the limited number of conformational states captured by X-ray crystallography and cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM). Indeed, GPCRs likely explore complex conformational landscapes, characterized by several meta-stable structural states. The relative distribution of these states is controlled by ligands, signaling proteins, and the environment, ultimately dictating the signaling output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Casiraghi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hilger et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wingler and Lefkowitz, 2020</xref>). As a consequence, the conformational dynamics of GPCRs and its modulation by the receptor’s environment are under intense scrutiny, as this should illuminate how signal transduction occurs.</p><p>Among all the components in the receptor environment that control receptor dynamics and signaling behavior, the solvent is to play an important but yet unexplored role. Many GPCR experimental structures indicate the occurrence of water molecules within their transmembrane (TM) regions. Some are located in the ligand-binding pocket and directly contribute to the energetics of ligand binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deflorian et al., 2020</xref>). Others lie in different cavities and have been proposed to be central to the allosteric propagation of the conformational rearrangements required for receptor activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lesca et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>). Yet, mechanistic models describing the dynamics and role of water molecules in GPCR functioning remain speculative, as only limited experimental information is available. Indeed, the relationship between GPCR conformational dynamics and local hydration has been mostly inferred from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with rhodopsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grossfield et al., 2008</xref>) and other receptors as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yuan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Venkatakrishnan et al., 2019</xref>). Although these simulations provide invaluable information on the arrangement and movements of water molecules, they nevertheless require further experimental support.</p><p>To analyze the hydration pattern of GPCRs, we used here an original strategy initially described with a model soluble protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amaro et al., 2015</xref>). This strategy combines site-specific labeling with unnatural amino acids (UAAs), fluorescence spectroscopy, and MD. This approach was applied to the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR). In addition to being a model for class A GPCRs, GHSR is a major target in pharmacology. Indeed, this receptor and its natural peptide agonist, ghrelin, are involved in most important biological processes such as the control of food intake, glucose metabolism, or reward and stress behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Müller et al., 2015</xref>). Using the emission properties of a particular UAA whose fluorescence emission properties are related to its hydration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amaro et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Choudhury et al., 2008</xref>), we found here that the ghrelin receptor hydration pattern is likely remodeled by orthosteric ligands and the lipid environment. In parallel, MD simulations provided a structural framework to the fluorescence observations and demonstrated that such a remodeling may be associated with collective movements of GHSR TM domains. Taken together, our data illuminate GPCR signaling with a mechanism where specific changes in the local hydration of the receptor could occur in a concerted manner with its conformational dynamics, in direct relationship to the activation process.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>GHSR labeling</title><p>We used L-(7-hydroxycoumarin-4-yl)-ethylglycine as a reporter of receptor local hydration. This UAA contains the L-(7-hydroxycoumarin-4-yl) (7H4MC) moiety whose emission properties are correlated to the presence of water molecules in its vicinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amaro et al., 2015</xref>). 7H4MC-ethylglycine was synthesized as described in the Materials and methods section and introduced in GHSR using codon suppression technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2006</xref>). To analyze receptor activation in a relevant membrane-like environment, the labeled receptor was inserted into lipid nanodiscs formed by the scaffolding MSP1E3D1 protein and a POPC:POPG mixture (see Materials and methods) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Damian et al., 2012</xref>). Under such conditions, homogeneous nanodisc populations of functional receptors were obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Of importance, the active receptor was purified through a ligand affinity chromatography step to ensure all the receptors in our preparations were competent with regard to ligand binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ferré et al., 2019</xref>). Accordingly, we repeatedly demonstrated that the receptor obtained under such conditions is totally functional with regard to ligand binding, and that its pharmacological profile is closely related to that of GHSR expressed in HEK cell membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ferré et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>7H4MC-ethylglycine was introduced at several, single positions within the TM domains of GHSR, namely Y81<sup>2.42</sup>, W104<sup>2.65</sup>, Y106<sup>2.67</sup>, F119<sup>3.28</sup>, F121<sup>3.30</sup>, I134<sup>3.43</sup>, F179<sup>4.61</sup>, W215<sup>5.41</sup>, Y232<sup>5.58</sup>, V268<sup>6.40</sup>, F272<sup>6.44</sup>, Y303<sup>7.33</sup>, or S315<sup>7.45</sup> (superscript numbers follow Ballesteros-Weinstein numbering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ballesteros and Weinstein, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>]). In all the cases, protein expression yields markedly decreased but, with the exception of the F119<sup>3.28</sup> mutant that was not expressed at a detectable level, the amounts of purified receptor obtained were still compatible with the fluorescence experiments, that is, in the range of a hundred of µg per liter of bacterial culture. However, the modified receptors bearing 7H4MC-ethylglycine at position Y81<sup>2.42</sup>, W104<sup>2.65</sup>, Y106<sup>2.67</sup>, F119<sup>3.28</sup>, F121<sup>3.30</sup>, F179<sup>4.61</sup>, and Y303<sup>7.43</sup> could not be purified through the ligand affinity chromatography step, indicating that replacing the native residue with 7H4MC-ethylglycine affected their three-dimensional fold and/or their ability to bind ligands. In addition, replacing W215<sup>5.41</sup> with 7H4MC-ethylglycine markedly decreased the basal activity of the receptor, although this mutant could still bind its ligands and be activated by ghrelin. In contrast, for the other positions, that is, I134<sup>3.43</sup>, Y232<sup>5.58</sup>, V268<sup>6.40</sup>, F272<sup>6.44</sup>, and S315<sup>7.45</sup>, replacing the naturally occurring residue with 7H4MC-ethylglycine affected neither ghrelin binding nor the receptor-catalyzed Gq activation in a relevant manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">6</xref>). Hence, only these mutants were considered in our analyses. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, the modified proteins displayed an emission spectrum characteristic of the 7H4MC moiety, while the wild-type receptor had no significant emission signal when excited at the same wavelength.

To this end, we analyzed the 7H4MC emission profile for each of the positions considered. An excitation wavelength of 320 nm was systematically used to excite the neutral form of the fluorophore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amaro et al., 2015</xref>). The emission spectra were deconvoluted into their separate components using the procedure initially described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amaro et al., 2015</xref>). A hydration parameter H was then determined that corresponded to the sum of the contributions of the anionic and tautomer forms. This parameter is an indicator of the extent of hydration at the position considered, as the higher the H parameter the higher local hydration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amaro et al., 2015</xref>). A difference in the H parameter inferred for the 7H4MC probe at the different positions of the apo GHSR was observed depending on the position considered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>). Indeed, all positions were hydrated to some extent, but some displayed a high H value characteristic of high hydration (3.43, 6.40) whereas others displayed a low H value suggestive of a lower local hydration (5.58, 6.44, 7.45). This indicates that 7H4MC fluorescence is a good indicator to discriminate between different local hydration states in the receptor structure. Besides, these data show that local hydration, as reported by 7H4MC fluorescence, depends on the region of the TM domain considered, with some regions more accessible to the solvent than others, even for closely related positions in the receptor structure (e.g., V268<sup>6.40</sup> and F272<sup>6.44</sup>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Impact of ligands on GHSR local hydration</title><p>We then used 7H4MC fluorescence to monitor the impact of ligand binding on the hydration pattern of GHSR. To this end, the H parameter was measured in the presence of saturating concentrations in ligands from different pharmacological classes, that is, the natural full agonist (ghrelin), a neutral antagonist (JMV3011), a Gq-biased partial agonist (JMV3002), and an inverse agonist (substance-P analog [SPA]) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">M'Kadmi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Binding of JMV3011 to labeled GHSR was not accompanied by a measurable change in the hydration parameter for any of the positions considered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). This is to be related to our previous observations demonstrating that binding of this compound was not associated with any change in the conformation of isolated GHSR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mary et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Damian et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, changes in the H parameter were observed at some specific positions upon binding of either the full agonist ghrelin, the Gq-biased agonist JMV3002, or the inverse agonist SPA. Specifically, ghrelin binding was associated with an increase in the hydration parameter at position 5.58 while local hydration at position 6.44 decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">6</xref>). Besides 5.58 and 6.44, no relevant change in the hydration parameter was observed for the other positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). This indicates that agonist-induced GHSR activation is accompanied by a concerted parallel increase and decrease of the local hydration in specific regions of the receptor, namely here TM5 and TM6. Interestingly, no change was observed for V268<sup>6.40</sup> whereas a decrease in the H parameter was measured for the probe at F272<sup>6.44</sup>, although both positions are close in GHSR structure. This suggests that 7H4MC fluorescence is well adapted to monitor hydration changes in a very local environment and that changes in local hydration likely occur at specific, spatially restricted sites. Perhaps not surprisingly, binding of the inverse agonist SPA was accompanied by a change in the hydration parameter opposite to that observed with ghrelin, that is, the H parameter decreased and increased for positions 5.58 and 6.44, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>), consistent with the opposite effect of ghrelin and SPA on GHSR activation and conformational landscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mary et al., 2012</xref>). Finally, the hydration pattern in the presence of JMV3002 was different from that observed in the presence of ghrelin. Indeed, while the binding of this compound was still accompanied by a decrease in the hydration parameter at position 6.44, as in the case of ghrelin binding, no change was observed for the probe at position 5.58 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). This could be related to the differences in the pharmacological profile of the two compounds, as ghrelin is a full agonist whereas JMV3002 is a Gq partial agonist that triggers neither Gi activation nor arrestin recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">M'Kadmi et al., 2015</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Local hydration of growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR) as a function of ligands.</title><p>H parameter for the 7H4MC-labeled GHSR in the absence of ligand (apo) and in the presence of JMV3011, ghrelin, JMV3002, or SPA (substance-P analog).

The crystal structure of the inactive, antagonist-loaded state of the receptor has been solved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shiimura et al., 2020</xref>) and was used as a starting point for our MD studies. Besides, two cryo-EM structures of the ghrelin receptor in complex with ghrelin or a synthetic agonist and a Gq mimetic have been posted on the BioRxiv preprint server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.09.447478">https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.09.447478</ext-link>). However, since the coordinates of these structures are not yet available, we had to model an active-like state of GHSR in the absence of its cognate G protein (see Materials and methods). A projection of all conformers explored during our simulations confirmed their compatibility with experimental structures, describing mainly inactive and intermediate states (based on the classification in the GPCRdb; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pándy-Szekeres et al., 2018</xref>), the latter corresponding to an activated receptor without the G protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, analysis of the statistical water distribution in GHSR confirmed that differences in the hydration pattern could exist depending on its inactive/active states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). More importantly, these differences effectively occurred in the regions where the 7H4MC-ethylglycine residue had been inserted in our experiments. Four out of five simulations starting from the X-ray (inactive) structure of GHSR converged toward a same hydration pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-D</xref>). In the last simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), the water statistically occupied a larger volume on the intracellular side of the receptor. Of interest, this distribution of water molecules in the inactive state was in agreement with the distribution described recently for other receptors of the same family using similar methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Venkatakrishnan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bertalan et al., 2020</xref>). In agreement with our experimental data, the water distribution in the inactive conformation of the receptor showed the presence of water molecules around F272<sup>6.44</sup> whereas Y232<sup>5.58</sup> was not solvated. Accordingly, I134<sup>3.43</sup> was also in contact with water molecules. However, and in contradiction with our experiments, V268<sup>6.40</sup> was not in contact with water molecule in the inactive state whereas S315<sup>7.45</sup> was. V268<sup>6.40</sup> occupies a central position in the receptor whereas S315<sup>7.45</sup> is close to the interface between TM6 and TM7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). If insertion of 7H4MC-ethylglycine at positions 134<sup>3.43</sup>, 232<sup>5.58</sup>, and 272<sup>6.44</sup> are more conservative in terms of residue size, the insertion of 7H4MC in place of a valine (V268<sup>6.40</sup>) or a serine (S315<sup>7.45</sup>) suggests a stronger adaptation of the receptor fold to these mutations. To clarify the possible orientations of 7H4MC-ethylglycine into the receptor, we thus computed adiabatic maps for positions 268<sup>6.40</sup> and 315<sup>7.45</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). In the case of 7H4MC-ethylglycine at position 268<sup>6.40</sup>, the adiabatic map confirmed that this large residue, in comparison to a valine, allowed interaction with solvent molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). For the 315<sup>7.45</sup> position, even the adiabatic map suggested that this residue could conserve its initial orientation toward the interior of the receptor and should be highly solvated.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Water distribution in growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR) as observed along the five independent 5 µs molecular dynamics (MD) simulations starting from either the inactive (<bold>A to E</bold>) or the active (<bold>F to J</bold>) states of the receptor.</title><p>(<bold>E and J</bold>) panels show simulations where GHSR transited from inactive to active (<bold>E</bold>) or from active to inactive (<bold>J</bold>) states, respectively.

This profile was explained by a spreading of TM6 during the simulation, thus leading to conformers close to those observed when starting from the active-like state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Accordingly, the resulting hydration pattern was very close to that obtained in the simulations starting from the active-like state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F-I</xref>). In this pattern, water molecules were more uniformly distributed in the receptor including its lower, intracellular part. Indeed, the main structural difference between both states was the spreading of TM6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), which contributed to a large water influx into the intracellular moiety of the receptor. In this pattern, and in agreement with the fluorescence experiments, I134<sup>3.43</sup>, Y232<sup>6.44</sup>, and V268<sup>6.40</sup> were all in close contact with water molecules whereas F272<sup>6.44</sup> was flipped toward TM5, contributing to reduce its interactions with surrounding water (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). This structural feature was found to be conserved in all GPCRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>We also obtained a simulation starting from the active state that showed a different behavior from other simulations, that is, a closure and a loss of hydration in the intracellular part of the receptor due to a motion of TM7 inside the receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). Such a motion was compatible with the direction coded by the experimental structures and shown by principal component analysis (PCA), where the first two eigenvectors displayed this inward motion of TM7 concomitant to TM6 spreading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). Accordingly, in this simulation, the resulting hydration pattern was very close to those observed in the simulations starting from the inactive state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Impact of lipids on GHSR local hydration</title><p>In their native environment, receptors are surrounded not only by the solvent but also by the lipid bilayer. To provide an illustration of the impact of the environment of the ghrelin receptor on its local hydration, we finally analyzed the effect of the lipid composition of the nanodiscs on 7H4MC fluorescence for the two positions that were affected by receptor activation. Specifically, we measured the hydration parameter for the probe at positions 5.58 and 6.44 with GHSR assembled into POPC:POPG nanodiscs in the absence or presence of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), a lipid that has been shown to impact on the activity of many different membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hammond and Burke, 2020</xref>) including GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yen et al., 2018</xref>) and, more recently, the ghrelin receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Damian et al., 2021</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, the H parameter for the two positions that were sensitive to receptor activation was further affected by PIP2. Indeed, adding 2.5% of this lipid to the nanodiscs increased the H parameter for position 5.58 and concomitantly decreased that for position 6.44. PIP2 therefore exalted the effect of the full agonist ghrelin had on the receptor hydration features. This suggests that PIP2 further shifts the conformational equilibrium toward hydration pattern associated with the active-like conformation of GHSR, indicative of an allosteric coupling between the full agonist and PIP2 for stabilizing this state. This effect could explain the impact of PIP2 on GHSR-catalyzed G protein activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Damian et al., 2021</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Impact of lipids on the local hydration of growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR).</title><p>H parameter for L-(7-hydroxycoumarin-4-yl) (7H4MC)-labeled GHSR assembled into nanodiscs containing or not phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) (2.5% PIP2-to-total lipids molar ratio), in the presence of 10 µM ghrelin.

However, illuminating this role is complicated by the lack of straightforward experimental approaches that could help delineate the hydration pattern of receptors under a variety of conditions. To decipher the concerted changes in the hydration pattern and conformational repertoire of GHSR, we used here a strategy combining advanced MD to fluorescence spectroscopy, an approach that had been previously developed with a model protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amaro et al., 2015</xref>). Specifically, 7H4MC-ethylglycine was incorporated at specific positions in GHSR through codon suppression technology. 7H4MC-ethylglycine includes the 7H4MC fluorophore whose emission properties are directly dependent on the water content in its microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Georgieva et al., 2005</xref>). Of importance, this chromophore has been shown not to affect the global hydration levels but, in some particular situations, only to influence the residence time of water molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Georgieva et al., 2005</xref>). It therefore should not markedly modify the hydration pattern of the protein, with the condition it does not affect its three-dimensional fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Georgieva et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The fluorescent probe was introduced at different positions along GHSR sequence. Among all the mutants we considered, only those involving I134<sup>3.43</sup>, Y232<sup>5.58</sup>, V268<sup>6.40</sup>, F272<sup>6.44</sup>, and S315<sup>7.45</sup> were essentially neutral with regard to the ability of the receptor to bind ghrelin and activate Gq. This suggests that incorporation of 7H4MC-ethylglycine at these positions does not dramatically perturb the three-dimensional fold of the ghrelin receptor. The absence of major effect on substituting F272<sup>6.44</sup> with 7H4MC-ethylglycine on GHSR functioning was puzzling, as mutating this residue to an alanine had been shown to abolish GHSR constitutive activity and reduce ghrelin-induced signaling without affecting ghrelin binding affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Valentin-Hansen et al., 2012</xref>). However, replacing the phenylalanine with a tyrosine had a far lower impact on both basal- and ghrelin-induced GHSR activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Valentin-Hansen et al., 2012</xref>). As concluded by the authors, a possible mechanism would be that a rigid, aromatic group is required at this position for stabilizing the receptor active state. This could explain why replacing phenylalanine with 7H4MC-ethylglycine did not lead to a major decrease in GHSR activity.</p><p>The fluorescence properties of 7H4MC were affected by the activation state of GHSR only when the probe was located at positions 5.58 and 6.44. Besides these two positions, highly hydrated, invariant positions were observed. These could correspond to regions of the receptor directly accessible to the solvent whatever its activation state is. Alternatively, hydration at these positions could include the contribution of water molecules with a structural rather than a functional role. Changes in the hydration pattern of GPCRs have been shown either to involve a direct rearrangement of the water molecules in the receptor ligand-binding pocket upon ligand binding or to result from the conformational changes associated with receptor activation. The two positions where we observed a change in the H parameter upon agonist binding, that is, Y232<sup>5.58</sup> and F272<sup>6.44</sup>, are both located outside the major putative ligand-binding pocket of GHSR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shiimura et al., 2020</xref>). The effects we observed on the H parameter upon ligand binding are thus not likely to be the direct consequence of the rearrangement of water molecules within the GHSR binding pocket but may rather result from differences in the hydration pattern of the different conformational states of GHSR, as fully supported by our MD simulations.</p><p>The emission profile of 7H4MC reflects the average, equilibrium contribution of the hydration pattern in the different GHSR states present in the solution. Any change in the emission properties of the probe thus implies (i) a change in the distribution of the different states in the receptor conformational landscape and (ii) a difference in the hydration features of these states. Taken together, the variations we observed therefore demonstrate that the remodeling of the hydration pattern is an integral component of the rearrangement of the GHSR conformational repertoire associated with receptor activation. This remodeling is directly correlated to concerted, specific and well-defined movements in the TM domains of the receptor, as demonstrated by MD. This is fully consistent with previous work demonstrating the role of water molecules in the activation process of other GPCRs such as the GLP-1 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wootten et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wootten et al., 2016b</xref>). Whether our data reflects the fact that water molecules are allosteric players in the activation process, as demonstrated for other proteins including rhodopsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chawla et al., 2021</xref>), or that the movements of water molecules compensate the changes in the intramolecular voids within the different states involved in receptor activation remains an open question.</p><p>In parallel to the fluorescence approach, we used a complementary approach based on MD simulations that was aimed at providing a structural framework to the experimental observables. This method is dedicated to the exploration of the conformational space accessible to the receptor without any bias. Indeed, structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) can help in identifying hotspots for protein-water interactions, but in more than half of the available structures the resolution is not good enough to observe any water molecules. Moreover, static structures do not inform about the dynamical behavior of water molecule inside the receptor. Structures often show isolated water molecule in interaction with the protein and give no clue about the global hydration of the receptor’s pockets. MD simulations of inactive and active state of GHSR allowed us to analyze a fully solvated receptor, where the global hydration pattern varied as a function of the conformational state of the receptor. Even though we simulated the wild-type GHSR, sidechain positions and hydration patterns in both states were compatible with our experiment for positions 134<sup>3.43</sup>, 232<sup>5.58</sup>, 268<sup>6.40</sup>, and 272<sup>6.44</sup>. In contrast, however, the hydration at position 315<sup>7.45</sup> did not agree with our experimental results. A possibility would be that the size of the residue itself excludes water molecules from its vicinity, and/or orients it toward the membrane, thus explaining the low hydration in the inactive and the active states of the receptor we measured experimentally.</p><p>Interestingly, a difference in the GHSR hydration pattern was observed depending on whether the ligand was a full or a Gq-biased agonist. This indicates a different arrangement of the water network in the conformational states stabilized by these ligands. This is in line with previous observations with NK1R where mutation of the water hydrogen bond network affected Gq- and Gs-mediated signaling in a different way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Valentin-Hansen et al., 2015</xref>). In the same way, the central polar network in the GLP1 receptor has been suggested to be critical for G protein-dependent but not for G protein-independent signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wootten et al., 2016a</xref>). Taken together, this data indicates that the different states in the GHSR conformational landscape differ in their hydration pattern, as stated above but, in addition, that ligands with different pharmacological profiles, here a full and a partial, biased agonist, have a different impact on the distribution of these states. This conclusion with GHSR is consistent with our previous data using a different conformational reporter, monobromobimane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mary et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In addition to ligands, other components in the receptor environment allosterically impact on GPCR activation and conformational dynamics. This is the case of the lipid bilayer whose composition has been shown to impact on the structure and function of many different membrane proteins including ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hille et al., 2015</xref>) and receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Strohman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dawaliby et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Casiraghi et al., 2016</xref>). Among the lipids reported to affect GPCR signaling such as cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Casiraghi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zocher et al., 2012</xref>) or charged phospholipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Strohman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dawaliby et al., 2016</xref>), PIP2 has been shown to stabilize the receptor:G protein complex for the adenosine A2a-, β<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic, and neurotensin receptor 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yen et al., 2018</xref>). More recently, we showed that PIP2 could be an allosteric regulator of ghrelin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Damian et al., 2021</xref>). Accordingly, we observed here that including PIP2 in the nanodiscs was associated with a further amplification of the changes in 7H4MC fluorescence triggered by ghrelin, reflecting the allosteric coupling between the full agonist and this lipid for stabilizing an active-like hydration pattern of GHSR.</p><p>In closing, the combination of incorporation of 7H4MC-ethylglycine into proteins, fluorescence spectroscopy, and advanced MD simulations provided us with a straightforward strategy to delineate conformational events associated with GHSR activation through an unexplored but nevertheless central feature in the functioning of membrane proteins, local hydration. Using this strategy, we found that the hydration pattern in specific regions of TM5 and TM6 is dependent on the activation state of the receptor. This illuminates an unexpected role of water molecules as possible allosteric modulators of GHSR activation, consistent with their general effect on the allosteric regulation of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Leitner et al., 2020</xref>). Hence, a model emerges where the activation process of GPCRs and their final signaling output could be the result of the concerted, synergistic, and exquisitely tuned influence of all the components in the receptor environment, including the solvent, on the distribution of the different states composing their conformational landscape. In addition, these observations demonstrate that water movements are tightly correlated to the receptor activation process and could therefore be used as a fingerprint to navigate the conformational landscape of GPCRs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

The protein was finally eluted from the column with the same buffer containing 200 mM imidazole and dialyzed into a 25 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM β-DDM, 0.02% (w/v) CHS, 10 µM JMV3011 buffer. For reconstitution into nanodiscs, the His-tagged receptor in 25 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM β-DDM was first bound onto a pre-equilibrated Ni-NTA superflow resin at a protein-to-resin ratio at 0.1–0.2 mg of receptor per mL of slurry (batch conditions). The receptor was then mixed with 10 µM of JMV3011, and with MSP1E3D1(-) and a POPC:POPG (3:2 molar ratio) mixture, in the absence or presence of PIP2 (2.5% PIP2-to-total lipid molar ratio), at a 0.1:1:75 receptor:MSP:lipid ratio, with the receptor still immobilized on the Ni-NTA matrix. After 1 hr incubation at 4°C, polystyrene beads (Bio-Beads SM-2) were added to the slurry at an 80% (w/v) ratio and incubated under smooth stirring for 4 hr at 4°C. The resin was then extensively washed with a 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 150 mM NaCl buffer, and the His-tagged receptor eluted with the same buffer containing 200 mM imidazole. After extensive dialysis in a 25 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, pH 7.5 buffer, active receptor fractions were purified using affinity chromatography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ferré et al., 2019</xref>). To this end, the receptor in lipid discs was loaded on a streptavidin-agarose column where the biotinylated JMV2959 antagonist had been bound following manufacturer’s instructions. After washing with 25 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, the bound proteins were recovered by washing the column with the same buffer containing 1 mM of the low affinity JMV4183 antagonist. This antagonist was then removed through extensive dialysis against a 25 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, pH 7.4 buffer. We previously demonstrated that under such conditions all the ligand is removed from its binding site on GHSR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ferré et al., 2019</xref>). Homogeneous fractions of GHSR-containing discs were finally obtained through a size-exclusion chromatography step on an S200 increase column (10/300 GL) using the 25 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, pH 7.4 buffer as the eluent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Receptor labeling for ligand-binding assays</title><p>To avoid any labeling of the scaffolding protein, labeling of the receptor N-terminus with the amine-reactive Tb chelate for the HTRF-monitored ligand-binding assays was carried out in the APol-folded state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Damian et al., 2012</xref>), that is, before insertion into the nanodiscs. To this end, the receptor in A8-35 was dialyzed in a 50 mM potassium phosphate, 100 M KCl, pH 7.7 buffer. This pH value was determined from a series of labeling reactions we first carried out at different pH to define the optimal value for labeling essentially the protein N-terminal α-amine and not the lysyl ε-amino groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Damian et al., 2012</xref>), which display a higher pKa value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grimsley et al., 2009</xref>). The amine-reactive chelate was added to the protein solution (dye-to-protein equimolar ratio), and the reaction was carried out overnight at 4°C under constant stirring. The conjugate was separated from any possible unreacted labeling reagent by desalting on a ZebaSpin 40K column. Specific labeling of the N-terminal amine was assessed in a pilot experiment by the absence of fluorescence of the labeled receptor after digestion with TEV of a construct we designed to determine if labeling indeed occurred essentially at the GHSR N-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). The receptor reconstitution procedure was then continued by exchanging the APol to β-DDM and assembly into nanodiscs, as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Ghrelin1-18-DY647P1 synthesis</title><p>The structure of the fluorescent ghrelin peptide we used in the ligand-binding experiments is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>.

We mutated back to wild-type amino acids the two mutations (T130<sup>3.39</sup>K and N188Q) that were present in the structure to match the wild-type sequence, and modeled the extracellular loop three ab initio (ECL3 – residue G293 to I300), with MODELLER 9.19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Webb and Sali, 2016</xref>). Two cryo-EM structures of the ghrelin receptor in complex with ghrelin or a synthetic agonist and a Gq mimetic have been posted on the BioRxiv preprint server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.09.447478">https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.09.447478</ext-link>). However, the coordinates of these models are not yet available. Hence, in order to capture differences in the receptor hydration pattern upon activation, we generated an active-like model of GHSR by targeted molecular dynamics (TMD) simulations performed in an explicit membrane environment. First, we modeled the target conformation based on the dopamine D2 receptor coupled to Gi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yin et al., 2020</xref>) (D2R:Gi, PDB id: 6VMS; sequence similarity: 33%) by homology modeling using MODELLER 9.19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Webb and Sali, 2016</xref>). The sequence alignment between GHSR and D2 was achieved with ClustalW (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Larkin et al., 2007</xref>). The best out of 100 models built by MODELLER, regarding DOPE score, was further selected as the target conformation for the subsequent TMD. The TMD simulation was run with NAMD 2.13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Phillips et al., 2020</xref>), where the inactive experimental conformation was pushed toward the newly generated active conformation. Inactive GHSR was embedded in a lipid bilayer containing 156 POPC (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine), for a size of 80×80 Å<sup>2</sup>. The system was then solvated and neutralized with a NaCl concentration around 0.15 M (17,270 water molecules, 46 sodium, and 29 chloride ions) with CHARMM-GUI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brooks et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jo et al., 2008</xref>). In order to limit the deviation from the initial experimental structure, the force during TMD was only applied to residues of the intracellular part of TM helix 6 (TM6, from S252<sup>6.24</sup> to L277<sup>6.49</sup>), which are known to undergo the largest conformational changes during activation of all known GPCRs. All remaining atoms of GHSR were harmonically restrained in position using a force constant of 1 kcal/mol/Å<sup>2</sup>, but residues L239<sup>5.65</sup> to A251 (ICL3), so that the loop could follow the motion of TM6. Prior to TMD, the system was minimized using 10,000 steps of conjugate gradient as implemented in NAMD 2.13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Phillips et al., 2020</xref>), followed by successive short equilibration procedures in NVT and NPT ensembles, to reach a final temperature of 300 K and a pressure of 1 bar using CHARMM36m force field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang et al., 2017</xref>). We did not modify the equilibration procedure designed by CHARMM-GUI developers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wu et al., 2014</xref>). The TMD simulation was performed in the NPT ensemble (300 K and 1 bar) over a period of 500 ps using a force constant of 200 kcal/mol/Å<sup>2</sup> scaled down by the number of selected atoms in TM6 (477 atoms including hydrogens). Non-bonded interactions were truncated at a distance cut-off of 12 Å applying a switching function in the range 10–12 Å, while long range electrostatics were computed via particle mesh Ewald (PME).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11-2"><title>MD simulations of inactive and active-like conformers of wild-type GHSR</title><p>The inactive (experimental) and active (modeled) conformers of GHSR were simulated by MD with Gromacs 2020.3 using the CHARMM36m force field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang et al., 2017</xref>). To fit to the experimental membrane composition used in this study, each conformer was embedded in a symmetric lipid bilayer of size 80×80 Å<sup>2</sup>, where each layer was composed of 20 cholesterol, 28 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (POPG), 42 POPC, and 10 phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) (including five PIP2 protonated on one phosphate group and five PIP2 protonated on the other phosphate group, named respectively POPI24 and POPI25 in CHARMM36m force field). Systems were solvated and their charges were neutralized with a NaCl concentration around 0.15 M (17,751 water, 170 sodium, and 47 chloride ions). The simulation setup was done with the CHARMM-GUI webserver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brooks et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jo et al., 2008</xref>). Contrary to the TMD protocol, we did change the default CHARMM-GUI procedure for equilibration. Indeed, we added three additional equilibration steps to the default CHARMM-GUI procedure. We modified the harmonic restraints on atomic positions and the number of simulation steps to allow a smooth relaxation of the systems (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We reproduced this protocol five times for each system (active and inactive) modifying the starting velocities so that the convergence of the resulting data could be discussed. The production was run in the NPT ensemble (300 K and 1 bar) for 5 µs (leading to a simulation time of 50 µs in total). It is important to notice that, during production, all restraints and constraints were removed. For all simulations, direct non-bonded interactions were truncated at a distance cut-off of 12 Å applying a switching function in the 10–12 Å range, while long range electrostatics were computed via PME.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11-3"><title>PCA of experimental structures</title><p>To delineate the possible motions described by the plethora of available GPCRs’ experimental structures, we retrieved 268 structures of class A GPCRs from the PDB. To homogenize these data, only the part corresponding to a single isolated receptor was conserved for further analysis, for instance removing the intra- and/or extracellular partner(s) if required or other copies of the same receptor in the case of dimeric structures. The sequences of all retrieved structures were then aligned with Clustal Omega (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Larkin et al., 2007</xref>) with default parameters. To perform PCA of the resulting set of coordinates, the length of the resulting sequences also required to be homogenous. As a compromise between the number of structures considered (increasing the conformational diversity) and the length of the sequence common to all receptors (improving the structural description), we decided to discard a residue at a particular position of the alignment if the latter was missing in at least two structures out of the 268. In addition, a structure was discarded if it was the only one presenting a missing residue at a specific position. Using these criteria, only six structures were deleted from the initial set (PDB id: 5WB2, 4PY0, 5ZKP, 3RZE, 4RWA, and 4DAJ). In summary, 262 structures were considered, together describing a set of 164 conserved amino acids (GHSR numbering: 45, 46, 48–68, 76–102, 120–148, 162–179, 181, 212, 213, 215–219, 221–239, 261, 263–286, 310–324).

Could the authors please provide original Coomassie stained gels and size exclusion chromatography traces that support their purification and re-incorporation of GHSR1a into the MSP scaffold? The authors report that they have expressed GHSR1a in bacteria then unfolded and refolded this protein, the reviewers are not aware of any other GPCR for which this has been successfully performed, indeed the structural paper that the authors discuss (below), uses a thermostabilized GHSR1a expressed in insect cells in order to obtain crystallizable protein. Additionally, the below paper uses a thermofluor assay to demonstrate the stabilization of their construct. The thermofluor assay, by its nature, indicates that GHSR1a does not spontaneously refold.</p><p>Shiimura Y, Horita S, Hamamoto A, Asada H, Hirata K, Tanaka M, Mori K, Uemura T, Kobayashi T, Iwata S, Kojima M. Structure of an antagonist-bound ghrelin receptor reveals possible ghrelin recognition mode. Nat Commun. 2020 Aug 19;11(1):4160. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-17554-1. PMID: 32814772; PMCID: PMC7438500.</p><p>2) As evidence of the functionality of the refolded, purified and MSP incorporated GHSR1a the authors provide a FRET competition binding assay. There is insufficient explanation of this assay for this to be reproduced by another group. In the method the authors indicate that the GHSR1a is labelled at the N-terminus with Lumi-4 Tb NHS. NHS esters typically react with any primary amine, in the authors methods they have the purified GHSR1a in a 25 mM Tris buffer, where the Tris would be expected to preferentially react with the Lumi-4 Tb NHS, the GHSR1a is also incorporated into MSP, which has an N-terminus and both proteins have a number of lysine residues where the Lumi-4 Tb NHS would be expected to react with the epsilon amino group. Perhaps there are some significant details missing from their methods that might enlighten this? In any case, could the authors please provide their in-gel fluorescence (or alternative analysis such as mass spectrometry) that demonstrates specific labelling of GHSR1a (and not MSP) on the N-terminus (and not on lysine side chains)? This assay uses a dy647 labelled ghrelin peptide, could the authors please provide details of how the labelling was performed and either HPLC of mass spec data for the resulting labelled reagent? The cited reference (19) does not appear to contain this reagent, whereas the cited reference (33) does contain a &quot;red-ghrelin&quot; where no details about the chemical composition are readily available. The published affinity of ghrelin for GHSR1a is 400 pM (https://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/ObjectDisplayForward?objectId=246), the authors need to specifically address why the reported affinity in their assay (Figure 1B) appears to be approximately 250 fold lower at ~100 nM? Could the authors also please provide the original, non-normalised FRET data so that the reader can understand the window for this assay along with a specificity control such as Lumi-4 Tb NHS labelled empty MSP nanosdiscs?</p><p>3) In figure 1C the authors provide further evidence for functionality of their purified GHSR1a using a GTP turnover assay. The authors need to provide the full details of how the Galpha/β/γ heterotrimer were expressed and purified for this assay. Please include details of which particular isoform and species each G protein subunit is from, the expression system and how they were purified. A representative Coomassie stained gel that demonstrates stoichiometric equivalence of the subunits in the purified complex should also be supplied. The references provided for this assay to not appear to relate to a GTP depletion style assay as appears to be described here. Could the authors also please describe how 0% was defined for the assay and the relative concentrations of GHSR1a and G proteins heterotrimer that were added to the reactions? The authors show apparent differences in bound GTP in this assay, could they please provide a statistical analysis for these differences?</p><p>Related to simulations:</p><p>1) Driving large structural changes fast is risky, and the reviewers were not convinced the water populations had equilibrated. Indeed, forces to enhance the sampling were applied along each PC separately. Since these PCs represent a linear decomposition of the overall family-wide conformational change, it didn't appear wise to enhance the sampling along them: linear decomposition of the movement could in principle result in very non-physical motions. Can the authors provide the readers with a supplementary figure showing the comparison between the starting and the 2 end structures, as well as the PDBs of the resulting structures so their quality can be checked?</p><p>Relatedly, the mix of active-like and inactive-like structures used in the PCA to derive the biasing forces is expected to have a major effect. The authors need to explicitly list (in the supplement) the structures used, and categorize them by activity state and preferably by GPCR family as well. The first principle vector probably point more or less along the path between inactive and active, but it would be nice to check this.</p><p>2) The reviewers also asked for a clearer rationalization of why the authors picked this sampling strategy as opposed to (1) building models of the ghrelin receptor in different states and simulating them or (2) enhancing the sampling using a non-linear approach. Ultimately, what do we learn from the fact that PC1 is the most compatible with the experimental data, given that the overall motion is a combination of all the PCs? It would be wise to replicate the results with a more standard MD simulation protocol to rule out artefacts from this choice of enhanced sampling methods.</p><p>3) Additionally, the methods section was unclear about several aspects:</p><p>a) it is unclear as to how many replicates were done for each mode: if it's a single replicate for each mode, no conclusion could be drawn about the hydration. To have any confidence in the result, the reviewers would want to see the simulations rerun many times (at least 10x, perhaps more depending on how variable the answer is), preferably starting from different structures within the equilibrated ensemble.</p><p>b) Which state does the original model represent? Can the comparison to the recently published structure be more thorough than simply showing a Calpha(?) RMSD (Figure S8)? Are the enhanced sampling MD carried out in presence or absence of ligand and why? Finally the method section as well as the Results section explaining the enhanced sampling protocol should be clarified such that it is not necessary to read the original paper explaining the method to understand.</p><p>c) Many key details of the simulations are missing: number of lipids, number of waters, electrostatics method (as written, it sounds like they didn't use Ewald, which would be a huge problem).</p><p>d) There is no discussion of statistical convergence. The simulations are very short by today's standards, and the reviewers saw no reason to assume the protein has stopped systematically changing after 300-350 ns (given the uncertainty of starting from a homology model), let alone begun actually sampling. The only evidence is Supp Figure 5, which shows the RMSD is still increasing, while nothing at all is shown for the mutants.</p><p>e) As it stands, too many details are missing for these calculations to be repeated. Please collect and document all of the scripts used (building the system, running, and analyzing) and put them either into the supplementary info or better yet into a separate repository (e.g. GitHub, zenodo, etc).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.63201.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Related to experiments:</p><p>1) Please address the functionality of the expressed, refolded and MSP incorporated GHSR1a.

As evidenced by these SEC and SDS-PAGE profiles, the GHSR-containing discs correspond to a homogeneous fraction composed of the scaffolding protein and receptor only. To be noted, faint bands corresponding to multimeric receptor species are present in the SDS gel, but this does not reflect the occurrence of such species in the nanodiscs. Indeed, we previously demonstrated unambiguously using native gel electrophoresis and fluorescence transfer that the conditions we use for nanodisc assembly (large MSP-to-receptor molar ratio, on-matrix batch assembly with a large resin-to-protein ratio) provide lipid discs with a single receptor (1). Similar conditions were also shown to provide monomeric receptor for a series of other GPCRs, including rhodopsin and the b<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor (2,3). Oligomerization of a membrane protein on an SDS-PAGE, as in the case of the gel in Figure 1—figure supplement 1, does not reflect its oligomerization state in solution when associated to various surfactants or lipids. Indeed, at the concentration used to run a gel, SDS is known to only partially unfold these membrane proteins and trigger some aggregation, with the exception of β-barrel ones. The consequences most frequently encountered are an anomalously electrophoretic mobility and protein aggregation in the gel (R.B. Gennis “Biomembranes: Molecular Structure and Function”, Springer Science, 1989, page 93&quot;; Rath et al. (2009) (4)).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors report that they have expressed GHSR1a in bacteria then unfolded and refolded this protein, the reviewers are not aware of any other GPCR for which this has been successfully performed, indeed the structural paper that the authors discuss (below), uses a thermostabilized GHSR1a expressed in insect cells in order to obtain crystallizable protein.

It has nevertheless been successfully used in several occasions by us and others, first for an olfactory receptor (5), and then for different GPCRs such as the receptors for neuropeptides Y1 and Y2 (6,7), ghrelin (1,8,9), chemokine (10,11), leukotriene B4 (12,13) or serotonin (14). In all cases, the receptor obtained was representative of the native one in terms of ligand binding and activation of G proteins. This is the case for the ghrelin receptor we used in the present work that, since our <italic>princeps</italic> paper in 2012 (1), has been repeatedly shown by us and others to be structurally and pharmacologically relevant (8,9,15-19) (see below). Besides, in our opinion, GHSR produced in <italic>sf9</italic> cell for crystallization purposes can be hardly compared to the present situation, as the former study dealt with a significantly different version of GHSR where the receptor was fused to BRIL at its N-terminus, devoid of its N- and C-terminal regions, thermostabilized through specific mutations and purified in a detergent solution.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) As evidence of the functionality of the refolded, purified and MSP incorporated GHSR1a the authors provide a FRET competition binding assay. There is insufficient explanation of this assay for this to be reproduced by another group. In the method the authors indicate that the GHSR1a is labelled at the N-terminus with Lumi-4 Tb NHS. NHS esters typically react with any primary amine, in the authors methods they have the purified GHSR1a in a 25 mM Tris buffer, where the Tris would be expected to preferentially react with the Lumi-4 Tb NHS, the GHSR1a is also incorporated into MSP, which has an N-terminus and both proteins have a number of lysine residues where the Lumi-4 Tb NHS would be expected to react with the epsilon amino group. Perhaps there are some significant details missing from their methods that might enlighten this?</p></disp-quote><p>The description of the labeling procedure was not detailed enough, and we apologize for that. In fact, labeling of the scaffolding protein is not an issue, as the receptor is labeled before its assembly into nanodiscs, <italic>i.e.,</italic> in the amphipol-folded state. This procedure was described in our initial paper reporting production of GHSR in nanodiscs, although for a different version of the fluorophore (amine-reactive derivative of Alexa Fluor 350 instead of Tb chelate) (1). Before its assembly into nanodiscs, the receptor is first folded from an SDS- to an amphipol (APol)-stabilized state using a procedure we developed in close collaboration with J.-L. Popot’s laboratory (20). This procedure, which consists in exchanging SDS for APol through precipitation of the detergent as its potassium salt, allows recovery of the receptor as a stable APol:protein complex (see the SEC profile in the Figure 1—figure supplement 3B,C of the revised manuscript). Labeling with the fluorophore is then carried out at this stage. Briefly, the receptor in A8-35 APol is dialyzed in a 50 mM potassium phosphate, 100 M KCl, pH 7.7 buffer to remove any Tris salt that would indeed bias labeling, as appropriately noted by the reviewer. This pH value was determined from a series of labeling reactions we first carried out at different pH to define the optimal value for labeling essentially the protein N terminal a-amine and not the lysyl e-amino groups (1), which display a significantly higher pKa value (the average pKa values in proteins is 7.7 and 10.5 for the N-terminal a- and lysine e-amino groups, respectively (21)). The conjugate is then incubated with the Apol:protein complex under the conditions described in the Methods section and unreacted labeling reagent is removed by desalting on a ZebaSpin column (ThermoFisher). The receptor reconstitution procedure in continued by exchanging the amphipol to b-DDM and then assembling the labeled receptor into the nanodiscs. The full labeling protocol is now detailed in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In any case, could the authors please provide their in-gel fluorescence (or alternative analysis such as mass spectrometry) that demonstrates specific labelling of GHSR1a (and not MSP) on the N-terminus (and not on lysine side chains)?</p></disp-quote><p>In-gel fluorescence may not be totally effective in assessing N-terminal specific labeling of the receptor, as we think it cannot discriminate between different positions for the fluorophore. Besides, high-resolution mass spectrometry analysis of integral a-helical membrane proteins in lipid bilayers is still not technically trivial, at least in our hands. Therefore, we applied an alternative strategy we devised previously to ascertain N-terminal labeling of G proteins with a Tb chelate (17). The experiment consists in introducing a TEV cleavage site after the protein N-terminus (see schematic representation in the figure below). This construct was used for the present experiment only. Not to affect labeling, the TEV cleavage site was introduced 11 residues after the N-terminus of the receptor. We then carried out labeling as described above and subsequently cleaved the GHSR N-terminus using TEV protease. Removal of the N-terminal residues is not detrimental to the receptor’s fold, as indicated by the crystal structure of GHSR where 28 residues were removed from the receptor N-terminus (22). The TEV cleavage is almost quantitative, as shown by the SEC profile in Figure 1—figure supplement 3. Besides, this profile shows that most of the labeling occurs at the receptor N-terminus, as the Tb-chelate moiety absorbing at 337 nm is essentially found in the column total volume after TEV digestion. This is confirmed by the UV absorption and fluorescence spectra of the non-cleaved and cleaved proteins. Indeed, essentially all the absorption and emission signatures of the Tb-chelate are lost after cleavage, indicating that most of the labeling indeed occurred at the receptor N-terminus. This figure has been added to the revised version of the manuscript as Figure 1—figure supplement 3. In any case, it is to be noted that even a residual labeling of the receptor at other sites besides the N-terminus would not be deleterious for the binding assay. Indeed, the latter simply consists in assessing the proximity between a fluorescence donor and acceptor on the receptor and the ligand, respectively, as a signature of the binding process, with no more detailed interpretation of the fluorescence transfer signal. Accordingly, equivalent binding plots have been reported using the same procedure and a fluorophore attached to any of six different positions in GHSR (23).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This assay uses a dy647 labelled ghrelin peptide, could the authors please provide details of how the labelling was performed and either HPLC of mass spec data for the resulting labelled reagent?

It has been proposed that a peculiar behavior of ghrelin in binding assays results, at least in part, from large non-specific binding effects due to its high hydrophobicity that can lead it to bind to low-affinity ‘‘pseudo-specific” sites into the plasma membrane (24). A value as low as 400 pM has been indeed initially reported and is referenced as such in the database mentioned by the reviewer (25). As reported in the original paper, this value was obtained using radiolabeled ghrelin and human tissues, with as much as 60-65% of specific binding. However, higher values have also been reported repeatedly. For instance, a 2.3 nM Kd was obtained using <sup>125</sup>I-ghrelin and GHSR-expressing COS cells (26). We ourselves measured a Kd value of 4.4 nM for ghrelin binding to GHSR using <sup>125</sup>I-labeled ghrelin and the recombinant receptor expressed in HEK293 cells (24), which is close to the value reported in Holst <italic>et al.</italic> (2005) (26). In the same paper, we reported a Ki of 4.6 nM for ghrelin, as measured from a FRET-based assay with the receptor expressed at the surface of HEK293 cells and a fluorescent ghrelin peptide. Again, a 3-fold higher value has been recently reported for the Kd of a similarly labeled ghrelin and GHSR-expressing HEK cells (12.47 nM) (27). In any case, as perfectly noted by the reviewer, the Ki we report for the isolated receptor (77 nM, as inferred for the wild type receptor from the plot in Figure 1B) is about 15-fold lower than that measured for the same receptor in a native environment, <italic>i.e.</italic> in HEK293 cells (24). However, it must be kept in mind that, as is the case for most GPCRs, isolated GHSR in the absence of G proteins is in a low affinity state for agonists. Accordingly, we previously demonstrated that high affinity ghrelin binding, very similar to that observed in HEK cells, could be recovered upon reconstituting GHSR in nanodiscs with its cognate Gq protein (see Figure 1D in (19)). This data established full functionality for the ghrelin receptor assembled into nanodiscs using exactly the same procedure as the one we used in the present study.</p><p>As requested by the reviewer, the normalized binding plot has been replaced in Figure 1B by the non-normalized FRET data. As the MSP protein is not labeled with the fluorophore, a similar control experiment with empty nanodiscs could not be carried out, however. Instead, we carried out a control experiment with an unrelated receptor, the leukotriene B4 receptor, we inserted into the same nanodiscs (N-terminal labeling of the leukotriene B4 receptor with a fluorophore was initially described in (28)). This receptor is a typical class A GPCR whose general architecture is close to that of GHSR. As shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 2 of the revised manuscript, essentially no FRET was observed between BLT1-containing nanodiscs and fluorescent ghrelin, indicating very limited non-specific binding or, alternatively, that any possible residual binding of the fluorescent peptide does not contribute to the FRET signal we use to monitor receptor:ligand interaction. This plot is provided as Figure 1—figure supplement 2 in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In figure 1C the authors provide further evidence for functionality of their purified GHSR1a using a GTP turnover assay.

Indeed, forces to enhance the sampling were applied along each PC separately. Since these PCs represent a linear decomposition of the overall family-wide conformational change, it didn't appear wise to enhance the sampling along them: linear decomposition of the movement could in principle result in very non-physical motions. Can the authors should provide the readers with a supplementary figure showing the comparison between the starting and the 2 end structures, as well as the PDBs of the resulting structures so their quality can be checked?</p><p>Relatedly, the mix of active-like and inactive-like structures used in the PCA to derive the biasing forces is expected to have a major effect. The authors need to explicitly list (in the supplement) the structures used, and categorize them by activity state and preferably by GPCR family as well.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the reviewer that functional motions are usually a combination of multiple PC. The objective here was to identify blindly all separate motions that could explain the experimental observations. It is very important to note that pulling was done with membrane and water. The pulling was slow and soft enough not to generate any nonphysical models thanks to a realistic environment (including membrane) described by a physical atomic force field (i.e. CHARMM36m). Our previous experiences with such kind of exploration along biasing vectors (e.g. normal modes) revealed that no nonphysical conformations are obtained and the structural quality of the conformational states sampled was preserved. Obtaining nonphysical motions would be related to the introduction of very strong forces, stronger than forces which maintain the topology of the receptor. In our case, we observe a wide range of amplitudes for each mode explored. This reveals that the resulting displacement does not necessarily follow precisely the biasing vector, therefore being able to diverge from the pulling direction was due to the restrictions imposed by the realistic environment. The differences in the amplitudes obtained are due to the distinct energy barriers observed for each displacement. Unfortunately, considering this very soft pulling and the statistical nature of results from MD, we were unable to reproduce our observations among different replicas using exactly the same pulling direction. We then chose to use a more classical approach by running free MD simulations in different activation states, as suggested by the reviewer.</p><p>Despite we did not use anymore the PCs inferred from experimental structures to explore GHSR motions, we used them to analyze our new MD simulations. We provide the structure list in this regard. The list of all experimental structures used to compute the PCs, together with information some readers might find useful is now available as Supplementary file 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The first principle vector probably point more or less along the path between inactive and active, but it would be nice to check this.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer guessed correctly the nature of the first eigenvector.

Ultimately, what do we learn from the fact that PC1 is the most compatible with the experimental data, given that the overall motion is a combination of all the PCs? It would be wise to replicate the results with a more standard MD simulation protocol to rule out artefacts from this choice of enhanced sampling methods.</p><p>3) Additionally, the methods section was unclear about several aspects:</p><p>a) it is unclear as to how many replicates were done for each mode: if it's a single replicate for each mode, no conclusion could be drawn about the hydration. To have any confidence in the result, the reviewers would want to see the simulations rerun many times (at least 10x, perhaps more depending on how variable the answer is), preferably starting from different structures within the equilibrated ensemble.</p></disp-quote><p>We initially ran 1 replica per mode, per direction and per mutant. After running two extra replicas, we could not reproduce our observations among the different replicas using the same pulling direction. This informed about how the protein could freely adapt to our soft pulling protocol and join our reply to the reviewer’s previous comment. Considering this behavior, we suspected that we would need many more than 10 replicas per pulling to observe significant trends for GHSR hydration in respect to its conformation. We thus decided to follow the reviewer’s suggestions by using a more classical approach with non-biased Molecular Dynamics simulations. We then ran 5 replicas of MD simulations (different starting velocities) starting either from an active model and the newly available inactive structure of GHSR. Our new results are described in the new version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Which state does the original model represent? Can the comparison to the recently published structure be more thorough than simply showing a Calpha(?) RMSD (Figure S8)? Are the enhanced sampling MD carried out in presence or absence of ligand and why? Finally the method section as well as the Results section explaining the enhanced sampling protocol should be clarified such that it is not necessary to read the original paper explaining the method to understand.</p></disp-quote><p>The initial state of the receptor in the first submission was inactive without any ligand (PDB id: 4GRV). However, we did not use this structure anymore in the current version of the manuscript, as it was a homology model from neurotensin receptor (NTS1R). We decided to start all over from the newly available GHSR inactive structure (this structure was not released when we designed the initial study).</p><p>Considering the orthosteric site and the presence of the ligand, only the structure of GHSR bound to a synthetic antagonist is available so far. We previously published GHSR bound to its endogenous agonist ghrelin (19), but it relies only on molecular modeling with a coarse-grained description. The choice not to have any ligand involved is thus based first on the lack of structural information with agonist, and second on the fact that GHSR has a large constitutive activity (above 50%) and can be activated easily without ligand. We hypothesize as well that presence of an agonist/inverse agonist would mainly decrease the energetic barrier associated with conformational changes, which we circumvented by starting from both inactive and active models of GHSR.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Many key details of the simulations are missing: number of lipids, number of waters, electrostatics method (as written, it sounds like they didn't use Ewald, which would be a huge problem).</p></disp-quote><p>We added more information about systems and simulation setups to the method section of the manuscript. All simulations were run with Ewald summation.
