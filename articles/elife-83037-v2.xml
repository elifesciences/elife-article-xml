While Dectin-1 is the best-characterized CLR recognizing β-glucan on pathogens, the endogenous targets of Dectin-1 are not fully understood. Herein, we report that human Dectin-1 is a ligand for CLEC-2, another CLR expressed on platelets. Biochemical analyses revealed that Dectin-1 is a mucin-like protein as its stalk region is highly <italic>O</italic>-glycosylated. A sialylated core 1 glycan attached to the EDxxT motif of human Dectin-1, which is absent in mouse Dectin-1, provides a ligand moiety for CLEC-2. Strikingly, the expression of human Dectin-1 in mice rescued the lethality and lymphatic defect resulting from a deficiency of Podoplanin, a known CLEC-2 ligand. This finding is the first example of an innate immune receptor also functioning as a physiological ligand to regulate ontogeny upon glycosylation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pattern recognition receptor</kwd><kwd>C-type lectin receptor</kwd><kwd>glycosylation</kwd><kwd>platelet</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20H00505</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yamasaki</surname><given-names>Sho</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20K06575</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nagae</surname><given-names>Masamichi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16H06276</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yamasaki</surname><given-names>Sho</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>22H05183</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yamasaki</surname><given-names>Sho</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>While Dectin-1 is a well-known C-type lectin receptor recognizing b-glucan and involved in anti-fungal immunity, human Dectin-1 is O-glycosylated and acts as a ligand for another C-type lectin receptor, CLEC-2, expressed by platelets that mediates homeostatic responses such as lymphangiogenesis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Innate immune receptors, mainly those characterized as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), sense external stressors such as infectious agents. Upon recognizing pathogens, these PRRs trigger immune cell activation which leads to appropriate protective immune responses. PRRs also recognize self-derived endogenous components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Marshak-Rothstein, 2006</xref>), but the biological significance of this self-recognition is not fully understood.</p><p>C-type lectin receptors (CLRs), a family of PRRs, mainly signal via the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM), which was originally identified in the cytoplasmic regions of the signaling subunits of antigen receptors which discriminate foreign from self-antigens. Accumulating evidence indicates that ITAM-coupled CLRs expressed on professional immune cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, play a critical role in protective immunity by recognizing various pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Iborra and Sancho, 2015</xref>). ITAM-coupled CLRs are also expressed in non-professional immune cells; however, their beneficial roles are not fully understood.</p><p>Since CLRs recognize various types of ligands including glycans, glycolipids, lipids, proteins, and crystalline substances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brown et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Iborra and Sancho, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zelensky and Gready, 2005</xref>), individual target-focused omics approaches are limited in identifying their respective ligands. Instead, unbiased activity-based approaches have determined several individual targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahrens et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Neumann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yamasaki et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Dectin-1, encoded by the <italic>Clec7a</italic> gene, is the first CLR identified as being ITAM-coupled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown, 2006</xref>). Its conserved carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) mediates binding to fungal β-glucan, but the function(s) of other regions has not yet been determined. For example, the stalk region is missing in the short-splicing variant of Dectin-1 (Dectin-1B), which is expressed at a substantial level along with full-length Dectin-1 (Dectin-1A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Willment et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yokota et al., 2001</xref>). This suggests that the stalk region might act as a functional unit; however, the function or even modification of the Dectin-1 stalk region is unknown.</p><p>Platelets are small anucleate blood cells generated from megakaryocytes in the bone marrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Battinelli et al., 2007</xref>) that mediate pleiotropic functions including thrombosis or lymphangiogenesis. However, the roles of platelets beyond coagulation in the physiological processes are not fully understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bertozzi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Osada et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ozaki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Suzuki-Inoue et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Uhrin et al., 2010</xref>). These processes are triggered by various receptors expressed on the surface of platelets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">van der Meijden and Heemskerk, 2019</xref>). Among them, CLEC-2, encoded by the <italic>Clec1b</italic> gene, is a Syk-coupled CLR expressed on platelets and megakaryocytes. During lymphangiogenesis, Podoplanin (Pdpn) expressed on lymphatic endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Suzuki-Inoue et al., 2007</xref>) binds to CLEC-2 and induces platelet signaling via the hemITAM-Syk-SLP-76 axis, which is thought to regulate blood-lymph separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abtahian et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bertozzi et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Of note, platelet functions differ among mammalian species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sato and Harasaki, 2002</xref>), implying that species-specific molecular interactions might regulate platelet function. However, to the best of our knowledge, no species-specific ligand(s) for platelet receptors have been identified, as human-specific machineries are the most difficult to study <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>In the present study, using mass spectroscopic, biochemical, and genetic analyses, we identified human Dectin-1 as a glycosylated ligand for CLEC-2 providing a physiological role for PRR self-interaction.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Human Dectin-1 interacts with CLEC-2 on platelets</title><p>To search for endogenous molecule(s) that interact with Dectin-1, we evaluated the ability of various organs to activate a Dectin-1-expressing reporter T cell line. Interestingly, human Dectin-1 (hDectin-1), but not mouse Dectin-1, reacted with several mouse organs, including liver, spleen, and bone marrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). T and B cells were dispensable for this interaction, as hDectin-1 binding was not decreased in splenocytes from Rag1-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Furthermore, splenocytes from mice with phenylhydrazine (PHZ)-induced anemia retained reactivity to hDectin-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), excluding erythrocytes as candidates. Upon density gradient separation of whole blood cells, the upper fraction interacted with hDectin-1, suggesting that platelets were the cell lineage expressing target(s) binding to hDectin-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

The current study further expands the capacities of PRRs with the demonstration that they can serve as self-ligands for other host receptors; this finding extends the concept of multitasking on the limited number of germline-encoded receptors.</p><p>Three examples of heterophilic interactions between CLRs have been reported thus far: NKRP1A−LLT1, NKp80−AICL, and NKp65−KACL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rosen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Spreu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Welte et al., 2006</xref>). Of note, all these CLRs are members of CLR group V which includes Dectin-1 cluster CLRs such as Dectin-1 and CLEC-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zelensky and Gready, 2005</xref>). Thus, self-recognition may be the original characteristic of CLRs of this group and Dectin-1 might be exceptional in that it has acquired PRR function for pathogens. To fully understand the network shaped by these hitherto unappreciated self-interactions, it will be worthwhile to further investigate potential mutual interactions between other PRRs, particularly CLRs.</p><p>To date, the stalk (also called neck) region of CLRs has not been regarded as having an active function. Rather, it is presumed to increase the valency of CLRs by self-multimerizing via the coiled-coil, collagen domain, disulfide bond, or heptad repeat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beavil et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Miyake et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Takahara et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 2001</xref>), which may compensate for the known low affinity of CRD ligands. The present study suggests that the stalk region is not merely a multimerizing tool, but also an <italic>O</italic>-glycosylated functional domain. It will be worthwhile to examine whether many other mucin-like proteins possess previously unappreciated <italic>O</italic>-glycosylated motifs that act as specific ligands.</p><p>One of the unique features of this CLEC-2 ligand is that its activity could be ‘canceled’, either by splicing out the stalk-encoding exon or deglycosylation. Indeed, terminal sialic acids of mucin-type glycans can be actively removed by multiple sialidases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Varki and Gagneux, 2012</xref>). Although the regulatory process is not fully understood, tissue- and stimuli-specific expression of the hDectin-1A/B isoforms have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fischer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Willment et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Willment et al., 2005</xref>) and glycosylation profiles may differ based on cellular status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pinho and Reis, 2015</xref>). In this regard, a reported interaction of galactose-specific lectin and Dectin-1 might be mediated based on this principle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Daley et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deerhake et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hayen et al., 2018</xref>). Such posttranscriptional modification of ligands may provide an additional layer of regulation of CLR signaling depending on the environmental status.</p><p>Dectin-1 cluster genes are widely expressed even in non-immune cells, such as endothelial cells, in sharp contrast to CLRs in the Dectin-2 cluster which are exclusively expressed in immune-related cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.proteinatlas.org">https://www.proteinatlas.org</ext-link>). The inverted half ITAM, called hemITAM, in Dectin-1 appears to have been acquired independently of the canonical ITAM immune module during evolution. Thus, this cluster seems not to be originally acquired as professional immune receptors. Syk-independent functions of Dectin-1 support this idea; one plausible role is phagocytosis, as internalization via Dectin-1 does not require Syk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Herre et al., 2004</xref>). Functioning as a ‘ligand’ is additional evidence for a Dectin-1 function independent of Syk in non-immune tissues.</p><p>The molecular basis for the pleiotropic function of CLEC-2 in platelets are not fully understood. Although the indispensable role of CLEC-2 in lymphangiogenesis is well-established, currently proposed mechanisms, such as local coagulation in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bertozzi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hess et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Uhrin et al., 2010</xref>), cannot fully explain this complicated process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Herzog et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Osada et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Suzuki-Inoue et al., 2017</xref>).

The apparent weak binding of hDectin-1 to CLEC-2 compared with that of Pdpn may be due to the shorter binding motif of hDectin-1 (EDxxT) compared with that of Pdpn (EDxxxT) or proximal <italic>O</italic>-glycan(s). Alternatively, but not exclusively, different ligands might create different qualities of receptor signaling, by acting as partial agonists/antagonists, which lead to distinct responses, similar to other germline-encoded ligands-receptor systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Radtke et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to Pdpn, Dectin-1 is also expressed in myeloid lineages in peripheral blood. The weak binding capacity of hDectin-1 may be advantageous in limiting unnecessary ‘autonomous’ activation of megakaryocytes or platelets through bystander interactions with myeloid cells in the periphery, as no spontaneous thrombosis is observed in the peripheral blood of human and hDectin-1 Tg mice. Furthermore, CLEC-2 did not induce activation of myeloid cells through hDectin-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Thus, hDectin-1 may be a moderate ‘homeostatic’ ligand for CLEC-2 that controls physiological processes through platelets beyond thrombosis. Broader distribution of hDectin-1 might provide additional advantages <italic>in vivo</italic>, which could be addressed by tissue-specific Dectin-1-humanized (Tg) mice, ideally on a hCLEC-2- and hPdpn-knock-in background.</p><p>To assess this, the analysis on the genetical mutation of hDectin-1 and diseases would be a straightforward approach. However, reported individuals had truncated mutant Dectin-1 (Y238X), which lacks CRD but retains EDxxT motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ferwerda et al., 2009</xref>), implying the importance of CLEC-2 ligand to be detected as a viable variant.</p><p>In contrast to well-organized genetical processes, glycosylation is a complex event with many exceptions and glycan structures are diverse depending on species, organs, and developmental stages. The principle organizing this complicated process remains an open question. The future development of spatiotemporal glycomics together with transcriptomics/proteomics at a single-cell level will clarify how germline-encoded receptors have acquired multiple functions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Materials</title><p>Primers, guide RNAs, antibodies, and reagents used in this study are also listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1 supp2">Supplementary files 1 and 2</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Mice</title><p>All animal protocols were approved by the committee of Ethics on Animal Experiment of the Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University (Permit number: Biken-AP-R03-17-0).

These tissues were further washed three times in PBS/T for 30 min at 4°C and two times at room temperature, followed by overnight incubation with secondary antibodies (Cy3-conjugated anti-Armenian hamster IgG, Cy5-conjugated anti-rat IgG, and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG) in blocking solution at 4°C. Tissues were washed three times in PBS/T for 30 min at 4°C and two times at room temperature.</p><p>For the observation of the junction of cardinal veins and lymphatic sacs, whole E13.5 embryos were dissected and fixed for 24 hr at 4°C in 4% PFA/PBS, then kept 24 hr in 30% sucrose for dehydration. Embryos embedded in Tissue-Tek OCT compound (Sakura Finetek, Tokyo, Japan) were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and 10 μm cryostat sections were prepared. Slices were treated with 0.1% trypsin at 37°C for 15 min and blocked in PBS containing 5% goat serum and 0.3% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 1 hr. For immunofluorescence, slices were incubated with primary antibodies (American hamster anti-mouse PECAM-1, Rabbit anti-mouse LYVE-1, and Rat monoclonal anti-mouse CD41) in blocking solution at 4°C overnight. These slices were washed three times in PBS for 3 min at room temperature, followed by 1 hr incubation with secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-Armenian hamster IgG, Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated anti-rat IgG, and Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG) in PBS containing 5% goat serum and 1% BSA at room temperature. Tissues were washed three times in PBS for 3 min at room temperature.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Microscopy</title><p>Embryos (E17.5) were photographed at autopsy, and the skin on the back was subjected to immunohistochemical analysis as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Uhrin et al., 2010</xref>). For the observation of the junction of cardinal veins and lymphatic sacs, whole E13.5 embryos were dissected and subjected to immunohistochemical analysis as summarized in <italic>Supplemental Methods</italic>. Confocal microscopy was performed using an Olympus FV-10i (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Separate green, red, and blue images were collected and analyzed with Fiji ImageJ software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). Maximum intensity projections of z-stack images were presented in each figure.</p></sec><sec id="s4-22"><title>RNA sequencing</title><p>Human monocytes (5×10<sup>5</sup> cells) were left untreated or stimulated with murine platelets from wild-type or <italic>Clec1b</italic><sup>ΔHPC</sup> (1×10<sup>7</sup> cells) mice for 8 hr at 37°C. Total RNA was extracted from the cells with a QIAzol Lysis Reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Library preparation was performed using a TruSeq stranded mRNA sample prep kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Whole transcriptome sequencing was applied to the RNA samples by using Illumina HiSeq 2500, HiSeq 3000, or Novaseq 6000 platforms in a 75- or 101-base single-end mode. Sequenced reads were mapped to the human reference genome sequences (hg19) using TopHat ver. 2.0.13. The number of fragments per kilobase of exon per million mapped fragments (FPKMs) was calculated using Cufflinks ver. 2.2.1. Unsupervised k-means clustering analysis was performed by integrated Differential Expression and Pathway analysis (iDEP) website. The transcriptome RNA-sequencing datasets have been deposited to the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus database under the accession number GSE196049.</p></sec><sec id="s4-23"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>An unpaired two-tailed Student t-test was used for all statistical analyses.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Writing – original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Resources, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Investigation, Writing – original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: All human subjects research was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Satyajit Rath as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Gavin J Wright (Reviewer #1); Sandra van Vliet (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Below we summarise the essential revisions required:</p><p>1. The authors use 2B4 transfectants to establish their proposition, but show in figure 2I that human monocytes can interact. Although a full characterization of all human Dectin-1 positive immune subsets would be out of scope for this article please include a basic glycan analysis of Dectin-1 in the human monocytes to confirm that also in these cells Dectin-1 harbors the sialylated Core 1 structure.</p><p>2. Figure 2H is not showing CLEC-2 internalization. The authors incubate platelet with plate-bound Dectin-1 transfectants. For CLEC-2 to internalize the Dectin-1 would have to be released from the transfected cells, of which there is no evidence. Therefore, the read-out platelet activation, CLEC-2 shedding or perhaps occupancy of the CLEC-2 receptor. These conclusions should be toned-down or confirmed using time-lapse experiments with pre-labeled CLEC-2 antibodies to convincingly demonstrate that the CLEC-2 is indeed internalized.</p><p>3. Which downstream signaling pathway of human Dectin-1 is triggered upon the CLEC-2 interaction? Have the authors performed western blots addressing the phosphorylation of SYK and/or Raf-1?</p><p>4. Ferweda et al., described four women with a human Dectin-1 deficiency (NEJM 2009). These women actually suffer from recurrent fungal infections, yet show no other apparent lymphatic defects. How do the authors reconcile their findings with these patients? Can the authors comment on this in their discussion?</p><p>5. The authors mainly use an NFAT-GFP reporter cell line as a proxy for hDectin-1 binding. When referring to this activity it would be preferable to state this more precisely rather than say &quot;interacts with hDectin-1&quot; examples on lines 93 and 97.</p><p>6. A few of the graphs were difficult to read the x-axis e.g. Figure 1G – requires more space or remove some of the major ticks.</p><p>7. The SPR data in Figure 5F is not convincing and does not affect any of the conclusions, but this could be improved. The amount of binding signal for the positive (just 3RU) is very small. I appreciate you are using low molecular mass peptides for this but designing the experiment with a higher mass analyte would give better data. Why not immobilise the peptides and use the CLEC-2 CRD as the analyte? Or a longer peptide?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>My only comments are:</p><p>The authors mainly use an NFAT-GFP reporter cell line as a proxy for hDectin-1 binding.

The novelty of the Dectin-1 and CLEC-2 interaction is high and the thorough characterization is done in high molecular detail. In my opinion, the authors convincingly show that the Dectin-1 – CLEC-2 interaction leads to 2-way signaling in a glycan (sialylated Core 1)-dependent manner. Moreover, they demonstrate the functionality of this interaction in a human Dectin1- transgenic mouse model deficient for the CLEC-2 ligand podoplanin.</p><p>I have a few suggestions to further strengthen the impact of this manuscript:</p><p>1. My only reserve is the relevance of the Dectin-1 – CLEC-2 interaction in humans. The authors mainly use 2B4 transfectants to establish their claims, but do show in figure 2I that human monocytes can interact. Although a full characterization of all human Dectin-1 positive immune subsets would be out of scope for this article, I strongly recommend including a basic glycan analysis of Dectin-1 in the human monocytes to confirm that also in these cells Dectin-1 harbors the sialylated Core 1 structure.</p><p>2. I would like to argue that figure 2H is not showing CLEC-2 internalization. The authors incubate platelet with plate-bound Dectin-1 transfectants. For CLEC-2 to internalize the Dectin-1 would have to be released from the transfected cells, of which there is no evidence.

How do the authors reconcile their findings with these patients? Can the authors comment on this in their discussion?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important point. We confirmed, that the position of the missense mutations found in all these patients were in the CRD (Y238X). As human Dectin-1 is a type II membrane protein, this truncated mutant Dectin-1 retained an intact stalk region and can be expressed on the cell surface as reported (Figure S4C, Ferweda, <italic>N Engl J Med</italic>, 2009). From this aspect, this mutant Dectin-1 in the patients is similar to human Dectin-1<sup>∆CRD</sup> (1-114), which we have shown to retain ligand activity to CLEC-2 (original Figure 3C). Thus, the expression of truncated Dectin-1 retaining the stalk region may act as a ligand in the patients, which may contribute to the normal blood-lymph separation. Alternatively, we cannot exclude the possibility that, in human, Podoplanin may compensate for the impaired function of Dectin-1. We have described these points in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript (page 14, line 323).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The authors mainly use an NFAT-GFP reporter cell line as a proxy for hDectin-1 binding. When referring to this activity it would be preferable to state this more precisely rather than say &quot;interacts with hDectin-1&quot; examples on lines 93 and 97.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for our misleading description about the results. We have now changed this to the precise description in the Results section (page 4, line 97 and page 5, lines 101) of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. A few of the graphs were difficult to read the x-axis e.g. Figure 1G – requires more space or remove some of the major ticks.</p></disp-quote><p>In accordance with the reviewer’s suggestion, we have corrected Figure 1G.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The SPR data in Figure 5F is not convincing and does not affect any of the conclusions, but this could be improved. The amount of binding signal for the positive (just 3RU) is very small. I appreciate you are using low molecular mass peptides for this but designing the experiment with a higher mass analyte would give better data. Why not immobilise the peptides and use the CLEC-2 CRD as the analyte? Or a longer peptide?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not clearly describing the limitation of the study in Figure 5F. In accordance with the reviewer’s suggestion, we have newly synthesized a biotinylated 11-mer peptide with and without a disialylated core-1 <italic>O</italic>-glycan (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>). Although these peptides were successfully immobilized onto a streptavidin sensor chip, we could not detect the apparent binding of CLEC-2 CRD even when using 150 μM (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>). Furthermore, we also tested the CLEC-2 binding using amine-coupling immobilization, but we could not detect a binding response (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>). We used 11-mer peptides to confirm the minimum moiety mediating the ligand function. As the reviewer suggested, we also synthesized longer glycopeptide, but we could not synthesize enough amounts of glycopeptide due to technical difficulties. In the present study, we performed multiple approaches to reach the current conclusion regarding the responsible region for the ligand activity. As the reviewer pointed out, Figure 5F itself cannot give us a strong conclusion. We therefore corrected our overstated interpretation in the Results section (page 9, line 211) in the revised manuscript.</p><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-83037-sa2-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig></body></sub-article></article>
