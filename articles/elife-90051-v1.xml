Despite extensive research on these defense strategies in various species, including the model organism <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, the neural mechanisms underlying their interaction remain poorly understood. Previous studies have highlighted the role of neural G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in regulating both immunity and pathogen avoidance, which is particularly dependent on aerotaxis. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a screen of mutants in neuropeptide receptor family genes. We found that loss-of-function mutations in <italic>npr-15</italic> activated immunity while suppressing pathogen avoidance behavior. Through further analysis, NPR-15 was found to regulate immunity by modulating the activity of key transcription factors, namely GATA/ELT-2 and TFEB/HLH-30. Surprisingly, the lack of pathogen avoidance of <italic>npr-15</italic> mutant animals was not influenced by oxygen levels. Moreover, our studies revealed that the amphid sensory neuron ASJ is involved in mediating the immune and behavioral responses orchestrated by NPR-15. Additionally, NPR-15 was found to regulate avoidance behavior via the TRPM (transient receptor potential melastatin) gene, GON-2, which may sense the intestinal distension caused by bacterial colonization to elicit pathogen avoidance. Our study contributes to a broader understanding of host defense strategies and mechanisms underlining the interaction between molecular and behavioral immune responses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>G-protein-coupled receptors</kwd><kwd>immunity</kwd><kwd>avoidance behavior</kwd><kwd>neuropeptides</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM0709077</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aballay</surname><given-names>Alejandro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI117911</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aballay</surname><given-names>Alejandro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Molecular and genetics approaches reveal a dual regulatory role of neuronal G-protein-coupled receptor NPR-15 in both immunity and avoidance behavior, independent of aerotaxis, mediated by amphid sensory neurons, ASJ.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hosts employ multiple defense mechanisms to combat infections, including molecular immune defenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Netea et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gourbal et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blander and Sander, 2012</xref>) and behavioral defense responses to invading pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Meisel and Kim, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sarabian et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hart and Hart, 2018</xref>).

On the other hand, the avoidance behavioral response serves as a crucial first line of defense, enabling hosts to prevent or minimize contact with pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Behringer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Curtis, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Meisel and Kim, 2014</xref>).

Although <italic>C. elegans</italic> lacks adaptive immunity, part of its innate immune response comprises evolutionarily conserved pathways and immune effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schulenburg and Félix, 2017</xref>). <italic>C. elegans</italic> has been widely used in research studies to investigate these pathways due to its well-defined nervous system and genetic tractability, making it an ideal model organism to explore pathways that are critical to immunity and avoidance behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sym et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nagiel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Powell, 2008</xref>). Notably, intestinal changes triggered by bacterial pathogen colonization activate the DAF-7/TGF-β pathway and the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) NPR-1 pathway, which also regulates aerotaxis behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Meisel and Kim, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Styer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Singh and Aballay, 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Singh and Aballay, 2019b</xref>).</p><p>To uncover mechanisms that control immune and behavioral responses to invading pathogens independently of aerotaxis, we focused on studying mutants in <italic>npr</italic> genes that have not been previously linked to either host strategy against pathogen infection. Our investigation revealed that loss-of-function mutations in the NPR-15 encoding genes enhanced pathogen resistance when infected by Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial pathogens. Intriguingly, <italic>npr-15</italic> mutants exhibited a lack of pathogen avoidance behavior that was found to be independent of oxygen sensation. These findings point toward the involvement of a novel mechanism in the regulation of immune response and avoidance behavior.</p><p>Further analysis unveiled that the resistance to pathogen infection in <italic>npr-15</italic> mutants is mediated by the transcription factors GATA/ELT-2 and TFEB/HLH-30.

Additionally, we discovered that NPR-15 controls avoidance behavior through the intestinal-expressed transient receptor potential melastatin (TRPM) ion channel, GON-2, which has recently been demonstrated to modulate avoidance behavior in Gram-positive bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Filipowicz et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, our results indicate that the amphid sensory neuron, ASJ, plays a crucial role in the interplay between immune response and avoidance behavior. These findings provide insights into the neural mechanisms that control immunity against bacterial infections and pathogen avoidance behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>NPR-15 loss-of-function enhances pathogen resistance and inhibits avoidance behavior independently of aerotaxis</title><p>Out of 34 mutants in <italic>npr</italic> genes that were not previously linked to the control immunity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>), only animals lacking NPR-15 (<italic>npr-15(tm12539</italic>) and <italic>npr-15(ok1626</italic>) null animals) exhibited enhanced survival against <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa-</italic>mediated killing compared to wild-type (WT) animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1B</xref>). Furthermore, we found that the <italic>npr-15(tm12539</italic>) animals exhibited less visible bacterial colonization and significantly reduced colony-forming units compared to WT animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). The enhanced resistance to pathogen of <italic>npr-15(ok1626</italic>) animals appears to be universal, as the mutants were also found to be resistant to additional human pathogens, including Gram-negative <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> strain 1344 and Gram-positive <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> strain OG1RF and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> strain NCTCB325 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>), suggesting that NPR-15 suppresses defense against bacterial pathogens in general.

Unexpectedly, we found that <italic>npr-15(tm12539</italic>) exhibited significantly reduced pathogen avoidance when exposed to <italic>S. aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>).

First, we examined the neuronal connectome and communication between the NPR-15-expressing cell and found well-established synaptic connections between all the sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

To address this question, we specifically inactivated <italic>npr</italic>-15 in neurons and the intestine using tissue-specific RNAi strains and assessed the survival of the animals after <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection. Unlike intestine-specific RNAi (strain MGH171) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), neural-specific RNAi (strain TU3401) of NPR-15 resulted in a pathogen resistance phenotype similar to that of <italic>npr-15(tm12539</italic>) animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

The results demonstrated that pan-neuronal promoter-driven expression of NPR-15 rescued the enhanced survival phenotype of <italic>npr-15(tm12539</italic>) animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). These results suggest that NPR-15 suppresses immunity through the nervous system. We next studied the specific NPR-15-expressing neuronal cells (ASG, ASI, ASJ, ASE, AFD, AWC) that could control the defense response against pathogen infection. To identify the neuronal cells responsible for the NPR-15-mediated immune control, we crossed strains lacking the neurons with <italic>npr-15(tm12539</italic>) animals and studied their effect on defense against pathogen infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>).

These results suggest that NPR-15 acts through the intestinal TRPM channel GON-2 to control pathogen avoidance behavior. Since we have previously shown that only ASJ(-) animals among other neuron-ablated strains exhibit a similar avoidance behavior to <italic>npr-15(tm12539</italic>) animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and D–G</xref>), we investigated whether NPR-15 control of avoidance behavior toward <italic>S. aureus</italic> in a GON-2-dependent manner involves ASJ. We used RNAi to inactivate <italic>gon-2</italic> in ASJ(-), ASJ(-);<italic>npr-15(tm152799</italic>), <italic>npr-15(tm12539</italic>), and WT animals before exposing them to <italic>S. aureus</italic> to assay their lawn occupancy.

In summary, the neuronal GPCR/NPR-15 plays a dual role: suppressing the immune response and enhancing avoidance behavior toward <italic>S. aureus</italic> through sensory neurons, specifically ASJ.

In this study, we investigated the dual functionality of GPCR/NPR-15 in regulating molecular innate immunity and pathogen avoidance behavior independently of aerotaxis. Additionally, we aimed to understand the mechanism by which the nervous system controls the interplay between these crucial survival strategies in response to pathogenic threats. Our findings indicate that NPR-15 suppresses immune responses against different pathogen infections by inhibiting the activity of the GATA/ELT-2 and HLH-30 immune transcription regulators. Moreover, we found that the control of the pathogen avoidance behavior by NPR-15 is independent of aerotaxis and dependent on intestinal GON-2. Furthermore, we demonstrated that NPR-15 controls the immunity-behavioral response via an amphid sensory neuron, ASJ, in response to <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection.</p><p>ASJ neurons are known to regulate different biological functions such as lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alcedo and Kenyon, 2004</xref>), dauer activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bargmann and Horvitz, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chung et al., 2013</xref>), head-directed light avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ward et al., 2008</xref>), and food search (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Macosko et al., 2009</xref>). We show here that ASJ neurons play a role in the control of immune and behavioral responses against pathogen infection through GPCR/NPR-15. Our research additionally indicates that the regulation of NPR-15-mediated avoidance is not influenced by intestinal immune and neuropeptide genes. Given the potential for functional redundancy and our focus on genes upregulated in the absence of NPR-15, we cannot entirely rule out the possibility that unexamined immune effectors or neuropeptides, not transcriptionally controlled by NPR-15, might be involved. Different intestinal signals may also participate in the NPR-15 pathway that controls pathogen avoidance.</p><p>Other neural GPCRs have also been linked to the control of innate immunity in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Styer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Frooninckx et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gupta and Singh, 2017</xref>). For example, the octopamine receptor OCTR-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sun et al., 2011</xref>), the olfactory learning receptor OLRN-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Foster et al., 2020</xref>), and the D1-like dopamine receptor DOP-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cao and Aballay, 2016</xref>) function in ASH/ASI, AWC, and ASG neurons, respectively. GPCRs that are neuropeptide receptors, such as NPR-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Styer et al., 2008</xref>), NPR-9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yu et al., 2018</xref>), and NPR-8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sellegounder et al., 2019</xref>), also function in neurons to control immunity. In common, these GPCRs regulate innate immunity via the p38/PMK-1 MAPK pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Styer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sellegounder et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Foster et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cao and Aballay, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yu et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, NPR-15 functions in ASJ neurons to suppress immune defense against bacterial infections by inhibiting the transcriptional activity of ELT-2 and HLH-30. Two of these GPCRs, NPR-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Styer et al., 2008</xref>) and PCDR-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson et al., 2019</xref>), also play a role in mediating pathogen avoidance.

NPR-15 seems to suppress specific immune genes while activating pathogen avoidance behavior to minimize potential tissue damage and the metabolic energy cost associated with activating the molecular immune response against pathogen infections.

The host relies on behavioral responses to minimize or completely avoid pathogen exposure, effectively preventing the activation of the immune pathways and production of immune effector molecules, which can be metabolically costly. Moreover, the sustained and prolonged activation of the molecular immune system can have detrimental effects on the host. Understanding the organismal control of molecular and behavioral immune responses to pathogens can provide valuable insights into universal mechanisms used across species to maintain homeostasis during infections.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial strains</title><p>The bacterial strains used in this study are <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50, <italic>E. coli</italic> HT115(DE3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brenner, 1974</xref>), <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tan et al., 1999a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tan et al., 1999b</xref>), <italic>S. enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium 1344 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wray and Sojka, 1978</xref>), and <italic>S. aureus</italic> strain NCTCB325 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sifri et al., 2003</xref>).

The enhanced resistance in npr-15 mutant worms was attributed to upregulation of immune and neuropeptide genes, many of which were controlled by the transcription factors ELT-2 and HLH-30.
