neutralized by SpeG, an enzyme for the spermidine <italic>N</italic>-acetyl transferase function. Thus, wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> can tolerate applied exogenous spermidine stress, but Δ<italic>speG</italic> strain of <italic>E. coli</italic> fails to do that. Here, using different reactive oxygen species (ROS) probes and performing electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, we provide evidence that although spermidine mitigates oxidative stress by lowering overall ROS levels, excess of it simultaneously triggers the production of superoxide radicals, thereby causing toxicity in the Δ<italic>speG</italic> strain. Furthermore, performing microarray experiment and other biochemical assays, we show that the spermidine-induced superoxide anions affected redox balance and iron homeostasis. Finally, we demonstrate that while RNA-bound spermidine inhibits iron oxidation, free spermidine interacts and oxidizes the iron to evoke superoxide radicals directly. Therefore, we propose that the spermidine-induced superoxide generation is one of the major causes of spermidine toxicity in <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Escherichia coli</italic></kwd><kwd>SpeG</kwd><kwd>spermidine toxicity</kwd><kwd>superoxide radical</kwd><kwd>iron metabolism</kwd><kwd>oxidative stress</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001412</institution-id><institution>Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), India</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MLP-042</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dutta</surname><given-names>Dipak</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Spermidine-mediated superoxide generation affects iron homeostasis in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Polyamines are ubiquitously present in all life forms.

However, polyamine in excess is toxic to the organisms unless polyamine homeostasis in the cell is operated at the levels of export, synthesis, inactivation, and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Miller-Fleming et al., 2015</xref>). Notably, spermine/spermidine <italic>N</italic>-acetyl transferase (SSAT or SpeG), which inactivates spermidine and spermine, constitutes the most potent polyamine homeostasis component of the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Miller-Fleming et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>A tremendous volume of work has been dedicated to unravel the biological importance of spermidine and its homeostasis mechanisms. It has also been known for long that spermidine (or spermine) in excess is toxic to the organisms and viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pegg, 2013</xref>). It has been proposed that the excess polyamines may affect protein synthesis by binding to acidic sites in macromolecules, such as nucleic acids, proteins, and membrane, and by displacing magnesium from these sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Limsuwun and Jones, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pegg, 2013</xref>). However, a precise molecular detail of spermidine toxicity is not yet understood. In this study, we decipher a molecular mechanism of spermidine toxicity in bacteria. We find the intertwined relationships among spermidine toxicity, iron metabolism, and O<sub>2</sub><bold><sup>-</sup></bold> radical production in bacteria.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Increased cellular spermidine inhibits overall oxidative stress while apparently evoking less harmful O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> production</title><p>To determine the working concentrations of exogenous spermidine that sufficiently inhibits the growth of Δ<italic>speG</italic>, but not WT strain, we added various amounts of spermidine in the growth medium. WT cells showed a modest reduction in growth up to 6.4 mM of spermidine concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). On the contrary, Δ<italic>speG</italic> strain exhibited a striking decrease in growth when supplemental spermidine level was &gt;3.2 mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, we chose spermidine concentration ≥3.2 mM for our further experiments. We performed HPLC analyses to show whether elevated spermidine level in the Δ<italic>speG</italic> strain caused growth inhibition. Supplementation of 3.2 mM exogenous spermidine in the growth medium increased the intracellular spermidine levels in the Δ<italic>speG</italic> strain, while no significant increase was observed in the WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The SpeG function apparently converted the excess spermidine to <italic>N</italic><sup>1</sup>- and <italic>N</italic><sup>8</sup>-acetyl-spermidines maintaining the level of spermidine in the WT cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Miller-Fleming et al., 2015</xref>). The spermidine synthase-defective (Δ<italic>speE</italic>) strain of <italic>E. coli</italic> also acquired spermidine at a low level from the LB medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>It is well documented that polyamine spermidine is an anti-ROS agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balasundaram et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chattopadhyay et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chattopadhyay et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ha et al., 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Khan et al., 1992a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Khan et al., 1992b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pegg, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Murray Stewart et al., 2018</xref>). However, all the in vivo studies in the past have been conducted under polyamine deficient conditions to show ROS production, thereby implicating the anti-ROS function of polyamines. Thus, assessing ROS levels both in spermidine-enriched and spermidine-deficient conditions are missing. To address this, we incubated <italic>E. coli</italic> strains with 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA) and dihydroethidium (DHE) probes, which generate fluorescent compounds reacting with one-electron-oxidizing species. While H2DCFDA is a generic ROS probe that nonspecifically reacts with many ROS, the DHE is somewhat specific to the O<sub>2</sub><bold><sup>-</sup></bold> anions in the system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kalyanaraman et al., 2012</xref>). The relative mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of H2DCFDA was increased about 1.5-fold in the spermidine synthase-defective (Δ<italic>speE</italic>) strain, while no change in MFI was observed in the Δ<italic>speG</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). However, spermidine treatment significantly decreased the H2DCFDA fluorescence in WT, Δ<italic>speG</italic>, and Δ<italic>speE</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Interestingly, despite no apparent increase in the spermidine level in WT cells under spermidine stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), a significant decrease in the H2DCFDA fluorescence was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). It is possible that the acetylated products of spermidine might have some role in the declined ROS levels causing decreased H2DCFDA fluorescence in spermidine-fed WT cells. Similarly, the relative MFI of DHE probe was increased significantly (1.5-fold) in Δ<italic>speE</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These findings are consistent with the observations that spermidine is an anti-ROS agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balasundaram et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chattopadhyay et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chattopadhyay et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ha et al., 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Khan et al., 1992a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Khan et al., 1992b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pegg, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Murray Stewart et al., 2018</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Spermidine (SPD) stress and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in <italic>Escherichia coli.</italic></title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The relative mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) values for the 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA), which is an indicator of •OH radical production, obtained by flow cytometry analyses are plotted.

Spermidine transport is a proton motif force (PMF)-dependent process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kashiwagi et al., 1986</xref>). Therefore, the observed narrower ZOI in the presence of spermidine under anaerobic condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) could also be due to the low PMF under anaerobic condition. Thus, to determine the relative levels of intracellular O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> species, we performed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) using a cell-permeable cyclic hydroxylamine spin-probe, 1-hydroxy-3-methoxycarbonyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrrolidine (CMH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dikalov et al., 2018</xref>).

Increased AhpC level indicating the activation of alkyl hydroperoxidase (AhpCF) enzyme could be responsible for the decline in cellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Chelation of Fe<sup>2+</sup> ions by bipyridyl generates pink color indicating Fe<sup>2+</sup> levels. No color formation was observed till the ratio of spermidine to Fe<sup>2+</sup> reaches 1:1.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), a number that exactly matches with the ratio of spermidine to Fe<sup>2+</sup> in the first half of ITC experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>). The color formation starts appearing when the ratio crosses 1:1.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), suggesting that 1 molecule of spermidine (or 10 molecules) exactly oxidizes 1.3 molecules (or 13 molecules) of Fe<sup>2+</sup>. The colorimetric values overlap with the standard curve when reactions were under anoxic condition, indicating Fe<sup>2+</sup> was not oxidized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). We used nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) dye to check whether the loss of one electron from Fe<sup>2+</sup> generates O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> anion under spermidine stress.

From the stoichiometry of 0.711 (which is close to 0.5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), we postulate that two spermidine and one Fe<sup>3+</sup> together could form a hexadentate coordination complex with an octahedral geometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). It appears that when spermidine molecules engaged to form a hexadentate coordination complex with Fe<sup>2+</sup>, the former helps oxidizing latter to form Fe<sup>3+</sup> in sufficient concentrations. Fe<sup>3+</sup> finally forms coordination complex with spermidine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). It may be noted that the binding of spermidine and Fe<sup>3+</sup> is entirely enthalpy-driven, as indicated by a large negative ΔH. The negative entropy (ΔS) value presumably results from the ordering of spermidine from an extended conformation to a compact and rigid one after metal chelation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).</p><p>The cellular spermidine barely exists as a ‘free’ species; rather, majority of them remain ‘bound’ with RNA, DNA, nucleotides, and phospholipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Igarashi and Kashiwagi, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miyamoto et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schuber, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tabor and Tabor, 1984</xref>).

The bound spermidine further enhances the inhibitory effects of these biomolecules toward iron oxidation.

The presence of 10 μM spermidine further decreased iron oxidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). However, increasing the concentrations of spermidine (50, 100, and 200 μM) accelerated iron oxidation gradually (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>).

However, when homeostasis fails due to <italic>speG</italic> deletion, excess spermidine accumulates that can remain in a ‘free’ form inducing O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> radical toxicity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our study presented in this paper answers why spermidine homeostasis is intriguingly fine-tuned in bacteria.

Since spermidine directly interacts with Fe<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), it may abstract iron from some of the iron-sulfur clusters, thereby inactivating some of the proteins. On the other hand, when spermidine level is at optimum, most of it remain as bound form with the biomolecules, thereby slows down iron oxidation and subsequent O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">LØVaas, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tadolini, 1988a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tadolini, 1988b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Thus, spermidine deficiency would enhance the rate of iron oxidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>), leading to ROS production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). This is why spermidine is a double-edged sword where in excess, it provokes O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> anion production, and in scarcity, it leads to higher ROS levels.</p><p>Polyamines remain protonated at physiological pH, yet they are able to coordinate several positively charged metal ions, such as Ni<sup>2+</sup>, Co<sup>2+</sup>, Cu<sup>2+</sup>, and Zn<sup>2+</sup>, possibly via charge neutralization by counterions that reduces the Coulombic repulsion between spermidine and the metals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">LØVaas, 1996</xref>). Similar charge neutralization of the nitrogen atoms of spermidine likely allows coordinate covalent bonds with Fe<sup>3+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). About 10 spermidine molecules oxidize Fe<sup>2+</sup> to generate 13 Fe<sup>3+</sup> cations and equivalent numbers of O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> radicals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>). When sufficient concentration of Fe<sup>3+</sup> is generated, two spermidine molecules coordinate one Fe<sup>3+</sup> to form a hexadentate complex with an octahedral geometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). We substantiated this in vitro spermidine-mediated iron oxidation and subsequent O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> radical production phenomena (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), showing that cells are highly toxic to the spermidine under aerobic condition but not under anaerobic condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>Usually, abundant O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> level leads to general ROS including H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production.

The declined H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> level could be attributed to the slower rate of O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> anion dismutation due to the failure of <italic>sodA</italic> activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) and the activation of alkyl hydroperoxidase (AhpCF) that neutralizes H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, represented by AhpC overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). A low level of cellular manganese (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) could also limit SodA activity. Besides, the activation of IscR regulon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), the low cellular iron content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), and the rejuvenation of cell growth by Fe<sup>2+</sup> supplementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) indicate that the spermidine presumably lowers the Fe<sup>2+</sup>/Fe<sup>3+</sup> ratio in Δ<italic>speG</italic> strain.

Even spermidine blocked SoxR expression by menadione, a redox cycling drug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). These two observations implicate that free spermidine being an iron chelator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A, B and C</xref>) might affect SoxR maturation by interfering its iron-sulfur cluster formation. As a result, apo-SoxR remained unreactive to the superoxide or redox cycling drugs, and thereby failed to activate SoxR regulon genes. Since spermidine ubiquitously interacts with DNA and modulates gene expression in many ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Igarashi and Kashiwagi, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jung and Kim, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miyamoto et al., 1993</xref>), another possibility could be that excess of it might occlude SoxR-binding to the <italic>soxS</italic> and <italic>sodA</italic> promoter regions to activate them. Alternatively, blockage of SoxR activation could result from spermidine-mediated activation of <italic>rsxA</italic> and <italic>rsxB</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), which encode the critical components of the iron-sulfur cluster reducing system of SoxR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koo et al., 2003</xref>), to keep SoxR inactive.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Joseph T Wade as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor.</p><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided to reject the paper.</p><p>The reviewers raised four major concerns. First, the probes used to determine the type of ROS stress are not specific enough to confidently draw the conclusion that spermidine causes O2- production, as opposed to another ROS. Hence, we would want to see a more direct test of the specific ROS produced. Electron paramagnetic resonance would be a suitable approach for this experiment. Second, several of the experiments use deletion mutant strains but lack a control where the deletion has been complemented, together with a corresponding empty-vector control. Third, the reviewers felt that the <italic>S. aureus</italic> experiments are peripheral to the main theme of the paper, and should be removed. Fourth, the reviewers were concerned that intracellular spermidine levels for different strains/growth conditions were inferred but not directly measured, particularly for the experiments in Figure 1 with speE and speG mutants and with spermidine supplementation. The use of LB as a growth medium is a concern in this regard, since LB contains spermidine. We would want to see either measurement of intracellular spermidine levels for wild-type and mutant strains grown under the conditions used in the corresponding experiments, or references to prior work where spermidine levels have been measured under the same growth conditions for the same strains. We believe these concerns are addressable, but would require a considerable amount of work, which would take more than two months. Hence, we are rejecting the paper, but we would consider a revised version if you are able to address the four major concerns.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The work presented in this study provides important insight into the role of spermidine in bacterial cells. The data can be supported by the addition of a few simple controls, and a more detailed explanation of some of the methods, but generally speaking I am convinced by the conclusion that spermidine causes production of ROS by oxidizing Fe2+ in the cell. The protective role of other biomolecules such as RNA is more speculative, but nonetheless intriguing, and consistent with the genetic data. I feel that the <italic>S. aureus</italic> data add little to the paper. A big problem with the <italic>S. aureus</italic> experiments is that they compare two genetically distinct strains rather than comparing wild-type and mutant derivatives of otherwise genetically identical strains. Nonetheless, the <italic>S. aureus</italic> data are not needed, since the <italic>E. coli</italic> work stands on its own.</p><p>1. The conclusion from the data in Figure 1 seems to be that both high and low spermidine levels, relative to wild-type cells grown without exogenous spermidine, increase ROS levels. This is consistent with the overall conclusion that there is a &quot;sweet spot&quot; of spermidine levels needed to minimize ROS. This conclusion should be clearly stated in the Results to give context, especially since some of the data appear at first glance to be contradictory.</p><p>2. The data in Figure 2 involve comparisons of two strains of <italic>S. aureus</italic>, one of which has speG. The data are interpreted in a way that attributes all the phenotypic differences between the strains to the presence/absence of speG, but presumably there are many other genetic differences between these strains. The wording in this section of the paper should be softened to reflect the possibility that there could be other reasons for the phenotypic differences. Alternatively, the authors should make mutant strains that introduce or delete speG from the two strains, and test phenotypes in those genetic backgrounds.</p><p>3. Perhaps I missed it, but I couldn't see how the authors determined (&quot;estimated&quot;, in their words) levels of NADP or glutathione, values for which are reported in Figure 3. The authors do mention a kit-based assay for measuring NAD levels, but there is insufficient description of this.</p><p>4. Line 195. There are lots of genes regulated by Fis or IHF. Is there a statistically significant enrichment of these genes among those differentially expressed, based on the microarray experiment?</p><p>5. Figure 4C. The authors gloss over the observation that SodA levels are similar in wt, untreated cells and spermidine-treated speG mutant cells. This is an unexpected result that warrants some discussion.</p><p>6. Figure 4 and associated text. This feels like a list of genes that went up or down, with little explanation of the expected result based on the prior observations in the paper. Hence, the significance of these observations is lost on the reader.</p><p>Figure 1C and 1E. The graphs would be easier to view if the lines were color-coded, especially for Figure 1E.</p><p>Line 143: &quot;Therefore, spermidine stress would likely evoke O2- radicals in the <italic>S. aureus</italic> RN4220 but not in USA300 strain&quot;. This statement is too strong, since it is based on data from <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p><p>Line 163. &quot;Confirms&quot; is too strong a word to use here without measuring intracellular levels of the relevant molecules with/without each of the treatments. I recommend softening the wording to &quot;is consistent with&quot;.</p><p>Figure 3 and associated description in the Results. The authors should make it clear at the start of this section and in the figure title that these experiments were done with <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p><p>Figure 4A. The authors should add a description of each of the numbered gene categories.</p><p>Figure 4C. The quantification graph is too small to easily interpret.</p><p>Figure 4G. The authors should plot data for Mn on a separate y-axis scale.</p><p>Figure 4G. This panel includes data for <italic>E. coli</italic> and data for <italic>S. aureus</italic>, which is very confusing. The authors should use a separate panel for data from each species.</p><p>Line 335. Should read &quot;spermidine is highly toxic to cells&quot;.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors have investigated why the polyamine spermidine is toxic to the bacterium <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> when intracellular spermidine is present in excess. To obtain cells where spermidine might be present in excess, they sought to create a gene deletion strain for the speG gene that encodes spermidine N-acetyltransferase, an enzyme that N-acetylates spermidine when spermidine levels are in excess, thereby neutralizing whatever function of spermidine is deleterious to cell growth. In principle, a speG gene deletion strain of <italic>E. coli</italic> is likely to have higher intracellular levels of spermidine. The authors also grew the speG strain in media contain high levels of added spermidine, which would be expected to further increase intracellular spermidine levels. A large number of physiological experiments were performed by the authors to demonstrate whether excess spermidine affects oxidative stress, and they concluded that it caused the generation of superoxide. Other analyses were performed to assess the affect of spermidine on iron oxidation. The global impact of spermidine toxicity was assessed by performing a transcriptional microarray experiment where the speG gene deletion strain was grown with and without 3.8 mM added spermidine in the growth medium, and the authors concluded that spermidine affects iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis.</p><p>Unfortunately (and inexplicably), the authors at no point measured spermidine or N-acetylspermidine levels in the cells that they were working with. The gene deletion regions for spermidine N-acetyltransferase (speG) and for spermidine synthase (speE) were transferred from KEIO collection strains into the authors' model <italic>E. coli</italic> wildtype strain by phage P1 transduction but were not confirmed by PCR after transduction, or by measuring spermidine or N-acetylspermidine levels. Thus, there is no proof that spermidine levels are altered in the speG or spermidine synthase (speE) gene deletion strains. The gene deletion strains were not complemented by the wildtype genes to show that any growth effects were not due to off-target damage cause by the P1 transduction. Furthermore, the supposed gene deletion strains were grown in LB medium, which contains spermidine, instead of in chemically defined M9 medium that does not contain spermidine. Because the spermidine content of the gene deletion strains is unknown, one can have very little confidence in any result that is supposedly based on whether cells contain excess spermidine or not. Although the microarray data looked at the effect of {plus minus} 3.8 mM spermidine on gene expression in the speG gene deletion strain, without knowledge of the intracellular spermidine content, any transcriptional effect could be due to indirect effects of spermidine on the cell wall, the outer membrane, on pH, and osmotic effects. In conclusion, the authors have performed a large number experiments where any conclusions on outcomes are in doubt due to the complete lack of knowledge of the content of intracellular spermidine, the metabolite that is supposedly responsible for the observed effects. Since, presumably, the authors do not have the data for intracellular spermidine content in their experiments, it is difficult to see how the data obtained can be used to make physiological conclusions, other than relating the observed effects to the presence or absence of added spermidine in the growth medium.</p><p>It is difficult to see how the data from this study can be salvaged. The observed effects cannot be attributed to excess spermidine or the complete absence of spermidine, since the level of spermidine in cells was never measured. Furthermore, the purported spermidine synthase (speE) deletion strain was grown in LB medium, which is a rich medium containing spermidine. Growth of the supposedly spermidine deficient speE deletion strain in LB medium will result in spermidine uptake from the LB medium, such that the supposedly depleted spermidine will be replaced by spermidine from the LB medium. The authors should have used chemically defined M9 medium for any spermidine-related experiment. Not only should spermidine levels and N-acetylspermidine levels have been measured in the speG deletion strain, but the levels of these metabolites should have been measured over the growth curve because N-acetylspermidine is accumulated more in stationary phase.</p><p>It may be possible to express the physiological changes observed in this study to the presence or absence of added spermidine to the growth medium, but the changes observed cannot be attributed to the levels of intracellular spermidine, since they were never measured.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In the manuscript by Kumar et al., the authors proposed that sperimidine (SPD) triggers the production of superoxide radicals and claimed that this production is the unique molecular mechanism of toxicity in bacteria (line 81). These conclusions are based on the used of ROS probes. The results are interesting, provocative and conceptually new. However, clarifications, controls and new experiences are needed to support their conclusions.</p><p>My main concern is that the authors consider the ROS probes as specific for each compound (HO{degree sign}, O2{degree sign}-). The interconnection between ROS in the cells and the absence of great specificity of this type of tools should not make it possible to affirm the dependence of one type of ROS. Other approach would be necessary. Detecting very transient ROS, such as superoxide radicals, is challenging in the study of oxidative stress in vivo and an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) approach is considered ideal since it is unique for detecting free radicals.</p><p>The anaerobic experiments which support the superoxide conclusion need to be mitigated as polyamine uptake has been reported to be PMF dependant (Kashiwagi et al. J. Bact 1986). Therefore, a possible other explanation will be that in anaerobic condition PMF is slow down, polyamine uptake decrease and bacteria are more resistant. This point needs to be integrating in the text.</p><p>How the ROS probes response to SPD in anaerobic condition, what happens in the absence of oxygen if nitrate is present ?</p><p>The absence of SoxR activation in presence of spermidine is difficult to understand. The authors could used the Imlay study (Gu et al. 2011 , DOI: 10.1111/j.1365-2958.2010.07520.x) in which it is show that SoxR is directly activated by redox cycling drugs rather than by superoxide.</p><p>Figure 1 A and B : add control (wt+SPD ; wt+SPD +/- tiron).</p><p>Figure 1C : speE mutant is expected to have less SPD and therefore more H2O2, how the authors explain the opposite result?</p><p>Figure 1E : add control (WT+pSodA ; speG+pSodA) and all the strains with empty vector</p><p>Sup1 : C : does the sod(A or B) simple mutant are more sensitive to SPD at higher concentration than 4.5mM?</p><p>Figure 3 B and C : add control (empty vector).</p><p>Figure 4A : microarray result, the authors could add and comment the data on the suf operon (Fe/S cluster biosynthesis during stress condition, ROS and iron limitation).</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Free spermidine evokes superoxide radicals that manifest toxicity&quot; for further consideration by eLife. Your revised article has been evaluated by Gisela Storz (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved, and the reviewers are satisfied that you have addressed the major concerns from the previous round of review. Nevertheless, there are a few small issues that still need to be addressed, as detailed in the two reviews below:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors have responded positively to the reviewers' comments. I have only a few comments:</p><p>1. Figure 1A. MFI levels for H2DCFDA are reduced when spermidine is added to wild-type cells, but the intracellular concentration of spermidine does not detectably increase in these cells (Figure 1 - Figure Supplement 1C). Thus, the data don't support the conclusion that ROS detected by H2DCFDA is reduced as a result of increased intracellular spermidine levels.</p><p>2. Line 124-5, &quot;...although spermidine accumulation in the ΔspeG strain reduces overall ROS levels and oxidative stress...&quot;. This statement is misleading. Intracellular levels of spermidine are higher in the ΔspeG strain when spermidine is added exogenously, and these cells do exhibit reduced H2DCFDA fluorescence, but so do wild-type cells, where the intracellular spermidine levels do not increase when spermidine is added exogenously.</p><p>3. The authors should show their HPLC traces used for quantifying intracellular spermidine levels. These data should include the control data using purified spermidine, and should indicate the quantified area of the HPLC trace.</p><p>4. Lines 140-1, &quot;The double and triple mutants containing empty vector exhibited higher growth defects than ΔspeG strain on LB-agar plate supplemented with spermidine (Figure 1E).&quot; I am not convinced by this conclusion; the sodA deletion has a very small effect when combined with the speG deletion, and the sodB deletion has no effect. However, what is clear is that overexpression of sodA rescues the growth defect of a speG mutant grown with exogenous spermidine. The authors don't mention this important result.</p><p>5. Figure 4 - Figure Supplement 1. The authors should repeat this restreak so that individual colonies for each strain can be more easily compared.</p><p>6. It seems likely that Fis-regulated and IHF-regulated genes are enriched in the set of genes identified as being differentially expressed in the microarray analysis. However, the authors have not done a statistical test to address this. A Fisher's exact test would suffice for this.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>I'm very happy to see that some of my suggestions from the first review were implemented by the authors.</p><p>Attached are a few more comments.</p><p>1) Claiming that the production of superoxyde is the unique molecular mechanism of toxicity is always too strong.</p><p>lines 35-36: &quot;Therefore, we propose that the spermidine-induced superoxide radicals cause spermidine toxicity in <italic>E. coli</italic>&quot;</p><p>line 84: &quot;we decipher a unique molecular mechanism of spermidine toxicity in bacteria&quot;</p><p>whereas in the rebuttal letter, the authors are more cautious, which is more appropriate: &quot;superoxide generation is one of the major causes of spermidine toxicity&quot; (just before reviewer#2 recommendations for the authors).</p><p>2) The comments on <italic>S. aureus</italic> in the introduction (l.73-77) are not any more necessary</p><p>3) Fig.1E: all the strains carrying plasmids (pDAK1 or pSodA), the plasmids are missing for ∆speG ∆sodB and ∆speG ∆sodA ∆sodB: is it a mistake?

However, further we modified our text in the light of two alternative explanations: Late Prof. Fridovich and many initial work had opined that superoxide can directly activate SoxR. On the other hand, Prof. Imlay group has shown that SoxR is efficiently activated by redox cycling drugs, but not by superoxide. We observed superoxide generation and no activation of SoxR which fits well with the second school of thought. However, we have also used a redox cycling drug, menadione, which activated SoxR greatly, and spermidine deactivates this menadione-induced SoxR activation. This data is pointing towards a bigger and generalized concept that spermidine may keep SoxR in apo-SoxR form by interfering its iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis. As a result, be it superoxide or redox-cycling drug, they cannot activate SoxR! We mentioned these new points in different part of the revised manuscript (Lines: 235-241, 431-438).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Figure 4 and associated text.

Should read &quot;spermidine is highly toxic to cells&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Removed the article “The” from the sentence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The authors have investigated why the polyamine spermidine is toxic to the bacterium Escherichia coli when intracellular spermidine is present in excess. To obtain cells where spermidine might be present in excess, they sought to create a gene deletion strain for the speG gene that encodes spermidine N-acetyltransferase, an enzyme that N-acetylates spermidine when spermidine levels are in excess, thereby neutralizing whatever function of spermidine is deleterious to cell growth. In principle, a speG gene deletion strain of E. coli is likely to have higher intracellular levels of spermidine. The authors also grew the speG strain in media contain high levels of added spermidine, which would be expected to further increase intracellular spermidine levels. A large number of physiological experiments were performed by the authors to demonstrate whether excess spermidine affects oxidative stress, and they concluded that it caused the generation of superoxide. Other analyses were performed to assess the affect of spermidine on iron oxidation. The global impact of spermidine toxicity was assessed by performing a transcriptional microarray experiment where the speG gene deletion strain was grown with and without 3.8 mM added spermidine in the growth medium, and the authors concluded that spermidine affects iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis.</p><p>Unfortunately (and inexplicably), the authors at no point measured spermidine or N-acetylspermidine levels in the cells that they were working with. The gene deletion regions for spermidine N-acetyltransferase (speG) and for spermidine synthase (speE) were transferred from KEIO collection strains into the authors' model E. coli wildtype strain by phage P1 transduction but were not confirmed by PCR after transduction, or by measuring spermidine or N-acetylspermidine levels. Thus, there is no proof that spermidine levels are altered in the speG or spermidine synthase (speE) gene deletion strains. The gene deletion strains were not complemented by the wildtype genes to show that any growth effects were not due to off-target damage cause by the P1 transduction. Furthermore, the supposed gene deletion strains were grown in LB medium, which contains spermidine, instead of in chemically defined M9 medium that does not contain spermidine. Because the spermidine content of the gene deletion strains is unknown, one can have very little confidence in any result that is supposedly based on whether cells contain excess spermidine or not. Although the microarray data looked at the effect of {plus minus} 3.8 mM spermidine on gene expression in the speG gene deletion strain, without knowledge of the intracellular spermidine content, any transcriptional effect could be due to indirect effects of spermidine on the cell wall, the outer membrane, on pH, and osmotic effects. In conclusion, the authors have performed a large number experiments where any conclusions on outcomes are in doubt due to the complete lack of knowledge of the content of intracellular spermidine, the metabolite that is supposedly responsible for the observed effects. Since, presumably, the authors do not have the data for intracellular spermidine content in their experiments, it is difficult to see how the data obtained can be used to make physiological conclusions, other than relating the observed effects to the presence or absence of added spermidine in the growth medium.</p></disp-quote><p>I appreciate the concern of the Reviewer. In fact, many years ago, we have noticed that some knockouts in Keio collection (e.g ∆<italic>hns</italic>) are not perfect. Therefore, our default lab practice is to make fresh strains by P1 transduction in an isogenic WT <italic>E. coli</italic> background (Either MG1655 or BW25113) followed by confirming the allelic replacement by PCR using flanking primer-pairs and Sanger sequencing. Although we had already mentioned the point of PCR verification in the Methods section, we forgot to mention the Sanger sequencing part. Now we clearly mentioned the sanger sequencing part (Line number: 416-420). in Methods section.</p><p>Now we have performed HPLC coupled MS analyses of the tri-dansylated-spermidine to determine its intracellular level to support our observations (in collaboration with my colleague Dr. Vinod D. Chaudhari; See the new author list for the detail). Di-dansylated-hexane diamine was used as an internal standard. Polyamines were extracted from about 50mg wet cell pellets adding internal standard and then fully dansylated. The tri-dansylated spermidine peak areas were first normalized with the area of the internal standards, and then with the wet mass of the cell pellets. A standard curve was also generated using different amounts of tri-dansylated spermidine using the HPLC. The cellular levels of spermidine were represented as µmol/100mg of wet cell pellets (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C and Source data Figure 1—figure supplement 1C).</p><p>We could not resolve N-acetyl spermidine peak using the protocol used by Dr. Chaudhari lab. We see an old literature where authors have shown two different, N1 and N8-acetyl spermidine peaks. In our case these two acetylated peaks but were merged with many other components, as detected in MS data.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that the spermidine can exerts effect on cell wall, outer membrane, pH and osmotic balance but how it will cause different effects to WT and ∆<italic>speG</italic> cells when present in extracellular environment is not conceivable. They can cause differential effect on those components only when accumulate intracellularly which was possible in ∆<italic>speG</italic> cells, but not in a wild type background. For example, spermidine also has an effect on translation. However, we have shown here that the superoxide generation is one of the major cause of spermidine toxicity. Thus, effects of spermidine in two isogenic strains (WT and DspeG) are different.</p><p>Our data now shows the intracellular level of spermidines in the different strains (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C and Source data Figure 1—figure supplement 1C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is difficult to see how the data from this study can be salvaged. The observed effects cannot be attributed to excess spermidine or the complete absence of spermidine, since the level of spermidine in cells was never measured. Furthermore, the purported spermidine synthase (speE) deletion strain was grown in LB medium, which is a rich medium containing spermidine. Growth of the supposedly spermidine deficient speE deletion strain in LB medium will result in spermidine uptake from the LB medium, such that the supposedly depleted spermidine will be replaced by spermidine from the LB medium. The authors should have used chemically defined M9 medium for any spermidine-related experiment. Not only should spermidine levels and N-acetylspermidine levels have been measured in the speG deletion strain, but the levels of these metabolites should have been measured over the growth curve because N-acetylspermidine is accumulated more in stationary phase.</p><p>It may be possible to express the physiological changes observed in this study to the presence or absence of added spermidine to the growth medium, but the changes observed cannot be attributed to the levels of intracellular spermidine, since they were never measured.</p></disp-quote><p>Now we have performed MS-coupled HPLC analyses of the spermidine peaks to determine its intracellular level to support our observations.</p><p>To get an idea, we compared the relative spermidine peak area in the LB medium to WT cell. This suggests that dry LB medium contains approx. 25 times lesser spermidine concentration than equal wet mass of WT cell pellets. If we consider the bio-number, The 100 mg wet cell pellet will correspond to about 20 mg dry mass. Therefore, comparing dry masses, LB powder will have 125 time lesser concentration of spermidine than in <italic>E. coli</italic> Dry cell pellets. Thus, this spermidine contamination in LB medium transported uphill to raise the polyamine level in the ∆<italic>speE</italic> strain to some extent, but it remains well below WT levels.</p><p>We could not resolve N-acetyl spermidine peaks but could detect their presence or absence in the MS data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In the manuscript by Kumar et al., the authors proposed that sperimidine (SPD) triggers the production of superoxide radicals and claimed that this production is the unique molecular mechanism of toxicity in bacteria (line 81).

However, clarifications, controls and new experiences are needed to support their conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>Now we have come up with new experiments and clarifications as stated point-by point below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>My main concern is that the authors consider the ROS probes as specific for each compound (HO{degree sign}, O2{degree sign}-). The interconnection between ROS in the cells and the absence of great specificity of this type of tools should not make it possible to affirm the dependence of one type of ROS. Other approach would be necessary. Detecting very transient ROS, such as superoxide radicals, is challenging in the study of oxidative stress in vivo and an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) approach is considered ideal since it is unique for detecting free radicals.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks to the reviewer for educating us with his helpful comments. We are convinced by the reviewer that the ROS probes, specifically H2DCFDA or DHE are not very specific for OH or superoxide radicals! Although DHE would be somewhat specific for superoxide in our assay condition. However, we cannot take any chance to misinterpret the observations. Therefore, as per the reviewer’s suggestion, we performed EPR spectroscopy experiments for superoxide detection.</p><p>We have struggled a lot to execute the suggested EPR experiments for superoxide species detection. This is because the EPR machines are available in a few distantly places in India and either heavily occupied by the physicists and chemists, or usage were restricted due to COVID situation.

MFI levels for H2DCFDA are reduced when spermidine is added to wild-type cells, but the intracellular concentration of spermidine does not detectably increase in these cells (Figure 1 - Figure Supplement 1C).

However, one cannot deny that exogenous spermidine supplementation caused the decreased H2DCFDA fluorescence. In fact, SpeG (spermidine N-acetyl transferase) enzyme can quickly acetylate either N1 and N8-amine groups of excess spermidines forming two different species of N-acetyl-spermidines in WT strain keeping almost constant level of spermidine. In eukaryotic system, there is known mechanisms of further degradation/recycling of N-acetyl-spermidines, but nothing is known about the fate of N-acetyl spermidines in prokaryotes.
