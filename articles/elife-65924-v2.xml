bacterial evolution. Mobile genetic elements are responsible for much of horizontal gene transfer and also carry beneficial cargo genes. Uncovering strategies used by mobile genetic elements to benefit host cells is crucial for understanding their stability and spread in populations. We describe a benefit that ICE<italic>Bs1</italic>, an integrative and conjugative element of <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, provides to its host cells. Activation of ICE<italic>Bs1</italic> conferred a frequency-dependent selective advantage to host cells during two different developmental processes: biofilm formation and sporulation. These benefits were due to inhibition of biofilm-associated gene expression and delayed sporulation by ICE<italic>Bs1</italic>-containing cells, enabling them to exploit their neighbors and grow more prior to development. A single ICE<italic>Bs1</italic> gene, <italic>devI</italic> (formerly <italic>ydcO</italic>), was both necessary and sufficient for inhibition of development. Manipulation of host developmental programs allows ICE<italic>Bs1</italic> to increase host fitness, thereby increasing propagation of the element.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many bacteria can ‘have sex’ – that is, they can share their genetic information and trade off segments of DNA.

ICE<italic>Bs1</italic> for instance, is an element found in the common soil bacterium <italic>Bacillus subtilis.</italic> Scientists know that ICE<italic>Bs1</italic> can rapidly spread in biofilms – the slimly, crowded communities where bacteria live tightly connected – but it is still unclear whether it helps or hinders its hosts.</p><p>Using genetic manipulations and tracking the survival of different groups of cells, Jones et al. show that carrying ICE<italic>Bs1</italic> confers an advantage under many conditions. When <italic>B. subtilis</italic> forms biofilms, the presence of the <italic>devI</italic> gene in ICE<italic>Bs1</italic> helps the cells to delay the production of the costly mucus that keeps bacteria together, allowing the organisms to ‘cheat’ for a little while and benefit from the tight-knit community without contributing to it. As nutrients become scarce in biofilms, the gene also allows the bacteria to grow for longer before they start to form spores – the dormant bacterial form that can weather difficult conditions.</p><p>Mobile elements can carry genes that make bacteria resistant to antibiotics, harmful to humans, or able to use new food sources; they could even be used to artificially introduce genes of interest in these cells. The work by Jones et al. helps to understand the way these elements influence the fate of their host, providing insight into how they could be harnessed for the benefit of human health.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>horizontal gene transfer</kwd><kwd>mobile genetic elements</kwd><kwd>sporulation</kwd><kwd>biofilms</kwd><kwd>integrative and conjugative elements (ICE)</kwd><kwd>microbial development</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>B. subtilis</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM050895</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grossman</surname><given-names>Alan D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM122538</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grossman</surname><given-names>Alan D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A mobile genetic element provides a selective advantage to host cells by delaying development, including biofilm and spore formation, thereby enabling temporary cheating and extra divisions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Conjugative elements and phages are abundant mobile genetic elements in bacteria, capable of transferring DNA between cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Frost et al., 2005</xref>). Integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) appear to be the most widespread type of conjugative element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guglielmini et al., 2011</xref>). ICEs are found integrated in a host genome. When activated, they excise and produce conjugation machinery that transfers the element DNA from the host cell to recipients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carraro and Burrus, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Johnson and Grossman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wozniak and Waldor, 2010</xref>).</p><p>ICEs often carry ‘cargo’ genes that are not necessary for transfer but confer a phenotype to host cells. In fact, ICEs (conjugative transposons) were first identified because of the phenotypes conferred by cargo genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Franke and Clewell, 1981</xref>). Cargo genes include those encoding antibiotic resistances, metabolic pathways, and determinants of pathogenesis and symbiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Johnson and Grossman, 2015</xref>). Transfer of mobile elements between cells contributes to rapid evolution and spread of associated cargo genes and phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Frost et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Treangen and Rocha, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Despite the benefits cargo genes can provide, the maintenance and transfer of mobile genetic elements requires host cellular resources and in some cases is lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baltrus, 2013</xref>). Maintenance of a mobile genetic element in host cells requires balancing the costs and benefits to the host or a sufficiently high transfer frequency. Many mobile elements, especially ICEs, have been identified bioinformatically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guglielmini et al., 2011</xref>). Many of these ICEs contain putative cargo genes. However, the phenotypes conferred by these genes cannot be inferred from sequence nor are they easily detected experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cury et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>ICE<italic>Bs1</italic>, a relatively small (~20 kb) ICE found in most strains of <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, was identified bioinformatically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burrus et al., 2002</xref>) and experimentally based on its regulation by cell-cell signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Auchtung et al., 2005</xref>). Most of the ICE<italic>Bs1</italic> genes needed for conjugation are grouped together in an operon that is repressed until activating signals are sensed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Two pathways activate ICE<italic>Bs1</italic>, both of which lead to cleavage of the repressor ImmR by the protease and anti-repressor ImmA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Auchtung et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bose et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bose and Grossman, 2011</xref>). ICE<italic>Bs1</italic> contains the cell-cell signaling genes, <italic>rapI</italic> and <italic>phrI</italic>, which regulate ICE<italic>Bs1</italic> activation by sensing population density and the relative abundance of ICE<italic>Bs1</italic>-containing host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Auchtung et al., 2005</xref>). RapI is produced at high cell density and during the transition to stationary phase and stimulates the proteolytic cleavage of the repressor ImmR by the protease ImmA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bose and Grossman, 2011</xref>). Overproduction of RapI stimulates activation of ICE<italic>Bs1</italic> in &gt;90% of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Auchtung et al., 2005</xref>). RapI activity (and therefore ICE<italic>Bs1</italic> activation) is inhibited by PhrI, a peptide that is secreted by cells that contain ICE<italic>Bs1</italic>. PhrI levels indicate the relative abundance of ICE<italic>Bs1</italic>-containing cells in the population, preventing the activation and possible redundant transfer of ICE<italic>Bs1</italic> if most nearby cells already contain the element. ICE<italic>Bs1</italic> is also activated during the RecA-dependent DNA damage response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Auchtung et al., 2005</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Genetic map and regulatory pathways of ICE<italic>Bs1.</italic></title><p>Genes are represented by horizontal block arrows indicating the direction of transcription. Vertical right-angle arrows mark the positions of promoters, and the arrowhead indicates the direction of transcription. Genes known to be involved in the conjugative life cycle of ICE<italic>Bs1</italic> are shaded in gray. The 60 bp direct repeats that mark the ends of ICE<italic>Bs1</italic> are shown as black rectangles. (Inset) A partial genetic map that highlights factors involved in the regulation of ICE<italic>Bs1</italic>. The major promoter Pxis drives expression of most genes in ICE<italic>Bs1</italic>. Pxis is repressed by the ICE-encoded repressor ImmR. Repression is relieved when ImmR is cleaved by the protease ImmA, and proteolytic cleavage is stimulated by activated RecA (RecA*) in response to DNA damage, or, independently by the cell signaling regulator RapI. RapI is made when cells are crowded by potential recipients, but repressed by the ICE-encoded secreted peptide PhrI if the neighboring cells already contain a copy of ICE<italic>Bs1. devI</italic> (formerly <italic>ydcO</italic>) is the third open-reading frame downstream of Pxis. DevI inhibits sporulation and expression of biofilm matrix genes, likely by inhibiting Spo0A (directly or indirectly).

In addition, during growth in a biofilm, ICE<italic>Bs1</italic> is naturally activated and transfers efficiently, generating on the order of 10 new ICE<italic>Bs1</italic>-containing host cells (transconjugants) per donor cell under appropriate conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lécuyer et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>B. subtilis</italic> biofilms are held together by a matrix composed of secreted exopolysaccharides, protein fibers, and DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vlamakis et al., 2013</xref>). This matrix reinforces cell-cell contacts, likely promoting rapid spread of ICE<italic>Bs1</italic> by conjugation. Additionally, the conditions that promote biofilm formation (high cell density) also promote activation and transfer of ICE<italic>Bs1</italic> and sporulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Auchtung et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grossman and Losick, 1988</xref>). Although biofilm growth is clearly beneficial to conjugation, it is unknown how ICE<italic>Bs1</italic> impacts its host cells under these conditions.</p><p>In this study, we describe a selective advantage provided by ICE<italic>Bs1</italic> to its host cells during growth in biofilms. This fitness benefit was due to inhibition of host biofilm and spore development. We identified the ICE<italic>Bs1</italic> gene <italic>devI</italic> (formerly <italic>ydcO</italic>) as necessary and sufficient to inhibit host development and provide a selective advantage to ICE<italic>Bs1-</italic>containing cells. We also provide evidence indicating that <italic>devI</italic> likely inhibits the key developmental transcription factor Spo0A, reducing its ability to stimulate biofilm and sporulation gene expression. <italic>devI</italic> (<italic>ydcO</italic>) is conserved in other ICE<italic>Bs1</italic>-like elements, indicating that manipulation of host development may be a conserved strategy among this family of mobile genetic elements. We postulate that manipulation of host pathways may be a common function of many of the as yet uncharacterized cargo genes in ICEs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ICE<italic>Bs1</italic> spreads efficiently in biofilms by conjugation</title><p>Biofilm formation is characteristic of many bacteria growing in natural settings, including <italic>B. subtilis</italic>.

The highest frequency of transconjugants was observed when the starting frequency of ICE<italic>Bs1</italic>-containing cells was ~0.1.

When ICE<italic>Bs1-</italic>containing cells are the minority in a mixed population, ICE<italic>Bs1</italic> genes are induced. One of these genes, <italic>devI</italic>, is necessary and sufficient to inhibit biofilm- and sporulation-associated gene expression, likely by inhibiting the key developmental regulator Spo0A, either directly or indirectly. Together with previous findings we conclude that ICE<italic>Bs1</italic> encodes at least three distinct strategies to benefit its host cells. (1) Inhibition of development (described here) provides a growth advantage in biofilms and during sporulation. (2) Exclusion, mediated by <italic>yddJ</italic>, blocks the conjugation machinery and protects the host cell from lethal excessive transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avello et al., 2019</xref>). (3) An abortive infection mechanism, mediated by <italic>spbK</italic> (<italic>yddK</italic>) protects populations of ICE<italic>Bs1</italic> host cells from predation by the lysogenic phage SPβ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Johnson et al., 2020</xref>). We propose that all three strategies provide a competitive advantage for ICE<italic>Bs1</italic> and its host cells in different conditions.</p><p>Expression of <italic>devI</italic> reduces biofilm matrix expression and delays the initiation of sporulation. Production of the biofilm matrix is a public good, benefiting the whole community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dragoš et al., 2018</xref>). Avoidance of matrix production can therefore be considered an exploitative behavior. Exploitation can be detrimental to the population as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Smith and Schuster, 2019</xref>), but we did not observe any negative effects on populations under conditions where ICE<italic>Bs1</italic> host cells had an advantage. This is in agreement with the facultative nature of ICE<italic>Bs1</italic> cheating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Even-Tov et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pollak et al., 2016</xref>). Quorum-sensing by <italic>rapI-phrI</italic> ensures that ICE<italic>Bs1</italic> cheats only as a minority, where its impact on total public goods levels is negligible. Interestingly, the pBS32 plasmid utilizes direct regulation of biofilm formation by a Rap receptor to its benefit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Omer Bendori et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pollak et al., 2015</xref>), while in ICE<italic>Bs1</italic> this regulation was moved from the Rap receptor to one of its regulated genes.</p><p>The fitness consequences of sporulation inhibition are complicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mutlu et al., 2018</xref>). Delaying sporulation too long would result in a loss of viability of the starved cells. Inhibition of sporulation by ICE<italic>Bs1</italic> appears to be transient; ICE<italic>Bs1</italic> host cells eventually sporulate and do not lose significant viability as a consequence of delaying sporulation. Regulation of <italic>devI</italic> expression by the cell-cell signaling genes <italic>rapI-phrI</italic> is likely critical for transient developmental inhibition. Because commitment to sporulation is irreversible, sporulating too early is detrimental if nutrient deprivation is short-lived. <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells with activated Spo0A that have not yet committed to sporulate also delay commitment to sporulation by killing sibling cells to liberate nutrients (‘cannibalism’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">González-Pastor et al., 2003</xref>). Cannibalism is regulated by Spo0A and the subpopulation of cannibal cells (those doing the killing) overlaps with those producing the biofilm matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">López et al., 2009</xref>). Because of this overlap, it seems unlikely that <italic>devI</italic> delays sporulation by stimulating cannibalism.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>ICE<italic>Bs1</italic> stability during sporulation</title><p>We hypothesize that in addition to providing a fitness advantage to its host cell, delaying sporulation may also improve stability of ICE<italic>Bs1</italic> in the host during development. Sporulation involves the formation of an asymmetric division septum generating the larger mother cell and the smaller forespore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Errington, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Higgins and Dworkin, 2012</xref>). Sporulation is induced when cells are at a high population density and running out of nutrients, conditions that also activate ICE<italic>Bs1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Auchtung et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grossman and Losick, 1988</xref>). The plasmid form of ICE<italic>Bs1</italic> that is generated after excision from the chromosome is not known to have a mechanism for active partitioning and is more likely to remain in the larger mother cell if the cells do enter the sporulation pathway and divide asymmetrically. Therefore, the ability of ICE<italic>Bs1</italic> to delay the initiation of sporulation under conditions where the element is activated could help prevent loss of the element and maintain ICE<italic>Bs1</italic> in host cells.</p><p>Mobile genetic elements employ various strategies to promote their maintenance during sporulation. Rates of curing during sporulation for various plasmids in <italic>Bacillus</italic> species vary widely and do not necessarily correlate with their stability during normal cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tokuda et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Turgeon et al., 2008</xref>). Mechanisms encoded by plasmids to promote their stability during growth and sporulation include the production of dynamic cytoskeletal filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Becker et al., 2006</xref>) and post-segregational killing of plasmid-cured pre-spores with toxin-antitoxin systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Short et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, even lytic phage genomes can be incorporated into spores (first described in the 1960 s) by co-opting the host’s chromosomal partitioning system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Meijer et al., 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Diversity of cargo genes and associated phenotypes</title><p>Mobile genetic elements, especially ICEs, are widespread in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Frost et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guglielmini et al., 2011</xref>). Many known mobile genetic elements encode cargo genes that confer easily recognizable phenotypes, notably antibiotic resistance. Other cargo genes provide less obvious phenotypes but still fundamentally alter the physiology of the host cell. A large (500 kb) ICE was discovered in <italic>Mesorhizobium loti</italic> because its horizontal transfer conferred the ability to form nitrogen-fixing symbiotic rood nodules on <italic>Lotus</italic> plant species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sullivan and Ronson, 1998</xref>). In many pathogens, cargo genes in mobile elements are largely responsible for virulence. For example, <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> is capable of a pathogenic lifestyle in human hosts due to the toxin-encoding phage CTXΦ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Waldor and Mekalanos, 1996</xref>). In the sporulating pathogen <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic>, mobile genetic elements regulate both virulence and host development. Two plasmids, pXO1 and pXO2, provide the genes for toxin synthesis and production of a protective capsule, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Green et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mikesell et al., 1983</xref>). pXO1 also contains a regulatory gene, <italic>atxA</italic>, that regulates virulence factor production and inhibits host cell sporulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dale et al., 2018</xref>). Co-regulation of virulence factors and sporulation is likely important during infection, as <italic>B. anthracis</italic> spores are thought to be more susceptible than vegetative cells to eradication by the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mock and Fouet, 2001</xref>).</p><p>Mobile elements are also known to alter the host’s interaction with other horizontally acquired DNA, which has implications for the fitness and evolvability of the host. For example, the plasmid pBS32 in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> encodes an inhibitor of the host’s DNA uptake machinery, blocking natural transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Konkol et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, genes with roles in defense against foreign DNA, CRISPR-Cas systems, are also identified within mobile elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Faure et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McDonald et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Millen et al., 2012</xref>). Competition between mobile elements not only shapes the repertoire of cargo genes in a given cell, but it may also protect the host from harmful elements.</p><p>Many mobile genetic elements have been identified bioinformatically from genome sequences or discovered by means other than the phenotypes they provide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guglielmini et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Johnson and Grossman, 2015</xref>). Many elements lack obvious cargo genes, or at least lack cargo genes that have recognizable functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cury et al., 2017</xref>). We suspect that many elements with uncharacterized cargo genes provide important traits to their hosts beyond the scope of the phenotypes currently attributed to mobile elements. Although mobile genetic elements can have remarkably broad host ranges, such as the Tn<italic>916</italic>-Tn<italic>1545</italic> group of ICEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clewell et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roberts and Mullany, 2009</xref>) and the IncP-1 group of plasmids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Popowska and Krawczyk-Balska, 2013</xref>), cargo genes and their associated functions could be highly specific to certain hosts.</p><p>Characterization of unknown cargo genes is likely to expand the diversity of traits currently attributed to mobile genetic elements. We speculate that many of these genes modulate normal host functions rather than provide entirely new phenotypes. Understanding cargo gene function is critical for understanding interactions between and co-evolution of mobile elements and their hosts.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> NCIB3610)</td><td>DS2569</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Konkol et al., 2013</xref>. <break/>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23836866">23836866</ext-link></td><td/><td>NCIB3610 cured of pBS32 plasmid.

genetic elements can influence host biology. Significantly, it points to the existence of an uncharacterized universe of genes on mobile elements that modulate the lives of their host cells in fascinating and ecologically important ways.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: David Dubnau (Reviewer #3); Gary Dunny (Reviewer #4).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>All the reviewers were in agreement that this is an exceptionally rigorous paper that sets an important precedent for how mobile genetic elements can influence hosts biology. The only requested revisions are the inclusion of a model figure to facilitate comprehension by a general audience and a few changes to one figure and the Discussion.

However, the effects of DevI on phenotypes measured here are probably not due to cannibalism. We included a brief mention of this in the Discussion section. DevI-mediated sporulation delay is likely a distinct mechanism from cannibalism, as cannibalism is under the control of Spo0A and the subpopulation of cannibal cells was shown to overlap with matrix-producing cells. Therefore, cells in which DevI is active are less likely to be cannibal cells.</p></body></sub-article></article>
