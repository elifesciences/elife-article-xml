mechanisms that lead to these processes in atrophic myofibers remain largely unclear. Our research has revealed that the maintenance of proper mitochondrial-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes (MAM) is vital for preventing skeletal muscle atrophy in microgravity environments. We discovered that the deletion of the mitochondrial fusion protein Mitofusin2 (MFN2), which serves as a tether for MAM, in human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells or the reduction of MAM in differentiated myotubes caused by microgravity interfered with myogenic differentiation process and an increased susceptibility to muscle atrophy, as well as the activation of the Notch signaling pathway. The atrophic phenotype of differentiated myotubes in microgravity and the regenerative capacity of Mfn2-deficient muscle stem cells in dystrophic mice were both ameliorated by treatment with the gamma-secretase inhibitor DAPT. Our findings demonstrate how the orchestration of mitochondrial morphology in differentiated myotubes and regenerating muscle stem cells plays a crucial role in regulating Notch signaling through the interaction of MAM.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>muscle atrophy</kwd><kwd>MAM</kwd><kwd>Mfn2</kwd><kwd>Notch</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17K01859</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sato</surname><given-names>Takahiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18H04061</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sato</surname><given-names>Takahiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>23K10971</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sato</surname><given-names>Takahiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009619</institution-id><institution>Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>21gm0910009h0506</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sato</surname><given-names>Takahiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009619</institution-id><institution>Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP16gm0810009</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sato</surname><given-names>Takahiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Nakatomi Memorial Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sato</surname><given-names>Takahiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005694</institution-id><institution>Hori Sciences and Arts Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sato</surname><given-names>Takahiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The maintenance of proper mitochondrial-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes is crucial for preventing skeletal muscle atrophy to interact with the Notch signaling pathway.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Skeletal muscles play a vital role in body posture, movement, and in regulating metabolism. Regular physical activity helps to maintain muscle mass, while decreased use of skeletal muscle can lead to muscle atrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bodine et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sandri et al., 2004</xref>). This can occur in a variety of disease states, such as muscular dystrophies, as well as in conditions where movement is limited, such as long-term bed rest or injury-induced immobility, or even in microgravity conditions during spaceflight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gao et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, muscle loss is a common aspect of the aging process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Larsson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Distefano and Goodpaster, 2018</xref>). The mechanisms of disuse-induced muscle atrophy and the impact on regenerative capacity in skeletal muscle have been extensively studied in various animal models, including humans.</p><p>Mitochondria are essential for maintaining tissue homeostasis and supplying adenosine triphosphate (ATP) during muscle development and regeneration. This is particularly important in energy-intensive myogenic cells, such as differentiated myofibers and muscle stem cells, as they mature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duguez et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ryall, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhattacharya and Scimè, 2020</xref>). The shape and size of mitochondria in mature myofibers undergo drastic changes to meet the energy demands of developmental growth, the switch between slow- and fast-twitch myofibers, exercise, and aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ljubicic et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wyckelsma et al., 2017</xref>). These morphological and functional changes in mitochondria are facilitated by the processes of fission and fusion, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Youle and van der Bliek, 2012</xref>). Mitochondrial fusion is regulated by the transmembrane GTPase proteins, Mitofusin1 (Mfn1) and Mitofusin2 (Mfn2), which are located on the outer mitochondrial membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eura et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Youle and van der Bliek, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Ablation of both Mfn1 and Mfn2 leads to embryonic lethality in mice, while muscle-specific inactivation of <italic>Mfn1</italic> and <italic>Mfn2</italic> genes results in severe mitochondrial dysfunction and muscle atrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2010</xref>). Mfn2, in particular, is necessary to tether the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to mitochondria, thereby enhancing mitochondrial energetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Brito and Scorrano, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Filadi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ishihara et al., 2004</xref>). However, the specific role of the mitochondria-ER complex in developmental, regenerative, and atrophic processes in skeletal muscle remains unclear. Our research has revealed that muscle atrophy is linked to Mfn2 and the Notch signaling pathway, as demonstrated by the use of MFN2-knockout human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, primary human myoblasts, and mice.</p><p>Our research demonstrates that the restoration of ER-mitochondria contacts through the regulation of Notch signaling is sufficient to partially alleviate the bioenergetic defects in MFN2-deficient human iPS cells or myogenic cells. This suggests that treatment with gamma-secretase inhibitors may be a viable therapeutic option in pathological conditions in which Mfn2 is involved. These findings provide new insights into the treatment of skeletal muscle atrophy caused by mitochondrial abnormalities.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Human primary myotubes exhibit an atrophic phenotype in a microgravity environment</title><p>To investigate the effects of microgravity on skeletal muscle atrophy, we utilized a 3D-clinorotation system to simulate microgravity conditions with human primary skeletal muscle hOM2 cells, which are derived from the orbicularis oculi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yamanaka et al., 2019</xref>). We observed that the proliferation of both myogenic cells and human iPS cells decreased in microgravity using the clinorotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), and it has been reported that initial myogenic differentiation to form myotubes is suppressed by fluid motion when the clinorotation is used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mansour et al., 2023</xref>). Therefore, we examined differentiated myotubes derived from primary hOM2 cells after confluence, both with and without the clinorotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These primary cells were mainly differentiated into <italic>MYH7</italic>-positive type 1 slow-twitch myotubes after 7 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), and we found that these differentiated myotubes in microgravity, when cultured for 7 days, were more fragile and tenuous in appearance than those cultured for 2 days, compared to controls (the bottom images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We also observed an increase in the transcripts of <italic>TRIM63</italic> (<italic>MuRF1</italic>) and <italic>FBXO32</italic> (<italic>Atrogen1/MAFbx</italic>), which are markers of muscle atrophy, in these myotubes, as the duration of microgravity increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>). However, the expression of <italic>MRF4</italic> and <italic>MYH3</italic>, early myogenic differentiation markers, and caspase-3 and phospho-AKT, apoptotic markers, were not altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). To investigate the condition of mitochondrial-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes (MAM) in differentiated myotubes, we utilized a proximity ligation assay (PLA) with antibodies against the voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) of mitochondria and the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (IP3 receptor) of the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Prole and Taylor, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shoshan-Barmatz et al., 1996</xref>). Previous studies have demonstrated that PLA can occur within a range of 40 nm, which aligns with findings suggesting that optical Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer necessitates a mitochondrial proximity of approximately 20 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gottschalk et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lim et al., 2021</xref>). We found that the number of MAM was severely decreased in microgravity, specifically in differentiated multinucleate myotubes rather than undifferentiated myoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–F</xref>). It has been previously reported that the mitochondrial fusion protein MFN2 tethers MAM. We found that the protein level of MFN2 was decreased in differentiated myotubes under microgravity conditions, although the mRNA level was not significantly changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The integrity of the mitochondrial-associated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane is compromised by microgravity in differentiated primary human myotubes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A diagrammatic representation of differentiated human myotubes under normal conditions or exposed to clinorotation. µG, microgravity.

Here, we found that diminished MAM is associated with muscle atrophy in the microgravity condition. The result of our studies demonstrated the essential role of MAM in the regulation of skeletal muscle atrophy. MAM is considered to serve as a Ca<sup>2+</sup> transit point from the ER to mitochondria and is regulated not only by MFN2 but by the IP3R-VDAC1 protein complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rizzuto et al., 1998</xref>) which releases Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the ER and participates in its transfer to the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Szabadkai et al., 2006</xref>). We have therefore measured the proximity of these protein complexes by the PLA method, as reported in liver or kidney cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alam, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">D’Eletto et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Theurey et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Mfn2 is a key factor in regulating mitochondrial fusion, which is affected by the GTPase activity of both Mfn1 and Mfn2 on the mitochondrial outer membrane. It has been reported that Mfn2 but not Mfn1 independently regulates not only MAM, but also mitophagy, obesity, cardiomyopathies, and several neuronal defects such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, and Parkinson’s disease, suggesting that Mfn2 might not functionally compensate for Mfn1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen and Dorn, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Filadi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sebastián et al., 2016</xref>). Our experiments with MFN2-disrupted iPS cells also indicated that the numbers of MAM were decreased and affected mitochondrial functions. However, no effect on developmental myogenesis or growth was observed in Mfn2-deficient mice, which showed comparable to that of wildtype mice. In muscle regeneration, Mfn2-deficient mice showed little change from wildtype mice in the event of a single muscle injury. In contrast, Mfn2 deficiency caused a muscle atrophy-like phenotype in vitro culture, however, no such muscle atrophy is observed with muscle-specific Mfn2 deficiency in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Luo et al., 2021</xref>). One potential explanation for this discrepancy is that cell culture conditions introduce excessive mechanical stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonfanti et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Valon and Levayer, 2019</xref>). Indeed in vivo, repeated injury of muscle lacking Mfn2 did result in impaired regeneration. Future studies should consider how Mfn2 is involved in adaptation to mechanical stress.</p><p>In addition, enhanced Notch signaling was observed accompanying the decrease of MAM in MFN2-deficient iPS cells and myocytes. Reports on cardiac muscle cells suggest that there is crosstalk between Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calcineurin with MAM and Notch signaling pathways, which may function in addition to, or in parallel with, Notch1 regulation by extracellular calcium and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> adenosine triphosphatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rand et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Roti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Song et al., 2022</xref>). Indeed, we report that when human iPS cells in the absence of MFN2 were treated with inhibitors of calcineurin and Notch signaling, the mitochondrial distribution was not significantly altered by FK506, a calcineurin inhibitor, but by DAPT, a Notch signaling inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). The same results were obtained in skeletal muscle cells, where changes in mitochondrial distribution were observed and partial functional recovery was demonstrated upon suppression of Notch signaling. Further research will be necessary to unravel the underlying mechanisms that lead to enhanced Notch signaling in MFN2 deficiency, to explore upstream pathways, other than calcium, and to elucidate the reverse control mechanism by which Notch regulates MAMs.</p><p>The Notch signaling pathway is an evolutionarily conserved cascade that plays a role in organ development and morphogenesis, stem cell fate, tissue metabolism, and in various diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersson et al., 2011</xref>). In skeletal muscles, Notch signaling is regulated throughout multiple stages of development and regeneration. It is essential for maintaining the dormant state and also for self-renewal of muscle stem cells in the adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gioftsidi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). The positioning of these stem cells on muscle fibers depends on basal lamina assembly controlled by Notch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bröhl et al., 2012</xref>), which also acts as an inhibitor of premature differentiation by repressing the expression of MyoD, a myogenic regulatory factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Delfini et al., 2000</xref>). However, its role in myogenesis at late stages or in mature myotubes remains unclear. In studies involving the forced expression of NICD in differentiating muscle cells, Notch signaling has been shown to inhibit their maturation after myocyte fusion, but also to ameliorate the pathophysiology of mature muscle fibers in aged or dystrophic muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bi et al., 2016</xref>). The differentiated human muscle cell culture used in this experiment reported here do not form fully mature fibers. Therefore, the effects of Notch inhibition by DAPT at later stages, using more highly organized culture systems to prompt maturation, require further investigation.</p><p>Activated Notch signaling has been reported in dystrophic or atrophic muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fujimaki et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sakai-Takemura et al., 2020</xref>) and also in other pathological situations such as neuroblastomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ferrari-Toninelli et al., 2010</xref>) or in ischemic stroke where inhibition of Notch signaling with DAPT is beneficial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balaganapathy et al., 2018</xref>). Our study has shown that treatment of DAPT can counteract the negative effect of MFN2 deficiency in human iPS cells and myocytes. Furthermore, grafting efficiency of Mfn2-deficient muscle stem cells is improved if the recipient muscle is treated with DAPT. These experiments point to the positive effects of inhibiting Notch in this context. Importantly, reduction in Notch signaling by DAPT addition in muscle cells under microgravity resulted in higher Mfn2 and MAM levels with improved mitochondrial function and reduced atrophy. This opens the possibility that compounds to inhibit Notch signaling may be of therapeutic value in treating pathological muscle wasting. The treatment of various cancers and of Alzheimer’s disease, in which the Notch pathway has been implicated, is in progress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McCaw et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">You et al., 2023</xref>). Further investigation will be required to find out whether these gamma-secretase inhibitors are also effective against muscle atrophy and muscle diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Primary human myogenic cell culture</title><p>All methods relating to human studies were performed in accordance with the guidelines and regulations of Medical Research Ethics Review Committee of Fujita Health University (approved number CI22-087).

The rationale used to obtain the data is one of the main strengths of the study. Already from the reading, the reasoning scheme used by the authors in setting up the study and evaluating the data obtained is clear. Using both cellular and mouse models in vivo consolidates the data obtained. The authors also methodologically described all the choices made in the supplementary section. A weakness, on the other hand, is the failure to include averages and statistical data in the results that would give a quantifiable idea of the data obtained. To complete the picture, the authors could also investigate the possible involvement of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway as well as describe probable metabolic shifts to muscle cells in atrophic conditions. The rationale used by the authors to obtain the result is linear. The data obtained are useful for understanding the onset and characterization of the atrophic phenotype under disuse and microgravity conditions. The methods used are in line with those used in the field and can be a starting point for other studies. The cellular models are well described in the Materials and methods section. The selected mouse models followed a logical rationale and were in line with the intended aim.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank this reviewer for comments that have led us to clarify several points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>In order to reinforce and justify the results obtained, I would suggest that the authors include numerical and statistical data in the results obtained.</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>Answer As the reviewer suggested, we have incorporated actual numerical and statistical data into each graph in all figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>With the aim of better framing the picture of an atrophic muscle phenotype caused by microgravity or disuse, I would advise the authors to also focus on the possible involvement of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway.

Our experiments showed no significant differences among these three housekeeping genes.We have added these data to Figure 1C and Methods in the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
