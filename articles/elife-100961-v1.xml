Basal progenitors give rise to progeny throughout development – first to intermediate cells, a transient proliferative suprabasal cell population, and later to spinous cells. Neither the function nor the differentiation trajectory of intermediate cells has been documented. We generated transcriptomes of intermediate and spinous cells and identified specific markers that distinguish these two populations. Further, we found that intermediate cells express a subset of genes in common with granular cells of the epidermis – the terminal living cell type that helps establish the barrier. Lineage tracing revealed that most intermediate cells directly transition to granular cells without expressing markers specific to spinous cells, thus revealing a distinct lineage pathway leading to granular fate. In addition to their transcriptional similarities, intermediate and granular cells both had hallmarks of increased actomyosin contractility. We found that rather than simply lying downstream of cell fate pathways, contractility was sufficient to suppress spinous fate and promote granular gene expression. Together, these data establish the molecular and mechanical characteristics of the developing epidermis that allow this tissue to rapidly develop barrier activity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>epidermis</kwd><kwd>interemediate cell</kwd><kwd>contractility</kwd><kwd>development</kwd><kwd>granular</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>NIH-NIAMS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AR08108</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lechler</surname><given-names>Terry</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>NIH-NIAMS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AR067203</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lechler</surname><given-names>Terry</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>NIH-NIAMS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AR083352</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lechler</surname><given-names>Terry</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The roles of intermediate cells and contractility are characterized in the embryonic development of the epidermis.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Development of many tissues is characterized by rapid proliferation coupled with morphogenesis and differentiation. This process often uses specialized and transient cell types that are not found in homeostatic tissue, necessitating distinct pathways for differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Singh and Tiwari, 2023</xref>). During the embryonic development of the epidermis, an initial single layer of progenitor cells gives rise to a multilayered and differentiated tissue that acts as a chemical and mechanical barrier at birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Moreci and Lechler, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sumigray and Lechler, 2015</xref>). This process begins at embryonic day (E) 14.5 in the mouse back skin when basal progenitor cells start to give rise to a suprabasal cell layer of intermediate cells (ICs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Damen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lechler and Fuchs, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Smart, 1970</xref>). Subsequently, basal cells divide to generate spinous cells, which are postmitotic. These cells then further differentiate into granular cells, the last living cell types in the epidermis which are integral to forming the epidermal barrier. ICs are a transient cell type that expresses differentiation markers like keratin 1 (K1) and K10 but remain mitotically active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Weiss and Zelickson, 1975</xref>). At this time point, the proliferation rate of ICs is comparable to basal cells, suggesting that they are a significant contributor to tissue expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Damen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Smart, 1970</xref>). These cells lack basement membrane attachment and, thus, they proliferate in a tissue environment that is normally quiescent in the adult. Currently, we do not understand if they play functional roles outside of proliferation, their cell fate trajectory, or how they compare to later generated spinous cells at a molecular level. Further, we lack specific markers for ICs despite recent scRNA-Seq data that has characterized the transcriptomes of these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jacob et al., 2023</xref>). Generation of ICs is transient (E14–15.5), and by E16.5 basal cells give rise to postmitotic spinous cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). It is not known whether this switch in progeny type is driven by intrinsic changes in basal progenitors, changes in signals from the surrounding periderm, and/or by systemic signals (circulating factors or amniotic fluid; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huebner et al., 2012</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Transcriptomic analysis of embryonic epidermal cell populations.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram depicting the stratification process and different cell populations (basal and K10+ suprabasal layers) existing in the epidermis from embryonic day (E) 14.5 to E16.5.

This has been most clearly demonstrated by substrates of differential stiffness eliciting altered differentiation pathways in mesenchymal stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Engler et al., 2006</xref>). Whether intra-tissue mechanical information is also instructive in differentiation has not been as thoroughly addressed. That said, in many tissues, differentiation leads to changes in contractility and/or stiffness. For example, in the epidermis, there is increased contractility in the granular cell layer, and this contractility is important for the formation of tight junctions in this cell layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Miroshnikova et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rübsam et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sumigray et al., 2012</xref>). While this flow of information from transcriptome to contractility has largely been assumed to be unidirectional, some works have demonstrated bidirectional interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Le et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Meyer-ter-Vehn et al., 2006</xref>). When physical linkages between the cytoskeleton and nucleus were removed, there was a premature differentiation of keratinocytes, and this was hypothesized to involve alterations in the transcription of the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC), a genetic locus that undergoes a change in localization in response to differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carley et al., 2021</xref>). Further, increased contractility in differentiated cells of the epidermis results in a non-cell autonomous effect on proliferation of their progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ning et al., 2021</xref>). However, we lack clear evidence that contractility can directly affect differentiation in the epidermis.</p><p>Here, we used bulk sequencing to characterize the transcriptomes of ICs and spinous cells, as well as their progenitors. We defined markers that are specific for ICs and spinous cells and showed marked transcriptomic differences in the basal cell progenitors that give rise to these distinct cell types. Further, our data demonstrate that ICs express many genes associated with granular cells – a cell type that emerges days later and is responsible for secreting lipids that constitute part of the epidermal barrier. Rather than moving through a spinous state, as has long been assumed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Koster and Roop, 2005</xref>), ICs appear to directly transition to granular cells. ICs also show similarity to granular cells in having increased apparent actomyosin contractility. Using genetic models to induce contractility in spinous cells, we demonstrate that contractility is sufficient to induce a granular-like state. Together, this work reveals the lineage pathways and the influences of contractility on epidermal barrier formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Transcriptomic analysis of embryonic epidermal differentiation</title><p>During early epidermal stratification at E14.5, ICs are the first layer of suprabasal cells that express the differentiation marker K10 and proliferate at a rate similar to basal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Damen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Smart, 1970</xref>). The proliferation rate of suprabasal cells decreases over the next 48 hr, and these cells are largely postmitotic by E16.5. To further validate these suprabasal cell dynamics during epidermal stratification, we performed live imaging of back skin explants from K10-rtTA;TRE-H2B-GFP embryos, which express H2B-GFP in K10-positive suprabasal cells. Consistent with data from fixed embryos, we observed numerous suprabasal mitotic events in explants collected from E14.5 embryos, while suprabasal cells in explants from E16.5 embryos were mitotically inactive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). All divisions visualized were planar to the epithelium.</p><p>To understand the differences between suprabasal cells at E14.5 and E16.5, we explored the transcriptomic changes occurring between these two time points. We used K14-RFP;K10-rtTA;TRE-H2B-GFP mice and FACS to purify H2B-GFP<sup>+</sup> suprabasal cells and RFP<sup>+</sup> basal cells at E14.5 and E16.5 and performed bulk RNA-Seq of each of these cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Given that granular cells also form part of the suprabasal compartment at E16.5, we excluded the more superficial cells that bind <italic>Ulex europaeus</italic> agglutinin I lectin from E16.5 samples in order to uniquely compare suprabasal cells that lie immediately above the basal layer (ICs and spinous cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brabec et al., 1980</xref>).</p><p>Principal component analysis (PCA) of the sequenced cell populations revealed that biological replicates grouped together and that samples were segregated by cell type (basal vs suprabasal) in the first component, and by age in the second component (E14.5 vs E16.5). Notably, ICs at E14.5 and spinous cells at E16.5 were not clustered together, indicating that they are distinct populations, as are their corresponding basal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Though not addressed further here, the developmental transition in suprabasal cells from E14.5 to E16.5 may reflect the very different states of basal cells at these time points.</p><p>To identify specific molecular markers for ICs and spinous cells, we filtered the genes that were uniquely enriched in ICs (at E14.5 compared to both E16.5 spinous cells and E14.5 basal cells) and in spinous cells (compared to both E14.5 ICs and E16.5 basal cells). The IC gene signature consisted of 610 genes and included <italic>Scara5</italic>, a scavenger receptor, St8sia6, which encodes a sialyltransferase enzyme, and <italic>Tgm1</italic> (transglutaminase 1), an enzyme involved in covalent cross-linking of proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). To validate these candidates, we performed RNAscope and detected mRNA of <italic>Scara5</italic> and <italic>St8sia6</italic> in ICs but not in suprabasal cells at E16.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–E</xref>). <italic>Scara5</italic> expression was specific to ICs, while <italic>St8sia6</italic> mRNA was also present in granular cells at E16.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In contrast, St8sia6 protein was detected in the granular layers at E16.5 by antibody staining; however, it was not seen in ICs at E14.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). This suggests that some granular genes are transcriptionally enriched in ICs but not yet appreciably expressed at the protein level. This included loricrin, whose expression was detected in ICs, but whose protein product was only found in granular cells. This could be due either to delayed production/build-up of the protein product or due to translational inhibition of these mRNAs. We also observed that another protein marker of granular cells, Tgm1, was also present in ICs, as described in more detail below (Figure 4C).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Identifying markers for intermediate (ICs) and spinous cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The core gene signature of ICs was obtained from the list of genes only upregulated in ICs (log2 fold change &gt; 1, p&lt;0.05; as compared with both basal cells at embryonic day [E] 14.5 and spinous cells at E16.5).

Among this list, the transcription factor <italic>MafB</italic> was a prominent candidate since it has been implicated in epidermal differentiation in cultured human epidermal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lopez-Pajares et al., 2015</xref>), and it is expressed in suprabasal cells in vivo during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Miyai et al., 2016</xref>). Consistent with our transcriptional data, immunofluorescence staining of MafB at E16.5 revealed that it was present in the first suprabasal cell layers in the epidermis but was excluded from granular cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2 G,I</xref>), and it was undetectable in ICs at E14.5. Another highly upregulated gene in this list, <italic>Ptgs1</italic>, which encodes the enzyme Cox1, was also enriched in spinous cells but not in ICs at the protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H and J</xref>). Therefore, MafB and Cox1 are specific markers for spinous cells in the embryonic epidermis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>MafB inhibits proliferation of ICs</title><p>To test the functional role of Maf transcription factors in determining spinous cell fate, we prematurely induced MafB expression in ICs. For this, we collected K10-rtTA;TRE-MafB-HA (hereafter called K10-MafB) embryos that were collected at E14.5, when suprabasal cells are ICs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In these embryos, MafB-HA was expressed in about 30% of all suprabasal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Examination of EdU incorporation revealed that HA+ cells had a significantly lower rate of incorporation than ICs in controls, demonstrating that MafB expression is sufficient to decrease cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). Notably, however, we found that there was increased proliferation of surrounding MafB-negative cells in mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>), while the overall suprabasal proliferation rate was not significantly different in mutants vs controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This suggests a potential homeostatic mechanism for maintaining total proliferation during the epidermal stratification process. To determine whether MafB expression was sufficient to repress IC-specific gene expression, we examined IC markers, including Tgm1 and Scara5. While we found a decrease in the levels of Tgm1 protein, <italic>Scara5</italic> mRNA levels were unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–F</xref>). These data demonstrate that MafB may repress parts of the IC signature but does not globally repress all markers. Given that it altered the mitotic status of ICs into a spinous-like state, we also examined whether MafB expression was sufficient for induction of spinous markers. However, we found that the spinous marker Cox1 was not induced by MafB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G and H</xref>).

To test this hypothesis, we performed a pulse-chase experiment in K10-rtTA;TRE-H2B-GFP embryos by injecting a low dose of doxycycline to induce the expression of H2B-GFP in K10-positive cells at E14.5 (i.e. only ICs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We followed the H2B-GFP+ cells over time, and we found that at E15.5, these cells were already more superficial, separated from basal cells by a layer of H2B-GFP-negative cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Based on their expression of MafB, these cells are the first spinous cells produced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Strikingly, about 95% of H2B-GFP+ cells did not stain for MafB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A’</xref>). Thus, rather than converting to a spinous cell fate, they are displaced upward. When we chased these cells until E16.5, they were located in the uppermost layers of the epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), and they co-stained with loricrin, a granular cell marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

When labeled cells were chased until E18.5, GFP signal was clearly present in the cornified layer, demonstrating that the traced ICs had terminally differentiated before birth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

We used both models of increased contractility in suprabasal cells: K10-Spastin and K10-Arhgef11<sup>CA</sup>, where expression of the transgene for both is detectable by HA staining. In both mouse models, suprabasal cells with increased contractility (at E16.5 and later) did not express the spinous marker MafB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and E</xref>), even when they were positioned in the first layers on top of basal cells, where they should clearly be spinous cells. In contrast, these cells precociously expressed the granular marker Tgm1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D and F</xref>). Similar results were obtained in back and glabrous skin of K10-Arhgef11<sup>CA</sup> adult mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>), and at E17.5, when suprabasal contractility was induced after initial spinous cell specification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>). These latter results suggest that the effects of increased suprabasal contractility are the same regardless of the time of its induction.</p><p>Analysis of the IC marker <italic>Scara5</italic> revealed that increasing suprabasal contractility did not alter <italic>Scara5</italic> mRNA levels in HA+ cells compared to controls, suggesting that contractility induces a granular-like rather than intermediate-like cell type in mutant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>).</p><p>YAP concentrates within the nucleus in suprabasal epidermal cells in both of our mouse models that increase contractility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ning et al., 2021</xref>), and YAP is also localized to the nucleus in granular cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). To test the role of YAP in inducing a granular-like state, we again used the mouse model K10-YAP<sup>CA</sup>. We observed that inducing active YAP did not induce Tgm1 in spinous cells and did not suppress the expression of MafB, the spinous cell marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4</xref>). These data suggest that YAP activation lies downstream of contractility but is not sufficient to induce the effects observed by increased contractility in spinous cells. In addition to YAP activation, stretching of keratinocytes results in epigenetic changes, including an increase in H3K27me3 levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Le et al., 2016</xref>). However, inducing contractility did not cause a significant change in nuclear levels of this epigenetic mark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Figure 7—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Embryonic epidermal cells coordinate their growth and differentiation to allow rapid stratification and barrier formation. Our data here characterize ICs in epidermal development, revealing novel trajectories of cell differentiation. Further, our data directly demonstrate that actomyosin contractility in the developing epidermis can play an instructive role in differentiation, promoting granular-like gene expression and suppressing spinous markers.</p><p>Bulk RNA-Seq analysis has allowed us to characterize embryonic epidermal cells in greater depth. This revealed that basal cells undergo significant changes between E14.5 and E16.5, consistent with the fact that they generate distinct cell progeny at these time points (ICs vs spinous cells). In addition, like suprabasal cells, basal cells at these time points also show differences in mechanical properties. Whether this is in response to changes in their physical environment or is mediated by internal timers remains unknown. That said, understanding specific markers and transcriptional regulators of these maturing basal cells may allow us to manipulate these transitions to maintain or bypass distinct stages of epidermal development.</p><p>Analysis of the IC transcriptome revealed an unexpected expression of granular genes in these transient cells. This gene expression program was especially enriched for lipid-modifying enzymes that play a key role in barrier formation. Lipids are synthesized in granular cells and stored in lamellar bodies before secreting them to the intercellular spaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Prado-Mantilla and Lechler, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vietri Rudan and Watt, 2021</xref>). Our data suggest that this process may begin early in ICs. In contrast, few EDC genes were upregulated in ICs, suggesting that only parts of the granular program are expressed early in these cells, and many of the structural components of the eventual barrier are expressed only later.</p><p>Further, our short-term lineage tracing suggests that most ICs transition into granular cells without going through a MafB+ (a spinous cell marker) stage. This reveals two distinct differentiation pathways leading to the granular cell state, one through ICs during development and one through spinous cells postnatally. This raises questions about whether each route will require distinct regulatory and transcriptional pathways.</p><p>Finally, our data revealed mechanical similarities between ICs and granular cells, in addition to their similarities at the transcriptomic level. Actomyosin regulators were transcriptionally upregulated in both of these cell types as compared to spinous cells, and we were able to validate these findings in intact skin. Importantly, we found that contractility was sufficient to induce granular-like gene expression and to repress some spinous cell markers. This reveals a rather direct effect of contractility lying upstream, as well as presumably downstream, of differentiation pathways. It also explains the observation that increased contractility results in premature formation of the epidermal barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Muroyama and Lechler, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ning et al., 2021</xref>). It has been appreciated for some time that granular cells have increased actomyosin contractility, which is important for the function and placement of tight junctions specifically in this layer of the epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Itoh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Prado-Mantilla and Lechler, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rübsam et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sumigray et al., 2012</xref>). There are many intriguing possibilities for how contractility may affect cell fates, such as mechanosensitive transcriptional regulators that mediate this effect. We tested a possible role for YAP1, a transcriptional regulator whose activation is induced by contractility in the epidermis. We found that active YAP1 was insufficient to drive these gene expression changes. Future work is required to determine the mechanism of mechanosensitive differentiation in the epidermis. The epidermis increases contractility in response to externally applied forces that result in stretch and in response to perturbation of cell adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aragona et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sumigray et al., 2014</xref>). It will be important to test whether these stimuli alter differentiation pathways through their effects on contractility.</p><p>Of note, we found that contractility had a strong effect on the EDC, whose positioning within the nucleus changes with differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gdula et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mardaryev et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Williams et al., 2002</xref>). This suggests that aspects of epigenetics and chromatin organization may be downstream of contractility, as shown by external forces directly stretching chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tajik et al., 2016</xref>) and extrinsic topographical cues constricting the nucleus to induce chromatin reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). Notably, we found that there is a decrease in mRNA levels of Sun1 and Nesprin1/3, parts of a complex that tether the actin cytoskeleton in the cytoplasm to chromatin in the nucleus when contractility is increased, in hypercontractile cells. Loss of Sun1/2 also leads to precocious differentiation in the epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carley et al., 2021</xref>) through effects on integrin-mediated mechanical integration, though whether regulation of these connections mediates the contractility effect seen in suprabasal cells will require further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>All animal work was approved by Duke University’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and performed in accordance with their committee guidelines.

The authors show for the first time that an increase in intracellular actomyosin contractility, a hallmark of barrier-forming keratinocytes, is sufficient to trigger terminal differentiation.

If any of these changes are instructive for differentiation itself, and whether consecutive changes in differentiation are required, remains unclear. Also, there are few comprehensive data sets on the exact changes in gene expression between different states of keratinocyte differentiation. In this study, through genetic fluorescence labeling of cell states at different developmental timepoints the authors were able to analyze gene expression of basal stem cells and suprabasal differentiated cells at two different stages of maturation: E14 (embryonic day 14) when the epidermis comprises mostly two functional compartments (basal stem cells and suprabasal so called intermediate cells) and E16 when the epidermis comprise three (living) compartments where the spinous layer separates basal stem cells from the barrier forming granular layer, as is the case in adult epidermis. Using RNA bulk sequencing, the authors developed useful new markers for suprabasal stages of differentiation like MafB and Cox1. The transcription factor MafB was then shown to inhibit suprabasal proliferation in a MafB transgenic model.</p><p>The data indicate that early in development at E14 the suprabasal intermediate cells resemble in terms of RNA expression, the barrier-forming granular layer at E16, suggesting that keratinocyte can undergo either stepwise (E16) or more direct (E14) terminal differentiation.</p><p>Previous studies by several groups found an increased actomyosin contractility in the barrier forming granular layer and showed that this increase in tension is important for epidermal barrier formation and function. However, it was not clear whether contractility itself serves as an instructive signal for differentiation. To address this question, the authors use a previously published model to induce premature hypercontractility in the spinous layer by using spastin overexpression (K10-Spastin) to disrupt microtubules (MT) thereby indirectly inducing actomyosin contractility. A second model activates myosin contractility more directly through overexpression of a constitutively active RhoA GEF (K10-Arhgef11CA). Both models induce late differentiation of suprabasal keratinocytes regardless of the suprabasal position in either spinous or granular layer indicating that increased contractility is key to induce late differentiation of granular cells. A potential weakness is the use of the K10-spastin model that disrupts MT and likely has additional roles in altering differentiation next to the induction of hypercontractility. Their previous publications provided some evidence that the effect on differentiation is driven by the increase in contractility (Ning et al. cell stem cell 2021). Moreover, their data are now further supported by a second model activating myosin through RhoA. This manuscript extends their previous findings that indicated a role for contractility in early differentiation, now focussing on the regulation of late differentiation in barrier forming cells. This data set thus help to unravel the interdependencies of cell position, mechanical state and differentiation in the epidermis, and suggest that an increase in cellular contractility within the epidermis can induce terminal differentiation. Importantly the authors show that despite contractility induced nuclear localization of the mechanoresponsive transcription factor YAP in the barrier forming granular layer, YAP nuclear localization is not sufficient to drive premature differentiation when forced to the nucleus in the spinous layer.</p><p>Overall, this is a well written manuscript and comprehensive dataset.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.100961.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript from Prado-Mantilla and co-workers addresses mechanisms of embryonic epidermis development, focusing on the intermediate layer cells, a transient population of suprabasal cells that contributes to the expansion of the epidermis through proliferation.

ICs are the first suprabasal cells in the stratifying skin and unlike later-developing suprabasal cells, ICs continue to divide. Using bulk RNA seq to compare ICs to spinous and granular transcriptomes, the authors find that IC-specific gene signatures include hallmarks of granular cells, such as genes involved in lipid metabolism and skin barrier function that are not expressed in spinous cells. ICs were assumed to differentiate into spinous cells, but lineage tracing convincingly shows ICs differentiate directly into granular cells without passing through a spinous intermediate. Rather, basal cells give rise to the first spinous cells. They further show that transcripts associated with contractility are also shared signatures of ICs and granular cells, and overexpression of two contractility inducers (Spastin and ArhGEF-CA) can induce granular and repress spinous gene expression. This contractility-induced granular gene expression does not appear to be mediated by the mechanosensitive transcription factor, Yap. The paper also identifies new markers that distinguish IC and spinous layers, and shows the spinous signature gene, MafB, is sufficient to repress proliferation when prematurely expressed in ICs.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Overall this is a well-executed study, and the data are clearly presented and the findings convincing. It provides an important contribution to the skin field by characterizing the features and fate of ICs, a much understudied cell type, at a high levels of spatial and transcriptomic detail. The conclusions challenge the assumption that ICs are spinous precursors through compelling lineage tracing data. The demonstration that differentiation can be induced by cell contractility is an intriguing finding, and adds a growing list of examples where cell mechanics influence gene expression and differentiation.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>A weakness of the study is an over-reliance on overexpression and sufficiency experiments to test the contributions of MafB, Yap, and contractility in differentiation. The inclusion of loss-of-function approaches would enable one to determine if, for example, contractility is required for the transition of ICs to granular fate, and whether MafB is required for spinous fate. Second, whether the induction of contractility-associated genes is accompanied by measurable changes in the physical properties or mechanics of the IC and granular layers is not directly shown. Inclusion of physical measurements would bolster the conclusion that mechanics lies upstream of differentiation.</p><p>Finally, the role of ICs in epidermal development remains unclear.

For MafB, these have been performed in cultured human keratinocytes, where loss of MafB and its ortholog cMaf results in a phenotype consistent with loss of spinous differentiation (Pajares-Lopez et al, 2015). Due to the complex genetics involved, generating these double mutant mice is beyond the scope of this study. Loss of function studies of myosin are also complicated by genetic redundancy of the non-muscle type II myosin genes, as well as the role for these myosins in cell division and in actin cross linking in addition to contractility. In addition, we have found that these myosins are quite stable in the embryonic intestine, with loss of protein delayed by several days from the induction of recombination. Therefore, elimination of myosins by embryonic day e14.5 with our current drivers is not likely possible. Generation of inducible inhibitors of contractility is therefore a valuable future goal.</p><p>Several recent papers have used AFM of skin sections to probe tissue stiffness.

We have attempted experiments to ablate intermediate cells with DTA expression - these resulted in inefficient and delayed death and thus did not yield strong conclusions about the role of intermediate cells. Our findings that transcriptional regulators of granular differentiation (such as Grhl3 and Hopx) are also present in intermediate cells, should allow future analysis of the effects of their ablation on the earliest stages of granular differentiation from intermediate cells.
