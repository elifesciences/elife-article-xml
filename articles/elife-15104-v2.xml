play a role in regulating epidermal melanocyte (MC) homeostasis. Here we show that physiologic estrogen (17β-estradiol) and progesterone reciprocally regulate melanin synthesis. This is intriguing given that we also show that normal primary human MCs lack classical estrogen or progesterone receptors (ER or PR). Utilizing both genetic and pharmacologic approaches, we establish that sex steroid effects on human pigment synthesis are mediated by the membrane-bound, steroid hormone receptors G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER), and progestin and adipoQ receptor 7 (PAQR7). Activity of these receptors was activated or inhibited by synthetic estrogen or progesterone analogs that do not bind to ER or PR. As safe and effective treatment options for skin pigmentation disorders are limited, these specific GPER and PAQR7 ligands may represent a novel class of therapeutics.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15104.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15104.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15104.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Factors controlling pigment production in skin are complex and poorly understood. Cells called melanocytes produce a pigment called melanin, which makes the skin darker. It has been known for a long time that skin color often changes during pregnancy, which suggests that sex hormones may be involved. However, the specific hormones and signaling mechanisms responsible for the changes have remained largely undefined.</p><p>Estrogen and progesterone are two of the main female sex hormones. Natale et al. now show that estrogen increases pigment production in human melanocytes, and progesterone decreases it.</p><p>For hormones to signal to cells, they must bind to and activate particular receptor proteins. Further investigation by Natale et al. revealed that estrogen and progesterone regulate pigment production by binding to receptors that belong to a family called G protein-coupled receptors. These receptors can signal rapidly once activated by sex hormones, and may serve as therapeutic targets for treating pigmentation disorders.</p><p>Skin diseases that cause inflammation often also cause changes in skin color. Natale et al. noticed several other G protein-coupled receptors that are likely to control pigmentation through similar mechanisms. Future analyses of the roles that these other receptors perform in melanocytes may therefore reveal how inflammation-based pigmentation changes occur.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15104.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15104.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>sex hormones</kwd><kwd>GPCR</kwd><kwd>pigmentation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1 CA163566</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ridky</surname><given-names>Todd W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P50CA174523</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ridky</surname><given-names>Todd W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 AR0007465-32</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Natale</surname><given-names>Christopher A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 AR0007465-30</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Duperret</surname><given-names>Elizabeth K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31 CA186446</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Duperret</surname><given-names>Elizabeth K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Two receptors have been identified that can be targeted in melanocytes with selective small molecule agonists to modulate human skin color.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cutaneous pigmentary changes have been long recognized as common side effects of pregnancy. The British physician Daniel Turner, in his 1714 <italic>De Morbis Cutaneis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Turner, 1726</xref>), references Hippocrates (460–370 B.C.E.), “There is a spot on the face…more peculiar, according to our great master <italic>Hippoc.,</italic> to Big Belly’d women, and recon’d as one of the Signs of Conception.” Modern physicians recognize this common pregnancy-associated hyperpigmentation as melasma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sheth and Pandya, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nicolaidou and Katsambas, 2014</xref>). Hippocrates also thought that the pigment was predictive of the sex of the fetus: <italic>Quae utero gerentes, maculum in facie veluti ex solis adustione habent, eae faemellas plerumque gestant</italic>. Translated to English: <italic>pregnant women who have a mark on the face as though stained by the sun, quite often give birth to girls</italic>. While Turner noted this association with fetal sex to be 'fallible', Hippocrates was remarkably astute in linking the pigment increases to the tanning response to DNA-damaging solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation. While early physicians attributed the pigment changes to “Retention of the menstrual Flux” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Turner and Cutaneis, 1726</xref>), the molecular mechanisms through which pregnancy-associated hormonal changes modulate skin color have remained elusive for over 2,000 years.</p><p>Melanocytes in the basal epidermis control skin pigmentation through synthesis of melanin, a complex process thought to be primarily regulated by alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (αMSH) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). The αMSH peptide is secreted centrally by the anterior pituitary gland, and locally by keratinocytes in response to UV damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cui et al., 2007</xref>). αMSH binding to the melanocortin receptor 1 (MC1R), a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), activates adenylate cyclase, and increases cAMP. This secondary messenger activates a cascade of downstream transcriptional events leading to expression of genes required for melanin synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rodríguez and Setaluri, 2014</xref>). Exogenous broadly-acting adenylate cyclase activators such as plant-derived forskolin, also stimulate melanin production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">D'Orazio et al., 2006</xref>), but the degree to which other endogenous molecules, other than αMSH regulate melanin synthesis in tissue is unclear. However, the observation that melasma frequently occurs in non-pregnant women using oral contraceptive pills, which contain only steroid hormone analogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sheth and Pandya, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Resnik, 1967a</xref>), suggests that humans may maintain αMSH-independent pigment control mechanisms. Identifying these pathways, and strategies to specifically access them pharmacologically to modulate skin pigmentation, may have substantial therapeutic utility.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Estrogen and progesterone reciprocally regulate melanin synthesis</title><p>To examine whether sex steroids influence melanin synthesis, we treated primary human melanocytes with estrogen (17β-estradiol). This resulted in a dose-dependent melanin increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). After 4 days of exposure to 25 nM estrogen, a medically-relevant concentration observed during pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbassi-Ghanavati et al., 2009</xref>), melanin was markedly increased (208% +/- 27%) in three individual isolates of primary human melanocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The magnitude of this change was similar to that observed with αMSH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), and is consistent with prior in vitro studies implicating estrogen in melanin synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McLeod et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ranson et al., 1988</xref>). Hormonal oral contraceptives, most of which incorporate ethinyl estradiol, are associated with melasma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Resnik, 1967b</xref>). Ethinyl estradiol also increased melanin to levels similar to those observed with native estrogen. To examine the effects of estrogen on melanocyte homeostasis in the context of intact human epidermis, architecturally-faithful three-dimensional organotypic skin was established utilizing normal primary epidermal keratinocytes and melanocytes in native human stroma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ridky et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Monteleon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Duperret et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McNeal et al., 2015</xref>).

To determine whether this reciprocal relationship is active in melanocytes, we treated cells with physiologic levels of progesterone, which resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in melanin production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). At 500 nM, a concentration observed in third trimester pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbassi-Ghanavati et al., 2009</xref>), progesterone decreased melanin production by half (58% +/- 11.4%), both in culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and in skin tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), without altering melanocyte cell number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Most of our primary melanocytes were derived from newborn male foreskin. To determine whether female cells also responded similarly, we treated female iPS-derived melanocytes with estrogen and progesterone and noted responses similar to those observed with the male cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>). To determine whether melanocytes isolated from body sites other than foreskin also responded similarly to sex hormones, we treated melanocytes from adult facial skin with estrogen and progesterone and again observed responses that were similar to those observed with the foreskin melanocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with other groups who have noted that steroid hormones have variable effects on melanocyte proliferation in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Im et al., 2002</xref>), we observed modest changes in proliferation when isolated primary cells were treated with estrogen or progesterone in vitro. Estrogen treated melanocytes tended to proliferate slightly slower, while progesterone treated cells tended to proliferate slightly faster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>). The effects varied with the basal level of melanin production. Melanocytes from dark skin were more sensitive to progesterone than estrogen, while melanocytes from light skin were more sensitive to estrogen. These proliferation changes are likely an in vitro artifact, as adult interfollicular epidermal melanocytes are relatively nonproliferative in vivo, and we did not note any changes in melanocyte numbers in sex steroid-treated 3-D organotypic tissues. Consistent with this lack of melanocyte proliferation in interfollicular epidermis, another group thoroughly examined 280 tissue sections from normal human skin from 18 donors, and identified only 2 proliferative interfollicular melanocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jimbow et al., 1975</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Primary human melanocytes do not express nuclear estrogen or progesterone receptors (ER/PR), and respond to sex steroids via altered cAMP signaling</title><p>To determine the mechanisms mediating estrogen and progesterone pigment effects, we examined components of the canonical pigment production pathway, and observed a cAMP increase upon estrogen treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), suggesting that estrogen accesses the canonical pigment production pathway downstream of MC1R. Consistent with this, pCREB and MITF proteins were similarly induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

Consistent with this, the estrogen effects were significantly attenuated in the presence of progesterone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This likely helps explain why pregnancy-associated hyperpigmentation is characteristically limited to specific areas where melanocyte or UV radiation exposure is highest including the face, genital, and areolar regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Szabo, 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Staricco and Pinkus, 1957</xref>).

To identify possible candidates, we analyzed whole transcriptome melanocyte RNAseq data. Of 412 known or predicted 7-pass human GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander et al., 2013</xref>), 61 distinct GPCRs were expressed in MCs, including the membrane-bound, G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Filardo et al., 2002</xref>) (GPER) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Given that prior work in breast cancer cell lines and fish oocytes determined that estrogen binding to GPER modulates cAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Filardo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thomas et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cabas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Majumder et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pang and Thomas, 2010</xref>), and that cAMP signaling stimulates melanin synthesis, we thought it possible that GPER may be the physiologically relevant human melanocyte estrogen receptor. The melanocyte RNAseq studies also demonstrated that an analogous, noncanonical G protein-coupled progesterone receptor, progestin and adipoQ receptor 7 (PAQR7) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tang et al., 2005</xref>), was also expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We next used qRT-PCR to verify that GPER and PAQR7 are both expressed in primary human MC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Notably, GPER and PAQR7 expression was markedly lower in other skin cells including keratinocytes and fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>To establish the necessity of GPER and PAQR7 in mediating sex hormone effects in MCs, we first depleted GPER using either of two independent shRNA hairpins, which completely eliminated the melanocyte pigmentation response to estrogen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E–F</xref>). Analogous shRNA-mediated PAQR7 depletion ablated the pigmentary response to progesterone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>). To verify these results, we next used a complementary genetic approach based on CRISPR-Cas9 mediated gene disruption of GPER or PAQR7, which also completely blocked the pigmentary response to estrogen and progesterone, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G–H</xref>). Consistent with our model in which these receptors access melanin synthesis at the level of adenylate cyclase, PAQR7 was found to bind progesterone and regulate the final stages of sea trout oocyte meiosis through cAMP reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tokumoto et al., 2012</xref>). In that fish system, PAQR7 signals through G protein complexes containing the inhibitory G subunit (G<sub>i</sub>), which represses adenylate cyclase. To examine whether this signaling mechanism is functional in melanocytes, we treated melanocytes with progesterone in the presence of pertussis toxin (PTX), an exotoxin that specifically inactivates G<sub>i</sub> subunits via ADP-ribosylation. With PTX treatment alone, we observed a small increase in melanin production. This likely reflects inhibition of G<sub>i</sub> released from basal PAQR7 activity, as well G<sub>i</sub> subunits from other GPCRs that collectively contribute to the basal level of cAMP signaling observed in culture. Importantly, PTX blocked progesterone effects, establishing that progesterone signals through G<sub>i</sub> subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Specific activation of GPER or PAQR7 is sufficient to alter pigment production in human skin tissue</title><p>To complement these genetic studies establishing that GPER and PAQR7 are the melanocyte sex steroid receptors, we utilized a pharmacologic approach employing synthetic steroid analogs with specific agonist or antagonist activity on ER, PR, GPER, or PAQR7. Tamoxifen, an ER antagonist, is associated with melasma in breast cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim and Yoon, 2009</xref>). The mechanistic basis for the pigment change was previously unknown. However, tamoxifen is a GPER agonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thomas et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2010</xref>), and increased melanin to levels comparable to those observed with estrogen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To determine whether GPER signaling was sufficient to increase melanin, we utilized the specific GPER agonist G-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bologa et al., 2006</xref>), an estrogen analog developed for mechanistic studies in other systems that does not bind ER. G-1 drove a dose-dependent increase in melanin production through pCREB and MITF that was GPER dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>). Further establishing that GPER is the melanocyte estrogen receptor, G-1 and estrogen effects were blocked by either of two specific GPER antagonists, G-15 and G-36 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E</xref>), which do not have inhibitory activity against ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dennis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">2011</xref>).

Defining these mechanisms is important however, as myriad genetic and acquired conditions including common afflictions such as acne, eczema, vitiligo, ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure, traumatic injury, and pregnancy are associated with alterations in skin pigmentation that can be extensive and long-lasting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">James et al., 2011</xref>). Another population that could potentially benefit from modulating skin pigment are people with naturally light skin, especially those with red hair, who have a markedly decreased ability to synthesize UV-protective brown eumelanin as a result of inactivating mutations in MC1R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Valverde et al., 1995</xref>). This large population is especially susceptible to photodamage, sunburns, and has an increased lifetime risk of keratinocyte and melanocyte-derived skin cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Han et al., 2006</xref>). There is currently no available therapeutic that promotes protective eumelanin pigment production. However, the specific activation of GPER alternatively activates cAMP signaling, bypassing MC1R, to stimulate melanin synthesis, and could therefore be especially useful in this sun-vulnerable population. Selective GPER activation in skin could potentially be a safe alternative to intentional UV radiation exposure (via natural sunlight or tanning beds) for individuals seeking what they perceive as an aesthetically desirable tan. The only method currently available to increase skin melanin is UV exposure. While effective at darkening skin, the requisite DNA damage promotes premature aging, wrinkles, and skin cancer.</p><p>Commonly utilized approaches for decreasing skin melanin are also often unsafe, and involve application of toxic mercury or arsenic compounds, especially common in India, China, Japan, and Korea, but also encountered in the U.S., and recently highlighted in a report from the California Department of Public Health (Report #14–046, 2014), or hydroquinone, a tyrosinase inhibitor, which has been banned in Europe because of concerns regarding its possible association with cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McGregor, 2007</xref>). Our findings describe small molecule sex steroid analogs, without these toxicities, that modulate pigment production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><p>Therapeutic use of GPER or PAQR7 agonists/antagonists could potentially have effects on cells other than epidermal melanocytes. While topical delivery of such agents would likely avoid off target effects in distant tissues, there exits the theoretical possibility of off-target effects within the skin. However, we did not note any significant abnormalities in the epidermis from our in vitro or in vivo skin tissues treated with the sex steroids.</p><p>GPER and PAQR7 have been identified only relatively recently, but are expressed in several tissues, and may mediate at least some of the estrogen and progesterone effects that cannot be attributed to the classical nuclear hormone receptors. GPER has been identified in the reproductive, nervous, cardiovascular, renal, pancreas, and immune systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Prossnitz and Barton, 2011</xref>). In immune cells, GPER expression on T cells has been shown to play a role in 17β-estradiol-induced thymic atrophy and autoimmune encephalomyelitis. PAQR7 is expressed in the reproductive and nervous systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tokumoto et al., 2016</xref>), and in murine macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lu et al., 2015</xref>) and in human T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dosiou et al., 2008</xref>), although the functional role of PAQR7 in those tissues remains relatively unclear. Given that the increased systemic estrogen and progesterone associated with pregnancy does not typically result in skin cancer or significant pathology in other tissues, we think it likely that the specific GPER and PAQR7 agonists will be well-tolerated. Nonetheless, formal toxicity studies and careful evaluation of human skin treated in clinical trials will be important.</p><p>The finding that PAQR7 works through inhibitory G<sub>i</sub> subunits is especially interesting, as it is the first example of a melanocyte cellular signaling cascade that <italic>actively represses</italic> melanin synthesis at the level of G-protein signaling, as opposed to classically defined pigment control mechanisms that modulate the strength of the <italic>stimulatory</italic> MC1R signal. In many animal systems, the Agouti protein decreases pigment production via physically binding to MC1R and inhibiting αMSH stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ollmann et al., 1998</xref>), rather than through an actively suppressive mechanism.</p><p>Our finding that normal primary melanocytes lack nuclear ER or PR contradicts a prior report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Im et al., 2002</xref>). This group performed immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR to support the claim that nuclear estrogen receptors are expressed in melanocytes, but in our view, the data presented in that work is not especially convincing, and there is no evidence in that work that nuclear hormone signaling drives changes in melanin synthesis. Another group demonstrated that melanocyte protein extracts have the ability to bind radioactive estrogen, but that work did not identify the specific protein(s) responsible for the binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jee et al., 1994</xref>). We do not exclude the possibility that in some tissue settings, including neoplastic lesions and possibly hair follicles, melanocytes express nuclear ER/PR. Still, as there is no known direct signaling pathway linking nuclear sex hormone receptors to the melanin synthesis machinery, it is most likely that the major effects of estrogen and progesterone on pigment production are mediated through the G<sub>s</sub> and G<sub>i</sub> coupled GPCRs identified in our current work.</p><p>We have shown that signaling through GPCRs other than MC1R directly affects melanin production. While surveying all the 7-pass transmembrane proteins expressed in melanocytes, we noted expression of several additional receptors that may also influence melanin production. These include histamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yoshida et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lassalle et al., 2003</xref>) and leukotriene receptors, which in other contexts are known to signal through G<sub>s</sub> and G<sub>i</sub> subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mondillo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arcemisbéhère et al., 2010</xref>). Future functional analysis of these and other GPCRs in melanocytes may elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the pigmentation changes that frequently accompany many skin diseases associated with inflammation. These studies may identify additional 'drugable' and therapeutically useful receptors in melanocytes, and will help advance an understanding of how cumulative GPCR signaling is integrated to regulate melanin production in human skin.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Melanocyte culture</title><p>Primary melanocytes were extracted from fresh discarded human foreskin and surgical specimens as described previously described with some modifications detailed as follows.

The study contains descriptive and mechanistic studies indicating that physiologic estrogen and progesterone exert their differential effects on melanocytes by non-genomic mechanisms. Using genetic and pharmacologic approaches, the authors demonstrated that activation of nonclassical estrogen and progesterone receptors (GPER and PAQR7) are both necessary and sufficient to mediate sex hormone effects on melanocytes.</p><p>The effect of sex hormones on skin pigmentation has been observed for many years. There are relatively few studies that investigated the mechanisms that lead to such a phenomenon. A study by McLoad and his colleagues in 1994 reported no staining of ER-α on primary human melanocytes. Interestingly, the observation that estradiol and its 17-α analogue had equivalent effect to increase melanin synthesis, and the surprising similar effect of a pure anti-estrogen compound led them to speculate that the effect of estrogen on melanocytes might be mediated through a &quot;non-classical&quot; mechanism.

(2002) Donor specific response of estrogen and progesterone on cultured human melanocytes. J. Korean Med. Sci.; Schmidt AN, et al. (2006). Oestrogen receptor-β expression in melanocytic lesions. Exp Dermatol.</italic> We agree that there is potentially contradicting literature regarding the expression of nuclear estrogen or progesterone receptors in normal melanocytes and melanocytic neoplasms. Jee et al. demonstrated that melanocyte protein extracts have the ability to bind radioactive estrogen, but that work did not identify the specific protein(s) responsible for the binding activity. Im et al. used immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR to support the claim that nuclear estrogen receptors are expressed in melanocytes, but in our view, the data as presented is not convincing, and the techniques used are not quantitative. Critically, those experiments lacked negative controls. We did not examine hair-follicle derived melanocytes, as the cells for our study were derived primarily from foreskins (which are hairless). Although we attempted to review the Tobin et al. poster cited by the reviewer, we were unable to locate any images or corresponding data, and therefore cannot comment directly on the claim in the title of that poster. However, we would certainly be willing to do so if the reviewers were to provide us with the data and methods used to obtain it. To our knowledge there are no peer-reviewed publications providing unequivocal evidence that classical estrogen or progesterone receptors are expressed and functional in normal primary human melanocytes. However, we do not exclude the possibility that in some tissue settings, including neoplastic lesions and possibly hair follicles, melanocytes express nuclear ER/PR. Still, as there is no known direct signaling pathway linking nuclear sex hormone receptors to the melanin synthesis machinery, it is most likely that the major effects of estrogen and progesterone on pigment production are mediated through the G<sub>s</sub> and G<sub>i</sub> coupled GPCRs identified in our current work. These points and references are included in the text in the subsection “Estrogen and progesterone reciprocally regulate melanin synthesis” and in the Discussion.</p><p>2) A few studies reported the effect of estradiol and progesterone on melanocyte proliferation:</p><p> <italic>Im, S., et al. (2002) Donor specific response of estrogen and progesterone on cultured human melanocytes. J. Korean Med. Sci.; Wiedmann, et al. (2008) Inhibitory effects of progestogens on the estrogen stimulation of melanocytes in vitro. Contraception. There are also a few clarifications that would improve the quality of the manuscript: 1) The authors state that there have been no changes in melanocyte number in the organotypic human tissue. They should also clarify whether treatment of melanocytes in culture had any effect on the proliferation or not.</italic> We observed modest changes in melanocyte proliferation when cells were treated with estrogen or progesterone in 2-D monolayer in vitro culture. Estrogen treated melanocytes tended to proliferate slightly slower, while progesterone treated cells tended to proliferate slightly faster. The proliferation effects varied with the basal level of melanin production. Melanocytes from dark skin were more sensitive to progesterone than estrogen, while melanocytes from light skin were more sensitive to estrogen. This is consistent with the idea that more a differentiated melanocyte produces more pigment and proliferates more slowly than a less differentiated melanocyte, but inconsistent with previous studies that have suggested that E2 somehow stimulates proliferation. Nonetheless, these changes in proliferation in monolayer culture are likely an in vitro artifact, as adult epidermal melanocytes are relatively nonproliferative in vivo. In an exhaustive examination of 280 tissue sections of normal human skin from 18 donors, Jimbow et al. identified only 2 proliferative interfollicular melanocytes. Mitotic activity in non-neoplastic melanocytes in vivo as determined by histochemical, autoradiographic, and electron microscope studies. The Journal of Cell Biology. 1975;66(3):663-670. This point, along with our new in vitro proliferation data is now included in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and discussed in the subsection “Estrogen and progesterone reciprocally regulate melanin synthesis”.</p><p><italic>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>: The authors should briefly explain why the melanin synthesis is significantly higher in Pertussis toxin alone compared to control.</italic> Melanin production is dynamic, and likely regulated by many genetic and environmental factors. Melanocytes integrate input from many GPCRs to regulate the level of cAMP/pCREB/MITF signaling that determines the rate of melanin production at any given time. There is likely basal contribution from PAQR7, as well as from other G<sub>i</sub> coupled GPCRs that contribute to the total cAMP signaling observed in culture. Pertussis toxin treatment inhibits all G<sub>i</sub> subunits, and this inhibition of the inhibitory inputs is therefore predicted to increase cAMP and downstream pigment production. This point is clarified in the second paragraph of the subsection “Sex steroid signaling in melanocytes is dependent on the nonclassical membrane bound G-protein coupled sex hormone receptors GPER and PAQR7”.</p><p><italic>3) Keratinocytes have been shown to express both classical and non-classical sex steroid receptors (Thornton, M. J. (2005) Oestrogen functions in skin and skin appendages. Expert. Opin. Ther. Targets). Since the authors discuss the therapeutic potential of topical non-classical receptor agonists/antagonist, it would be beneficial to briefly discuss their possible off-target effects. For example, is it likely that GPER agonists might increase the risk of inflammatory skin disorders or skin cancers by transactivation of EGFR on keratinocytes?</italic></p><p>We recognize the possibility that therapeutic use of GPER or PAQR7 agonists/antagonists could potentially affect cells other than epidermal melanocytes. While topical delivery of such agents would likely avoid off target effects in distant tissues, there exits the theoretical possibility of off-target effects within the skin. However, we did not note any significant abnormalities in the epidermis from our in vitro skin tissues treated with the sex steroids. FDA approved topical estrogen and progesterone products (approved for other non-pigment related indications) have not been associated with increased skin cancer risk or significant skin abnormalities. Interestingly however, topical estrogen has been associated with hyperpigmentation. Given that the increased systemic estrogen and progesterone associated with pregnancy also does not typically result in skin cancer or other non-pigment skin pathology, we think it likely that specific GPER and PAQR7 agonists, will be well-tolerated. Nonetheless, formal toxicity studies and careful evaluation of human skin treated in any future clinical trials will be important. These points are addressed in the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
