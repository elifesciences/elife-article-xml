lethality (SL) in BRCA2-deficient cells. Hence, DNA damage is accepted as a prerequisite for SL in BRCA2-deficient cells. In contrast, here we show that inhibiting ROCK in BRCA2-deficient cells triggers SL independently from acute replication stress. Such SL is preceded by polyploidy and binucleation resulting from cytokinesis failure. Such initial mitosis abnormalities are followed by other M phase defects, including anaphase bridges and abnormal mitotic figures associated with multipolar spindles, supernumerary centrosomes and multinucleation. SL was also triggered by inhibiting Citron Rho-interacting kinase, another enzyme that, similarly to ROCK, regulates cytokinesis. Together, these observations demonstrate that cytokinesis failure triggers mitotic abnormalities and SL in BRCA2-deficient cells. Furthermore, the prevention of mitotic entry by depletion of Early mitotic inhibitor 1 (EMI1) augmented the survival of BRCA2-deficient cells treated with ROCK inhibitors, thus reinforcing the association between M phase and cell death in BRCA2-deficient cells. This novel SL differs from the one triggered by PARPi and uncovers mitosis as an Achilles heel of BRCA2-deficient cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cancer cell

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) is an autosomal dominant disease that accounts for 5–10% of breast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Krainer et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Langston et al., 1996</xref>) and 15% of ovarian cancer cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pal et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). HBOC is primarily caused by mutations in the breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Futreal et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Miki et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wooster et al., 1995</xref>). BRCA1 and BRCA2 are DNA repair genes, and their protein products regulate homologous recombination (HR), a repair pathway that is recruited to highly toxic DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Prakash et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, BRCA1 and BRCA2 are essential for DNA replication events, including replication fork protection, reversal, restart and gap-filling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cong and Cantor, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cong et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Panzarino et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ray Chaudhuri et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Schlacher et al., 2012</xref>). BRCA1- and BRCA2-deficient cells exhibit structural chromosome abnormalities and are highly sensitive to DNA-damaging agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Moynahan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Patel et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Yu et al., 2000</xref>). Additionally, BRCA-deficient cells exhibit translocations, large deletions and chromosome fusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Moynahan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Yu et al., 2000</xref>). This chromosome instability underlies the tumorigenicity of BRCA-deficient tumors and underscores the critical tumor suppressor function of BRCA genes in cells.</p><p>Mutations in BRCA genes are highly penetrant, and their carriers have a high risk of developing early-onset breast and ovarian cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antoniou et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">King et al., 2003</xref>). Carriers of BRCA mutations are also at an increased risk of developing other malignancies, including pancreatic and prostate cancers and melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cavanagh and Rogers, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gumaste et al., 2015</xref>). BRCA-mutation carriers whose mutations are detected before cancer onset are suggested to undergo highly invasive surgeries such as salpingo-oophorectomy and mastectomy. The standard of care for BRCA-mutation carriers with tumors is similar to the approach used for patients with sporadic tumors, except for some types of BRCA-deficient tumors, which might be more sensitive to platinum-based therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Vencken et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Yang et al., 2011</xref>). Unfortunately, chemotherapy resistance to platinum agents is common and alternative therapies are most needed for these patients.</p><p>One group of alternative therapeutic agents that are clinically available is poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors which are highly effective in killing BRCA-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bryant et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Farmer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McCabe et al., 2006</xref>) and several PARP inhibitors (PARPi) have been approved for clinical use. The synthetic lethality (SL) observed between BRCA deficiency, and PARPi is due to the ability of PARPi to physically trap PARP on DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Murai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Murai et al., 2012</xref>). PARP trapping causes the accumulation of DNA replication intermediates, such as gaps, which must be handled by BRCA proteins to protect DNA integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Taglialatela et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tirman et al., 2021</xref>). Additionally, some DNA structures that derive from the encounter of replication forks with PARP-bound DNA may require HR-mediated repair, a mechanism impaired in BRCA1- and BRCA2-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Prakash et al., 2015</xref>). While the impaired DNA damage response of BRCA-deficient cells to PARPi leads to cell death, resistance to PARPi is also observed in the clinic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barber et al., 2013</xref>). Molecular mechanisms of resistance to PARPi include, but are not limited to, secondary mutations that restore HR function, increased drug efflux, and decreased PARP trapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D’Andrea, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Noordermeer and van Attikum, 2019</xref>).</p><p>As mentioned above, although BRCA proteins were initially studied based on their roles in HR, we currently know that BRCA1 and BRCA2 have pleiotropic functions, performing functions outside canonical HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Petsalaki and Zachos, 2020</xref>). Thus, it is likely that multiple targets not restricted to HR could be exploited for SL therapeutic approaches. This concept has been corroborated for BRCA1 deficiency in a phenotypic screening in which we tested BRCA-deficient cells for SL against the kinase inhibitor library PKIS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carbajosa et al., 2019</xref>). Our findings unveiled that BRCA1-deficient cells have increased sensitivity to Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) inhibitors and that this sensitivity does not require excess DNA damage caused by external agents.</p><p>In this study, we present findings indicating that BRCA2-deficient cells are highly sensitive to the inhibition or depletion of Rho-kinases (ROCK), which regulate actin cytoskeleton dynamics. Unlike PARPi, ROCK inhibitors (ROCKi) did not induce acute replication stress in BRCA2-deficient cells but instead triggered mitotic defects including cytokinesis failure, polyploidy, aberrant multipolar spindles and centrosome amplification. Remarkably, SL-induction was also observed after inhibition of Citron Rho-interacting kinase (CITK), an enzyme that regulates cytokinesis at the level of mitotic furrow cleavage, indicating that cytokinesis failure is the likely trigger of this novel SL interaction. Moreover, preventing mitotic entry via depletion of Early mitotic inhibitor 1 (EMI1), abrogated ROCKi-induced BRCA2-deficient cell death. In conclusion, while the accumulation of DNA damage in S phase is required for PARPi-mediated cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ray Chaudhuri et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schoonen et al., 2017</xref>), our findings highlight that BRCA2-deficient cells bear additional vulnerabilities outside S phase that could represent promising new SL targets.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>BRCA2-deficient cells are sensitive to ROCK inhibition</title><p>In a previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carbajosa et al., 2019</xref>), we developed a phenotypic survival screening method to evaluate the differential sensitivity of BRCA1-deficient cells against 680 ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors provided by GlaxoSmithKline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Drewry et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Elkins et al., 2016</xref>).

This strategy allowed a comparison of BRCA-proficient vs BRCA-deficient cell lines on an isogenic background. In addition, HCT116<sup>p21-/-</sup> cells are easy to grow and tolerate low seeding densities compatible with long-term (i.e. 6 days) survival analysis. Additionally, we used a p21 knockout background, which attenuates the cell cycle arrest that otherwise would mask the cytotoxic phenotypes during the screening time frame.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Phenotypic screening identifies ROCK kinases as potential targets for synthetic lethality in BRCA2 cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The screening assay is based on the co-culture of isogeneic BRCA-proficient and BRCA-deficient cell lines in equal proportions on each well of 96-well plates.

Two of them are fasudil and ripasudil, which are approved for diseases other than cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Garnock-Jones, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Shi and Wei, 2013</xref>). Both are ATP-competitive inhibitors targeting ROCK1 and ROCK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nakagawa et al., 1996</xref>). In addition, we used the inhibitor SR 3677 dihydrochloride, which is a newer ROCK inhibitor that has interesting advantages such as a low IC50 and high potency in biochemical and cell-based assays as well as high selectivity for ROCK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Feng et al., 2008</xref>). We performed survival assays with fasudil in several cellular models of BRCA2 deficiency, including the HCT116<sup>p21-/-</sup> cell line used in the screening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We also tested survival in DLD-1/DLD-1<sup>BRCA2-/-</sup> paired cell lines, which are BRCA2 knockout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and the PEO4/PEO1, V-C8 #13 /V-C8 paired cell lines (see description of cell lines in the methods section - <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref>). SL was observed in all BRCA2-deficient cell line models following fasudil treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>). Cell death was confirmed using SYTOX green, a dye that only enters cells when cellular membranes have been compromised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) and in clonogenic survival assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Similar differences between control and BRCA2-deficient counterparts were observed with ripasudil and SR 3677 dihydrochloride, two other ROCKi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>).

While HCT116<sup>p21-/-</sup> shBRCA2, V-C8 and DLD-1<sup>BRCA2-/-</sup> were all sensitive to olaparib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>), PEO1 showed only modest sensitivity to olaparib in our experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>), despite reports indicating sensitivity to PARPi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sakai et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Stukova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Whicker et al., 2016</xref>). We confirmed that PEO1 were BRCA2-deficient. The BRCA2 mutation in PEO1 (5193C&gt;G) creates a premature stop codon and also a digestion site for the enzyme DrdI. In contrast, the reversion mutation in PEO4 (5193C&gt;T) abolishes this site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C</xref>). Consistent with their expected point mutation, following DrdI digestion PEO1 cells showed two DNA fragments (480 bp and 214 bp), which were not observed in PEO4 cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3D</xref>). Additionally, as previously reported for BRCA2-deficient cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sakai et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Stronach et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Stukova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Whicker et al., 2016</xref>) PEO1 cells are sensitive to cisplatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3E</xref>). Our results suggest that while clonogenic assays and other approaches may better expose the sensitivity of PEO1 to olaparib, strong SL induced by ROCKi is observed in growing conditions that reveal only mild sensitivity to PARPi. Hence, synthetic lethal avenues that diverge from PARPi could provide efficient therapeutic alternatives for treating BRCA2-deficient cancer cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Replication stress is not the major driver of SL between BRCA2 deficiency and ROCK inhibition</title><p>The SL observed between BRCA deficiency and PARPi is preceded by the accumulation of acute replication stress caused by PARP trapping on the DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Murai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schoonen et al., 2017</xref>). As BRCA-deficient cells keep progressing across S phase in the presence of PARPi, PARP/DNA adducts exacerbate replication stress resulting from fork stalling, gap formation and fork collapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kolinjivadi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lemaçon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mijic et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Panzarino et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Schlacher et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Taglialatela et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with those reports, the treatment of HCT116<sup>p21-/-</sup> shBRCA2 cells with olaparib caused the acute accumulation of replication stress markers such as γH2AX and 53BP1 nuclear foci, which represent sites of DSB formation in S phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). In striking contrast to olaparib, no increase in 53BP1 or γH2AX foci was induced by fasudil treatment in HCT116<sup>p21-/-</sup> shBRCA2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>) at this time. These results were also validated in PEO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In line with the lack of acute replication stress, we did not observe alterations in DNA replication parameters, such as nascent DNA track length or the frequency of origin firing after fasudil treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F–G</xref> and positive controls in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

Intriguingly, BRCA2-deficient cells also exhibited a peak of &gt;4N polyploid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>). By performing a detailed time course in which samples were collected in 24 h intervals, we observed that the polyploidy phenotype was cumulative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

The sub-G1 population was also evident as early as 24 h post-treatment but increased at longer time points after polyploidy detection (i.e.: after 3 days).

Using commercially available, and clinically relevant, ROCKi (i.e.: fasudil, ripasudil and SR 3677 dihydrochloride) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Feng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Feng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lee et al., 2019</xref>), we observed a dose-dependent SL-induction in multiple BRCA2-deficient cell lines which showed no signs of DNA replication stress. In contrast, these cells exhibited strong mitotic defects due to the cytokinesis failure induced by ROCKi. Remarkably, cell death by ROCK inhibition or depletion was recapitulated by inhibiting another enzyme that facilitates cytokinesis, CITK, supporting a model in which binucleation precedes multinucleation and SL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>). In fact, robust evidence in the literature indicates that highly abnormal metaphases/anaphases, such as the ones we observed, are incompatible with cell viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ganem et al., 2009</xref>) and are, therefore, the most plausible cause for the SL induced by ROCKi in BRCA2-deficient cells. While still viable, multinucleated cells are highly vulnerable. The presence of extra DNA content and centrosomes, increases the chances of abnormal spindle polarity, as well as the number of chromosomes that need to be properly aligned. In fact, attempts to trigger cell division in such states is incompatible with viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ganem et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dale Rein et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schoonen et al., 2017</xref>). We, therefore, postulate that the cytokinesis failure of a cell with 4N or more DNA content is the major driver for BRCA2-deficient cell death following ROCK inhibition. Because we have not identified the molecular target of ROCK which dysregulation triggers SL in BRCA2-deficient cells, further research on the mitotic functions of BRCA2 will be necessary to fully understand this SL pathway. However, we believe it is valuable to report that targeting mitosis alone in the absence of increased replication stress may suffice to kill BRCA2-deficient cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>BRCA2-deficient cells can be killed in a manner that is independent from the induction of replication stress</title><p>In addition to the well-documented replication stress-mediated toxicity of PARPi in BRCA-deficient cells, a recent report indicates that BRCA2-deficient cells can also be killed by mild replication defects which do not cause γH2AX accumulation in S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam et al., 2021</xref>).

Strikingly, this SL is not preceded by the accumulation of broken chromosomes or micronuclei and is independent of canonical players of the DDR, as it is observed after ROCK or CITK inhibition.</p><p>Intriguingly, while the triggers of SL by PARPi, CIP2A-TOPBP1 complex disruption and ROCKi are remarkably different, the three mechanisms converge at mitosis; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schoonen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schoonen and van Vugt, 2018</xref>; and this work. CDK1 inhibition blocks micronucleation which is the trigger for BRCA-deficient cell death by CIP2A-TOPBP1 complex disruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam et al., 2021</xref>), while PARPi and ROCKi-mediated cell death is abrogated by EMI1-depletion- see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schoonen et al., 2017</xref> and this work. Hence, the transit through M phase is required for all SL events triggered in BRCA2-deficient cells. Of note, the accumulation of viable multinucleated BRCA2-depleted cells capable of enabling DNA synthesis after ROCKi reveal that, at least for a few DNA replication cycles, a cytokinesis-free cell cycle progression does not affect survival of BRCA2-deficient cells. Interestingly, multinucleation was also reported after PARPi treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schoonen et al., 2017</xref>) and anaphase bridges were detected both after ROCKi and PARPi as a potential source of either multinucleation or cell death- see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schoonen et al., 2017</xref> and this work. In conclusion, despite the difference in the initial trigger of cell death, both after PARPi and ROCKi, BRCA2-deficient cells die at mitosis.</p><p>It should also be mentioned that our experimental analysis does not rule out that background levels of replication stress or increased levels of under-replicated DNA induced by BRCA2 deficiency could contribute to the cell death triggered by ROCK inhibition. As previously suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam et al., 2021</xref>, it is possible that BRCA2-deficient cells rely more on M phase due to their propensity to accumulate defects in DNA synthesis, making them more susceptible to a suboptimal M phase (e.g. triggered by ROCKi). However, if the source of SL was solely associated with DNA synthesis events, then it would also be present in BRCA1-deficient backgrounds, which we did not observe. Importantly, BRCA1-deficient backgrounds are also vulnerable during M phase, as we previously observed SL between BRCA1 and PLK1 inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carbajosa et al., 2019</xref>). The identification of synthetic lethal interactions specific for BRCA1 or BRCA2, indicates that HR impairment is not the only possible trigger of SL in BRCA1- and BRCA2-deficient backgrounds that could be therapeutically exploited. In the future, M phase may provide a window of opportunity for novel treatments in patients that do not respond to PARPi therapy.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Cytokinesis failure as the trigger of the SL between BRCA2-deficiency and ROCK inhibition</title><p>We believe that DNA replication defects are not the main trigger for the SL observed with ROCKi, and that defects intrinsic to M phase are more likely to account for ROCKi-induced cell death of BRCA2-deficient cells. Intriguingly, BRCA2 and ROCK functions converge at cytokinesis. ROCK kinases accumulate at the cleavage furrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kosako et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Yokoyama et al., 2005</xref>), regulate furrow ingression, and their knockdown induces multinucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Yokoyama et al., 2005</xref>). Similarly, CITK localizes to the cleavage furrow, and its downregulation or inhibition also causes multinucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kosako et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sahin et al., 2019</xref>). Cytokinesis defects have also been reported for BRCA2-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Daniels et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jonsdottir et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mondal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rowley et al., 2011</xref>). However, BRCA2 localizes to a different cytokinesis structure than ROCK, the midbody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Daniels et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jonsdottir et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mondal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rowley et al., 2011</xref>). Remarkably, previous reports suggest that the effect of BRCA2 downregulation on cytokinesis regulation may be very mild (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lekomtsev et al., 2010</xref>). Given ROCK and BRCA2 localize to cytokinesis structures that are also separated in time (furrow and midbody), the deficiency in both functions may potentiate cytokinesis failure and cell death. Supporting cytokinesis failure as the SL trigger between ROCK and BRCA2 deficiency backgrounds, we observed that binucleation significantly accumulates at 24 h of treatment, when other mitotic defects have not yet significantly increased.</p><p>SL can be enhanced by the formation of multipolar spindles due to centrosome amplification. BRCA2 contributes to the regulation of centriole splitting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Saladino et al., 2009</xref>) and centrosome number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ehlén et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Saladino et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Tutt et al., 1999</xref>). BRCA2 also localizes to centrosomes and preventing such a localization causes centrosome amplification and multinucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Shailani et al., 2018</xref>). ROCK also localizes to the centrosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chevrier et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ma et al., 2006</xref>) and its activity is required for centrosome movement and positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chevrier et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rosenblatt et al., 2004</xref>). Similar to BRCA2 deficiency, ROCK inhibition also induces centriole splitting and centrosome amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aoki et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chevrier et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Oku et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, both ROCK and BRCA2 bind nucleophosmin (NPM/B23), a protein involved in the timely initiation of centrosome duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ma et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Okuda et al., 2000</xref>) and disrupting the interaction between BRCA2 and NPM/B23 induces centrosome fragmentation and multinucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). Hence, the SL observed after BRCA2 deficiency and ROCKi may be enhanced by centrosome dysregulation, leading to mitotic spindle defects, cytokinesis failure and cell death. Further work may shed additional light on this SL pathway and unravel other potential druggable targets that could provide therapeutic alternatives for treating BRCA2-deficient tumors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Screening</title><p>Stable HCT116<sup>p21-/-</sup> cell lines tagged with fluorescent proteins (CFP, iRFP or mCherry) and expressing Scramble, BRCA1, or BRCA2 shRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carbajosa et al., 2019</xref>) were co-cultured in equal proportions in 96-well plates for 6 days in the presence (0.1 μM) of each of the 680 compounds of the Protein Kinase Inhibitor Set 2 (PKIS2) library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Drewry et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Elkins et al., 2016</xref>).

Absolute foci numbers should be plotted and statistically analyzed, especially because this is a key argument in the manuscript.</p><p>– The work depends solely on chemical inhibitors (of which 3 out of 9 score in the SL analysis). Why do the other ROCK inhibitors not show SL effects? Genetic approaches in long-term assays are required to strengthen the SL interaction.</p><p>– EME1 depletion allows cells to skip mitosis, but also restores HR in BRCA-deficient cells (work from Pagano lab). This effect should be considered.</p><p>– The observed G2/M arrest upon ROCKi could represent 4n G1 cells.</p><p>– The nature and cause of the observed anaphase bridges are enigmatic. A defect in cytokinesis does not explain the defects observed earlier in mitosis.</p><p>– It is unclear why ROCK or citron kinase selectively disrupt cytokinesis in BRCA2-defective cells? Also, depmap analysis shows that the viability of most cell lines is negatively affected by ROCK1 loss. How do the authors imagine that long-term loss of ROCK specifically affects BRCA2-defective cells? Is there evidence from public data that this interaction is BRCA2-specific?</p><p>– Aberrant multipolar spindles are quantified from DNA staining, but not spindle stainings.

The model that the authors put forward is that ROCK inhibition leads to multinucleate cells, selectively in BRCA2-depleted cells and that this leads in the next cell cycle to structural mitotic defects (eg lagging chromosomes, multipolar spindles). Although the analysis of early and late time points supports this model, any mechanistic underpinning is lacking. Why does ROCK inhibition selectively induce binucleated cells in BRCA2-defective cells in the first cell cycle? There is some literature cited, but that only provides a shallow explanation. Time-lapse imaging would be very informative here to confirm the model that is put forward.</p><p>– The analysis of numbers/intensity of H2AX/53BP1 foci in absolute measures are much more insightful than the arbitrary cut-off. I would suggest showing these data in the main figure not supplement.</p><p>– Line 123: one -&gt;ones.</p><p>– Supplement Figure 3E: please check abelling: should be HU with the images of fibers?</p><p>– Clonogenic assays: this is substandard.

Your revised article has been evaluated by Wafik El-Deiry (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I appreciate that the authors have changed the manuscript, concerning data visualisation. Also, I value how the authors have changed their model and writing in which a first binucleation event precedes further toxic events, which aligns much better with the presented data.</p><p>I realize that I suggested live cell microscopy analysis, and that this comment came after the first revision. However, it is not per se a request for a specific technique, it was merely a request to provide some mechanistic insight. It was just a suggestion of a commonly used technique in the cell cycle/mitosis research field to uncover what the order of events is that happens in BRCA2-defective cells in which ROCK is inactivated.</p><p>Personally, I still feel that the mechanistic insight is not substantial and that the main novelty is that ROCK inactivation is more toxic in BRCA2-depleted cells when compared to BRCA2-proficient cells. I realize that the authors do not agree with this standpoint. At least make clear in the discussion that it is unclear what happens mechanistically.</p><p>As the reviewers suggested, I have considered the 4 points put forward in the rebuttal letter (especially points 1,3 and 4):</p><p>1. ROCKi can kill BRCA2-deficient cells in a manner that is independent of replication stress in S phase. Such a concept has been reinforced in the R1 version by adding fiber assays and including the quantification of H2AX suggested by reviewer 2.</p><p>True, there is no overt replication stress induced by acute ROCK inhibition that can explain the SL effects. The mode of action of PARP inhibitor is clearly different than those of ROCK inhibitors in this respect. However, whether replication stress is not involved in this form of SL is difficult to conclude.</p><p>The effects of 53Bp1, H2AX and fibers were done after 48h of treatment, whereas the toxic effects of ROCK inhibition occur much later, when binucleated cells have I. Since whole genome duplication upon mitotic failure is known to cause replication stress (see for instance Gemble et al., Nature, 2022). To really conclude that replication stress is not involved, analysis at a late time points should be done. Of note. this point of the author does not indicate an underlying mechanism of action, but suggests a mechanism that is not involved.</p><p>2. The cytokinesis defects triggered by ROCKi have been documented by others, and so was the contribution of BRCA2-depletion to cytokinesis defects. By monitoring cells with DNA content higher than 4 N and binucleation, this manuscript shows that the treatment of BRCA2-deficient cells with ROCKi causes a significant augmentation of binucleation at early time points hence suggesting that the cytokinesis defects is a common defect that is amplified by the combined depletion of BRCA2 and the inhibition of ROCKi. Moreover, supporting the idea of cytokinesis defect as the trigger of other defects, including the DNAreplication independent SL, it temporally precedes all other mitotic defects.</p><p>The mechanism proposed here is that ROCKi and BRCA2 inactivation both give cytokinesis defects, and that the SL effect is based on these effects adding up. This is not entirely novel, and also, BRCA2 inactivation in this manuscript only marginally induces cytokinesis defects on its own. That cytokinesis failure leads to secondary defects I completely support, but claiming that secondarily effects are DNA replication independent is not shown and should not be claimed.</p><p>3. Reinforcing the link between cytokinesis failure and SL, the inhibition of another kinase that has also been associated with cytokinesis defect, Citron Rho-interacting kinase, also triggers SL in BRCA-2 deficient cells.</p><p>True, the observation that Rho kinase and ROCK behave the same is strong, and points towards cytokinesis, in which both kinases are clearly implicated.</p><p>4. The prevention of mitosis by EMI1 depletion prevents the SL caused by ROCKi in BRCA2- deficient cells, thus reinforcing the association between M-phase transit and cell death in BRCA2-deficient cells.</p><p>True, the EMI experiment connects mitosis to the SL effect of ROCK inhibition in these cells, reinforcing that a cytokinesis failure is involved</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80254.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The evidence that this SL interaction is independent of replication defects is not solid. Please provide more data to support this conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>In the original version of the manuscript, we included the analysis of BrdU+ cells (%) and BrdU intensity in cells transiting S phase (current Figure 3D and Figure 3—figure supplement 1F). We believe that such evidence is crucial since BrdU intensity reveals global changes in the replication choreography that might be overlooked in DNA spreading assays (Calzetta, Gonzalez Besteiro, and Gottifredi, 2021). Moreover, such a negligible effect of ROCKi in the S phase progression of BRCA2 deficient cells is not associated with changes in γH2AX or 53BP1 nuclear foci accumulation (current Figure 3A-C).</p><p>Nonetheless, we addressed the reviewers' request to provide additional data by performing two sets of experiments:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Reviewer 2 specifically highlighted the need for an alternative quantification method of γH2AX or 53BP1 nuclear foci accumulation independent of arbitrary thresholds. Hence, we quantified absolute γH2AX intensity and the number of 53BP1 foci/ cell (current Supplementary Figure 3 A-D). Such analyses are shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 1AD, and the conclusions (replication stress levels are not upregulated in BRCA2-deficient cells treated with ROCKi) are aligned with the data reported in Figure 3A-C.</p><p>2) We have also carried out a fiber assay analysis to monitor nascent DNA elongation tracks and origin firing frequency. ROCKi causes no changes in such DNA replication parameters in both BRCA2-WT and BRCA2-deficient cells (current Figure 3E-F). In contrast, hydroxyurea (HU) caused changes in the nascent DNA track length of BRCA2-deficient cells, as previously shown elsewhere (Schlacher et al., 2011) (current Figure 3—figure supplement 1E). Together, these results demonstrate that while BRCA2 deficiency alters DNA replication parameters after HU, it does not trigger obvious replication defects after the ROCK inhibitor, fasudil.</p></disp-quote><p>Hence, the data in Figure 3E-F and Figure 3—figure supplement 1A-E further support our claim of a SL interaction independent of replication defects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The SL interaction is based on chemical inhibitors only, with 6 out of 9 ROCK inhibitors not demonstrating the SL interaction. Please explain and define why?</p></disp-quote><p>The SL interaction identified herein is not based on chemical inhibitors only. In fact, in the original version of this manuscript, we have provided genetic evidence (using siRNAs against ROCK1 and ROCK2) to confirm this SL interaction (current Figure 8B and Figure 8—figure supplement 1A).</p><p>When it comes to the reason for obtaining SL-positive results for only 3 out of 9 ROCK inhibitors in the screening, it is related to the low dosage at which the screening was performed. Given that ATP competitive kinase inhibitors are well known to hit multiple off-target kinases with similar ATP binding pockets, we decided to perform this screening at a low dose: 0.1 μM. As such, we aim to reduce false positives and the number of hits to validate, yet concomitantly risk increasing the rate of false negatives. This occurrence of false negatives was precisely the case with the ROCK inhibitors. While the 3 hits were within their activity range at the sub-micro-molar range (Figure 1 E and F), the 6 remaining inhibitors were out of their activity range. When re-testing the remaining 6 inhibitors a 1μM, they all showed SL activity on BRCA2-deficient cells. This information is now in Figure 1figure supplement 1.</p><p>In this revised version, we also included another potent and selective ROCK inhibitor (SR 3677 dihydrochloride) revealing SL activity in BRCA2-deficient samples (current Figure 2—figure supplement 2D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The mechanisms by which ROCKi specifically affects BRCA2-defective cells are elusive. Explain.</p></disp-quote><p>The first type of mitotic defects we observe in BRCA2-deficient cells after fasudil treatment is a significant increase in polyploidy and high levels of binucleated cells (current Figure 4 A-C and Figure 7), which indicates that cytokinesis failure may be the trigger to the SL caused by ROCKi in BRCA2-deficient cells. As detailed below, both ROCK and BRCA2 (but not BRCA1) have been implicated in regulating cytokinesis during mitosis.</p><p>Evidence linking ROCK with cytokinesis regulation: ROCK accumulate at the cleavage furrow and phosphorylate myosin II, a component of the actomyosin ring whose contraction gives rise to the cleavage furrow which divides the cytoplasm (Kosako et al., 2000; Yokoyama, Goto, Izawa, Mizutani, and Inagaki, 2005). Depending on the cell line, inhibiting ROCK can impair or delay furrow ingression (Kosako et al., 2000; Lordier et al., 2008). If furrowing is impaired, cytokinesis fails, and there is polyploidization (Lordier et al., 2008). Knockdown of ROCK1 or ROCK2 using siRNAs also induces multinucleation (Yokoyama et al., 2005).</p><p>Evidence linking BRCA2 with cytokinesis regulation: BRCA2 localizes to a different cytokinesis structure than ROCK, the midbody, where it mediates the assembly of factors involved in abscission (Daniels, Wang, Lee, and Venkitaraman, 2004; Jonsdottir et al., 2009); (Mondal et al., 2012; Rowley et al., 2011). Cytokinesis defects have also been reported for BRCA2-deficient cell models (Daniels et al., 2004; Jonsdottir et al., 2009; Lee, Daniels, Garnett, and Venkitaraman, 2011; Rowley et al., 2011; Vinciguerra, Godinho, Parmar, Pellman,’and D'Andrea, 2010) (Mondal et al., 2012). Importantly, this bona fide role of BRCA2 in cytokinesis is independent of its role in HR (Mondal et al., 2012).</p><p>The evidence above indicates that both BRCA2 and ROCK regulate cytokinesis, albeit at different levels of the process. Such contributions must be mild or easy to compensate for, as individual deficiencies in our experimental settings are insufficient to impair cytokinesis. On this note, previous reports suggest that the individual effects may be very mild. For example, (Lekomtsev, Guizetti, Pozniakovsky, Gerlich, and Petronczki, 2010) compared BRCA2 knockdown against the knockdown of MgcRacGAP, a well-known mediator of cytokinesis, and the multinucleation levels were comparably so low that they concluded that BRCA2 had no significant contribution to cytokinesis.</p><p>Our results indicate that the initial trigger that precedes the mitotic defects observed when ROCK inhibition is combined with BRCA2-deficient backgrounds is binucleation (detected as early as 24 hours post-treatment-Figure 7 A). Given that ROCK and BRCA2 localize to cytokinesis structures (furrow and midbody) at different time points, we propose that the combined deficiencies may cause defects in the early and late steps of cytokinesis which augments the probability of cytokinesis failure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It remains unclear what the cause of the multiple mitotic defe–ts is – best if the authors expand on this.</p></disp-quote><p>In BRCA2-deficient cells treated with ROCKi, the cytokinesis failure is accompanied by other mitotic defects that, we believe, derive from the DNA replication proficiency maintained by binucleated BRCA2-deficient cells (current Figure 6—figure supplement 1C-D). Because multipolar mitosis events accumulate at later time points than binucleation (48 and 24 hours of treatment respectively current Figure 7), we speculate that the attempt to separate DNA after multipolar spindle assembly could ultimately trigger cell death in BRCA2-deficient cells treated with fasudil. We also detected increased centrosome numbers in such samples (current Figure 6D). Centrosomes, the organelles responsible for nucleating the mitotic spindle, must be in the correct number (two) for successful chromosome segregation during mitosis (Fukasawa, 2007). Increased centrosome numbers (i.e., centrosome amplification) lead to abnormal spindle poles, chromosome instability or cell death (Ganem, Godinho, and Pellman, 2009). Centrosome amplification can result from multiple mechanisms, including cytokinesis failure (Fukasawa, 2007; Lens and Medema, 2019). Centrosome duplication is also ruled by timely centriole splitting (Tsou and Stearns, 2006), and in BRCA2.deficient tumors high levels of centriole splitting have been observed (Saladino, Bourke, Conroy, and Morrison, 2009). BRCA2 also localizes to centrosomes, and preventing this localization causes centrosome amplification and multinucleation (Han, Saito, Miki, and Nakanishi, 2008; Nakanishi et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2016). Consistent with in vitro results, BRCA2-deficient tumors display increased centrosome numbers (Hou, Li, Ren, and Liu, 2016; Saladino et al., 2009; Tutt et al., 1999; Watanabe et al., 2018; Wiegant, Overmeer, Godthelp, van Buul, and Zdzienicka, 2006). Additionally, BRCA2 has also been implicated in facilitating chromosome alignment and as part of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), which regulates the metaphase to anaphase transition by monitoring proper kinetochoremicrotubules attachment (Choi et al., 2012; Ehlén et al., 2020). The loss of M phase functions in BRCA2-deficient cells, including the regulation of centrosome numbers, may synergistically interact with ROCKi to kill cells. ROCK also localizes to the centrosome (Chevrier et al., 2002; Ma et al., 2006), and its activity is required for centrosome movement and positioning (Chevrier et al., 2002; Rosenblatt, Cramer, Baum, and McGee, 2004), which are crucial to proper spindle formation as well as mitotic exit (Piel, Nordberg, Euteneur, and Bornens, 2001). Inhibition of ROCK causes mitotic spindle misorientation, diffuse pericentrin and increases the nucleating capacity of astral microtubules (Heng et al., 2012; Rosenblatt et al., 2004). Like BRCA2 deficiency, ROCK inhibition also induces centriole splitting and centrosome amplification (Aoki, Ueda, Kataoka, and Satoh, 2009; Chevrier et al., 2002; Oku et al., 2014). Interestingly, both ROCK and BRCA2 bind nucleophosmin (NPM/B23), a protein involved in the timely initiation of centrosome duplication (Ma et al., 2006; Okuda et al., 2000) and disrupting the interaction between BRCA2 and NPM/B23 induces centrosome fragmentation and multinucleation (Wang, Takenaka, Nakanishi, and Miki, 2011).</p><p>Together, these findings may explain why BRCA2 deficiency and ROCKi potentiate the accumulation of multiple mitotic defects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Missing is some discussion, at least, on how BRCA2 expression is related to actin cytoskeleton dynamics controlled by ROCK kinases.</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed in points 3 and 4, cytokinesis is affected by BRCA2 loss and ROCKi at different levels; while BRCA2 loss dysregulates the midbody organization, ROCKi impair the mitotic furrow formation. Additionally, ROCK and BRCA2 localize to the centrosomes and prevent their amplification. While BRCA2 prevents dysregulation of centriole number and participates in the SAC, ROCK regulates the movement and positioning of centrosomes. Hence, the SL does not result from BRCA2 controlling the ROCK-mediated cytoskeleton regulation. Instead, ROCK and BRCA2 have complementing functions that favor cell fitness in mitosis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors also show that ROCK kinase inhibitors are also quite toxic to WT cells. Is this via the same mechanism but just attenuated and if so, why?</p></disp-quote><p>We designed an experiment to test whether WT cells die via the same mechanism by which ROCKi kills BRCA2-deficient cells. To test this, we increased fasudil doses in WT cells to achieve levels of cell death similar to those obtained after lower doses of fasudil in BRCA2-deficient cells. Surprisingly, despite the massive cell death observed in WT cells at high fasudil concentrations, increased binucleation was not observed (current Figure 7—figure supplement 1). Hence, the treatment of BRCA2-deficient cells with ROCKi triggers a cell death preceded by cytokinesis failure, while the treatment of WT cells with higher doses of ROCKi triggers a cell death independent of cytokinesis failure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors should provide more detail on the mechanism of BRCA2-specific cell death by ROCK kinase inhibitors.</p></disp-quote><p>The evidence discussed in points 3 and 4 and the experiment reported in point 6 have already provided additional details on the BRCA2-specific cell death by ROCKi. Furthermore, based on one of the comments from reviewer 2: &quot;The nature and cause of the observed anaphase bridges are enigmatic; a defect in cytokinesis does not explain the defects observed earlier in mitosis&quot;, we designed an experiment that provides further detail to the SL mechanism. We monitored binucleation, anaphase and mitotic aberrations at early times: 24, 48 and 72 hours after fasudil treatment. As shown in Figure 7, binucleated cells but not anaphase and mitotic aberrations, were detected at 24 hours in BRCA2-deficient cells treated with ROCKi. These data support the model in Figure 8G, indicating that the earliest alterations that accumulate in BRCA2-deficient cells treated with ROCKi are binucleated cells. Given that DNA duplication is not inhibited in binucleated cells (current Figure 6—figure supplement 1C-D), it is very likely that the anaphase bridges do not precede cytokinesis but accumulate later when binucleated or multinucleated cells attempt mitosis. From these data, we infer that the attempt to achieve separation of polyploid nuclei into daughter cells is the most likely trigger of cell death in BRCA2-deficient cells treated with ROCKi.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Authors focus all the PARPi effects in BRCA2-KO cells as due to HR defects, but recent reports have supported more clarity of that phenotype, related to the accumulation of replication gaps and not solely due to HR defects.

While the regulation of RAD51 by EMI1 is undoubtedly relevant when interpreting the effect of EMI1 on PARPi-induced synthetic lethality, some observations from our manuscript do not support a potential role of HR in the SL we describe. First, there is no replication stress in BRCA2-deficient cells treated with ROCKi, so the accumulation of double-strand breaks is unlikely. Second, ROCKi is synthetic lethal in BRCA2- but not BRCA1-deficient cells, and a SL involving HR modulation should equally affect both backgrounds. Third, ROCK overlap with BRCA2 in controlling mitotic events at the level of cytokinesis and centriole regulation (see points 3 and 4 in the &quot;essential revision&quot; section), but ROCK have no role in HR.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The observed G2/M arrest upon ROCKi could represent 4n G1 cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for spotting this possibility that could explain the early accumulation of cells in the 4n region of the flow cytometry peaks.

This was followed up by adding staining against α-tubulin (microtubules) and γ-tubulin (centrosomes) (Figure 6 D-F). Such an information is reported in the Methods section and in the legend of Figure 6. The quantifications in Figure 6E and 6F relied on spindle staining (revealed by γ- tubulin), centrosomes (revealed by alfa- tubulin) and DNA (revealed by DAPI). As shown in Figure 6 D, only anaphases revealing all three immunofluorescent marks were considered in the analysis (and all metaphases without exception were positive for the three marks).

Why does ROCK inhibition selectively induce binucleated cells in BRCA2-defective cells in the first cell cycle? there is some literature cited, but that only provides a shallow explanation. time-lapse imaging would be very informative here to confirm the model that is put forward.</p></disp-quote><p>We submitted the original version of this manuscript on June 2022 and provided an R1 version of the manuscript attending all reviewer comments in November 2022. The live cell microscopy experiment has been suggested by reviewer 2 when evaluating the R1 version of our manuscript. We do not deny that such an experiment could be very interesting to perform as many others but we cannot provide this experiment at this time. It is technically challenging and impossible to perform without the building up of expertise that can only be gained after several months.</p><p>Moreover, we believe that the comment indicating that “no mechanistic data that explains why ROCK kinase inhibition selectively affects BRCA2-defective cells” is a bit harsh. As discussed below, there are many critical mechanistic insides which are already provided by our manuscript (when assessing the mechanistic contribution reviewer 2 focuses on point 2 but not 1, 3 and 4). We ask reviewer 2 and the editors to please consider the following mechanistic insights provided in the manuscript:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) ROCKi can kill BRCA2-deficient cells in a manner that is independent of replication stress in S phase.

By monitoring cells with DNA content higher than 4 N and binucleation, this manuscript shows that the treatment of BRCA2-deficient cells with ROCKi causes a significant augmentation of binucleation at early time points hence suggesting that the cytokinesis defects is a common defect that is amplified by the combined depletion of BRCA2 and the inhibition of ROCKi. Moreover, supporting the idea of cytokinesis defect as the trigger of other defects, including the DNA replication independent SL, it temporally precedes all other mitotic defects.</p><p>3) Reinforcing the link between cytokinesis failure and SL, the inhibition of another kinase that has also been associated with cytokinesis defect, Citron Rho-interacting kinase, also triggers SL in BRCA-2 deficient cells.</p><p>4) The prevention of mitosis by EMI1 depletion prevents the SL caused by ROCKi in BRCA2deficient cells, thus reinforcing the association between M-phase transit and cell death in BRCA2-deficient cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Finally, reviewer 2 also considers that the analysis of early and late time points supports a model indicating that ROCKi first leads BRCA2-depleted cells to binucleation and later to structural mitotic defects (e.g. lagging chromosomes, multipolar spindles). In the manuscript, we have made it clear that our findings indicate that a significant increase in binucleation is detected earlier than other mitotic defects without mentioning the first or second cycle. In addition, in the current R2 version of the manuscript, we have changed a sentence “we speculate that after a subsequent DNA duplication, these cells can attempt mitosis.” (see lane 1075).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The analysis of numbers/intensity of H2AX/53BP1 foci in absolute measures are much more insightful than the arbitrary cut-off.

Also, I value how the authors have changed their model and writing in which a first binucleation event precedes further toxic events, which aligns much better with the presented data.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer 2 for this positive assessment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I realize that I suggested live cell microscopy analysis, and that this comment came after the first revision. However, it is not per se a request for a specific technique, it was merely a request to provide some mechanistic insight. It was just a suggestion of a commonly used technique in the cell cycle/mitosis research field to uncover what the order of events is that happens in BRCA2-defective cells in which ROCK is inactivated.</p><p>Personally, I still feel that the mechanistic insight is not substantial and that the main novelty is that ROCK inactivation is more toxic in BRCA2-depleted cells when compared to BRCA2-proficient cells. I realize that the authors do not agree with this standpoint. At least make clear in the discussion that it is unclear what happens mechanistically.</p></disp-quote><p>We still believe that finding a SL association between a non-DDR kinase and BRCA2, which is independent from the induction of acute replication stress, is initiated by augmentation of binucleation, is prevented by EMI1 depletion and recapitulated by Citron Rho-Interacting kinase (another non-DDR kinase), and provides a certain level of mechanistic insight. We understand that reviewer 2 wants us to acknowledge that we have not identified the molecular target of ROCKi that triggers the excess cytokinesis failure in BRCA2-deficient cells. We have made this limitation explicit in the Discussion section of the R3 version of this manuscript (lines 328- 332).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As the reviewers suggested, I have considered the 4 points put forward in the rebuttal letter (especially points 1,3 and 4):</p><p>1. ROCKi can kill BRCA2-deficient cells in a manner that is independent of replication stress in S phase. Such a concept has been reinforced in the R1 version by adding fiber assays and including the quantification of H2AX suggested by reviewer 2.</p><p>True, there is no overt replication stress induced by acute ROCK inhibition that can explain the SL effects. The mode of action of PARP inhibitor is clearly different than those of ROCK inhibitors in this respect. However, whether replication stress is not involved in this form of SL is difficult to conclude.</p><p>The effects of 53Bp1, H2AX and fibers were done after 48h of treatment, whereas the toxic effects of ROCK inhibition occur much later, when binucleated cells have occured. Since whole genome duplication upon mitotic failure is known to cause replication stress (see for instance Gemble et al., Nature, 2022). To really conclude that replication stress is not involved, analysis at a late time points should be done. Of note. this point of the author does not indicate an underlying mechanism of action, but suggests a mechanism that is not involved.</p></disp-quote><p>Because this section starts with “As the reviewers suggested…” we assume that this part of the letter has been written by the reviewing editor or the editor. We would like to emphasize that we never claimed that the replication stress was absent. We focused on acute replication stress which is the type of stress triggered by PARP inhibitors. Our intention was to highlight the mechanistic differences between ROCK and PARP inhibitors. However, and due to this request, we have performed the experiment requested herein by reviewer 2 and the editors. Surprisingly, there is no replication stress at later time points for mono, bi and multinucleated cells, which reinforce the replication stress-independent nature of this SL between ROCKi and BRCA2deficiency.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The cytokinesis defects triggered by ROCKi have been documented by others, and so was the contribution of BRCA2-depletion to cytokinesis defects. By monitoring cells with DNA content higher than 4 N and binucleation, this manuscript shows that the treatment of BRCA2-deficient cells with ROCKi causes a significant augmentation of binucleation at early time points hence suggesting that the cytokinesis defects is a common defect that is amplified by the combined depletion of BRCA2 and the inhibition of ROCKi. Moreover, supporting the idea of cytokinesis defect as the trigger of other defects, including the DNAreplication independent SL, it temporally precedes all other mitotic defects.</p><p>The mechanism proposed here is that ROCKi and BRCA2 inactivation both give cytokinesis defects, and that the SL effect is based on these effects adding up. This is not entirely novel, and also, BRCA2 inactivation in this manuscript only marginally induces cytokinesis defects on its own. That cytokinesis failure leads to secondary defects I completely support, but claiming that secondarily effects are DNA replication independent is not shown and should not be claimed.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not claim independence from replication stress. Throughout the whole manuscript (original, R1 and R2) we did purposely limit such a conclusion to acute replication stress which is what we tested. Because of the experiments requested by the editors and reviewer 2 in this R3 round, we have monitored replication stress at the same time we measure cell death (6 days) by means of H2AX intensity and 53BP1 foci formation, in two cell lines (shBRCA2 HCT116<sup>p21-/-</sup> and PEO1 BRCA2-/-) (see new Figure 3—figure supplement 2). Surprisingly, there was no replication stress even at those late time points for mono, bi and multinucleated cells. Such observation reinforces the dissociation of this SL from replication stress.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.
