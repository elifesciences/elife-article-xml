Previous studies identified <italic>ectodysplasin (EDA)</italic> gene as the major locus controlling recurrent plate loss in freshwater fish, though the causative DNA alterations were not known. Here we show that freshwater <italic>EDA</italic> alleles have <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulatory changes that reduce expression in developing plates and spines. An identical T → G base pair change is found in <italic>EDA</italic> enhancers of divergent low-plated fish. Recreation of the T → G change in a marine enhancer strongly reduces expression in posterior armor plates. Bead implantation and cell culture experiments show that Wnt signaling strongly activates the marine <italic>EDA</italic> enhancer, and the freshwater T → G change reduces Wnt responsiveness. Thus parallel evolution of low-plated sticklebacks has occurred through a shared DNA regulatory change, which reduces the sensitivity of an <italic>EDA</italic> enhancer to Wnt signaling, and alters expression in developing armor plates while preserving expression in other tissues.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05290.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05290.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05290.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Stickleback fish develop bony plates on their surface to protect themselves from predators. The extent and pattern of their bony armor depends on their habitat: marine sticklebacks are typically covered from head to tail with bony plates, but freshwater sticklebacks retain only a few plates on their sides.</p><p>One gene that promotes the formation of the bony plates is called <italic>ectodysplasin</italic> (<italic>EDA</italic>). This encodes a signaling protein that is important for the development of the skeleton, skin and many other tissues. Variations in the sequence of this gene are shared among different stickleback populations worldwide. However, it has not been clear which genetic changes can explain how lightly armored freshwater sticklebacks could have evolved from their well-armored marine ancestors on several separate occasions.</p><p>Here, O'Brown et al. studied <italic>EDA</italic> in marine and groups of freshwater sticklebacks that have evolved in different locations around the world. The experiments show that the level of expression of <italic>EDA</italic> in the developing plates and spines is lower in the freshwater fish. O'Brown et al. thought this could be due to genetic changes in regions of <italic>EDA</italic> that lie outside the region that encodes the protein, so called ‘regulatory elements’.</p><p>Indeed, further experiments found that all freshwater fish have a small change in the DNA of a regulatory element that switches on the gene in plate-forming regions of the body. When this change was introduced into marine sticklebacks, the fish had lower levels of <italic>gene</italic> expression in these plate-forming regions.</p><p>These findings demonstrate that lightly armored sticklebacks have evolved multiple times from their well-armored marine ancestors through the same small change in their DNA that alters the expression of the <italic>EDA</italic> gene. The next challenge will be to understand why this particular small change in DNA appears to be favored over all the other changes that could occur in the regulatory element, and to see if factors that act through this regulatory switch also modify armor structures in natural populations.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05290.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05290.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>recurrent mutation</kwd><kwd>Wnt signaling</kwd><kwd>skeletal development</kwd><kwd>ectodysplasin gene</kwd><kwd>enhancer</kwd><kwd>stickleback</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation (NSF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>O'Brown</surname><given-names>Natasha M</given-names></name><name><surname>Summers</surname><given-names>Brian R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brady</surname><given-names>Shannon D</given-names></name><name><surname>Kingsley</surname><given-names>David M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM007790</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>O'Brown</surname><given-names>Natasha M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000051</institution-id><institution>National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>3P50 HG002568</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jones</surname><given-names>Felicity C</given-names></name><name><surname>Kingsley</surname><given-names>David M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An identical DNA base pair change has occurred in divergent sticklebacks to alter the expression of a major developmental gene controlling armor plates, thus providing a molecular link between particular enhancer changes, cell signaling, and repeated skeletal evolution in natural populations.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The repeated evolution of similar adaptive phenotypic traits in multiple populations is a fascinating evolutionary phenomenon observed in many organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wood et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Elmer and Meyer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Conte et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Martin and Orgogozo, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stern, 2013</xref>). The threespine stickleback (<italic>Gasterosteus aculeatus</italic>) is a particularly favorable species to characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying repeated evolution of adaptive phenotypic traits in nature, because many populations have evolved similar morphological and skeletal traits following widespread colonization of new freshwater environments by migratory marine ancestors at the end of the last ice age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bell and Foster, 1994</xref>).</p><p>One of the most striking and ubiquitous morphological changes seen in sticklebacks is repeated alteration in bony armor seen along the sides of fish. Marine sticklebacks are typically covered from head to tail with 32 (or more) bony lateral plates. In contrast, freshwater fish characteristically lack most plates, typically retaining only 0–7 plates in the anterior flank region. This dramatic difference in anterior-posterior patterning of armor plates was used to assign different species names to marine and freshwater sticklebacks in the 1800s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cuvier and Valenciennes, 1829</xref>). Subsequent studies have shown that different armor patterns are highly heritable, and are likely controlled by a relatively simple genetic system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Münzing, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hagen and Gilbertson, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avise, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ziuganov, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banbura, 1994</xref>). More recently, genome-wide linkage mapping in crosses between divergent sticklebacks identified a major locus on stickleback chromosome IV that controls over 75% of the variance in armor plate number in F2 offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Colosimo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cresko et al., 2004</xref>), as well as several unlinked modifier genes that each control 5–10% of the variance in plate numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Colosimo et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>High-resolution mapping, chromosome walking, and transgenic rescue experiments showed that the major armor plate locus corresponds to the <italic>ectodysplasin</italic> (<italic>EDA</italic>) gene on stickleback chromosome IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Colosimo et al., 2005</xref>). The <italic>EDA</italic> gene encodes a secreted protein in the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family that plays a key role in cell signaling during the development of multiple neural crest and ectodermal tissues, including skin, hair, and teeth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mikkola and Thesleff, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cui and Schlessinger, 2006</xref>). Humans with null mutations in <italic>EDA</italic> have defects in multiple ectoderm and neural crest derived tissues, including sparse hair, absent sweat glands, dental abnormalities, and dermal bone changes in the skull (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mikkola and Thesleff, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cui and Schlessinger, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yavuz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clauss et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lesot et al., 2009</xref>). Zebrafish and medaka mutants with perturbations in the EDA pathway display severe skeletal abnormalities, such as loss of fins and scales, missing and abnormally shaped teeth, and abnormal craniofacial morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Harris et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Iida et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>While both high-resolution mapping and transgenic rescue experiments confirm that <italic>EDA</italic> is the major locus controlling armor plates in sticklebacks, the molecular difference between marine and freshwater fish is still unclear. Most freshwater populations share four amino acid differences in the <italic>EDA</italic> gene, as well as numerous non-coding changes that together make up a characteristic freshwater haplotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Colosimo et al., 2005</xref>). However, the four amino acid changes occur at positions that also vary among other species, so these coding changes are unlikely to be the basis of major changes in EDA function. In addition, there exists at least one low-plated stickleback population that has the identical EDA protein-coding sequence as marine fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Colosimo et al., 2005</xref>). This key population from Nakagawa Creek in Gifu, Japan (NAKA) is a low-plated stream population with a predominately marine-like sequence in both coding and non-coding regions. NAKA fails to complement armor plate changes when crossed with a typical Canadian low-plated population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schluter et al., 2004</xref>), suggesting that NAKA and other low-plated fish share a modification in the same major locus. Based on the absence of amino acid changes in NAKA, and the deleterious nature of coding region changes in human patients, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Colosimo et al. (2005)</xref> proposed that an unknown regulatory change at the stickleback <italic>EDA</italic> locus is the most likely basis of the common <italic>EDA</italic> variants found in freshwater fish.</p><p>Here we further investigate the <italic>EDA</italic> locus in order to study the causative base pair changes that underlie repeated evolution of low-plated sticklebacks.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulatory change reduces expression of freshwater <italic>EDA</italic> gene</title><p>In order to test if <italic>EDA</italic> is differentially expressed in marine and freshwater fish due to <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory differences, we performed allele-specific expression in F1 hybrid fish made by crossing marine and freshwater sticklebacks. The F1 hybrids are heterozygous for both the marine and freshwater haplotypes at the <italic>EDA</italic> locus, and therefore express both alleles in an identical <italic>trans</italic>-acting environment. We then isolated RNA from 10 different developing tissues, and determined whether the freshwater and marine <italic>EDA</italic> transcripts were expressed at the same or different levels using pyrosequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, see ‘Materials and methods’). No significant expression differences between marine and freshwater <italic>EDA</italic> alleles were observed in the fins or the lower jaw. However, the freshwater <italic>EDA</italic> allele was expressed almost fourfold lower than the marine allele in the developing anterior and posterior flanks (corresponding to sites where armor plates had already appeared, or were not forming yet; respectively), and in the dorsal and pelvic spines (p &lt; 0.01, Student's <italic>t</italic> test), as well as twofold lower in the premaxilla (p &lt; 0.05, Student's <italic>t</italic> test). These data suggest that the marine and freshwater haplotypes at the <italic>EDA</italic> locus have <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulatory changes that reduce expression of the freshwater allele in particular tissues, including the flank regions where armor plates normally form.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05290.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>EDA</italic> shows allele-specific expression differences in several tissues, indicating <italic>cis-</italic>regulatory divergence.</title><p>Allele-specific expression in F1 freshwater-marine heterozygous larvae reveals significant differential expression of the marine and freshwater alleles in dorsal spines 1 and 2, the pelvic spine, the premaxilla, and the presumptive armor plates (anterior and posterior flanks).

Our allele-specific expression experiments show that the freshwater allele of <italic>EDA</italic> is expressed at lower levels than the marine allele in F1 hybrids, confirming prior suggestions that there were likely to be <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulatory differences between marine and freshwater <italic>EDA</italic> variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Colosimo et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, we have now identified a specific enhancer region in the key armor plates region, shown that the marine version of this enhancer normally drives expression in developing armor plates, and identified a specific T → G base pair change within the enhancer that is shared by all sequenced low-plated freshwater fish. Experimental recreation of the T → G base pair change reduces both armor plate expression and Wnt responsiveness of the enhancer, suggesting that this specific DNA change is the likely causative regulatory lesion in the <italic>EDA</italic> locus that leads to low-plated phenotypes in sticklebacks.</p><p>Like other genes found to underlie major morphological differences between marine and freshwater fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shapiro et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Miller et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chan et al., 2010</xref>), the <italic>EDA</italic> gene is a key developmental control gene that is essential for formation of multiple tissues. Mutations in the coding region of <italic>EDA</italic> in both zebrafish and medaka cause deleterious phenotypes at multiple body sites, including complete loss of scales, partial loss of fins and teeth, and multiple craniofacial abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Harris et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Iida et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, the T → G regulatory change we have identified in an <italic>EDA</italic> enhancer leads to partial loss of <italic>EDA</italic> expression, particularly in the posterior flank region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This regulatory change thus alters <italic>EDA</italic> expression at the same body site where freshwater fish lack body armor, while preserving important functions of <italic>EDA</italic> in other tissues. These results provide a new example of a specific regulatory change linked to morphological evolution in natural populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Martin and Orgogozo, 2013</xref>), and add to growing evidence that regulatory changes are a predominant mechanism underlying adaptive evolution in sticklebacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jones et al., 2012</xref>) and other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wray, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carroll, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Our results also provide new insight into genomic mechanisms contributing to repeated evolution. Previous analyses identified a shared low-plated <italic>EDA</italic> haplotype that has been fixed in most low-plated Pacific and Atlantic freshwater populations, and that is also present at very low frequency in the heterozygous state in marine populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Colosimo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barrett et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bell et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, <italic>EDA</italic> has become a classic example of rapid parallel evolution based on a preexisting genetic variant that increases in frequency when marine populations colonize new freshwater environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stern, 2013</xref>). The current results suggest that repeated evolution of low-plated phenotypes might also result from independent mutations occurring in the <italic>EDA</italic> locus in different populations. In previous surveys, Japanese NAKA fish were the only low-plated freshwater population that did not share the same <italic>EDA</italic> haplotype as other freshwater populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Colosimo et al., 2005</xref>). Our experiments show that NAKA and other freshwater sticklebacks share an identical T → G non-coding regulatory mutation that reduces expression of <italic>EDA</italic> specifically in developing posterior armor plates. Characteristic flanking SNPs are not shared between NAKA and other low-plated populations, suggesting that the same T → G mutation has likely occurred independently on two very different haplotypes.</p><p>Recurrent mutations can be due to a particular DNA sequence that has a high intrinsic mutation rate. For example, previous studies of pelvic reduction in sticklebacks suggest that a key pelvic enhancer repeatedly deleted in freshwater populations has sequence features shared with fragile sites in human chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chan et al., 2010</xref>). Individual base pairs can also be prone to particular mutations. For example, C → T transition mutations are particularly common at CpG dinucleotides in mammalian genomes, due to a high rate of spontaneous deamination of methylated C residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mancini et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Xia et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, the recurrent regulatory mutation we have identified at the stickleback <italic>EDA</italic> locus is a T → G transversion substitution, one of the least common types of changes seen in large scale studies of spontaneous germ-line mutations in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Genome of the Netherlands Consortium, 2014</xref>) as well as in flies, worms, and yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lynch, 2010</xref>).</p><p>It is possible that the shared T → G change arose not by independent mutation, but by extensive recombination or gene conversion from the typical freshwater <italic>EDA</italic> haplotype. Migratory marine populations include rare individuals that are heterozygous for both marine and freshwater haplotypes, which likely arise by repeated rounds of introgression of freshwater alleles into marine populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Colosimo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schluter and Conte, 2009</xref>). Sequence studies suggest that recombination can occur between typical marine and freshwater haplotypes, producing smaller and smaller blocks of sequence shared among most low-plated populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Colosimo et al., 2005</xref>). In previous studies, the minimal shared freshwater region was approximately 16 kb, consisting of regions of both the <italic>EDA</italic> gene and two flanking genes involved in immune functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Colosimo et al., 2005</xref>). However further recombination between marine and freshwater haplotypes could narrow this region further, conceivably approaching the size of a single base pair. For example, we have recently surveyed 263 migratory marine sticklebacks from Alaska and identified 12 completely plated individuals that are heterozygous for the T → G change in the <italic>EDA</italic> enhancer (minor allele frequency 2.3%). Analysis of flanking SNPs suggests one of these carriers is heterozygous for a larger characteristic freshwater haplotype, three are heterozygous for a much shorter freshwater haplotype, and eight are heterozygous at the T → G position but are marine-like at other characteristic flanking SNPs tested (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). These data show that migratory marine populations can carry freshwater haplotypes of different sizes, including much smaller regions surrounding the key T → G regulatory change. Although most low-plated populations have clearly fixed a multi-kilobase haplotype surrounding <italic>EDA</italic>, the large size of this haplotype may reflect co-selection for additional phenotypes controlled by the closely linked genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Colosimo et al., 2005</xref>). The geographically distant NAKA population is low-plated but shares only the T → G change, either because of an independent mutation, or because of fixation of a tiny fragment of the typical <italic>EDA</italic> haplotype. The NAKA population may be useful in the future for distinguishing the phenotypic effects of the isolated T → G regulatory change versus the larger <italic>EDA</italic> haplotype typically found in most low-plated sticklebacks.</p><p>The absence of a greater range of armor plate mutations at the <italic>EDA</italic> locus could be due to the relatively high frequency of a preexisting freshwater haplotype, whose frequency in migratory populations exceeds the rate of many spontaneous mutations. Alternatively, the T → G change could represent one of very few possible ways of producing a major change in armor plate patterns while still preserving other functions of the <italic>EDA</italic> gene. A constrained spectrum of mutations has been observed in other contexts involving very specific phenotypes. For example, nearly all patients with classic achondroplasia contain the same Gly380Arg (G → C) substitution in FGFR3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Horton et al., 2007</xref>). This Gly380Arg substitution leads to a constitutively active FGF receptor that is thought to confer a selective advantage to spermatogonial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tiemann-Boege et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Choi et al., 2008</xref>). Identical amino acid substitutions in particular genes also underlie several examples of repeated evolution including insecticide resistance in insects (<italic>GABA</italic>), tetrodotoxin resistance in snakes (<italic>NaK-ATPase</italic>), C4 photosynthesis in plants (<italic>PEPC</italic>), and dark pigmentation in mice and birds (<italic>MC1R</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stern, 2013</xref>). These and other well-studied cases typically involve particular amino acid changes that alter protein activity in specific ways, rather than completely ablating protein function. In contrast, few examples are known of identical recurrent base pair mutations in non-coding regulatory sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Martin and Orgogozo, 2013</xref>), though multiple cases are now being uncovered in large-scale sequencing surveys of replicate microbial evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tenaillon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blank et al., 2014</xref>). In a recent large-scale study of parallel temperature adaptation over 2000 generations, recurrent use of particular genes was at least 10 times more common than recurrent use of the same base pair changes within those genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tenaillon et al., 2012</xref>). Of the relatively rare recurrent base pair changes, those affecting protein-coding sequence also outnumbered those affecting non-coding intergenic sequence by nearly threefold. The T → G base pair change we have identified near <italic>EDA</italic> provides a rare example in vertebrates of a particular non-coding base pair change contributing to repeated adaptive evolution.</p><p>Our experiments also show that Wnt signaling acts upstream of <italic>EDA</italic> control sequences in armor plate patterning, and that the low-plated SNP reduces Wnt responsiveness of the <italic>EDA</italic> enhancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6">Figures 5, 6</xref>). Although canonical Wnt signaling typically acts through the β-catenin and Lef transcription factors, the particular T → G base pair change we have identified does not alter a canonical Lef binding sequence. However, Wnt signaling is known to interact with multiple additional signaling and transcription factor pathways, and the T → G change does alter a predicted binding site for c-Jun in the marine sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Newburger and Bulyk, 2009</xref>), which can act in collaboration with Wnt signaling in chondrocyte dedifferentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hwang et al., 2005</xref>), osteopontin promoter activation in mammary cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">El-Tanani et al., 2004</xref>), and complexes with β-catenin to bind the promoters of Wnt target genes both in mammalian cells and in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gan et al., 2008</xref>). There are seven base pair positions in the predicted marine c-Jun binding site, and 21 corresponding single bp mutations that could alter one of these bases. 19 of these potential mutations are predicted to eliminate c-Jun binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Messeguer et al., 2002</xref>). Of these 19 mutations, the T → G change found in low- plated sticklebacks is the only mutation that is also predicted to create a new overlapping binding site for AP-2α in the low-plated sequence. AP-2α has been shown to inhibit Wnt signaling by complexing with APC/β-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li and Dashwood, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2009b</xref>). A new binding site for AP-2α could contribute to the reduced Wnt responsiveness of the freshwater <italic>EDA</italic> gene, or may contribute to other novel expression patterns that are not yet understood (such as the enhanced cyanoacrylate response we have observed with the T → G mutated enhancer). Future experiments are needed to test whether c-Jun, AP-2α or other factors interact directly with the <italic>EDA</italic> enhancer of either marine or freshwater sticklebacks. However, the simultaneous loss and gain of specific binding sites is a good example of the type of dual molecular constraints that could limit the range of possible base pair substitutions found underlying adaptive regulatory evolution at the <italic>EDA</italic> locus.</p><p>Our findings that connect Wnt signaling, plate development, and EDA signaling in sticklebacks also suggest new candidates for trans-acting genetic factors that may modify armor plate number in evolving populations. Previous genetic studies have shown that while the majority of the variance (&gt;75%) in armor plate number in stickleback crosses maps to the <italic>EDA</italic> locus, the remainder of the variance can be explained by multiple plate modifier loci located on other chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Colosimo et al., 2004</xref>). Interestingly, two of the three previously mapped armor plate modifier regions contain genes for members of the Wnt pathway: <italic>WNT11</italic> on chromosome VII and β-catenin (<italic>CTTNB1</italic>) on chromosome X. Given the dramatic effects of Wnt signaling on armor plate development and <italic>EDA</italic> regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6">Figures 5, 6</xref>), these or other components of the Wnt signaling pathway are strong candidates for additional loci that may contribute to the adaptive fine-tuning of armor plate numbers that is known to occur in many low-plated populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hagen and Gilbertson, 1972</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Moodie, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Moodie et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bell and Haglund, 1978</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Allele-specific expression</title><p>Allele-specific expression differences were detected using pyrosequencing analysis of F1 hybrid fish as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang and Elbein, 2007</xref>).

Previous studies have identified characteristic base pair positions that differentiate the most abundant <italic>EDA</italic> haplotypes present in marine and freshwater populations. The position of these SNPs in the <italic>EDA</italic> region are shown, along with the exon number in which they occur, the nature of the mutation (S: synonymous change; N: non-synonymous change; Reg: regulatory change), the SNP number assigned in previous studies, and the characteristic alleles that are found in 10 different completely-plated marine (red) and 14 different low-plated freshwater (blue) populations (top two haplotype rows, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Colosimo et al., 2005</xref>). We amplified the genomic region surrounding the new T → G regulatory mutation identified in the current study, and found that 12 of 263 completely plated migratory fish from Rabbit Slough, Alaska (RABS) were heterozygous for the T → G change (minor allele frequency: 2.3%). Analysis of flanking positions suggests that these carrier fish are heterozygous for larger or smaller haplotypes at the <italic>EDA</italic> locus, or are marine-like at all positions except for the T → G change like NAKA. The six indicated SNPs correspond to positions chrIV: 12808303, 12808630, 12811481, 12811933, 12813328, 12813394 in the stickleback genome assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jones et al.,

This finding has both developmental and potential clinical significance.

It would have enhanced the study to know which factors bind to this region, or data on the phenotypic consequences of engineering a correction of this change, or of mutating the same base, but to a different substitution.

(This work was carried out in part by Shannon Brady, who has now been added a co-author of the manuscript). This survey showed that most completely plated marine animals are homozygous for the marine “T” allele, but a small number of fish are heterozygous carriers of the freshwater “G” allele (overall minor G allele frequency: 2.3%). We also typed these heterozygous fish with flanking markers, to distinguish between carriers of large, small, or recombinant freshwater <italic>EDA</italic> haplotypes. These data are summarized in a new <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>, and a corresponding section has been added to both the Discussion (paragraph 5) and the Materials and methods (paragraph 3) to cover the new material.</p><p><italic>Tone down your inference that there might be very few, perhaps only one mutation that is evolutionarily permissible, unless you can demonstrate with additional mutations in the enhancer that this is indeed the case</italic>.</p><p>We have examined the location of the marine and freshwater sequence change for predicted transcription factor binding sites, and computationally compared the predicted effects of all possible single base pair mutations at the positions surrounding the observed T-&gt;G change. While there are multiple mutations that can potentially disrupt the c-Jun site previously mentioned in the Discussion, the observed T-&gt;G change is the only base pair mutation that is predicted to both eliminate a c-Jun site in the marine enhancer, and to simultaneously create a new overlapping AP-2 alpha site in the freshwater sequence. We describe these predicted mutational effects in an enlarged paragraph 7 of the Discussion, and discuss how the dual effects of the T-&gt;G mutation could be an example of combined molecular constraints that limit the range of base pair mutations observed in low-plated populations.</p><p>We have also edited the Discussion to clearly state the possibility that the observed sharing of T-&gt;G changes is due to the relatively high frequency of the freshwater G allele in marine populations, rather than due to strong constraints on possible adaptive sequence changes among independently arising mutations (paragraph 5 and first sentence of paragraph 6).</p><p><italic>Also, in your previous work, you did not distinguish between gene-flow from freshwater into migratory marine fish and ancestral presence in the marine population</italic>.</p><p>This distinction was not discussed in the original Colosimo et al. paper in 2005. However, the issue has subsequently been further analyzed using the geographic patterns found in the Colosimo et al. marine and freshwater <italic>EDA</italic> allele sequences. This analysis shows much greater geographic structuring among freshwater <italic>EDA</italic> alleles than among marine <italic>EDA</italic> alleles, which is consistent with repeated rounds of gene flow from freshwater fish into migratory marine populations, rather than selection from ancestral diversity already present in marine populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schulter and Conte, 2009</xref>). We now briefly refer to this point in the revised Discussion (see paragraph 5).</p><p><italic>Nor did you explore potential reasons for the remarkable size of the common low-plated 16 kb haplotype</italic>.</p><p>Our new survey of migratory marine fish includes additional analysis of freshwater haplotype sizes in carrier animals, and identifies multiple examples of apparent recombinant haplotypes that are smaller than the previous observed 16 kb freshwater region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We have also modified the Discussion to point out that the substantial size of the typical 16 kb freshwater haplotype may be due to coselection for multiple phenotypes arising from linked genes, and that NAKA may be an interesting example of a population that has fixed only the armor plate changes (see the end of paragraph 5 of the revised Discussion).</p></body></sub-article></article>
