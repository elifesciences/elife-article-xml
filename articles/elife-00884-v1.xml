Cellular actin networks contain multiple NPFs, but how they coordinately regulate Arp2/3 complex is unclear. Cortactin is an NPF that activates Arp2/3 complex weakly on its own, but with WASP/N-WASP, another class of NPFs, potently activates. We dissect the mechanism of synergy and propose a model in which cortactin displaces N-WASP from nascent branches as a prerequisite for nucleation. Single-molecule imaging revealed that unlike WASP/N-WASP, cortactin remains bound to junctions during nucleation, and specifically targets junctions with a ∼160-fold increased on rate over filament sides. N-WASP must be dimerized for potent synergy, and targeted mutations indicate release of dimeric N-WASP from nascent branches limits nucleation. Mathematical modeling shows cortactin-mediated displacement but not N-WASP recycling or filament recruitment models can explain synergy. Our results provide a molecular basis for coordinate Arp2/3 complex regulation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00884.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00884.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00884.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells constantly sense, and react to, their environments. They can monitor or alter their surroundings by taking up or secreting various substances, and may also migrate toward food supplies, or toward signaling molecules—for example, to clot blood or heal wounds. These actions depend on the cytoskeleton, a protein meshwork that gives cells their shape; allows them to transport materials into, out of, or across their cytoplasms; and enables them to move.</p><p>The filaments of the cytoskeleton are constructed from several different types of proteins, one of which is called actin. In response to signals, actin can assemble into linear filaments, or can form branches with one end anchored on an existing filament. Branch formation requires the Arp2/3 complex, which initiates and anchors branches on existing filaments, and also various ‘nucleation-promoting factors’ (NPFs), which turn on the branching activity of the Arp2/3 complex.</p><p>Two types of NPFs have been identified: type I interact with individual actin molecules, while type II bind to actin filaments. Previous work has shown that type I NPFs—including the N-WASP protein—have a specialized domain called VCA that binds to both the Arp2/3 complex and to actin molecules. VCA brings actin molecules to the branch site, which initiates branch formation, but how N-WASP collaborates with type II NPFs to build branches is not well understood.</p><p>Helgeson and Nolen now examine how a type II NPF called cortactin works with the Arp2/3 complex and N-WASP to construct new branches on actin filaments in vitro. Cortactin appears to displace the VCA domain of N-WASP to stimulate branch formation, and then to remain associated with—and stabilize—the growing branch. Helgeson and Nolen suggest that these NPFs work together to create branches using an “obligatory displacement” model. According to this scheme, N-WASP (or another type I NPF), the Arp2/3 complex and two actin molecules are bound at the site of a future branch on an actin filament, poised for branch formation. However, before more actin molecules can be added, N-WASP must be released, either slowly on its own—as Smith et al. also report in findings published concurrently in <italic>eLife</italic>—or rapidly with the help of cortactin or other type II NPFs.</p><p>Although the rationale for N-WASP removal is not yet understood, type I NPFs are generally attached to the plasma membrane. When N-WASP releases the mother filament, the membrane should no longer be able to block the addition of actin molecules to a growing branch.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00884.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00884.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Arp2/3</kwd><kwd>actin</kwd><kwd>WASP</kwd><kwd>cortactin</kwd><kwd>single molecule</kwd><kwd>N-WASP</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM092917</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Helgeson</surname><given-names>Luke A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Pew Biomedical Scholar Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Helgeson</surname><given-names>Luke A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health Predoctoral Training Grant</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM007759</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Helgeson</surname><given-names>Luke A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Single-molecule TIRF microscopy, biochemical assays and mathematical modeling demonstrate how actin-branch nucleation by the Arp2/3 complex is coordinately regulated by two biochemically distinct activators.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Orchestration of many complex cellular processes, including cellular motility, endocytosis, and cytokinesis, requires tight control of the assembly and disassembly of actin filament networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chhabra and Higgs, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pollard and Cooper, 2009</xref>). <underline>A</underline>ctin-<underline>r</underline>elated <underline>p</underline>rotein (Arp)-2/3 complex is an important actin cytoskeletal regulator that mediates the assembly of branched actin filament networks by nucleating new (daughter) filaments from the sides of pre-existing (mother) filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goley and Welch, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rotty et al., 2013</xref>).

The V and C regions of VCA bind actin monomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kelly et al., 2006</xref>), and CA binds two sites on Arp2/3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Padrick et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ti et al., 2011</xref>). Chemical crosslinking assays demonstrate that one CA site is on Arp3 and the other spans Arp2 and ARPC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Padrick et al., 2011</xref>). Using two CA binding sites, VCA is thought to recruit actin monomers to the Arp2 and Arp3 subunits, stimulating a conformational rearrangement to create an Arp2-Arp3-actin hetero-oligomer that mimics a stable actin filament nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Padrick et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hetrick et al., 2013</xref>). Monomeric vs oligomeric VCA regions activate the complex with distinct kinetics, presumably due to differential engagement of the two sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Padrick et al., 2008</xref>). Oligomerization of WASP/Scar proteins is thought to tune NPF activity in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Padrick et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gohl et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Footer et al., 2008</xref>), so dissecting biochemical differences between monomeric and oligomeric NPFs is an important challenge.</p><p>Cortactin, the prototypical type II NPF, was initially discovered as a Src kinase substrate and actin binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wu and Parsons, 1993</xref>), and was later found to directly bind and activate Arp2/3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Weed et al., 2000</xref>). Cortactin contains an N-terminal acidic region (NtA), which interacts with Arp2/3 complex, 6.5 actin filament binding repeat sequences, and a C-terminal SH3 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Mutations in the NtA that block its interaction with Arp2/3 complex prevent assembly of actin in protrusive structures in transformed cells called invadopodia, and hinder actin-dependent vesicle trafficking required for lamellipodial protrusion and cellular motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bryce et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ayala et al., 2008</xref>). These observations demonstrate that cortactin plays an important role in regulating Arp2/3 complex in vivo, yet the precise mechanism of Arp2/3 complex activation is unclear. Because the actin filament-binding repeats are required for activation, it has been hypothesized that cortactin recruits Arp2/3 complex to filaments to stimulate nucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Uruno et al., 2001</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). However, whether filament recruitment can explain the acceleration of branching nucleation is unknown. In addition, cortactin on its own is a weak activator of Arp2/3 complex in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Weed et al., 2000</xref>), making it uncertain how cortactin can contribute to branching nucleation in vivo.</p><p>Importantly, in the presence of WASP/Scar proteins, cortactin potently activates Arp2/3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Weaver et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Uruno et al., 2001</xref>), suggesting these NPFs synergize to assemble branched actin structures in vivo (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> for schematic). Consistent with this hypothesis, WASP/Scar proteins and cortactin co-localize in many branched networks in vivo, including at the leading edge of motile cells, podosomes and invadopodia, and at sites of endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martinez-Quiles et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">DesMarais et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grassart et al., 2010</xref>). Previous data showed that N-WASP and cortactin compete for binding to Arp3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Weaver et al., 2002</xref>), and cortactin competes more strongly when Arp2/3 complex is bound to filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Uruno et al., 2003</xref>), but the precise mechanism of synergy is unknown<italic>.</italic> Previously proposed models include scenarios in which cortactin recruits Arp2/3 complex to the mother filament, where it cooperates with VCA to activate nucleation or induces release of VCA from branch-incorporated Arp2/3 complex to stabilize the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Weaver et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Uruno et al., 2003</xref>). In another model, VCA becomes sequestered at branch junctions, so the concentration of VCA available to activate Arp2/3 complex limits the rate of branching nucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Siton et al., 2011</xref>). In this model, called the recycling model, cortactin binding displaces VCA from branch junctions, recycling it back into solution for more activation.</p><p>Here we dissect the mechanism of synergy between N-WASP and cortactin. Using single-molecule total internal reflection fluorescence (smTIRF) microscopy along with biochemical assays and mathematical modeling, we show that neither a filament recruitment nor a VCA recycling model can explain synergy. Our data instead support an obligatory displacement model, in which cortactin directly targets nascent branch junctions to accelerate the release of VCA. A key concept of the model is that VCA release is required for nucleation, either with or without cortactin, and the VCA release rate modulates the rate of nucleation. We dissect the biochemical requirements for synergy in cortactin and N-WASP to show that oligomerization of N-WASP VCA is required for significant synergy, but the actin filament binding repeats of cortactin are not. In addition, we provide evidence that slow release of N-WASP at nascent branch junctions limits nucleation rates, and that synergy is dependent on the ability of cortactin to accelerate this step. Our data provide important mechanistic insights into the regulation of Arp2/3 complex by cortactin, and lay the foundation for a molecular understanding of how NPFs work together to regulate branching nucleation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cortactin-mediated synergy follows a hyperbolic activity curve</title><p>Previous experiments showed that cortactin activates Arp2/3 complex weakly on its own, but potently synergizes with WASP/N-WASP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Weed et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Weaver et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Uruno et al., 2001</xref>).

We mimicked the effect of recruitment by simulating an increase in the concentration of actin filaments to saturate Arp2/3 complex side binding. If synergy occurs purely through recruitment, the magnitude of polymerization rate increases caused by adding side-binding sites will be similar to cortactin-induced rate increases. Using k<sub>fil_on</sub> determined from the experimental data with cortactin (1.4 × 10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>, see below, blue line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), we found that increasing side binding sites increased the polymerization rate, but could not account for the dramatic rate increases we observed in experiments containing cortactin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This suggests that filament recruitment cannot account for cortactin-mediated synergy. Because of the uncertainty in k<sub>fil_on</sub>, we repeated the simulations at additional k<sub>fil_on</sub> values. First, we used a k<sub>fil_on</sub> value (6.9 × 10<sup>5</sup> M<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>, purple line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) calculated from the experimentally determined filament off rate of budding yeast Arp2/3 complex (0.625 s<sup>−1</sup>) and the affinity of the bovine complex for filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Smith et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hetrick et al., 2013</xref>). This simulation also failed to account for experimentally observed synergy. However, in a simulation at the minimum threshold on rate (2.7 × 10<sup>3</sup> M<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>, green line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), filament recruitment could fully account for synergy. Therefore, while our best estimates of k<sub>fil_on</sub> suggest that actin filament recruitment cannot explain synergy, k<sub>fil_on</sub> is not determined well enough to completely eliminate the possibility that synergy occurs through recruitment.</p><p>Therefore, we next asked if the actin filament binding repeats of cortactin are required for synergy. We tested a range of concentrations of full-length cortactin and a construct containing only the NtA (residues 1–84) for their ability to synergize with GST-VCA. We found NtA was synergistic with GST-VCA, demonstrating that actin filament binding is not required for synergy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). The concentration dependence of synergy for both constructs followed a hyperbolic trend, and the concentration of NtA required for half-maximal synergy was 11 µM, 110-fold higher than for full-length cortactin. However, at saturation, NtA was as potent as full-length cortactin, increasing the maximum polymerization rate 3.8-fold over GST-VCA-mediated activation of Arp2/3 complex. These data demonstrate that the NtA is sufficient for synergy, but that the actin filament binding repeats allow cortactin to synergize at lower concentrations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The oligomerization state of the type I NPF is an important determinant of synergy</title><p>To probe further the mechanism of synergy, we next asked if biochemical features of the type I NPF influence synergy. Dimerization of VCA is known to increase its binding affinity for Arp2/3 complex, and some evidence suggests WASP/Scar proteins function as oligomers in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Padrick et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gohl et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Footer et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, we compared cortactin-mediated synergy with monomeric vs GST-tagged N-WASP-VCA in a pyrene actin polymerization assay. In previous experiments, GST-VCA behaved similarly to WASP dimerized through physiological SH3-polyproline interactions, so artificial dimerization by GST can mimic in vivo dimerization mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Padrick et al., 2008</xref>). Saturating cortactin enhanced the maximum polymerization rate of a reaction containing GST-VCA 3.7-fold over the rate without cortactin, whereas cortactin weakly influenced a reaction containing monomeric VCA, accelerating the reaction only ∼1.5-fold over VCA alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Increasing the concentration of monomeric VCA did not increase synergy, suggesting the failure to observe potent synergy is not due to under-saturation of two CA binding sites on the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). VCA dimerized with a leucine zipper (LZ-VCA) behaved identically to GST-VCA, demonstrating that the difference in synergy is due to the oligomerization state of the VCA rather than an artifact caused by GST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00884.010</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The oligomerization state of VCA is an important determinant of synergy.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Plot of the fold activation vs cortactin concentration for reactions containing 2 µM 15% pyrene-actin, 20 nM Arp2/3 complex and 250 nM GST-VCA (black), 750 nM VCA (blue), 750 nM VVCA (green), 250 nM Leucine-zipper VCA (LZ-VCA, magenta) or no N-WASP (red).

For instance, if NtA and VCA simultaneously interact with Arp2/3 complex during activation, GST-VCA may be able to recruit two actin monomers while engaging only one NPF binding site, while VCA can only recruit one actin monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Unlike WASP and Scar, native N-WASP contains tandem V regions and may be able to recruit two actin monomers to Arp2/3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rebowski et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, we made a monomeric N-WASP construct with both V regions (VVCA) and tested its ability to synergize with cortactin. We found that VVCA is not synergistic with cortactin at any concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). These data suggest that the ability to recruit two actin monomers to the complex using one NPF binding site is not sufficient for synergy.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Dissociation of N-WASP from branch junctions may limit the rate of branching nucleation</title><p>Dimerization increases the affinity of N-WASP for Arp2/3 complex 180-fold, allowing it to saturate both NPF binding sites on the complex at lower concentrations than monomeric VCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Padrick et al., 2008</xref>). We next explored the importance of the affinity of the type I NPF for Arp2/3 complex in synergy. Based on a number of observations, we hypothesized that type I NPF release is required for nucleation, and that tight binding of the type I NPF can slow the final activation step. First, we observed that at saturation, VCA is a better activator of Arp2/3 complex than GST-VCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Second, recent single-molecule imaging experiments show that WASP dissociates from the branch junctions before elongation of the daughter filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Martin et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Smith et al., 2013</xref>, in press at eLife). Finally, crystal structures show that the V region may block the barbed end of actin monomers, preventing interactions with incoming actin monomers required for elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chereau et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that cortactin synergizes with GST-VCA by displacing it from the nascent branch complex, increasing the rate of the final activation step by accelerating the obligatory release of GST-VCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00884.012</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>VCA affinity for the nascent branch junction is an important determinant of synergy.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Maximum polymerization rates verses (monomer) concentration of N-WASP constructs for reactions containing 20 nM Arp2/3 complex and 2 µM 15% pyrene-actin.

We predicted that in the absence of cortactin, saturating concentrations of this mutant would have a higher maximal polymerization rate, because it would release from the nascent branch junction faster than wild-type GST-VCA. Consistent with this prediction, the maximal polymerization rate at saturation was increased 2.5-fold in the R442A mutant compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The obligatory displacement model predicts that cortactin will be less synergistic with the GST-VCA(R442A) mutant because of its higher intrinsic off rate from the nascent branch complex. Our data are also consistent with this prediction. In the presence of the R442A mutant, cortactin showed approximately twofold less synergy compared to the wild-type GST-VCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). As an additional test of the model, we made a V region mutation, E455R, which we predicted would bind more tightly to actin monomers and the nascent branch junction.

To test this, we visualized single molecules of cortactin with preformed branch junctions. Cortactin added to a TIRF chamber with preformed branches bound to both filament sides and branch junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>). The off rate of cortactin for branch junctions was 0.034 s<sup>−1</sup>, almost twofold slower than the off rate for preformed filament sides measured from the same reaction (0.063 s<sup>−1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Interestingly, 30% of the 270 tracked cortactin molecules were bound to branch junctions even though branches made up only ∼0.13% (68 branch junctions vs ∼53,000 filament side binding sites) of total cortactin binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C,D</xref>). This suggests that cortactin binds with a significantly higher affinity to branch junctions than filament sides. A twofold change in the off rate is unlikely to account for this difference. To determine if cortactin binds to branch junctions with a higher on rate than filament sides, we first measured the affinity of cortactin for branch junctions and filament sides using the single-molecule data. We counted the total number of bound cortactin molecules, branch junctions and side binding sites in each frame and calculated the average fraction of cortactin bound over hundreds of frames. Using the average fraction bound, we determined that the affinity of cortactin for branch junctions is ∼300-fold greater than for filament sides: 17 nM vs 5.2 µM, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Using these equilibrium constants and our previously measured off rates, the calculated on rates of cortactin for branch junctions and filament sides are 2.0 × 10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> and 1.2 × 10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>, respectively. Our data show that cortactin targets branch junctions by binding over two orders of magnitude more tightly to junctions than filament sides. High affinity binding to branch junctions is accomplished through a ∼160-fold increase in the on rate and further amplified by a ∼twofold decrease in the off rate. These data explain how cortactin can specifically target nascent branch junctions to displace N-WASP.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00884.017</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Cortactin directly targets branch junctions with a fast on rate.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) smTIRF microscopy images showing interaction of cortactin with preformed branched networks.

While the accuracy of pre- and post-nucleation lifetime measurements is limited by our ability to resolve newly formed daughter filaments, the data clearly indicate that cortactin stays bound to the junctions long after nucleation.

The recycling displacement model could not fit the data because increasing concentrations of cortactin had no influence on modeled polymerization rates. To determine why, we plotted the concentration of sequestered GST-VCA during the modeled time courses at various concentrations of cortactin. In the absence of cortactin, only 3.8% of the total GST-VCA was sequestered at the end of the reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>). Addition of cortactin reduced the concentration of sequestered GST-VCA, but did not influence the polymerization rate because the free GST-VCA concentration did not limit the rate of the reaction. Therefore, the recycling model cannot account for the synergistic activation of Arp2/3 complex we observe in our assays.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we dissect the mechanism of synergistic activation of Arp2/3 complex by cortactin and N-WASP. Our data support an obligatory displacement model in which cortactin specifically targets nascent branch junctions to displace GST-VCA, thereby accelerating nucleation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). In this model, GST-VCA, two actin monomers and Arp2/3 complex assemble on the side of a filament, creating a nascent branch junction. Cortactin targets the junction, making a multivalent interaction with Arp2/3 complex and the adjacent mother filament. At the nascent branch junction, NtA can compete with CA at the Arp3 binding site on the complex, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Weaver et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Padrick et al., 2008</xref>). Release of one CA speeds release of the GST-VCA, allowing nucleation and elongation to proceed. Importantly, NtA does not block elongation, as we demonstrate by visualizing labeled NtA at nascent branch junctions during nucleation/elongation. Rather, NtA stays engaged with Arp2/3 complex and the repeats stay bound to the mother filament after elongation, allowing cortactin to remain tightly bound to the mature branch junction. Our smTIRF measurements are consistent with immuno-gold-labeled electron micrographs and three-dimensional EM reconstructions that show cortactin remains at the mature branch junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cai et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Egile et al., 2005</xref>). The obligatory displacement model is also consistent with the observation that cortactin competes weakly with GST-VCA in the absence of filaments, but strongly in their presence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Uruno et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>A key aspect of the obligatory displacement model is that GST-VCA must be released before nucleation. Our mutational analyses support this requirement, since a mutation in the V region that decreased its affinity for actin increased the rate of nucleation at saturating GST-VCA, suggesting weakened interactions with the nascent branch junction can increase nucleation rates. Additional evidence comes from recent single-molecule TIRF experiments, which show that VCA release precedes elongation of the daughter filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Martin et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Smith et al., 2013</xref>, in press at eLife). Why release of the type I NPF is programmed into the branching nucleation mechanism, at least in the case of dimerized N-WASP-VCA, is not clear. One possibility is that because WASP/Scar proteins are attached to membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Higgs and Pollard, 2000</xref>), incorporation of the release step into the nucleation mechanism ensures branches are not strongly tethered to the membrane as the growing actin network pushes outward on it<italic>.</italic> In support of this hypothesis, Akin et al. showed that increasing transient connections between bead-immobilized NPFs and nascent branch junctions decreased bead motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akin and Mullins, 2008</xref>). Our data suggest cortactin could stimulate release of a membrane bound NPF from Arp2/3 complex to regulate network-substrate connections, providing an additional mode by which cortactin can control the dynamics of branched actin networks. Recent experiments showed that addition of cortactin to a solution of GST-VCA coated beads increased the bead motility to an extent unlikely to be accounted for simply by an increased nucleation rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Siton et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, cortactin may stimulate branched network dynamics both by increasing nucleation rates and by preventing stalling caused by tight membrane-network attachments.</p><p>A second key aspect of the displacement model is that cortactin must be able to target nascent branch junctions and avoid being non-productively sequestered along filament sides. Our single-molecule experiments revealed the kinetic basis for targeting. Instead of diffusing along filament sides to find branch junctions, cortactin targets branches using a ∼300-fold increased affinity over filament sides. Most of the binding preference arises from an unusually slow on rate (12,100 M<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) of cortactin for filament sides. This on rate is 200–2000-fold slower than for most other actin filament binding proteins, and is unlikely to be diffusion limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kovács et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De La Cruz et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wegner and Ruhnau, 1988</xref>). Binding may be slow because it requires a conformational change in filaments, in agreement with an electron microscopy reconstruction showing that cortactin binding widens the gap between protofilaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pant et al., 2006</xref>). Our mathematical model of obligatory displacement did not include reactions in which cortactin binds filament sides before Arp2/3 complex rather than targeting an existing nascent branch junction. While these pathways can be inserted into the model, we note that in the case of the NtA construct, synergy must occur completely through nascent branch targeting, suggesting nascent branch targeting may be the dominant displacement pathway for the full-length protein. Additional multi-color smTIRF experiments will be required to fully map out the kinetic pathways.</p><p>We showed the actin filament binding repeats of cortactin are not required for synergy, eliminating an actin filament recruitment mechanism. While it is possible that recruitment operates simultaneously with displacement in full-length cortactin, we observed that saturating concentrations of NtA activated nucleation to the same extent as saturating full-length cortactin, so there is no recruitment component of synergy that cannot be mimicked by NtA. The high concentrations of NtA required for saturation likely reflect the decreased affinity of NtA for the nascent branch junction caused by removal of the actin filament binding repeats. Importantly, cortactin can weakly activate Arp2/3 complex on its own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Weed et al., 2000</xref>), and in contrast to synergy, this intrinsic activity requires the filament binding repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Uruno et al., 2001</xref>). Therefore, filament recruitment may explain the weak intrinsic activity of cortactin observed in vitro. Our data are inconsistent with a previously proposed recycling model of synergy, in which cortactin indirectly increases nucleation rates by recycling WASP sequestered at mature branch junctions, freeing it to activate Arp2/3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Siton et al., 2011</xref>). Instead, our data indicate that cortactin directly influences nucleation at nascent branch junctions. These biochemical distinctions will have important implications in understanding the influence of cortactin on the regulation of Arp2/3 complex in vivo.</p><p>In addition to activating Arp2/3 complex, cortactin has been shown to stabilize branch junctions in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Weaver et al., 2001</xref>). The average lifetime of cortactin at branch junctions was 29.2 s, whereas the lifetime of branches has been reported to be between 8 and 27 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Martin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mahaffy and Pollard, 2006</xref>). Given these data, cortactin dissociates from branches much more rapidly than branches disassemble. However, cortactin has a high affinity for junctions (K<sub>D</sub> = 17 nM), so it likely dissociates and rebinds branches many times during the life of a branch, even when present at low (nanomolar) concentrations. Therefore, cortactin dynamically stabilizes branch junctions. This mechanism is consistent with FRAP experiments that show cortactin is incorporated into treadmilling networks not just at the leading edge but also throughout the entire network, and exchanges rapidly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lai et al., 2008</xref>). Importantly, in vivo treadmilling networks turn over on much shorter timescales than in vitro branch lifetimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lai et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Martin et al., 2006</xref>). In cells, the competition of cortactin with branch disassembly factors like GMF, coronin1B, and cofilin may be more important than the intrinsic branch stabilizing activity of cortactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gandhi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cai et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blanchoin et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>The mathematical models we present show how rate constants for filament binding by the complex influence the potential of filament recruitment to contribute to activation. Measuring filament on rates has been technically challenging, and a range of values has been reported. Experiments using pyrenyl-Arp2/3 complex from fission yeast yielded a k<sub>on</sub> of 150 M<sup>−1</sup>s<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beltzner and Pollard, 2008</xref>), while a k<sub>on</sub> value of 3 × 10<sup>3</sup> M<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> was calculated for budding yeast Arp2/3 complex from smTIRF experiments, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Smith et al., 2013</xref>). Our optimized k<sub>on</sub> value for bovine Arp2/3 complex was ∼1 × 10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>−1</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>. Species-specific differences may account for some of the differences in these values, but are unlikely to fully explain them. In single-molecule studies, complications arise from the lack of simple methods to directly measure on rates for filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Van Oijen, 2011</xref>). Off rates can generally be determined directly from the lifetimes of the on state, but difficulties arise from the complexity of interactions of Arp2/3 complex with filaments. For example, budding yeast Arp2/3 complex dissociated from filaments with three distinct off rates, indicating a heterogeneous population of dissociating species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Smith et al., 2013</xref>). Filament binding rate constants are important for not only understanding how Arp2/3 complex works with type I NPFs like WASP/N-WASP, but also how other regulators control Arp2/3 complex activity by mediating its interactions with filaments. The advent of three-color smTIRF experiments will be critical in allowing us to dissect these interactions.</p><p>An important finding of this work is that potent synergy occurs only when the type I NPF is dimerized. We hypothesize that this is because dimerized type I NPFs engage both Arp2/3 complex binding sites to bind tightly to nascent branch junctions, thereby slowing the nucleation step. In our assays, we artificially oligomerized N-WASP, but in vivo, N-WASP can oligomerize by association with scaffolding proteins like Nck or BAR domain proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Padrick et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Suetsugu, 2013</xref>). SCAR/WAVE, another widely expressed type I NPF, has also been shown to oligomerize or cluster on membranes, suggesting it can also act as a higher order oligomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gohl et al., 2010</xref>). These observations suggest the potential for cortactin-mediated synergy to activate Arp2/3 complex in multiple distinct branched networks in vivo. We note that in addition to Arp2/3 complex, cortactin has dozens of other binding partners, including some that influence its ability to regulate branched networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kirkbride et al., 2011</xref>). For instance, cortactin binding to WIP, an actin momomer binding protein, greatly enhances cortactin-mediated activation of Arp2/3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kinley et al., 2003</xref>). In addition, the SH3 of cortactin binds N-WASP to relieve its autoinhibition, providing an indirect mechanism for cortactin to upregulate branching nucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kowalski et al., 2005</xref>). Biochemical dissection of these reactions will allow us to understand precisely how cortactin coordinates branched networks in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein purification and labeling</title><p>GST-tagged mouse cortactin and cortactin NtA (residues 1–84 or 1–48) (gifts from John Cooper) were overexpressed in BL21(DE3)-RIL <italic>E. coli</italic> and purified using glutathione sepharose, Resource Q ion exchange and size exclusion chromatography columns, in that order.

Cover slips were then briefly washed in methanol before incubating for 30 min in a 1% APTES ((3-Aminopropyl)triethoxysilane), 5% acetic acid methanol solution. Aminosilanized cover slips were rinsed with methanol then water and allowed to completely dry. TIRF chambers were assembled by adhering two strips of double-sided tape, separated by 5 mm, along the long axis of an aminosilanized cover slip. A 24 mm wide, 1 mm thick microscope slide was rinsed briefly with ethanol and placed perpendicular across the cover slip such that the middle of the slide and cover slip were aligned. Firm, even pressure was applied to the slide to secure it to the cover slip tape. The resulting assembly contains a 5 mm × 24 mm × 0.1 mm (tape height) reaction chamber with openings on two sides for reaction solution addition and exchange. Solution exchange was performed by using Whatman paper to wick out the chamber solution from one end resulting in the uptake of the new solution into the chamber, from the opposite end.</p><p>TIRF reaction chambers were then treated with biotinylated-PEG to create a low binding surface to which actin filaments could be tethered through streptavadin and biotinylated-myosin.

Single cortactin molecules were identified in each 561-channel image using thresholding image segmentation after removal of noise using a band pass filter. Single-molecule trajectories were created by identifying and linking identical molecules between frames using a nearest neighbor algorithm. An assembled trajectory represents a single-molecule and contains a preliminary frame-based lifetime. All identified molecules were filtered based on the following criteria: Molecule cannot be present in the first or last frame of the image acquisition period, molecule cannot have a lifetime of 1 frame, molecule average intensity must be within a standard deviation of the overall molecular average intensity and the molecule must be associated with an actin filament based on filament identification statistics performed on the corresponding 488-channel images. The molecules that passed the filter were manually tracked to verify the initially determined frame lifetime and to identify the binding class (filament side, branch junction, nascent branch). We identified branches manually by visually inspecting videos. Potential branches were examined in multiple frames to verify that they were not overlapping linear actin filaments. Lifetimes were converted from frames to seconds based on calculated frame rates from image time stamps, and binned into 5 s intervals. The cumulative frequency across all bins was calculated and a plot of 1- cumulative frequency vs lifetime (bin) was fit with a single-exponential decay equation to determine the average off rate from which the average lifetime is the reciprocal.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Single-molecule affinity determination</title><p>Single-molecules of cortactin were identified (see above) and classified into filament side or branch junction binding from 1000 randomly chosen frames of the preformed branch network image acquisition.

Number of filament binding sites was calculated for each frame at equilibrium (829 frames) by a custom image processing script run in Matlab, described as follows. For each frame, pixels corresponding to filament fluorescence were identified using image segmentation followed by morphological area opening to remove non-filamentous small fluorescent objects. Pixels corresponding to branch junctions (5 pixels per junction) were subtracted from the total number of pixels and this new number of pixels was divided by 3 (average filament width in pixels) to remove pixels corresponding to the PSF of the filament fluorescence. The final pixel number value was converted to micrometers (1 px = 106.7 nm) to yield the total length of actin filaments in the image frame, and further converted to number of subunits using 370 subunits µm<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kuhn and Pollard, 2005</xref>). A 4% error in total filament length was found between using the above algorithm and manual filament tracing on a small subsection of filaments; therefore, the described length calculation algorithm works well for the extensive length measurements needed. The total number of cortactin filament side binding sites was calculated by assuming a cortactin to F-actin subunit stoichiometry of 1:6. The total number of branch junctions was visually counted in each frame. For each frame, the fraction bound of actin for each binding group was calculated by dividing the total number of counted molecules by the total number of binding sites.

The average number of cortactin molecules bound to junctions or filaments sides per image frame was 20. Because unbound actin filaments were washed out of the chamber, all binding events occurred on the surface, so this number allows us to account for all actin-bound cortactin molecules in the chamber. Using the chamber-to-image ratio (2.48 × 10<sup>−5</sup>), this gives an average number of cortactin molecules bound per chamber of 8.06 × 10<sup>5</sup>. In the reaction chamber there are 1.08 × 10<sup>10</sup> cortactin molecules (12 µl of 1.5 nM cortactin) indicating that on average 0.0075% (8.06 × 10<sup>5</sup>/1.08 × 10<sup>10</sup>) of the total cortactin molecules are bound to actin, therefore the free cortactin concentration is essentially equal to its total concentration.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Mathematical modeling of Arp2/3 complex nucleation by GST-VCA activation with and without cortactin</title><p>To limit the number of floating parameters in our kinetic models, we ran four sets of pyrene actin polymerization assays, and fit each set to an independent model with a limited number of floating variables (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>).

We modeled the Arp2/3 complex activating nucleation step (k<sub>nuc</sub>) by converting the nascent branch junction of two actin monomers bound to GST-VCA bound to Arp2/3 complex at a filament side to a barbed end which subsequently elongated at 11.6 × 10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pollard, 1986</xref>). Pointed end elongation was not included in our simulations, because the actin monomer concentration is low and Arp2/3 complex-mediated nucleation does not create free pointed ends. We assumed GST-VCA dissociates from the branch junction during nucleation (k<sub>nuc</sub>), except in the recycling model (see main text and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). For simplicity, the k<sub>on</sub> of Arp2/3 complex for the sides of filaments was assumed to be unaffected by GST-VCA or GST-VCA and actin monomer binding. For reactions with cortactin, the stoichiometry of cortactin:F-actin subunits was set to 1:6. Rate constants for cortactin binding to filament sides and branch junctions were determined from the single-molecules studies.</p><p>Mathematical modeling of pyrene-actin polymerization time courses was performed using COPASI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hoops et al., 2006</xref>). Fluorescence values were converted to actin filament concentrations by assuming 0.1 µM actin was unpolymerized at equilibrium. Optimization of parameters was carried out by simultaneously fitting all traces from a reaction set, using the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm method in the parameter estimation module. To simulate the influence of actin filament recruitment by cortactin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), we increased the initial concentration of actin filament sides but not ends.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Bruce Bowerman and Chris Doe for use of their microscope, Raghuveer Parthasarathy for the particle tracking script, and members of the BJN laboratory for helpful discussions.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom, Wesley Sundquist, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The authors present experiments and simulations aimed at explaining the mechanism by which cortactin (and its minimal NtA domain) synergizes with WASP (and its minimal VCA activation region) to stimulate actin branching. They conclude that displacement of dimeric WASP(VCA) is limiting for branch formation, and that cortactin accelerates the branching reaction primarily by displacing WASP(VCA). In support of this model, they show that: 1) actin filament recruitment cannot account for cortactin activity. Here, the strongest experiment is the demonstration that actin filament binding activity is not required for maximal cortactin stimulation because the minimal NtA domain (which lacks the actin filament binding repeats) stimulates to the same extent, at saturation, as full length cortactin; 2) VCA dimerization is required for cortactin stimulation and, nicely, mutations that alter the rate of N-WASP dissociation alter actin polymerization (and the degree of cortactin stimulation) as predicted by the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>); 3) cortactin binds preferentially to branch sites because it associates much faster onto branch sites than onto the sides of actin filaments, and also dissociates a bit slower (direct visualization/binding studies, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5">Figures 4 and 5</xref>), and can remain there as the actin filament nucleates and elongates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, lifetime measurements); and 4) simulations reveal that data for GST-VCA and cortactin co-stimulation of actin polymerization can be explained by a displacement model, but not by a VCA recycling vs sequestration model (because GST-VCA binding does not significantly deplete the pool of free GST-VCA).</p><p>This is generally a very nice study that addresses an important problem in actin biology – that is, how different actin nucleating factors act together to regulate actin assembly. Overall the conclusions are well supported by the data presented.</p><p>No additional experiments are absolutely required, but the authors need to discuss the following issues more explicitly:</p><p>1) Why cortactin synergizes with dimeric VCA but not monomeric VCA. The authors argue that the difference between dimeric vs monomeric VCA data is that the off rate of monomeric VCA is sufficiently high that cortactin, at the concentrations explored, does not play a role in displacing it. Does the apparent lack of synergy for monomeric VCA depend on VCA concentration or on Arp2/3 concentration? It might also be useful to extend the study to explore a broader range of concentrations. More importantly, the dimeric VCA formed with GST may have an artificially low off rate from the branch junction compared to two monomeric VCAs on a branch junction, making the observed ‘displacement’ relevant to the dimeric VCA construct but not relevant in vivo. The increased activation by monomeric VCA at saturation compared to dimeric VCA underscores this issue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Can the authors address this concern?</p><p>2) The role of the filament binding domain of cortactin in targeting branch junctions would benefit from further clarification. How does the on rate and off rate of NtA at branch junctions (imaged in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) compare with full-length cortactin rates presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>?</p><p>3) The study would also benefit from some discussion of how nucleotide state of the filament affects cortactin binding to branch junctions.</p><p>4) Finally, the authors should exert some effort to make their paper, particularly the Introduction, more accessible to the general readers of <italic>eLife</italic>. The authors are urged to extend their reach to an audience outside the actin polymerization field. (i) Consider providing an introductory set of schematic diagrams at the very beginning that brings together parts of the schematics scattered throughout the figures so that the reader is introduced to the players and can better understand what the issues are, when reading the Introduction. (ii) Consider reducing the extent to which three letter acronyms are used – this makes the paper rather impenetrable to the outsider. For example, why not spell out nucleation promoting factor rather than resorting to the opaque “NPF”? (iii) Explain the conceptual problem that is being addressed in way that can be better understood by outsiders. For example, in the very last part of the Introduction, two prior models are described, the second of which is that the role of cortactin is to “stabilize the nucleus or recycle VCA back into solution”. The authors then go on to say that they have a different model, referred to as a “displacement” model. It is not clear what the distinction is, at least when reading the Introduction.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00884.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Why cortactin synergizes with dimeric VCA but not monomeric VCA.

It might also be useful to extend the study to explore a broader range of concentrations</italic>.</p><p>Synergy between monomeric VCA and cortactin is consistently weak over a range of concentrations of monomeric VCA. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> shows that the increase in the maximum polymerization rate of reactions with either 150 or 750 nM monomeric VCA at saturating cortactin is 1.5 fold, compared to 3.7x for dimeric VCAs. These concentrations of monomeric VCA were chosen based on the concentration dependence plots shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, with one sub-saturating concentration (150 nM) and one concentration at which the reaction is saturated with monomeric VCA (750 nM). In a separate set of experiments, we titrated 500 nM cortactin and 20 nM Arp2/3 complex with monomeric VCA, and showed that the fold activation (synergy) is consistently ∼1.5x at monomeric VCA concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 4.0 μM. We included this new data as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and added text to the Results section (starting “Saturating corcactic enhanced the maximum polymerization rate of a reaction…”).</p><p>We have not tested synergy over a broad range of Arp2/3 complex concentrations. By keeping the Arp2/3 complex concentrations low in our assays, we avoid having to account for a small amount of direct activation of the complex by cortactin, which could complicate the analysis.</p><p><italic>More importantly, the dimeric VCA formed with GST may have an artificially low off rate from the branch junction compared to two monomeric VCAs on a branch junction, making the observed ‘displacement’ relevant to the dimeric VCA construct but not relevant in vivo. The increased activation by monomeric VCA at saturation compared to dimeric VCA underscores this issue (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3C</italic></xref><italic>). Can the authors address this concern</italic>?</p><p>We predict the off rate of any dimeric VCA from the nascent branch will be slowed compared to monomeric VCAs because the dimers can make multivalent interactions with the complex. In support of this, we showed that VCA dimerized by a leucine zipper shows the same magnitude of synergy with cortactin as GST-VCA. While the leucine zipper and GST are artificial dimerizers, a number of SH3 domain-containing proteins can bind the polyproline stretches in WASP/Scar family proteins to create oligomers which activate Arp2/3 complex similarly to GST-VCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Padrick et al., 2008</xref>). We are currently generating reagents to test whether WASP dimerized in this more physiologically relevant manner shows the same potency in synergy as GST-VCA, but we have no reason to think it will not. One possibility is that the length of the linker between the V region and the dimerization domain could influence synergy. In our GST-VCA construct, the linker between GST and V is 16 amino acids long, similar to the distance between the polyproline stretch and the first V in full-length N-WASP (∼16 amino acids) and the V in WASP (∼13 amino acids), or Scar/WAVE (∼22 amino acids). The linker is longer in our LZ-VCA construct (27 amino acids), which behaves identically to GST-VCA. Together these observations suggest the behavior of the dimers is consistent within the range of linker lengths we expect for physiological dimers.</p><p>Because GST-dimerized VCA behaves similarly to VCA dimerized through more physiological mechanisms, we think the decreased activity of GST-VCA compared at saturation to monomeric VCA will be relevant in vivo. To our knowledge, there are few experiments that directly address the oligomerization state of these NPFs in a cell during Arp2/3 complex-dependent actin assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gohl et al., 2010</xref>). However, given the biochemical data it seems likely that many of these actin assembly processes depend on dimerization or higher order oligomerization of the NPF. Therefore the activity profile of GST-VCA in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> (and its associated kinetic parameters) may be equally (or more) relevant in dissecting the kinetics of branched network assembly in cells than kinetic parameters for monomeric VCA.</p><p>We expanded the Results section to clarify this issue (sentences starting “Therefore, we compared cortactin-mediated synergy…”).</p><p><italic>2) The role of the filament-binding domain of cortactin in targeting branch junctions would benefit from further clarification. How does the on rate and off rate of NtA at branch junctions (imaged in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6</italic></xref><italic>) compare with full-length cortactin rates presented in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref>?</p><p>Unfortunately, we did not observe enough NtA binding events to calculate the binding rate constants. This is due to the weaker affinity of NtA for the branch junctions compared to full-length cortactin and an upper threshold on the concentration of labeled NtA we could use in the reaction.</p><p><italic>3) The study would also benefit from some discussion of how nucleotide state of the filament affects cortactin binding to branch junctions</italic>.</p><p>We analyzed the ages of actin filament segments in movies of cortactin binding to both preformed and actively assembling branches (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref> versus <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref>, respectively). In the movies with preformed branches, most actin subunits within the filament segments are bound to ADP, whereas in the actively branching movies, most actin subunits are ADP-Pi bound. Despite this difference, the average lifetime of cortactin bound at branch junctions was the same in two sets of movies (∼29 s). Therefore, we don’t think that the nucleotide state of the filament, at least comparing ADP to ADP-Pi bound actin, has a significant influence on cortactin binding to branch junctions.</p><p><italic>4) Finally, the authors should exert some effort to make their paper, particularly the introduction, more accessible to the general readers of</italic> eLife<italic>.

We added a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) with three panels. The first panel, (A), shows an overview of the branching nucleation reaction, emphasizing what is required for the reaction and illustrating the resultant Y-shaped branches. The second panel, (B), shows the domain organization of N-WASP, WASP and cortactin. The third panel, (C), shows an overview of activation of Arp2/3 complex by Type I and Type II NPFs alone or in synergy, emphasizing the interactions and issues that are addressed in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>(ii) Consider reducing the extent to which three letter acronyms are used – this makes the paper rather impenetrable to the outsider.

In addition, we changed the name of our model from “displacement” to “obligatory displacement” to clearly distinguish it from other models. We also revised the Introduction (sentences starting “Previously proposed models include scenarios…”).</p></body></sub-article></article>
