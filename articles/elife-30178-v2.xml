Asymmetrically modified nucleosomes exist in multiple cell types, but whether modifications on both sister histones contribute equally to chromatin dynamics remains elusive. Here, we devised a bivalent nucleosome system that allowed for the constitutive assembly of asymmetrically modified sister histone H3s in nucleosomes in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. The sister H3K36 methylations independently affected cryptic transcription in gene coding regions, whereas sister H3K79 methylation had cooperative effects on gene silencing near telomeres. H3K4 methylation on sister histones played an independent role in suppressing the recruitment of Gal4 activator to the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter and in inhibiting <italic>GAL1</italic> transcription. Under starvation stress, sister H3K4 methylations acted cooperatively, independently or redundantly to regulate transcription. Thus, we provide a unique tool for comparing symmetrical and asymmetrical modifications of sister histone H3s in vivo.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30178.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Inside each human cell, about two meters of DNA is wrapped around millions of proteins called histones, forming structures known as nucleosomes. Each nucleosome contains 147 letters of DNA code and two copies of four different histones – H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 – meaning eight proteins in total.</p><p>The two copies of each histone protein found in a nucleosome are referred to as “sister” histones and are identical. Histone proteins have long tails that the cell can edit by adding chemical groups at specific positions. This changes the way the cell copies, uses and repairs its DNA. Previous studies show that identical sister histones can end up with different modifications. But, it was not clear what effect this had.</p><p>To adress this issue, there are two questions to answer. What do asymmetric sister histones do in living cells? And, does a modification to one histone affect its sister? Gene editing could help scientists to understand the effect of asymmetrical tail modification by forcing cells to make non-identical sister histones. However, this is challenging because most animals studied in the laboratory have many copies of the genes for histones. Fruit flies, for example, have 23 copies of their histone genes. The single-celled yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> has only two copies of its histone genes. Yet, even if one of these genes was replaced with a mutant gene and the other left unedited or “wild-type”, there would be nothing to stop the cell from forming nucleosomes in which both sister histones were still identical – that is to say, mutant with mutant or wild-type with wild-type.</p><p>Now, Zhou, Liu et al. report a new method that allowed them to edit the tail sequence of one H3 histone but not its sister. First, they searched for, and found, a pair of mutant H3 genes, which encode two extremely similar but different H3 proteins that could bind to each other but not to themselves. As a result, yeast cells with the genes for these proteins could only form nucleosomes in which the sister H3 histones were non-identical. Next, Zhou et al. made a small change to the tail of one of the H3 sisters which meant it could not be modified. The resulting nucleosomes contain one H3 histone with a wild-type tail and one with a mutant tail. The cell could only modify one of them, mimicking natural asymmetrical modifications.</p><p>The new technique revealed that modification of one sister does not affect the the other. It also revealed that modifications to sister histones can work both alone and together. In some cases, the cell needs only edit one tail to affect the use of a gene. Other times, it must edit both tails for greatest effect.</p><p>This new tool is the first step in understanding the contribution of the tails of sister histones in living cells. In future, it should help to uncover the effect of different combinations of modifications. This could shed light on how cells control the use of different genes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sister histones</kwd><kwd>histone H3 methylation</kwd><kwd>histone crosstalks</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31521061</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Jin-Qiu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31230040</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Jin-Qiu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016YFA0500701</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Jin-Qiu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A yeast genetic model for studying the function of sister histones in chromatin dynamics.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In eukaryotes, chromatin carries both genetic and epigenetic information that controls multiple cellular processes, such as DNA replication, transcription and genome organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berger, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lawrence et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Papamichos-Chronakis and Peterson, 2013</xref>). The basic unit of chromatin is the nucleosome, which comprises ~147 bp of DNA and a histone octamer formed by two copies of histone H2A-H2B and H3-H4 heterodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bentley et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kornberg and Thomas, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Luger et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Oudet et al., 1975</xref>). The packaging of DNA into nucleosomes affects sequence accessibility, and nucleosomes therefore regulate the activity of DNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wasylyk and Chambon, 1979</xref>). Histones also appear to protect DNA from breaking and maintain the fidelity of both replication and transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carrozza et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Govind et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Joshi and Struhl, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Keogh et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pinskaya et al., 2009</xref>). The regulation of nucleic acid metabolism by nucleosomes is mediated through multiple post-translational modifications (PTMs), such as methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, and sumoylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lawrence et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Histone lysine methylation, especially on histone H3, regulates chromatin structure and transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ng et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vermeulen and Timmers, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wagner and Carpenter, 2012</xref>). In budding yeast, the best-studied methylations on histone H3 are methylation of lysine at amino acid positions 4, 36, and 79 (H3K4, H3K36 and H3K79, respectively). H3K4 di- and tri-methylation (H3K4me2/3) is catalyzed by the Set1 complex (also called the COMPASS complex) and is associated with steady-state gene transcription; thus, H3K4me2/3 is considered to be an ‘activating’ mark in mammals. Conversely, in budding yeast, most of the evidence indicates that H3K4 methylation is a repressive mark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shilatifard, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Weiner et al., 2012</xref>). H3K36 tri-methylation (H3K36me3) by Set2 directs the deacetylation of histones, predominantly at the 3’ portion of gene open reading frames (ORFs), to suppress spurious intragenic transcription initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carrozza et al., 2005</xref>). Methylation of H3K79 (H3K79me) affects telomeric heterochromatin structure because mutations at H3K79 as well as inactivation of its methyltransferase, Dot1, lead to loss of telomere silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jones et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ng et al., 2002</xref>). The functions of each modification are largely dissected by using histone mutations in combination with the inactivation of corresponding methyltransferases, under which circumstances the modifications on both sister histones are simultaneously removed, making it difficult to study the crosstalk between modifications on sister histones.</p><p>Although two copies of each histone in a nucleosome possess identical protein sequences, histone-modification enzymes do not always modify sister histones simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">van Rossum et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Voigt et al., 2013</xref>). For example, symmetrical modification of histone lysines within a nucleosome is not globally required in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, in different cell types, a significant number of nucleosomes contain asymmetrically modified sister histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fisher and Fisher, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mikkelsen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Voigt et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, asymmetrically modified nucleosomes are present in embryonic stem cells but are symmetrically modified upon differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Voigt et al., 2012</xref>). Each of these studies suggests that sister histones within a single nucleosome may function independently in gene regulation. A synthetic system for the generation of asymmetrically modified nucleosomes has been used to study histone PTM crosstalk in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lechner et al., 2016</xref>), but the lack of a genetic model system for studying asymmetric histone modifications in vivo has prevented exploration of the biological significance of this previously documented phenomenon.</p><p>To investigate the individual contributions of sister histones and their modifications to chromatin structure and function, we employed a protein engineering strategy to mutate both copies of histone H3 in their interaction interface. After screening for mutants that were able to form histone H3 heterodimers but not H3 homodimers, we successfully set up a bivalent nucleosome system in the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. By using this unique system, we validated the establishment of asymmetrically methylated H3K4, H3K36 or K3K79 in chromatin in yeast in vivo. Furthermore, we examined the functions of asymmetrically modified sister histones in the regulation of chromatin structure and gene transcription. Our results revealed that modifications such as H3K4me, H3K36me or K3K79me on sister histone H3s could be independent of each other. In addition, the same modifications on both sister H3 histones can affect transcription in a cooperative, independent or redundant manner. Our study provides the first picture of the individual contributions of sister histones to chromatin dynamics in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A bivalent nucleosome system to study sister histone H3s in yeast</title><p>In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, each canonical histone is encoded by two genes. H3 is encoded by <italic>HHT1</italic> and <italic>HHT2</italic>, and H4 is encoded by <italic>HHF1</italic> and <italic>HHF2</italic>.

As asymmetrical modifications have previously been reported on histone H3 in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Voigt et al., 2012</xref>), we began by examining H3. Previous structural work revealed that two molecules of histone H3 interact through their carboxy-terminal four-helix bundle to form a homodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Luger et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ramachandran et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">White et al., 2001</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We performed site-directed mutagenesis on the Ala110, Ala114 and Leu130 residues of the <italic>HHT1</italic> gene. These residues were chosen because they were spatially close and within the bundle region that interacts to form the H3 homodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Luger et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ramachandran et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">White et al., 2001</xref>). These neutral amino acids were mutated to acidic or basic residues to make them electronegative or electropositive under physiological conditions. We reasoned that if we created an H3 allele with an electronegative (or electropositive) interface, it would not form homodimers, but it would interact with a different H3 allele with an electropositive (or electronegative) interface, thereby creating a heterodimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30178.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The complementary mutants of histone H3A110D and H3L130H are assembled into nucleosomes in vivo.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic illustration of the production of histone H3 mutants that are able to complement and form heterodimers.

However, similar to post-translational chemical modifications on any protein, the modifications of histones provide an additional layer of chromatin regulation. Paradoxically, sister histones with either asymmetrical modification or coexistence of activation and repression marks have been found in different cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fisher and Fisher, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mikkelsen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Voigt et al., 2012</xref>), raising the possibility that sister histones in a single nucleosome may function independently. In this study, we took advantage of a yeast system that allows for facile genetic manipulation of histones. We identified H3 mutations that prevented homodimer formation and allowed heterodimer formation. After a series of intentional and systematic screenings, we established a bivalent nucleosome system that enabled us to express and monitor sister histone H3s independently in vivo. Owing to the nature of the nucleosome, which is the basic unit structure of chromatin, any possible indirect effect(s) caused by knocking-in a histone mutation cannot be fully excluded from our analysis. Indeed compared with the parental strain, the H3<sup>D</sup>/H3<sup>H</sup> strain did display some minor differences in carbon source preference and nucleosome positioning (e.g., the <italic>GAL1</italic> locus) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,E</xref>). In addition, when a mutation was introduced into one of the sister histone H3s, only half of the H3 could be modified. Therefore, the global level of modified H3 had a maximum value of 50% of the maximum in a normal cell. Discriminating between the biological consequences caused by forced asymmetrical modification and a forced decrease in total modification is difficult. Nevertheless, we have provided biochemical and functional evidence indicating that this unique genetic system is useful for studying asymmetrical modifications on sister histones.</p><p>Using this system, we found that histone H3K4 methylation on one tail is independent of the other tail on the sister H3 histone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), suggesting that Set1C binds and modifies one tail in a <italic>cis</italic> fashion. Consistently, mutation of K4R in one of the sister H3s did not affect the methylation of K4 on the other tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

The results of our genetic models are consistent with a previous observation that sister histones are not always modified in the same manner simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Asymmetrically modified nucleosomes exist on chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fisher and Fisher, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mikkelsen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Voigt et al., 2012</xref>), but whether these asymmetrical modifications on sister histones function in manner similar to or different from that of symmetrical modifications remains largely unknown. In our study, we observed that K79me on both sister H3 histones was required for silencing telomere-proximal genes through regulation of the acetylation level of histone H4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), establishing a cooperative role for both sister histones in vivo. This mode of regulation was also seen for the genes in the I∩<italic>set1</italic>∆ group when the cells were challenged with glucose starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Different from K79me, H3K36me3 on two sister histone H3s did not appear to have a synergistic effect but rather had an additive effect on suppressing spurious transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), indicating that two K36me3 marks on sister histone H3s altered chromatin structure independently. The same additive effect was observed in the genes grouped in II∩<italic>set1</italic>∆ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>), as well as in <italic>GAL1</italic> transcription levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). In addition, K4me marks on sister histone H3s redundantly affected the transcription of the genes grouped in III∩<italic>set1</italic>∆ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Consistent with our observations in transcription, sister H3K4me exhibited different regulatory modes in response to various DNA-damage reagents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Thus, our data indicate that modifications on sister histones could employ a cooperative, independent, or redundant mode of regulation of chromatin-associated processes. However, why the genes in different loci are subjected to different regulatory mechanisms remains unclear. One possibility is that different gene loci are targeted by different readers, such as activators and repressors that sense the magnitude of H3K4me differently during transcription. This hypothesis is supported by the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and G</xref> showing that differential marks of K4me3 on two sister histone H3s affected the enrichment of Gal4-activator binding to the <italic>GAL1</italic> gene promoter, thereby fine-tuning the transcription of <italic>GAL1</italic>. The chromatin readers for different genomic loci have not yet been well characterized, so providing a mechanistic explanation for the different performances of sister histone modifications in every case is difficult.</p><p>Histones and their modifications are unique to eukaryotes, and they are important in the packaging of DNA into chromatin. From an evolutionary point of view, it may be that the possesion of two identical copies of each histone in the chromatin in eukaryotes rather than one copy is a sporadic outcome of natural selection. Previous high-throughput analysis showed that epigenetic regulation in the form of histone modification plays a far more pronounced role during gene induction/repression than during steady-state expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Weiner et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting the involvement of histone modifications in regulation of gene expression in response to changing environmental cues. In this study, we imposed glucose starvation on yeast cells to mimic an environmental cue. In response, the additive effect of H3K4me on gene transcription was recapitulated in the groups of genes that are enriched in pathways related to glycometabolism, such as carbon metabolism, TCA cycle, and fructose and mannose metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). These observations support the notion that in order to adapt to environmental stress, sister histones execute their fine-tuning regulation by differential modifications.</p><p>In conclusion, this study provides new insights into how sister histones regulate the plasticity of chromatin structure, as well as gene transcription, and how epigenetic regulation evolves to address variable environmental cues. Given that combinatorial manipulations of sister histone H3 tails have encountered technical challenges in other model systems, the bivalent nucleosome system that we created in this study will be instrumental in further uncovering the role that combinatorial histone H3 modification crosstalk plays in regulating gene expression. In addition, our system for the genetic manipulation of sister histone H3s could be extended to an asymmetry study of sister histone H4s, which have N-terminal tail acetylations representing important epigenetic marks in various biological processes. Moreover, the genetic system that we created will be useful in examining the role that sister histones play in other biological processes, such as DNA repair and recombination, chromatin replication and heterochromatin assembly. Finally, since the protein sequences of histone H3s are highly conserved during evolution, it will be appealing to apply the same scheme to construct a bivalent nucleosome system in other model systems. However, the challenge might be much greater in higher eukaryotes because the copy numbers of histone genes in these organisms are much higher than those in yeast.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains, antibodies and growth conditions</title><p>All yeast strains used in this study were derived from yeast strain YPH500 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sikorski and Hieter, 1989</xref>).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Modifications on both sister histone H3s coordinate to regulate chromatin structure and transcription&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Timothy Formosa is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission</p><p>The authors describe the development and validation of a novel tool for investigating the physiological role of symmetrical modifications of &quot;sister&quot; histone H3 molecules within a given nucleosome in yeast. This system has high potential to probe a set of longstanding questions in this field and the initial results presented here already make a significant contribution. Overall, both the system and the results presented are likely to be of interest to a broad community of chromatin researchers. However, substantial issues need to be resolved prior to publication of the work, and some additional experiments would provide additional support for key conclusions that are currently too preliminary.</p><p>Requires further experiments:</p><p>1) The authors need to validate more loci; single examples are not sufficient.</p><p>The interpretation of the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D-F</xref> is limited due to its examination of a single locus. Similarly, it is premature to conclude from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> that there are telomeric silencing defects when only a single locus was assessed. The data as presented would also be consistent with promoter-specific effects of the K79 mutations, so analysis of additional loci is required to support the claims put forth. Ideally, a global analysis would be used to obtain the clearest picture, but it should be sufficient to test three independent loci in each case to validate these conclusions.</p><p>2) Further genetic analysis of strains would strongly enhance the manuscript.</p><p>The authors use screens of plate phenotypes to establish the health of the obligate dimer strain, but one of the potentially most interesting aspects of this study would be to examine the asymmetrical modification strains for these same phenotypes, and this is not included here. It would be very helpful to know how some of the mutations affect phenotypes that reveal changes in gene expression, DNA damage sensitivity, and other features known to be altered by histone modifications. Including this data would increase the impact of the manuscript significantly. Further, as currently presented, the plate phenotypes are difficult to interpret due to the limited growth observed under many conditions even with &quot;WT&quot; cells. Ideally, similar growth rates would be demonstrated by providing growth curves for some crucial conditions, but at the very least the incubation times for the plate assays should be extended, and examination of responses to other challenges such as the Spt- phenotype, caffeine sensitivity, 6AU, rapamycin, synthetic media, raffinose, and galactose should be considered. Given previous results with mutations affecting histone modifications, the Spt- phenotype seems like it would be a very sensitive test of chromatin status, but this requires the use of a strain with a suitable reporter. Screens for some additional phenotypes and better documentation of the plate effected are considered necessary, while examining the effects on reporters like the Spt- phenotype would be strongly encouraged but not required.</p><p>3) Additional separation of H3K4 methylation states and more accurate and complete discussion of results.</p><p>The experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> were set up in the text as a dissection of the effects of different methylation states of H3K4, but the results are not analyzed this way. For example, in panel H, if loss of H3K4 methylation leads to activation of the GAL genes, then why does loss of Set1 not show the increase in transcription? Should it not be epistatic with the K4R/K4R strain? There was no explanation for this finding, and the Results section did not adequately address this. Also, Rad6 is an inappropriate mutant to use in this case since it also abolishes H2BK123ub1. There are other mutants that can be used to separate H3K4me states. Further, the fold inductions in panel 4H in the spp1 and rad6 mutants are greater than in the wild-type background (panel 4E), and all induction is lost in the set1 mutant cells. These data are consistent with a model in which H3K4 mono-methylation is required for the induction, but that trimethylation is inhibitory.

However, there are substantial differences evident between the wild-type and D-H cells. Most notably, the array of nucleosomes on the GAL1 side of the hypersensitive region produces a much more evenly digested pattern, suggesting altered nucleosome stability, at least in this region, making it an overstatement to claim that there are no structural changes in chromatin resulting from the histone mutations. Further, it is unclear why part of the promoter is labeled as a &quot;hypersensitive region&quot; as this region instead appears refractory to MNase; is the hypersensitivity for DNase I? An additional control using naked DNA would clarify the results shown.</p><p>10) The severe growth defect of the delta21-D/delta21-H strain also suggests that the dimerization mutants cause chromatin changes, as deleting the H3 N-termini in otherwise normal strains does not cause this growth defect (e.g. Mann and Grunstein, 1992). The authors should therefore indicate that the D-H mutations cause some changes in chromatin, necessitating that all comparisons must be between D-H cells with wild-type modifiable residues and D-H cells with histone mutations. Along these lines, the authors need to clearly specify which strains are used as controls in each experiment, as &quot;WT&quot; could mean several things, and must be explicit that valid comparisons between appropriately matched controls are being made in every case.</p><p>11) The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> are presented as validation that gene expression is not affected by the D-H mutations, but outliers are visible. It would be useful to describe some of them and give statistics for the sample-to-sample reproducibility for a WT strain to give the reader context for understanding how similar the profiles actually are.</p><p>12) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> should be analyzed to provide the ratio of H3K4me3 signals comparing the delta21 and the H-D strains.</p><p>13) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> is lacking H3DK4R/H3HK4R, and 4G is lacking H3D/H3HK4R.

For example, in a strain in which only half of the H3 can be modified, the global level of modified H3 now has a maximum value of 50% of the maximum in a normal cell. How can one discriminate between effects due to forced asymmetrical modification and forced decrease in total modification? It is difficult to imagine addressing this experimentally, but the issue should be discussed.</p><p>16) Better explanation of the strains used is needed. As noted above, the use of the term &quot;WT&quot; requires explanation in each case. For example, it seems likely that Myc-tagging the H3 protein would have a physiological effect, but no strain with Myc-HHT1 is listed for use as a control for the Myc-tagged heterodimeric nucleosome strains. Is the WT strain the histone shuffle strain? Why is the ADE3 promoter used to drive the Myc-HHT1? Is this a single Myc repeat? It is difficult to determine whether appropriate comparisons are being made without explicit statement of which strains are used in each experiment with a unique name that identifies the strain being described in the strain list provided.</p><p>17) Further explanation of the nucleosome purification would be helpful.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>. The DNA fragments look bigger than mononucleosomes; is there other evidence that they are mononucleosomes?</p><p>18) The authors refer to the analysis of the δ-21 mutation as &quot;clipping&quot;. The term &quot;clipping&quot; is usually used to refer to the natural process of proteolytic tail cleavage, which is induced during sporulation or starvation (Santos-Rosa et al., 2009). In contrast, here the authors are analyzing an engineered gene deletion and are not analyzing cells grown under conditions inducing proteolysis. Therefore, this figure should be titled &quot;Examination of an asymmetric deletion in the N-terminus of histone H3&quot;. Furthermore, some of the discussion of this result perpetuates this confusion (subsection “The N-terminal clipping on one of the sister histone H3 tails does not affect the other tail”): &quot;the H3 N-terminal clipping on one of the sister H3s will not influence the clipping on the other one, in other words the endopeptidase activity of cleavage is not affected by losing one of the sister H3 tails.&quot; This experiment doesn't include an endopeptidase so this conclusion is not supported by the data.</p><p>19) Subsection “K4 methylation on sister H3s independently regulates the transcription efficiency of GAL1 upon induction”, referring to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4B-C</xref>: &quot;These results indicate that the nucleosomes with asymmetrical K4me3 is constitutively assembled in chromatin in vivo.&quot; The whole cell extracts analyzed show that the steady-state total levels of K4me3-modified H3 is decreased ~50% by the asymmetric mutations, but do not directly measure assembly of those molecules into chromatin in vivo, so the conclusion overstates the observation.</p><p>20) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, the y-axes of panels D, E and H refer to &quot;rate&quot; but that is not what is being graphed, which is the time course of GAL1 mRNA induction. Rate would be related to the slope of the time course curves. Likewise, the legend for Figure 7—figure supplement 1 does indeed report log2 fold-changes, but not an &quot;induction rate.&quot;</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30178.035</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Requires further experiments:</p><p>1) The authors need to validate more loci; single examples are not sufficient.</p><p>The interpretation of the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D-F</xref> is limited due to its examination of a single locus.

Further, as currently presented, the plate phenotypes are difficult to interpret due to the limited growth observed under many conditions even with &quot;WT&quot; cells. Ideally, similar growth rates would be demonstrated by providing growth curves for some crucial conditions, but at the very least the incubation times for the plate assays should be extended, and examination of responses to other challenges such as the Spt- phenotype, caffeine sensitivity, 6AU, rapamycin, synthetic media, raffinose, and galactose should be considered. Given previous results with mutations affecting histone modifications, the Spt- phenotype seems like it would be a very sensitive test of chromatin status, but this requires the use of a strain with a suitable reporter. Screens for some additional phenotypes and better documentation of the plate effected are considered necessary, while examining the effects on reporters like the Spt- phenotype would be strongly encouraged but not required.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this reviewers’ constructive suggestions. We examined the DNA damage sensitivities of H3K4R, K36R and K79R mutants respectively in our system by dotting assay on plate. First of all, consistent with previous findings(Faucher and Wellinger, 2010; Jha and Strahl, 2014; Pai et al., 2014), loss of K4 or K79 modifications on both sister histones exhibited sensitivity to phleomycin, HU and MMS, while losing K36 modifications on both sister histones showed hypersensitivity to phleomycin and mild sensitivity to MMS. These plate phenotypes further confirm that our obligate dimer strain (H3<sup>D</sup>/H3<sup>H</sup>) behaves similar to WT cells (histone shuffle strain, LHT001) in DSB repair. Then we analyzed the plate phenotypes of those asymmetrical modification strains. Intriguingly, we observed that the asymmetrically modified K36 and K79 constantly displayed intermediate levels of sensitivity to all of the genotoxic reagents used, whereas the mutants of H3K4 showed a similar level of sensitivity to HU and MMS, but single-tail H3K4R mutants displayed less growth fitness to the phleomycin treatment compare to the double-tail H3K4R mutant. These observations reveal that in response to DNA damage, the K36me and K79me marks on sister histones functions independently, while the K4me marks on sister histones functions cooperatively. The results were presented in the revised manuscript as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>.</p><p>To give a better interpretation of the plate phenotype of WT (histone shuffle strain, LHT001) and H3<sup>D</sup>/H3<sup>H</sup> cells. We examined their responses to challenges including rapamycin, phleomycin, HU, MMS by dot plate assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> in this letter; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> in the revised manuscript) and glycerol, raffinose, galactose by growth curve assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> in the revised manuscript). Meanwhile, the incubation time for the plate assay was extended to 3 days. As expected, H3<sup>D</sup>/H3<sup>H</sup> and WT strains displayed the same growth phenotype on plate under normal and challenged conditions, as well as the similar growth rates in medium containing glucose and galactose. Whereas, the growth rates of H3<sup>D</sup>/H3<sup>H</sup> and WT strains differ when they are cultured with glycerol and raffinose as carbon sources. Since we have observed altered nucleosome stability on the GAL1-10 promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> in the revised manuscript), we suspect that the expression of genes involved in these carbon metabolic pathways are probably disturbed due to altered chromatin structure by our mutations on histone H3. Consistently, when we analyzed the gene expression profile in H3<sup>D</sup>/H3<sup>H</sup> and WT strains, we observed that the differentially expressed genes are mostly down-regulated in H3<sup>D</sup>/H3<sup>H</sup> cells. Additionally, the genes encoding cytochrome-c reductase activity and ATPase activity appear to closely related to the growth defect in glycerol medium (Tzagoloff et al., 1975) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> and Supplementary file 4 in the revised manuscript).</p><p>The Spt- phenotype analysis is a good suggestion, but we don't have the strain with suitable reporters, therefore we didn't include it in our examination.

Should it not be epistatic with the K4R/K4R strain? There was no explanation for this finding, and the Results section did not adequately address this. Also, Rad6 is an inappropriate mutant to use in this case since it also abolishes H2BK123ub1. There are other mutants that can be used to separate H3K4me states. Further, the fold inductions in panel 4H in the spp1 and rad6 mutants are greater than in the wild-type background (panel 4E), and all induction is lost in the set1 mutant cells. These data are consistent with a model in which H3K4 mono-methylation is required for the induction, but that trimethylation is inhibitory.

This time, we set the value for H3<sup>D</sup>/H3<sup>H</sup> to 1 and the values for all of the knock-out mutants were presented as mean percentage of H3<sup>D</sup>/H3<sup>H</sup>. As the data shown, loss of SPP1, SDC1 and SET1 (thanks to the reviewers’ suggestions, we knocked out SDC1 instead of RAD6 to eliminate K4me2 and me3) all led to up-regulation of GAL1 transcription which is consistent with previous findings (Pinskaya et al., 2009). In the sdc1∆ group, no significant difference was found between sdc1∆ H3<sup>D</sup>/H3<sup>H</sup> and sdc1∆ H3<sup>D</sup>K4R/H3<sup>H</sup>K4R mutants, indicating that mono-methylation of H3K4 doesn't play a role in regulating GAL1 transcription (to our knowledge, there's no evidence proving that H3K4 mono-methylation is required for GAL1 induction previously). Meanwhile, the intermediate level of GAL1 expression was seen in the spp1∆ H3<sup>D</sup>K4R/H3<sup>H</sup> and spp1∆ H3<sup>D</sup>/H3<sup>H</sup>K4R cells while no significant difference was found in the set1∆ mutants. Since it is difficult to distinguish between the effects of H3K4me2 and H3K4me3, we conclude that H3K4me2/3 on sister H3s may contribute to GAL1 regulation in an independent mode.

Therefore., these antibodies cannot be used for quantification assay. By the way, since we excluded the contribution of K4me1 in GAL1 induction and cannot separate the function of K4me2 and me3, lacking K4me1 and me2 quantification will not interfere our conclusion.

Although hyper H4 acetylation level suggest a loose chromatin, it seems too preliminary to regard H4 acetylation phenotypes as a stand-in for chromatin structure. It's more reasonable to interpret it as a downstream effect by K36 methylation loss in regulation of cryptic transcription as previously reported. Following this suggestion, we performed northern blot assay to examine the level of intragenic initiation in the H3K36R mutants within the <italic>FLO8, PCA1</italic> and <italic>STE11</italic> genes which have been demonstrated to be regulated by K36 methylation (Carrozza et al., 2005; Li et al., 2007).

These results were presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D-G</xref> in the revised manuscript.

Consistent with previous findings (Jha and Strahl, 2014; Pai et al., 2014), loss of K36 modifications on both sister histones showed hypersensitivity to phleomycin and mild sensitivity to MMS.

And these results were presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1C-E</xref> in the revised manuscript.</p><p>The known level of induction is the prerequisite for defining our three clusters. By comparing the level of induction (expressed as log<sub>2</sub>fold-change in our manuscript) in the asymmetrical K4R mutants with that in the H3<sup>D</sup>/H3<sup>H</sup> cells and in the symmetrical K4R mutants, we defined three clusters as: Cluster I, the level of induction in the asymmetrical K4R mutants is the same with that in the symmetrical K4R mutants, but different from that in the H3<sup>D</sup>/H3<sup>H</sup> cells; Cluster II, the level of induction in the asymmetrical K4R mutants is intermediate between that in the H3<sup>D</sup>/H3<sup>H</sup> cells and in the symmetrical K4R mutants; Cluster III, the level of induction in the asymmetrical K4R mutants is the same with that in the H3<sup>D</sup>/H3<sup>H</sup> cells, but different from that in the symmetrical K4R mutants. These correlations between clusters and level of induction help us to infer that the transcription of genes in Cluster I is hypersensitive to the loss of one H3K4me on sister H3s, and one K4me on sister H3s is insufficient to exert any effect; the transcription of genes in Cluster II is sensitive to the magnitude of H3K4me, and is regulated by sister histones through H3K4 methylation; the transcription of genes in Cluster III is hyposensitive to the loss of one H3K4me on sister H3s, and the function of K4me on sister H3 is redundant. Further KEGG pathway analysis showed that genes regulated by H3K4me are involved in pathways directly responsive to glucose starvation, e.g. carbon metabolism, the TCA cycle, and fructose and mannose metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref> in the revised manuscript). Analysis of the fold-change of those genes which are involved in the three pathways revealed a similar pattern to that of Cluster II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1G</xref> in the revised manuscript). Therefore, under glucose starvation stress a significant proportion of glycometablism associated genes are regulated by the fluctuation of H3K4me level on sister H3s.

However, there are substantial differences evident between the wild-type and D-H cells.

Since the signals of our initial MNase digestion results were a little weak in the detected regions, we repeated the MNase digestion assay (presented as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> in our revised manuscript). As this reviewer has pointed out, indeed we observed substantial differences between the wild-type and D-H cells on the GAL1 side. The nucleosome array was much more unstable in D-H cells in this region. Therefore, we changed our statement in our revised manuscript for this part.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This reviewers are right that the &quot;hypersensitive region&quot; is defined relative to chromatin digestion by DNase I (Lohr, 1993), thus was labeled accordingly either in DNase I digestion result or in MNase digestion result (Lohr and Lopez, 1995). To avoid confusion, we relabeled this region as &quot;UAS&quot; which is reported to be included in the hypersensitive region and protected by effecter proteins (such as GAL4) from digesting (Lohr and Lopez, 1995).</p><p>10) The severe growth defect of the delta21-D/delta21-H strain also suggests that the dimerization mutants cause chromatin changes, as deleting the H3 N-termini in otherwise normal strains does not cause this growth defect (e.g. Mann and Grunstein, 1992). The authors should therefore indicate that the D-H mutations cause some changes in chromatin, necessitating that all comparisons must be between D-H cells with wild-type modifiable residues and D-H cells with histone mutations. Along these lines, the authors need to clearly specify which strains are used as controls in each experiment, as &quot;WT&quot; could mean several things, and must be explicit that valid comparisons between appropriately matched controls are being made in every case.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks to the reviewers for their critical comments. In the work by Mann and Grunstein, they performed various kinds of N-terminal deletions of histone H3 while the first three amino acids were left to promise normal post-translational processing of the N-terminal residue and stability (Mann and Grunstein, 1992). As cited in their paper, it has been reported that the amino-terminal residues of a protein are important for its stability (Bachmair et al., 1986). We apologize that we didn't consider this issue in our initial design for the N-terminal deletion strategy. That's why we observed severe growth defect of the delta21-D/delta21-H strain. Therefore, we changed our N-terminal deletion strategy to deletion of the N-terminal 15 amino acids while keeping the first three amino acids (Δ4-15). It turned out that the growth defect is remarkably alleviated, while a little slow growth was still observed in the N-terminal deletion mutants which is consistent with previous findings that the doubling time in Δ4-15 strain is prolonged (Mann and Grunstein, 1992).

We chose the anti-H3-N antibody for detection. We didn't set total H3 control here, because we normalized the signals of the immunoprecipitated Myc- H3<sup>H</sup> and Myc- H3<sup>H</sup> by myc antibody (compare the Myc panel of lane 4 and 6) and detected their co-immunoprecipitated counterparts (untagged H3<sup>D</sup> and untagged H3<sup>H,</sup>respectively) by H3-N antibody (compare the H3N panel of lane 4 and 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) The results raise an interesting issue regarding the distinction between asymmetrical modification and changes in the total level of modification that should be discussed. For example, in a strain in which only half of the H3 can be modified, the global level of modified H3 now has a maximum value of 50% of the maximum in a normal cell. How can one discriminate between effects due to forced asymmetrical modification and forced decrease in total modification? It is difficult to imagine addressing this experimentally, but the issue should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>In a normal cell, down-regulation of the total level of modification definitely exists as a mode to regulate chromatin associated processes. However, it's difficult to achieve a fixed value (such as 50%) for a certain modification in a normal cell experimentally. Therefore, it's rather difficult to investigation the relationship between the magnitude of histone modification and its effects. In our system, we forced the establishment of asymmetrical modifications on chromatin to have a maximum value of 50% of the maximum for the global level of modified H3. We found that some cellular processes are sensitive to the decrease of modification level (the effects of 50% modification loss equals that of 100% loss), some are not sensitive (the effects of 50% modification loss equals that of 0% loss), while some are fine-tuned by 50% modification loss. Since multiple asymmetrical modifications have been found in cells, they should contribute to regulate cellular processes. Based on previous observations by many labs, it's speculated that genes possessing asymmetrical modifications are in a poised state, enabling them to be rapidly activated upon suitable developmental cues and/or environmental stimuli (Voigt et al., 2013). Consistently, in our story, we found that most of the genes fine-tuned by asymmetrical modifications are closely related to stress-response. Thus, we conjecture that oscillation of the total level of histone modification may apply to situations requiring rough regulation (on-off regulation) while the role of asymmetrical modification may be related to situations calling for subtle regulation (fine-tuning regulation). It'll be perfect if we can come up with a strategy to control the level of forced decrease in total modification. We discussed this issue in the &quot;Discussion&quot; part of our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) Better explanation of the strains used is needed.</p><p>As noted above, the use of the term &quot;WT&quot; requires explanation in each case. For example, it seems likely that Myc-tagging the H3 protein would have a physiological effect, but no strain with Myc-HHT1 is listed for use as a control for the Myc-tagged heterodimeric nucleosome strains. Is the WT strain the histone shuffle strain? Why is the ADE3 promoter used to drive the Myc-HHT1? Is this a single Myc repeat? It is difficult to determine whether appropriate comparisons are being made without explicit statement of which strains are used in each experiment with a unique name that identifies the strain being described in the strain list provided.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks to the reviewers for their critical comments. As suggested, we have included explanation for the use of &quot;WT&quot; and marked it by the unique name described in the strain list in each case in our revised manuscript and figure legends. We feel sorry that we omitted the information for strain with Myc-HHT1 in our initial strain list, and it's added in our revised list. In the part of &quot;Characterization of the H3<sup>D</sup>/H3<sup>H</sup> strain&quot;, we use the term of &quot;WT&quot; and it's indeed the histone shuffle (Agez et al., 2007)strain (LHT001 in the strain list). All of the histones tagged with Myc in our story refer to tagging with a single Myc repeat, which is illustrated in the revised strain list.</p><p>The main purpose of using the ADE3 promoter to drive one of the copy of HHT1 gene is to reduce the expression of H3<sup>H</sup> (including myc-H3<sup>H</sup>) expression. The reason is as following. When we examined the incorporation ratio of H3<sup>D</sup> and H3<sup>H</sup> in chromatin, we constructed two strains: in one strain, the H3<sup>D</sup> was tagged with Myc-HA and the H3<sup>H</sup> was tagged with Myc; in the other strain, the H3<sup>D</sup> was tagged with Myc and the H3<sup>H</sup> was tagged with Myc-HA. The Myc and Myc-HA tags are used to discriminate the size of H3<sup>D</sup> and H3<sup>H</sup> proteins. In the immunoprecipation experiment, we immunoprecipitated the mono-nucleosomes using anti-H2B antibody, and examined Myc- and Myc-HA-tagged H3<sup>D</sup> and H3<sup>H</sup> by anti-Myc antibody. We observed severe decrease of expression levels for Myc-HA-tagged proteins (Attached <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, the first two lanes). Under these circumstances, the IPed signal for Myc-HA-H3<sup>H</sup> is far much higher than that for Myc-H3<sup>D</sup>, suggesting that undesired H3<sup>H</sup>- H3<sup>H</sup> dimer was incorporated into nucleosome. In contrast, when the expression level of Myc-HA-H3<sup>D</sup> is much higher than Myc-H3<sup>H</sup> (Attached <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, the last lane), the incorporation ratio of H3<sup>D</sup> and H3<sup>H</sup> was near 1:1. We suspect that though mutant strains containing only H3<sup>H</sup> cannot survive on the FOA plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> in our revised manuscript), there could be very weak interactions between two H3<sup>H</sup> moleculeswhen the expression of H3<sup>H</sup> is too high due to the strong natural promoter of H3<sup>H</sup>. This specaulation is reasonable. Because (1) the pKa value for the side chain of histidine (H) is 6.02 (according to the evaluation &quot; pH = pKa + lgBHB+ &quot;), under physiological pH conditions which is around 6, there could be 1molecule of uncharged histidine out of 2 molecules of histidine. Accordingly, the pKa value for the side chain of Aspatate (D) is 3.71 (according to the evaluation &quot; pH = pKa + lgA-HA &quot;), there could be 1molecule of uncharged aspatate out of 200 molecules of aspatate. Therefore, the probability of interaction between H3<sup>H</sup> molecules should be much higher than that between H3<sup>D</sup> molecules. (2) histone chaperone Asf1 has been found to prefer binding hydrophobic groups (Agez et al., 2007; Antczak et al., 2006). The uncharged histidine exhibits relatively strong hydrophobicity, thus is more preferred by Asf1.</p><p>In order to alleviate the risk of H3<sup>H</sup>- H3<sup>H</sup> dimer formation, we used ADE3 promoter, which is much weaker than the natural promoterof HHT1, to drive H3<sup>H</sup> expression (Ghaemmaghami et al., 2003; Kulak et al., 2014), while H3<sup>D</sup> was still driven by its natural promoter. In this reformed strain, we performed IP and ChIP assays and showed that H3<sup>D</sup> and H3<sup>H</sup> are assembled into nucleosomes at a ratio of 1:1 in total level and at specific gene loci (e.g. GAL1-10 promoter) respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and 2B</xref> in our revised manuscript). We indicated the change of promoter in the H3<sup>D</sup>/H3<sup>H</sup> strain and briefly explained the reason in our revised manuscript.</p><fig id="respfig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Immunoprecipitation analysis using anti-Myc antibody.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-30178-resp-fig3-v2"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17) Further explanation of the nucleosome purification would be helpful.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>.

In this way, we got mononulcosomes with flexible linker DNA ends which may leads to bigger DNA fragments than that in theory. By the way, we compared our FPLC spectra for purification of mononucleosomes with the reference spectra of our chromatographic column provided by GE healthcare.

The term &quot;clipping&quot; is usually used to refer to the natural process of proteolytic tail cleavage, which is induced during sporulation or starvation (Santos-Rosa et al., 2009). In contrast, here the authors are analyzing an engineered gene deletion and are not analyzing cells grown under conditions inducing proteolysis. Therefore, this figure should be titled &quot;Examination of an asymmetric deletion in the N-terminus of histone H3&quot;. Furthermore, some of the discussion of this result perpetuates this confusion (subsection “The N-terminal clipping on one of the sister histone H3 tails does not affect the other tail”): &quot;the H3 N-terminal clipping on one of the sister H3s will not influence the clipping on the other one, in other words the endopeptidase activity of cleavage is not affected by losing one of the sister H3 tails.&quot; This experiment doesn't include an endopeptidase so this conclusion is not supported by the data.</p></disp-quote><p>According to the reviewers’ suggestions, we changed the statements from &quot;clipping&quot; to &quot;N-terminal deletion&quot; in our revised manuscript and figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>19) Subsection “K4 methylation on sister H3s independently regulates the transcription efficiency of GAL1 upon induction”, referring to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4B-C</xref>: &quot;These results indicate that the nucleosomes with asymmetrical K4me3 is constitutively assembled in chromatin in vivo.&quot; The whole cell extracts analyzed show that the steady-state total levels of K4me3-modified H3 is decreased ~50% by the asymmetric mutations, but do not directly measure assembly of those molecules into chromatin in vivo, so the conclusion overstates the observation.</p></disp-quote><p>According to the reviewers’ suggestions, we changed the statements to &quot;These results suggest asymmetrical K4me3 has been mimicked on chromatin in vivo.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>20) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, the y-axes of panels D, E and H refer to &quot;rate&quot; but that is not what is being graphed, which is the time course of GAL1 mRNA induction.
