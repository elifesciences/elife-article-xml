Ribosome recycling following translation termination produces free 40S subunits for re-assembly of 43S PICs. Yeast mutants lacking orthologs of mammalian eIF2D (Tma64), and either MCT-1 (Tma20) or DENR (Tma22), are broadly impaired for 40S recycling; however, it was unknown whether this defect alters the translational efficiencies (TEs) of particular mRNAs. Here, we conducted ribosome profiling of a yeast <italic>tma64∆/tma20∆</italic> double mutant and observed a marked reprogramming of translation, wherein the TEs of the most efficiently translated (‘strong’) mRNAs increase, while those of ‘weak’ mRNAs generally decline. Remarkably, similar reprogramming was seen on reducing 43S PIC assembly by inducing phosphorylation of eIF2α or by decreasing total 40S subunit levels by depleting Rps26. Our findings suggest that strong mRNAs outcompete weak mRNAs in response to 43S PIC limitation achieved in various ways, in accordance with previous mathematical modeling.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>yeast</kwd><kwd>translation</kwd><kwd>initiation</kwd><kwd>ribosome</kwd><kwd>recycling</kwd><kwd>eIF2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Intramural Research Program of the NIH</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HD001004-37</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hinnebusch</surname><given-names>Alan G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A mutant impaired for ribosome recycling exhibits translational reprogramming wherein strong mRNAs outcompete weak mRNAs, also observed when preinitiation complexes are diminished by eIF2α phosphorylation or 40S ribosomal subunit depletion.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The initiation of translation in eukaryotes commences with assembly of a 43S preinitiation complex (PIC) on the small (40S) ribosomal subunit, containing the ternary complex (TC), comprised of GTP-bound eukaryotic initiation factor two and methionyl initiator tRNA (eIF2·GTP·Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub>), and additional eIFs (−1, −1A, and −3). The 43S PIC attaches to the 5’ end of mRNA, in a manner stimulated by the eIF4F complex bound to the m<sup>7</sup>G cap, and scans the mRNA 5’-untranslated region (5’UTR) for an AUG start codon, producing a stable 48S PIC on AUG selection by Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub>. The GTP bound to eIF2 can be hydrolyzed during scanning, stimulated by GTPase activating protein eIF5, but eIF1 impedes release of inorganic phosphate (P<sub>i</sub>) at non-AUG codons. Start codon recognition triggers dissociation of eIF1 from the 40S subunit, enabling P<sub>i</sub> release from eIF2·GDP·P<sub>i</sub> and subsequent dissociation of eIF2·GDP and other eIFs from the 48S PIC. The eIF5B-catalyzed joining of the large (60S) subunit produces an 80S initiation complex (IC) ready to begin the elongation phase of protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hinnebusch, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hinnebusch, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Several different mRNA features influence the rate of translation initiation. The efficiency of 43S PIC attachment to mRNA and subsequent scanning of the 5’UTR are hindered by stable secondary structures, such that long, structure-laden 5’UTRs are generally inhibitory and impose a requirement for RNA helicases associated with eIF4F, including eIF4A and Ded1, to resolve mRNA structures near the cap, within the 5’UTR, and surrounding the start codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gupta et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gulay et al., 2020</xref>). The nucleotide sequence immediately surrounding the start codon—the ‘Kozak context’—particularly at the −3 and +4 positions (numbered from the A of AUG (+1)) also influences the efficiency of start codon selection, with A nucleotides upstream of the AUG codons enhancing initiation on yeast mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shabalina et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zur and Tuller, 2013</xref>). Binding of eIF4F to the mRNA cap is stimulated by interaction of its eIF4G subunit with the poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) bound to the poly(A) tail, promoting circularization of the mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hinnebusch, 2011</xref>). Formation of this ‘closed-loop structure’ might facilitate reinitiation by ribosomal subunits released from the stop codon of the mRNA following termination of translation and ribosome recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Uchida et al., 2002</xref>). There is evidence that closed-loop formation is favored for shorter mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amrani et al., 2008</xref>), which might help account for the negative correlation between mRNA coding sequence length and translation efficiencies observed in yeast and other eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arava et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Thompson et al., 2016</xref>). However, theoretical modeling indicates that shorter mRNAs are capable of more efficient recycling of ribosomal subunits from the stop codon to the initiation codon without a mechanism for promoting circularization via end-to-end interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fernandes et al., 2017</xref>). The abundance of mRNA is also associated with efficient translation, presumably reflecting the need for mRNAs encoding highly expressed proteins to be both abundant—highly transcribed and stable—and optimized for translation.</p><p>Translation initiation can also be modulated by altering the activities of general initiation factors. The function of eIF2 in Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> recruitment is inhibited in response to various stresses by phosphorylation of serine-51 of its α-subunit, as phosphorylated eIF2·GDP acts as a competitive inhibitor of eIF2B, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for eIF2. Inhibition of eIF2B reduces assembly of the TC and thereby decreases formation of 43S PICs, attenuating bulk translation initiation in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pavitt, 2018</xref>). Reducing TC levels also stimulates the translation of certain mRNAs by blunting the inhibitory effects of upstream open-reading-frames (uORFs) present in their 5’UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hinnebusch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hinnebusch et al., 2016</xref>). Such uORFs are encountered by scanning 43S PICs first, and their translation generally diminishes the number of PICs that reach the main coding sequences (CDS) downstream owing to recycling of ribosomes following termination at the uORF stop codons. Limited reductions in TC by eIF2α phosphorylation allow uORF start codons to be skipped by scanning PICs with attendant increased translation of the main CDS, by various mechanisms. For yeast <italic>GCN4</italic> mRNA, encoding a transcriptional activator of amino acid biosynthetic genes, translation of the first of four uORFs gives rise to 40S subunits that escape recycling at the uORF1 stop codon and resume scanning downstream. At high TC levels, they quickly rebind TC and reinitiate at uORFs 3 or 4, and are efficiently recycled from the mRNA following uORF translation. When TC levels are reduced by eIF2α phosphorylation, catalyzed by protein kinase Gcn2 on amino acid starvation, a fraction of scanning 40S subunits fails to rebind TC until after bypassing all four uORFs, but then bind TC in time to reinitiate at the main <italic>GCN4</italic> CDS instead, thereby inducing <italic>GCN4</italic> translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hinnebusch, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Ribosome recycling entails the splitting and release of 80S ribosomes from mRNA at the stop codon following polypeptide chain termination, and occurs in two stages. Dissociation of the 60S subunit from the 80S post-termination complex (post-TerC) occurs first, catalyzed by ABCE1 (Rli1 in yeast), leaving a 40S subunit with the stop codon in the A site and deacylated tRNA in the P site corresponding to the last translated codon of the ORF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Young et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hellen, 2018</xref>). The second stage of recycling, dissociation of the tRNA and 40S subunit from the mRNA, is stimulated in vitro by eIF2D, or by the heterodimer MCT-1/DENR, which exhibit homology to separate regions of eIF2D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Skabkin et al., 2010</xref>). eIF2D could also stimulate reinitiation of translation by reconstituted mammalian 40S post-TerCs by releasing the deacylated tRNA and making the P site available for recruiting Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> via the TC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Skabkin et al., 2013</xref>). Structural analysis shows that human MCT-1/DENR can bind to the 40S decoding center and contact both ends of tRNA<sub>i</sub> in a model reinitiation intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Weisser et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting their likely positions in a 40S post-TerC. Both DENR and MCT-1 have been shown to promote translation reinitiation downstream of uORFs with strong Kozak consensus sequences in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and HeLa cells, although the sensitive uORFs in human cells are extremely short, encoding only one amino acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schleich et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schleich et al., 2017</xref>). Other recent findings implicate DENR in promoting reinitiation following uORF translation on certain mRNAs in mouse cells, including that for the CLOCK gene, although the relevant uORFs were not the single-codon variety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Castelo-Szekely et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, in reconstituted mammalian systems, eIF2D and MCT-1/DENR were found capable of substituting for eIF2 in GTP-independent recruitment of Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> to the 40S subunit during primary initiation events on certain mRNAs where the AUG codon is placed in the P site without prior scanning, including leaderless mRNAs, mRNAs containing an internal ribosome entry site, or mRNAs with unstructured A-rich 5’UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dmitriev et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Skabkin et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Recently, we showed that yeast mutants lacking the genes for both eIF2D (Tma64) and either MCT-1 (Tma20) or DENR (Tma22) exhibit phenotypes consistent with a broad defect in 40S recycling, including a queuing of translating 80S ribosomes immediately upstream of main CDS stop codons, and increased reinitiation at AUG codons in 3’UTRs. At certain genes, it appeared that unrecycled 40S ribosomes could rejoin with 60S subunits and undergo unconventional 80S reinitiation events in the 3’UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Young et al., 2018</xref>), a process observed previously for unrecycled 80S post-TerCs in cells depleted of ABCE1/Rli1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Young et al., 2015</xref>). The ability of Tma64 or Tma20/Tma22 to promote recycling and block reinitiation was also demonstrated in cell extracts with uORF-containing reporter mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Young et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, ostensibly at odds with the findings from mammalian cells where MCT-1/DENR enhance reinititiation following uORF translation, the available evidence suggests that the yeast orthologs of these proteins impede reinitiation by promoting dissociation of 40S post-TerCs from the mRNA. It remains possible, however, that the yeast Tma proteins stimulate, rather than inhibit, reinitiation on particular uORF-containing mRNAs in vivo. It is unknown whether Tma64 or Tma20/Tma22 can substitute for eIF2 in Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> recruitment during primary initiation events on any native mRNAs in yeast cells in the manner described for their mammalian orthologs in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dmitriev et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Skabkin et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Because ribosome recycling is required to provide 40S subunits needed for assembly of 43S PICs to support new initiation events, we wondered whether defective recycling in yeast cells lacking the Tma proteins would reduce the formation of 43S PICs, which in turn, might differentially affect the translation of mRNAs with different inherent rates of initiation. In this view, changes in translation efficiencies (TEs) observed on depletion of the Tma proteins would result from altered competition among mRNAs for limiting PICs rather than loss of mRNA-specific functions of the Tma proteins in either reinitiation or eIF2-independent primary initiation. To explore this possibility, we conducted ribosome profiling on a <italic>tma64∆/tma20∆</italic> double mutant, lacking the yeast orthologs of eIF2D and MCT-1, and compared the TEs of all expressed mRNAs in this mutant to their values in isogenic WT cells. The results indicate that eliminating Tma64/Tma20 leads to a reprogramming of translation that generally favors mRNAs that are more efficiently translated in WT cells and disfavors weakly translated mRNAs. Observing the same general reprogramming of TEs in response to eIF2α phosphorylation in WT cells, or to a reduction in WT 40S subunit levels, we propose that competition among mRNAs for limiting 43S PICs is an important driver of changes in TE in cells impaired for 40S recycling.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of mRNAs dependent on Tma64 or the Tma20/Tma22 heterodimer for efficient translation in yeast cells</title><p>Previously, we provided evidence that the yeast counterparts of eIF2D or the MCT-1/DENR heterodimer (Tma64 and Tma20/Tma22, respectively) act in ribosome recycling following the termination of polypeptide synthesis at stop codons. Analysis of a yeast <italic>tma64∆/tma20∆</italic> double mutant (<italic>tma∆∆</italic>) suggested the accumulation of unrecycled 40S post-TerCs stranded at stop codons, with two main consequences: (i) queuing of translating 80S ribosomes immediately upstream of 40S post-TerCs stalled at stop codons; (ii) increased reinitiation by the stalled 40S post-TerCs and attendant translation in adjacent 3’UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Young et al., 2018</xref>). Recently, profiling of 40S subunits (as opposed to 80S ribosomes) has confirmed the genome-wide accumulation of unrecycled 40S subunits at stop codons in the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutant (D. Young, S. Meydan-Marks, and N. Guydosh, personal communication). We wondered whether the sequestration of 40S subunits in 40S post-TerCs stranded at stop codons, or otherwise engaged in scanning or translation within 3’UTRs, in the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutant would reduce their availability to assemble new 43S preinitiation complexes and thereby diminish the relative translational efficiencies (TEs) of certain mRNAs in the cell.</p><p>To address this possibility, we used ribosome profiling to measure the relative TEs of all expressed mRNAs in the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutant compared to the isogenic WT, culturing both strains in synthetic complete (SC) medium. Ribosome profiling entails deep-sequencing of 80S ribosome-protected mRNA fragments (RPFs, or ribosome footprints) in parallel with total RNA. The ratio of sequencing reads of RPFs summed over the coding sequences to the total mRNA reads for the corresponding transcript provides a measure of TE for each mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ingolia et al., 2009</xref>). Owing to normalization of the data for total read number in each library, the RPF and mRNA reads and the calculated TEs are determined relative to the average values for each strain and do not indicate absolute levels of mRNA expression or translation. The RPF and RNA read counts between biological replicates for each strain were highly reproducible (Pearson’s r ≈ 0.99) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). The normalized RPF counts from all mRNAs aligned at their stop codons for the WT strain showed the expected three nucleotide periodicity and a peak at the stop codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, blue). As we reported previously for cells cultured in undefined rich medium (YEPD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Young et al., 2018</xref>), the corresponding metagene profile for the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutant in defined (SC) medium differs from the WT profile in exhibiting a peak ~30 nt upstream of the stop codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, green versus blue), attributed to queuing of a translating 80S ribosome behind an unrecycled 40S post-TerCs stalled at the stop codon following peptide release and recycling of the large 60S subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, schematic). The <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutant also exhibits genome-wide elevated 80S occupancies downstream of stop codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, green versus blue), indicating increased translation reinitiation in 3’UTRs by unrecycled post-TerCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, schematic). Thus, key defects associated with impaired 40S recycling following translation termination observed previously in the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutant cultured in YEPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Young et al., 2018</xref>) were reproduced here in the same mutant grown in SC medium.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Identification of mRNAs exhibiting altered relative TEs on deletion of <italic>TMA64/TMA20.</italic></title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Results from ribosome profiling showing the normalized 80S ribosome reads from all mRNAs aligned with respect to their stop codons, for WT strain BY4741 (blue), the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutant H4520 (green), and SM-treated WT cells (maroon).

The usual explanation for halfmer polysomes is a delay in joining of 60S subunits to 48S PICs at AUG start codons, such as conferred by reductions in the production or stability of 60S subunits. In fact, a <italic>tma20∆</italic> single mutant was found to exhibit an abnormally high ratio of free 40S to free 60S subunits in the manner expected from a 60S biogenesis defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fleischer et al., 2006</xref>). An accumulation of unrecycled 40S subunits at stop codons or in 3’UTRs might also contribute to the halfmer formation we observed in the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutant; however, the association of such 40S complexes with mRNA might be too labile to withstand sedimentation through sucrose gradients without the cross-linking step employed in 40S subunit profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Archer et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Interrogating the ribosome profiling data for possible changes in TEs of mRNAs associated with elimination of the Tma proteins, we identified a sizable group of 175 mRNAs showing significant reductions in relative TE (ΔTE<italic><sub>tma∆∆</sub></italic>_down), and a cohort of 378 mRNAs exhibiting relative TE increases (ΔTE<italic><sub>tma∆∆</sub></italic>_up), in the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutant versus WT cells (at FDR &lt; 0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Importantly, these changes in translation were largely independent of changes in mRNA abundance, as very few mRNAs showing significant TE changes also displayed significant mRNA changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), which is consistent with the idea that eIF2D or MCT-1/DENR directly or indirectly influence the translation of a fraction of cellular mRNAs. Interestingly, the mRNAs belonging to the ΔTE<italic><sub>tma∆∆</sub></italic>_up group tend to be highly translated in WT cells, showing a significantly higher median TE compared to all mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, solid green versus black). Consistent with this, these mRNAs exhibit multiple features characteristic of well-translated mRNAs, including short CDS and short 5’UTR lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>), higher than average Kozak context scores for nucleotides surrounding the AUG start codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), and greater than average transcript abundance and stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–F</xref>).

One way to explain these results is to propose that a competition between ‘strong’ and ‘weak’ mRNAs for limiting translation components is skewed in favor of the strong mRNAs in the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutant.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Evidence that relative TE changes observed in the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutant do not arise from eliminating an alternative function of eIF2D</title><p>As mentioned above, studies in reconstituted mammalian systems revealed that eIF2D can promote binding of Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> to AUG codons in specialized mRNAs in which ribosomal scanning is not required to place the AUG codon in the P site of the 40S subunit.

The TE reductions for this group of mRNAs might then indirectly stimulate translation of the other group of mRNAs found to be upregulated in the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutant owing to reduced competition for initiation machinery. In an effort to rule out this possibility, we conducted ribosome profiling of a <italic>tma64∆</italic> single deletion mutant lacking the yeast homolog of eIF2D but still containing Tma20/Tma22, the homologs of MCT-1/DENR.</p><p>The ribosome footprint and RNA-seq results between biological replicates for the WT and <italic>tma64∆</italic> single mutant strains were highly reproducible (Pearson’s r ≈ 0.99) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>).

If this hypothesis is correct, then reducing assembly of 43S PICs by other means might elicit a similar global reprogramming of translation. As a first test of this prediction, we used ribosome profiling to examine the effects on genome-wide TEs rendered by phosphorylation of serine-51 of eIF2α by protein kinase Gcn2.

The TE changes evoked by SM treatment were largely independent of changes in mRNA abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), except that ~ 1/4th of the 889 mRNAs exhibiting increased TEs also show decreased mRNA abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, 2nd row; more on this phenomenon below). This last finding, plus the considerably larger number of mRNAs whose TEs were significantly changed by SM treatment versus the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutations, indicate a more widespread reprogramming of TEs evoked by increased eIF2α phosphorylation compared to loss of 40S recycling factors. Nevertheless, as observed for the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutations, the mRNAs showing increased relative TE on SM treatment (ΔTE<sub>WT+SM</sub>_up) are enriched for mRNAs that are well-translated in untreated WT cells, whereas the ΔTE<sub>WT+SM</sub>_down group of mRNAs are enriched for weakly translated mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Moreover, the ΔTE<sub>WT+SM</sub>_up group tend to exhibit all of the attributes of strongly translated mRNAs (short CDS and 5’UTR lengths, good Kozak context, greater mRNA abundance and stability, compared to the genome averages); whereas the ΔTE<sub>WT+SM</sub>_down mRNAs are enriched for the features of weakly translated mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–E</xref>). These opposite features for the ΔTE<sub>WT+SM</sub>_up and ΔTE<sub>WT+SM</sub>_down groups of mRNAs are mirrored by the greater preferences for A nucleotides upstream of the AUG codons of the ΔTE<sub>WT+SM</sub>_up group in comparison to the ΔTE<sub>WT+SM</sub> _down group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref> versus <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Furthermore, the global ΔTE values for all expressed mRNAs on SM treatment of WT cells (ΔTE<sub>WT+SM</sub>) are positively correlated with mRNA half-life, transcript abundance, Kozak context score, and the TE in WT cells, while negatively correlated with 5’UTR and CDS lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). As in the case of TE changes in response to the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutations, the strongest correlations with TE changes in response to SM are for CDS length and for TE in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref> versus <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>).</p><p>Additional support for the idea that eliminating the Tma proteins and increasing phosphorylation of eIF2α produce overlapping alterations in TEs was provided by hierarchical clustering of the TE changes in the two conditions for the group of 486 mRNAs showing significant TE changes, either relative increases or decreases, in response to both the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutations and SM treatment of WT cells. The results are displayed in the heatmap of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, where TE increases or decreases for each gene (shown from top to bottom) are indicated by blue or red hues, respectively. It can be seen that the majority of mRNAs showing significant TE changes in response to the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutations or SM treatment of WT cells exhibit changes in the same direction (same color) in the two conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>); albeit with a tendency for stronger changes (deeper hues) in the SM-treated WT cells. In accordance with these findings, we found highly significant overlaps between the mRNAs in the ΔTE<italic><sub>tma∆∆</sub></italic>_up and ΔTE<sub>WT+SM</sub>_up groups, and between the ΔTE<italic><sub>tma∆∆</sub></italic>_down and ΔTE<sub>WT+SM</sub>_down groups of mRNAs defined above (with changes in TE at FDR &lt; 0.05) on elimination of the Tma proteins or SM treatment of WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Moreover, the median TEs of the groups of mRNAs that are translationally up- or down-regulated by the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutations also show significant changes in median TE in the same direction, albeit of diminished magnitude, on SM treatment of WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>, columns 3–4). A similar conclusion emerges from comparing the changes in median TE between the two conditions for the groups of mRNAs up- or down-regulated by SM treatment of WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C–D</xref>, columns 3–4).</p><p>Further evidence that the TEs of many mRNAs change coherently on eliminating the Tma proteins or SM treatment of WT came from gene ontology (GO) analysis of the ΔTE<italic><sub>tma∆∆</sub></italic>_up and ΔTE<sub>WT+SM</sub>_up groups of mRNAs. This exercise revealed that the most significantly enriched functional groups for both sets of upregulated mRNAs are gene products involved in cytoplasmic translation, including ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>, cf. maroon and green circles). Indeed, the group of 135 ribosomal protein gene (RPG) mRNAs shows highly significant TE increases in both conditions compared to all mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4A and D</xref>). At the same time, the abundance of this group of mRNAs declines under both conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4B and E</xref>), which partially offsets the increases in TEs and dampens the increase in translation levels (i.e. RPF reads uncorrected for mRNA abundance, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4C and F</xref>). The repression of RPG mRNAs in response to starvation for individual amino acids has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Natarajan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Saint et al., 2014</xref>). The findings above, that the TEs of the RPG mRNAs are upregulated by both the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutations and SM treatment of WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4A and D</xref>), are in accordance with the fact that they comprise a group of particularly ‘strong’ mRNAs, exhibiting TEs in WT substantially above the genome average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). GO analysis of the ΔTE<italic><sub>tma∆∆</sub></italic>_down and ΔTE<sub>WT+SM</sub>_down groups of mRNAs also revealed common functional categories among those exhibiting the highest enrichments, including protein glycosylation, mannoprotein biosynthesis, and transmembrane transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref>, cf. maroon and green circles).</p><p>Given that increased eIF2α phosphorylated induced by SM treatment increases translation of <italic>GCN4</italic> mRNA and alters expression of hundreds of mRNAs owing to enhanced transcriptional activation by Gcn4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jia et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Natarajan et al., 2001</xref>), the question arose as to whether the transcriptional changes evoked by Gcn4 induction are responsible for the translational reprogramming produced by SM treatment of WT cells. To test this, we conducted ribosome profiling of a <italic>gcn4∆</italic> mutant treated with SM under the same conditions employed above for WT cells. The ribosome profiling and RNA-seq results between biological replicates for the <italic>gcn4∆</italic> mutant cultured with or without SM treatment were highly reproducible (Pearson’s r ≈ 0.99) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5A–D</xref>). This experiment probably does not provide a perfect test of whether upregulating Gcn4 contributes to the translational reprogramming evoked by SM treatment because the absence of transcriptional changes produced Gcn4 renders the <italic>gcn4∆</italic> mutant more sensitive to the growth-retarding effects of Ile/Val starvation by SM. Nevertheless, analyzing the TE changes produced by SM treatment of the <italic>gcn4∆</italic> mutant revealed a strong reprogramming of TEs with features similar to those described above for SM-treated WT cells and untreated <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutant. In particular, the ΔTE values for all expressed mRNAs on SM treatment of the <italic>gcn4∆</italic> mutant show significant positive correlations with TE in WT, transcript abundance, mRNA half-life and Kozak context score, but negative correlations with CDS and 5’UTR lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>).</p><p>It is striking that eliminating Tma proteins and SM treatment both preferentially increase the TEs of strong mRNAs and disfavor weak mRNAs, and that the majority of mRNAs whose TEs are significantly altered under both of these conditions display changes in the same direction and are enriched for the same functional categories. However, there are also many condition-specific changes in TE that should not be overlooked. Thus, ~50% of the mRNAs whose TEs are upregulated or down-regulated by the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutations are not significantly altered by SM treatment of WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), even though the latter condition generally has a greater impact on the TEs of those mRNAs significantly affected by both conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Condition-specific TE changes are also evident in a cluster analysis of TE changes conferred by the two conditions for all 824 mRNAs exhibiting significant TE changes in response to the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutations (at FDR &lt; 0.1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6A</xref>). While the TE changes conferred by the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutations or SM treatment of WT cells are significantly correlated for this group of mRNAs (Spearman’s ρ = 0.52, p = 0), there are sizeable blocks of mRNAs that show changes of lesser magnitude (same color, lighter hue), or even changes in the opposite direction (different colors), on SM treatment versus the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutations (see blocks of mRNAs bracketed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6A</xref>). Thus, numerous condition-specific changes in TE appear to be superimposed on the shared general trends of increased TEs for strong mRNAs and decreased TEs for weak mRNAs conferred by the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutations or by SM treatment of WT.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Relative TE changes evoked by depleting 40S subunits are also related to those conferred by loss of 40S recycling factors and reduced TC assembly</title><p>The results thus far suggest that the competition between strong and weak mRNAs is shifted in favor of strong mRNAs when eIF2D and MCT-1/DENR are both eliminated or when eIF2 function is impaired by phosphorylation. Given the role of eIF2D and/or MCT-1/DENR in supplying recycled free 40S subunits for initiation, and the effect of eIF2α phosphorylation in reducing the concentration of TC—a key constituent of initiation complexes—we considered the possibility that both conditions skew the competition among different mRNAs by limiting formation of 43S PICs. If so, then reducing the availability of free 40S subunits by reducing total 40S abundance should likewise diminish 43S PIC assembly and confer a similar reprogramming of TEs. To test this prediction, we depleted the 40S protein Rps26A from a strain lacking the paralog Rps26B by employing a <italic>rps26b∆</italic> mutant in which <italic>RPS26A</italic> is transcribed from the galactose-dependent, glucose-repressible <italic>P<sub>GAL1</sub></italic> promoter (for brevity, dubbed <italic>rps26∆∆</italic>).

Consistent with this, there was also a reduction in the polysome:monosome ratio in the <italic>rps26∆∆</italic> mutant, indicating a reduced rate of translation initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

The translationally repressed group of mRNAs, ΔTE<italic><sub>rps26∆∆</sub></italic>_down, showed the opposite trends for at least a subset of these attributes, including lower than average TEs in WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), larger than average CDS lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A</xref>), and shorter mRNA half-lives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3D</xref>).

Examination of the correlations between these mRNA attributes and the global ΔTE changes conferred by the <italic>rps26∆∆</italic> mutations for all expressed mRNAs again revealed significant positive correlations with TE in WT, and with transcript abundance, mRNA half-life and Kozak context score, but negative correlations with CDS and 5’UTR lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p><p>The foregoing results suggest that the TE changes conferred by elimination of Rps26 might overlap substantially with those conferred by elimination of the Tma proteins or by induction of eIF2α phosphorylation by SM treatment of WT cells. Support for this idea is provided by hierarchical clustering of the TE changes for a group of 248 mRNAs showing TE changes in response to all three conditions of the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutations, SM treatment of WT cells, or depletion of Rps26 in the <italic>rps26∆∆</italic> mutant (at p &lt; 0.05), where it can be seen that the majority of these mRNAs show TE changes in the same direction for all three conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Furthermore, the group of mRNAs whose TEs were upregulated in the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutant versus WT (ΔTE<italic><sub>tma∆∆</sub></italic>_up), and which also showed an increase in median TE in SM-treated versus untreated WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, columns 1–2), likewise displayed an increased median TE in the <italic>rps26∆∆</italic> mutant versus WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, column 3). Similar results were observed for the group of mRNAs whose TEs were down-regulated in the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutant versus WT (ΔTE<italic><sub>tma∆∆</sub></italic>_down), which also showed significant TE reductions in response to both SM treatment of WT cells and the depletion of Rps26 in the <italic>rps26∆∆</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, columns 1–3). In addition, the mRNAs whose TEs are upregulated by the <italic>rps26∆∆</italic> mutations are enriched for the GO categories of ribosomal components and ribosome biogenesis, just as observed for the responses to the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutations and SM treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>, blue versus green/maroon). Consistent with this, the group of 135 RPG mRNAs shows highly significant TE increases in the <italic>rps26∆∆</italic> mutant compared to all mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4G</xref>). Also, in accordance with the aforementioned results on the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutant and SM-treated WT, the abundance of the RPG mRNAs declines in response to depletion of Rps26 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4H</xref>), offsetting the increases in TEs and dampening the increase in translation levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4I</xref>).</p><p>Despite these commonalities in TE changes, there are sizeable groups of mRNAs whose TEs are affected differently by the <italic>rps26∆∆</italic> and <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutations. This is indicated by the relatively smaller changes in median TE conferred by the <italic>rps26∆∆</italic> mutations versus the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutations or SM treatment for the groups of mRNAs whose TEs are up- or down-regulated by the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–F</xref>, column 3 versus 1). It is also evident in the cluster analysis of the TE changes conferred by the <italic>rps26∆∆</italic> or <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutations for the group of mRNAs showing significant TE changes in response to the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutations. Although the TE changes for this group of mRNAs are significantly correlated between the <italic>rps26∆∆</italic> and <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutations (ρ = 0.37, p = 0), there are several sets of mRNAs that change by markedly different amounts or in opposite directions in the two mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6B</xref>, see bracketed blocks). Moreover, the ΔTE<italic><sub>rps26∆∆</sub></italic>_down mRNAs do not show significant enrichment for the GO categories shared by the mRNAs whose TEs are down-regulated by the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutations and SM treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Thus, as concluded above for the TE changes conferred by SM treatment, there are many TE changes specific to the depletion of Rps26 that appear to be superimposed on the tendency common to all three conditions for strong mRNAs to show increased TEs and weak mRNAs to show reduced TEs; and these differences are generally more pronounced for the <italic>rps26∆∆</italic> mutations compared to the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutations or SM treatment of WT. Below, we consider various explanations for the condition-specific changes in TE, and also explain that the shared trend is in accordance with mathematical modeling of how TEs of different groups of mRNAs should be altered by limiting concentrations of 43S PICs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The group of mRNAs with a strong propensity to form the closed-loop intermediate is translationally upregulated by loss of 40S recycling factors, increased eIF2α phosphorylation or 40S subunit depletion</title><p>The 5’ cap of mRNA is recognized by the cap-binding complex eIF4F, and interaction of the scaffolding subunit eIF4G with the poly(A) binding protein (PABP) enables mRNA circularization. There is evidence that formation of this ‘closed-loop’ intermediate stabilizes eIF4F binding at the cap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Park et al., 2011</xref>), and facilitates recycling of 40S subunits from the stop codon to the mRNA 5’ end, to increase initiation frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Uchida et al., 2002</xref>). Using RNA sequencing-immunoprecipitation (RIP-seq) analysis of eIF4F subunits, PABP and the inhibitory eIF4E-binding proteins (4EBPs), Costello et al. identified ‘Strong Closed-Loop’ (SCL) mRNAs as those enriched in occupancies of eIF4E, eIF4G, and PABP, while de-enriched for association with 4EBPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Costello et al., 2015</xref>). This group of SCL mRNAs have shorter than average 5’UTRs and CDS lengths, higher than average Kozak context scores for nucleotides surrounding the AUG start codons, are more abundant, and more stable compared to all mRNAs, and are highly translated in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–F</xref>). Noting that these attributes are enriched among the mRNAs whose TEs are elevated by elimination of the Tma proteins, eIF2α phosphorylation, or depletion of Rps26 and 40S subunits, we interrogated the TE changes for the group of SCL mRNAs conferred by each of these three conditions. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6A, C and E</xref>, the TEs of the group of SCL mRNAs are significantly elevated in each of the three conditions, whereas the abundance of these mRNAs is significantly reduced under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6B, D and F</xref>). The inference that limiting 43S PICs upregulates the TEs of SCL mRNAs is also supported by data from Thompson et al., who reported a similar upregulation of SCL mRNAs in strains lacking a ribosomal protein, including <italic>rpp1a∆</italic> and <italic>rps16b∆</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Thompson et al., 2016</xref>).

These findings support the idea that eliminating the 40S recycling factors leads to a defect in translation initiation that preferentially affects mRNAs that are inefficiently translated owing to a reduced ability to recruit 43S PICs to the 5’ end.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Examining the importance of Tma proteins for translational control by uORFs</title><p>The foregoing results support a role for Tma proteins in generating free 40S subunits to support 43S PIC assembly through their functions in ribosome recycling. We next examined whether the Tma proteins might be required for reinitiation at downstream CDSs following uORF translation in uORF-containing mRNAs, as noted above for MCT-1 and DENR in animal cells. <italic>GCN4</italic> is the best characterized yeast mRNA exhibiting efficient reinitiation, as ~50% of the 40S subunits that initiate at uORF1 can resume scanning downstream after completing uORF1 translation. Under non-starvation conditions the majority of these 40S subunits reinitiate at uORFs 2–4 and undergo translation termination and ribosome recycling before reaching the <italic>GCN4</italic> AUG. In starved cells where eIF2α is phosphorylated, ~50% of such ‘re-scanning’ 40S subunits can bypass the remaining uORFs 2–4 and reinitiate instead at the <italic>GCN4</italic> AUG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hinnebusch, 2005</xref>). If the Tma proteins enhance reinitiation on <italic>GCN4</italic> mRNA, then either single or double deletions of the <italic>TMA</italic> genes should reduce translation of the <italic>GCN4</italic> CDS in starved cells.

It was previously shown that the starvation-induced increased expression of this reporter is completely dependent on the Gcn2 kinase and the uORFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mueller and Hinnebusch, 1986</xref>). Importantly, none of the single or double deletions of the three <italic>TMA</italic> genes produced a significant reduction in <italic>GCN4-lacZ</italic> expression in SM-treated cells, except for a small ~15% reduction in the <italic>tma64∆</italic> single mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, white bars).

Presumably, this Tma-independent pathway is sufficient for robust 40S recycling at the stop codons of <italic>GCN4</italic> uORFs 3 and 4.</p><p>Going beyond the case of <italic>GCN4,</italic> we next interrogated a previously identified group of mRNAs containing uORFs, initiating with either AUG (262 mRNAs) or one of the nine near-cognate triplets (with a single mismatch to AUG; 1044 mRNAs), which showed evidence of translation in multiple ribosome profiling datasets from various mutant and WT strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). Based on previous findings that uORFs initiating with AUG codons are more likely to inhibit initiation at downstream CDSs compared to uORFs with near-cognate start codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arribere and Gilbert, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hinnebusch et al., 2016</xref>), we examined the TE changes of the main CDS for the group of 262 mRNAs containing AUG uORFs with evidence of translation in our ribosome profiling data for both the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> and WT strains, and for a second set of 385 mRNAs harboring members of a group of 438 evolutionarily conserved AUG uORFs identified by McManus et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Spealman et al., 2018</xref>). Both groups of mRNAs exhibit significant reductions in CDS TE in the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutant versus WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–C</xref>, columns 4), consistent with the possibility that reinitiation at downstream CDSs following uORF translation is diminished in the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutant. However, we found that these two groups of mRNAs also display a lower than average TE in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), and hence, might exhibit TE reductions in the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutant owing to reduced competition for limiting 43S PICs. In addition to containing uORFs, these mRNAs could have other features, such as long or structured 5’UTRs, that impede 43S PIC attachment and confer reduced initiation rates when 43S PIC levels decline in the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutant. Indeed, both groups of AUG uORF-containing mRNAs also exhibit TE reductions on SM treatment of WT cells or depletion of Rps26 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7–C</xref>, columns 5–6), conditions that are not predicted to impair possible functions of Tma proteins in reinitiation downstream of uORFs. Thus, it is difficult to ascribe the TE reductions conferred by the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutations for mRNAs with AUG uORFs to diminished reinitiation following uORF translation.</p><p>As an orthogonal approach to detecting a role for the Tma proteins in promoting reinitiation, we reasoned that a reduction in reinitiation following uORF translation in the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutant should confer an increase in the ratio of RPFs in the uORF versus CDSs, which we termed relative ribosome occupancy (RRO). Applying differential expression analysis using DESeq2 to identify statistically significant changes in RRO values revealed that none of the 843 annotated uORFs initiating with either AUG or near-cognate start codons, nor any of the evolutionarily conserved translated uORFs identified by McManus et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Spealman et al., 2018</xref>), showing evidence of translation in our WT and <italic>tma∆∆</italic> strains exhibited significant changes in RRO in the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutant versus WT cells, even at a relatively non-stringent FDR of 0.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). Furthermore, the group of 63 mRNAs with 70 annotated AUG-initiated uORFs showed no significant difference in median RRO in the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutant versus WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). In contrast, the same group of AUG uORF-containing mRNAs displayed a significant increase in the ratio of RPFs in 3’UTRs versus the main CDS, indicative of increased (not decreased) reinitiation following termination at the main CDS stop codons in the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>, column 4 versus 3), which is comparable in magnitude to that seen for all mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>, column 2 versus 1). Thus, our results provide no evidence that the Tma proteins enhance reinitiation following uORF translation in yeast cells.</p><p>Previous findings on reporter mRNAs in cell extracts suggested that Tma proteins serve to inhibit, rather than promote, reinitiation downstream of uORFs, presumably by stimulating the recycling of 40S post-TerCs at uORF stop codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Young et al., 2018</xref>). In this event, a decrease (rather than increase) in RRO might be expected for the AUG uORF-containing mRNAs in the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutant owing to increased reinitiation at downstream CDS. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>, a decrease in RRO was not observed in the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutant. Note, however, that the RPF densities might increase in the uORFs owing to queuing of 80S ribosomes behind the stalled 40S post-TerCs at the uORF stop codons, which could offset an increase in RPFs in the downstream CDSs conferred by enhanced reinitiation, and yield no net change in RRO between the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutant and WT. If so, this would confound our ability to detect increased reinitiation at the main CDSs conferred by impaired recycling at uORF stop codons by examining RRO changes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we set out to determine whether impairing the second step of ribosome recycling by eliminating Tma64/Tma20, and the predicted sequestration of 40S subunits in either stalled 40S post-TerCs, in 43S PICs scanning 3’UTRs, or in 80S ribosomes translating 3’UTR ORFs, has an impact on global TEs in yeast cells. We also wondered whether eliminating Tma64 would alter the TEs of any mRNAs owing to loss of its possible function as an alternative to eIF2 for recruiting Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> to AUG start codons in the manner demonstrated in vitro for its mammalian counterpart, eIF2D. We found that the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutant lacking both Tma64 and Tma20 exhibits reduced bulk polysome assembly, consistent with a reduced rate of translation initiation on many mRNAs; and by ribosome profiling we observed altered TEs of specific mRNAs, with sizable groups undergoing increases or decreases in relative TE compared to their values in isogenic WT cells. These groups of upregulated and down-regulated mRNAs were enriched for diametrically opposed properties. The mRNAs translationally upregulated in the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutant tend to be well-translated in WT cells and to have short CDS and 5’UTRs, strong Kozak AUG contexts, to be unusually abundant and to have longer than average half-lives—all attributes of well-translated ‘strong’ mRNAs. The mRNAs translationally down-regulated in the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutant tend to be poorly translated in WT cells and to exhibit all of the opposite properties characteristic of ‘weak’ mRNAs. The <italic>tma64∆</italic> single mutant, in contrast, displays none of the hallmarks of impaired 40S recycling, shows no reduction in bulk polysome assembly, and exhibits no statistically significant changes in TE for any mRNAs in our profiling experiments. These results suggest that the translation changes in the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutant are associated with defective ribosome recycling rather than the absence of Tma64/eIF2D per se and any possible role it might play in Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> recruitment in yeast. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that MCT-1/DENR can substitute completely for eIF2D in providing a WT level of eIF2-independent Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> recruitment in the <italic>tma64∆</italic> single mutant, and that complete loss of this function in the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutant contributes to the reprogramming of TEs.</p><p>Strikingly, the pattern of TE changes conferred by the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutations was also evident in the translational reprogramming that accompanies induction of eIF2α phosphorylation by Gcn2 on starvation for amino acids Ile/Val, and also that conferred by depletion of essential 40S subunit protein Rps26. In particular, the group of highly translated ‘SCL’ mRNAs with a heightened propensity for closed-loop formation, owing to their elevated occupancies of eIF4F and PABP, and the group of RPG mRNAs that are strongly enriched in the SCL group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1G</xref>), tend to show increased TEs in all three conditions of <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutations, SM treatment of WT cells, and depletion of Rps26. There was also a significant enrichment for ‘weak’ mRNAs among those down-regulated in all three conditions. These same trends were evident on SM treatment of the <italic>gcn4∆</italic> mutant, showing that they occur independently of the widespread transcriptional changes conferred by Gcn4 in SM-treated WT cells. Given that eIF2α phosphorylation reduces TC assembly, a key component of 43S PICs, and that both the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutations and depletion of Rps26 reduce the abundance of free 40S subunits available for PIC assembly, we suggest that the reduced concentration of 43S PICs that should exist in each case is a key factor that skews the competition between strong and weak mRNAs to favor strong mRNAs, and that this altered competition is an important driver of TE changes common to all three conditions. Supporting the idea that the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutations impair translation initiation by limiting the availability of 43S PICs, they preferentially reduced expression of <italic>LUC</italic> reporter mRNAs harboring stem-loops inserted close to the mRNA 5’ end, which are expected to impair 43S PIC attachment, compared to reporters bearing cap-distal insertions or the parental reporter lacking a stem-loop insertion.</p><p>We note that the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutant does not exhibit a reduction in the ratio of free 40S to 60S subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> (ii) versus (i)), ostensibly at odds with our suggestion that the 40S recycling defect in this mutant limits the availability of free 40S subunits for 43S PIC assembly. It is expected that a fraction of the unrecycled 40S subunits will have moved from stop codons and are scanning the 3’UTR to generate the increased 3’UTR translation previously demonstrated in the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Young et al., 2018</xref>) and observed here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Such 40S post-TerCs, located either at stop codons or scanning in 3’UTRs, may dissociate from mRNA during polysome fractionation by sucrose density gradient centrifugation because they lack base-pairing between a bound tRNA and an mRNA codon—a property which necessitated the use of formaldehyde fixation to capture scanning 40S subunits in 40S profiling experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Archer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sen et al., 2019</xref>). If so, this dissociation would prevent us from observing the predicted reduction in free 40S subunits. We have also proposed that sequestration of 40S subunits in the 80S ribosomes engaged in abnormal 3’UTR translation in the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutant, which occurs on essentially all 3’UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Young et al., 2018</xref>), also contributes to the reduced availability of free 40S subunits for PIC assembly in this mutant; and this sequestration also will not reduce the free 40S/60S ratio. Finally, the <italic>tma20∆</italic> deletion was shown to confer an elevated free 40S/60S ratio, which may result from a 60S biogenesis defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fleischer et al., 2006</xref>) and this could offset the depletion of free 40S subunits expected from accumulation of unrecycled 40S subunits at stop codons and in 3’UTRs in the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutant. Nevertheless, we cannot eliminate the possibility that the impaired ribosome recycling in the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutant is not the major defect responsible for the reprogramming of translation with features characteristic of a reduction in 43S PIC assembly. As noted above, the complete loss of eIF2-independent Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> recruitment could be involved, or a defect in ribosome biogenesis that results in aberrant 40S subunits in addition to reduced 60S subunit levels might exist, either of which could be exacerbated by defective 40S recycling to confer the reprogramming of TEs observed in the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutant.</p><p>The conclusion that conditions expected to reduce the concentration of 43S PICs favor more efficiently translated mRNAs is in full agreement with Lodish’s predictions based on mathematical modeling of the kinetics of protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lodish, 1974</xref>). A key prediction of this model is that reducing the concentration of 43S PICs will alter the TEs of particular mRNAs to different degrees depending on their inherent rates of assembling an 80S initiation complex at the start codon from mRNA and the 43S PIC (assigned an overall rate constant of K<sub>1</sub> in the model). On reducing 43S PIC levels, ‘weaker’ mRNAs (with lower K<sub>1</sub> values) will exhibit a proportionally greater reduction in translation compared to ‘stronger’ mRNAs (with higher K<sub>1</sub> values). Considering the relative TE values provided by genome-wide ribosome profiling, the model predicts that weak mRNAs will exhibit a decrease in TE relative to the average mRNA, while strong mRNAs will show an increase in relative TE on reduction of 43S PIC levels, which corresponds to the trends we observed for TE changes in the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutant, SM treatment of WT, and depletion of Rps26 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The Lodish model is supported by several studies of global translation; and other analyses suggest that reductions in 40S availability can also confer increases in absolute translation rates of very ‘strong’ mRNAs owing to reduced ribosome crowding and collisions during elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mills and Green, 2017</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model depicting how impaired 40S recycling, increased eIF2α phosphorylation, or 40S subunit depletion results in reprogramming of TEs by decreasing 43S PIC assembly.</title><p>Reducing assembly of 43S PICs in any of three different ways, (<bold>i</bold>) impairing recycling of 40S post-TerCs by the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutations, (ii) inducing phosphorylation of eIF2α by SM treatment of WT cells, or (iii) decreasing 40S subunit levels by depleting Rps26, skews the competition between inherently ‘strong’ and ‘weak’ mRNAs to favor translation of the ‘strong’ mRNAs, which have higher TEs in WT cells and tend to have shorter, less-structured 5’UTRs and shorter CDSs, compared to ‘weak’ mRNAs.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-64283-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig><p>It is formally possible that CDS length is a more fundamental driver of TE changes than the basal TE in WT cells under the three mutant/stress conditions analyzed here, but this would beg the question of the molecular mechanism involved. Shorter mRNAs might be more capable of forming the closed-loop intermediate, which could enhance eIF4F association owing to eIF4G-PABP interaction, or more capable of recycling of ribosomes in cis from the stop codon to start codon; but both features would enhance their basal TE and help them compete for limiting 43S PICs at the initiation step. It is also important to note that all the features known to be associated with high basal TE in WT cells are also associated with increased TE in our three mutants/conditions, including elevated propensity for closed-loop formation, higher than average Kozak context scores, higher than average mRNA abundance, and longer than average mRNA half-lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Costello et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Weinberg et al., 2016</xref>). Given the highly conserved inverse relationship between CDS length and TE across many different species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arava et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Thompson et al., 2016</xref>), it is likely that our finding that a short CDS is a predictor of enhanced TE in all three conditions we examined reflects the fact that mRNAs with short CDSs tend to be inherently stronger mRNAs and thus better able to compete for limiting PICs during initiation in the manner predicted by the Lodish model.</p><p>While the same trends in TE reprogramming were evident in all three mutant/stress conditions, there were also extensive condition-specific differences among the particular mRNAs being affected, and in the magnitude of changes observed for the same mRNAs. Thus, it seems clear that particular mRNAs respond to different extents, or even in different directions, to eIF2α phosphorylation induced by SM treatment, to the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutations, or to the reduction in total 40S abundance in the <italic>rps26∆∆</italic> mutant. We envision that these condition-specific responses are superimposed on the reprogramming of TEs imposed by increased competition for limiting 43S PICs to sculpt the overall profile of TE changes across the translatome in different ways.</p><p>This condition-specificity of TE changes is exemplified by translational regulation of <italic>GCN4</italic>. The TE of <italic>GCN4</italic> mRNA was strongly induced only by SM treatment, which likely reflects the exquisite sensitivity to TC levels of the delayed reinitiation mechanism via uORFs that governs <italic>GCN4</italic> translation. In this mechanism, a slowed rate of TC binding to 40S subunits scanning the <italic>GCN4</italic> mRNA leader following translation of uORF1, and not the availability of free 43S PICs per se, leads to the strong induction of <italic>GCN4</italic> translation when TC concentrations decline on eIF2α phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hinnebusch, 2005</xref>). It is possible that TE increases observed for certain other mRNAs specifically on SM treatment also result from overcoming the inhibitory effects of uORFs on downstream translation via increased eIF2α phosphorylation. This might include mRNAs with single inhibitory uORFs in addition to the more elaborate set of four regulatory uORFs found in <italic>GCN4,</italic> as reducing TC levels by eIF2α phosphorylation has been shown to mitigate the inhibitory effects of single uORFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Young and Wek, 2016</xref>). In the well-studied case of antizyme inhibitor mRNA, in which ribosome stalling occurs during translation of an inhibitory uORF, evidence indicates that eIF2α phosphorylation decreases the rate of 43S PIC loading at the mRNA 5’ end and thereby suppresses queuing of PICs upstream of the uORF start codon to allow a greater proportion of scanning ribosomes to bypass the uORF and translate the downstream CDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ivanov et al., 2018</xref>). In addition to the translation of uORF-containing mRNAs being upregulated by eIF2α phosphorylation via increased reinitiation, it is also possible that primary initiation occurs more efficiently at low TC levels on certain mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dasso et al., 1990</xref>), possibly related to the RNA-binding activity of eIF2β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Laurino et al., 1999</xref>) or to the role of eIF2 in promoting the recruitment of other eIFs to the PIC in the multifactor complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hinnebusch, 2011</xref>), and that such mRNAs would not be similarly upregulated by the diminished free 40S subunit levels predicted for the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> or <italic>rps26∆∆</italic> mutations.</p><p>One way to account for TE changes conferred specifically by elimination of the Tma factors might be to propose that mRNAs differ in their dependence on the recycling of 40S post-TerCs from the stop codon to the initiation codon of the same mRNA for reinitiation. Indeed, there are theoretical predictions that short mRNAs achieve their relatively higher TEs compared to long mRNAs by this feedback mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fernandes et al., 2017</xref>). In this view, however, shorter mRNAs would be preferentially impaired by a reduction in 40S recycling, whereas we observed that mRNAs down-regulated in the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutant tend to be longer than average. In fact, if the predicted deleterious effect of reduced 40S recycling from stop codon to start codon on short mRNAs acts to dampen the stimulatory effect of limiting 43S PICs on their translation, then this could help explain why the <italic>tma∆∆</italic> mutations confer an overall weaker reprogramming of TEs compared to SM treatment, given that eIF2α phosphorylation reduces 43S PICs without affecting recycling.</p><p>We also considered the possibility that TE changes conferred specifically by elimination of the Tma factors could arise from altered reinitiation following uORF translation, as mammalian MCT-1/DENR were shown to stimulate reinitiation in a reconstituted system, and depletion of these factors in animal cells reduces reinitiation on certain mRNAs. In yeast, by contrast, elimination of these proteins in combination with eIF2D (Tma64) had the opposite effect of enhancing reinitiation following termination at uORFs of reporter mRNAs in cell extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Young et al., 2018</xref>). However, based on our analysis of <italic>GCN4</italic> translational control, and from quantifying the ratios of ribosome densities in uORFs versus downstream CDSs (RRO values), we uncovered no evidence that eliminating the Tma proteins significantly perturbs reinitiation following uORF translation in yeast cells. Additional experiments using other indicators of reinitiation should be undertaken to examine this issue further. Recently, it was shown that elimination of DENR (Tma22) and eIF2D (Tma64) impairs translation of <italic>ATF4</italic> mRNA both in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bohlen et al., 2020</xref>) and in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vasudevan et al., 2020</xref>), which is regulated by the delayed reinitiation mechanism established for yeast <italic>GCN4</italic> mRNA. It appears that loss of DENR/eIF2D reduces reinitiation following translation of <italic>ATF4</italic> uORFs 1-2 owing to a failure to dissociate tRNAs from 40S post-TCs at the penultimate codons of these uORFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bohlen et al., 2020</xref>). Presumably, the penultimate codons in <italic>GCN4</italic> uORFs 1-2 do not require this activity of the yeast recycling factors.</p><p>There were many mRNAs whose TEs were affected specifically by depletion of Rps26 and 40S subunit levels. One possible contribution to these specific changes might be the elevated ratio of free 60S to free 40S subunits present only in this condition. This could have the effect of increasing rates of 60S subunit joining to 48S PICs at start codons by mass action, and thereby increase the relative TEs of a subset of mRNAs in which subunit joining is a rate-limiting step of initiation. Some support for this idea comes from our findings here, and from previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mittal et al., 2017</xref>), that depleting 40S subunits can impair <italic>GCN4</italic> translation, which might result from enhanced subunit joining at the inhibitory uORFs that, in turn, reduces the amount of reinitiation downstream at the <italic>GCN4</italic> CDS. Another possibility is that the aberrant-free ribosomal subunit ratios activate a signaling pathway that alters the translation of particular mRNAs in a manner distinct from the influence of limiting 43S PICs. Clearly, more work is required to achieve a full understanding of the numerous condition-specific TE changes.</p><p>Our finding that depletion of Rps26 increases the relative TEs of the group of highly-translated SCL mRNAs was also observed in profiling data from Gilbert et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Thompson et al., 2016</xref>) for two mutants lacking a different ribosomal protein belonging to the large or small subunit, in accordance with the Lodish model. However, findings ostensibly at odds with the model were presented recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ferretti et al., 2017</xref>) involving two groups of yeast mRNAs found to bind preferentially to 40S subunits either containing Rps26 (868 &quot;+Rps26&quot; mRNAs) or lacking Rps26 (743 &quot;ΔRps26&quot; mRNAs). The &quot;+Rps26&quot; mRNAs tend to be more highly translated in WT cells versus the &quot;ΔRps26&quot; mRNAs, and thus are enriched in ‘strong’ mRNAs; however, five representative mRNAs of the &quot;+Rps26&quot; group showed a greater reduction in translation on Rps26 depletion in comparison to eight representative mRNAs of the &quot;ΔRps26&quot; group. This last finding departs from the prediction of the Lodish model that strong mRNAs should be translated proportionally better than weak mRNAs on reduction of 40S subunit levels by depletion of Rps26. However, by interrogating our own ΔTE<italic><sub>rps26∆∆</sub></italic> values for the &quot;+Rps26&quot; and &quot;ΔRps26&quot; groups of mRNAs, we found an increase in median TE for the &quot;+Rps26&quot; group, and a decrease in median TE for the &quot;ΔRps26&quot; group, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>), in keeping with the Lodish model. It is unclear whether the different conclusions regarding the effects of Rps26 depletion on translation of the &quot;+Rps26&quot; and &quot;ΔRps26&quot; mRNAs in our two studies reflect differences in the strains or culture conditions (undefined rich medium there versus defined medium here), the use of polysome association (there) versus ribosome density (here) to assess TE changes, or the particular subsets of representative &quot;+Rps26&quot; and &quot;ΔRps26&quot; mRNAs interrogated for TE changes by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ferretti et al., 2017</xref>.</p><p>A recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Khajuria et al., 2018</xref> on the consequences of reducing the levels of ribosomal subunits in human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), regarded as a model of Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), also revealed a widespread reprogramming of translation quite different than observed here in the yeast <italic>rps26∆∆</italic> mutant. The mRNAs showing TE reductions in that study tended to be highly translated in untreated HSPCs, and to exhibit short CDSs and short 5’UTRs lacking uORFs, which seems at odds with the predictions of the Lodish model. Although we cannot account for this discrepancy, we note that the global TE values in the untreated HSPCs did not show the marked inverse correlation with CDS lengths that has been observed previously in yeast (including our study) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arava et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Thompson et al., 2016</xref>), and highly conserved throughout Eukarya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fernandes et al., 2017</xref>), including mouse and HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Thompson et al., 2016</xref>). We also note that examining the profiling data of Khajuria et al. indicates that the TEs of RPG mRNAs in untreated HSPCs are well below average, but were found to be above average in a study of HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guo et al., 2015</xref>), just as they are in yeast. The lower than average TEs of RPG mRNAs in HSPC cells places the reductions in their TEs conferred by reduced ribosome levels in line with the Lodish model; however, the fact that the entire cohort of translationally down-regulated mRNAs have a greater than average median TE in untreated HSPCs seems to suggest that other changes in translation factors or regulatory proteins occur in response to ribosome depletion in HSPCs that override the predicted broad outcomes of the Lodish model. As noted above, other factors also appear to modulate the response to limiting 43S PICs in our <italic>rps26∆∆</italic> mutant to produce extensive condition-specific TE changes.</p><p>At odds with our results on the <italic>rps26ΔΔ</italic> mutant, a study examining the effects of deleting many different RPGs in yeast reached the conclusion that genes for which translation was consistently lower in ribosome-deficient yeast cells had moderately shorter than average CDS lengths, whereas genes for which translation was consistently higher had dramatically longer CDS lengths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheng et al., 2019</xref>). However, using the Ribo-seq and RNA-seq data from this study to calculate TE changes, we observed no clear relationship between TE changes and CDS lengths conferred by the two 40S RPG deletions with the strongest reductions in free 40S levels (<italic>rps29b∆</italic> and <italic>rps0b∆</italic>) comparable in degree to the depletion of 40S subunits observed in our <italic>rps26∆∆</italic> mutant. Compared to the two WT strains analyzed in that study, the <italic>rps29b∆</italic> and <italic>rps0b∆</italic> mutants do not exhibit reduced relative TEs for the 20% of all mRNAs with the shortest CDS lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5A</xref>, 1st pentile); nor for the group of RPG mRNAs, which have very short CDS lengths and high basal TE values in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5B</xref>, RPG mRNAs). Whereas <italic>rps0b∆</italic> confers a small increase in relative TE for the pentile of mRNAs with longest CDS lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5A</xref>, 5th pentile), this mutation conferred a comparable increase for all mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5B</xref>, all mRNAs). Thus, although these results are incongruent with our findings on the <italic>rps26∆∆</italic> mutant, they also differ from the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Khajuria et al., 2018</xref> on the effects of depleting ribosomal subunits in human HSPCs.</p><p>In summary, our findings suggest that reducing 43S PICs in yeast either by eliminating the 40S ribosome recycling factors, inducing eIF2α phosphorylation, or depleting a 40S subunit protein, all contribute to a similar realignment of TEs wherein inherently strong mRNAs tend to undergo an increase in relative TE at the expense of weak mRNAs. As these trends are predicted by the Lodish model, which should apply generally to all eukaryotic cells, they might be expected to occur in the context of human mutations that reduce the concentration of ribosomal subunits (ribosomopathies) or that reduce the abundance or function of general initiation factors. As pointed out previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mills and Green, 2017</xref>), it may be possible therefore to produce broad changes in the TEs of many cellular mRNAs without the presence of specific regulatory sequences in the sensitive mRNAs by lowering the abundance of the initiation machinery and intensifying the competition between strong and weak mRNAs. It should be kept in mind, however, that other regulatory mechanisms present in mammalian cells but lacking in yeast could alter the outcome from the expectations of the Lodish model for TE changes in ribosomopathies, such as mTORC-mediated control of RPG mRNA translation via 5’-terminal oligopyrimidine (5’TOP) sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Meyuhas and Kahan, 2015</xref>). It is also important to realize that an increase in relative TE does not necessarily result in higher translational output, as it may coincide with a reduction in absolute TE in a situation where the median translation rate is dramatically lowered; or if it is buffered by a reduction in mRNA abundance, as observed here for the RPG mRNAs in amino acid starved yeast cells. If the function of a critical gene product is highly dose-sensitive, then a small decrease in absolute translational output could be pathological even if the relative TE of its mRNA is elevated in a disease state that involves attenuated 43S PIC assembly.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

Ribosomal RNA contamination was reduced by oligonucleotide subtraction hybridization. Each ‘subtracted’ library was amplified by PCR to add unique six nt indexes and common Illumina primer and flow cell binding regions. Quality of the libraries was assessed with a Bioanalyzer using the High Sensitivity DNA Kit (Agilent 5067–4626) and quantified by Qubit.

DESeq2 is well-suited to identifying changes in mRNA or RPF expression, or TEs, with very low incidence of false positives using results from only two highly correlated biological replicates for each of the strains/conditions being compared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lamarre et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, DESeq2 pools information from the thousands of genes analyzed to model count variances for genes of similar expression levels, which are used in a generalized linear model (GLM) to identify expression changes and place confidence intervals on the magnitude of changes, and exclude genes with aberrantly high variability. Transcriptional and translational changes are analyzed together in a GLM by including library type (mRNA-seq or Ribo-seq) as one of the variables, in addition to genotype/condition, in a multi-factor design. TE emerges as the effect of Ribo-seq library type against the mRNA-seq baseline, and significant interactions of TE with the genotype/condition indicate translational control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ingolia, 2016</xref>). The R script employed for DESeq2 analysis of TE changes can be found on Github (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/hzhanghenry/RiboProR">https://github.com/hzhanghenry/RiboProR</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Analysis of uORF translation using ribosome profiling data</title><p>Relative ribosome occupancies (RRO) of translated uORFs were calculated as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Martin-Marcos et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, translated uORFs in annotated 5′-UTRs were identified using the yassour-uorf program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brar et al., 2012</xref>), wherein the ratio of RPF counts at the +1 position (uORF start codon) to −1 position was calculated for all putative uORFs initiating with either AUG or near-cognate codons. All uORFs with +1 /−1 RPF ratios &gt; 4, combined RPF counts at the +1 and −1 positions &gt;14, and &gt;50% of the RPF counts in the zero frame with respect to the start codon were selected for further analysis. These selection criteria were applied to multiple ribosome profiling datasets to obtain a set of 6061 translated uORFs of at least three codons in length, including 564 AUG-initiated and 5497 near-cognate-initiated uORFs. The uORF identification tool RibORF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ji et al., 2015</xref>) was applied as a second filter, which is based on three nucleotide periodicity and uniformity of read distribution across uORF codons, using a probability threshold of 0.5, to obtain a final list of 2721 uORFs with evidence of translation in the profiling datasets from which they were first identified using the yassour-uorf program. A bed file containing the sequence coordinates of the 2721 uORFs was combined with bed files containing the coordinates of the 5’UTR, main CDS, and 3’UTR of each gene, and used to obtain RPF counts for the uORFs and associated main CDS in each strain examined, excluding the first and last nucleotide triplets of the 5’UTRs, the first and last codons of the uORFs, and the first 20 codons of the CDS. The RRO for each uORF was calculated by dividing RPF counts in the uORF by RPF counts of the main CDS; and statistical analysis of changes in RRO values between the two biological replicates of two different genotypes was conducted using DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Love et al., 2014</xref>), excluding uORFs with mean RPF counts &lt;2 or mean CDS RPF counts &lt;32 in the four samples (of two replicates each) combined.

The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, used to evaluate the cumulative distributions in cumulative distribution and frequency distribution plots, was computed using the R Stats package in R. Significance of gene set overlaps in Venn diagrams was evaluated with the hypergeometric distribution by Fisher's exact test computed in R using the GeneOverlap package. Pearson’s correlation and student’s t-tests analysis were done using the formula imbedded in Microsoft Excel. Scatterplots displaying correlations between read counts from replicates of ribosome profiling or RNA-seq experiments, and volcano plots, were created using the scatterplot function in Microsoft Excel.

The central hypothesis is that as yeast strains deleted for the respective genes are known to show defects in ribosome recycling, such strains might also show a reduction in functional ribosomal subunits. This hypothesis is tested by monitoring the translational efficiency of the yeast transcriptome using Ribo-Seq and RNA-Seq approaches, together with polysome profiles and reporter assays. The central conclusion is that they do indeed observe specific effects on the translational machinery which they attribute to impaired post-termination ribosome recycling, as opposed to the ablation of putative translation initiation factor activities of Tma64 and Tma20/22.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>Although the central hypothesis is clearly formulated and makes sense, the relationship between the experimental results and the hypothesis is unclear and a number of results are implicitly or explicitly presented as supporting the hypothesis, although it is not clear to me why. Specifically:</p><p>1) While the polysome profiles support the existence of some translational defect in the deletion strains, I do not think that they are consistent with a reduction in 43S PIC levels. First, there is no evidence of a change in free 40S/60S ratios which I would expect to see if 40S recycling was impaired to the extent that this would result in functional consequences.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point. We have calculated the free 40S/60S ratios and indeed found no significant decrease in the <italic>tmaΔΔ</italic> mutant. In addition, it is expected that a fraction of these unrecycled 40S subunits will have moved from the stop codon and are scanning the 3’UTR to generate the increased 3’UTR translation previously demonstrated in <italic>tmaΔΔ</italic> cells (Young et al., 2018) and confirmed here (Figure 1B). It is likely that such 40S post-termination complexes located either at stop codons or scanning in 3’UTRs will dissociate from mRNA during polysome fractionation by sucrose density gradient centrifugation because they lack base-pairing between a bound tRNA and an mRNA codon—a property which necessitated the use of formaldehyde fixation to study scanning 40S subunits by the TCP-Seq method for small-subunit profiling (Archer, S. K., et al. (2016). Nature 535(7613): 570-574), and this dissociation would prevent us from observing the predicted reduction in free 40S subunits. We have also proposed that sequestration of 40S subunits in the 80S ribosomes engaged in abnormal 3’UTR translation in <italic>tmaΔΔ</italic> cells, which occurs on essentially all 3’UTRs (Young et al., 2018), also contributes to the reduced availability of free 40S subunits for PIC assembly in this mutant; and this sequestration also will not reduce the free 40S/60S ratio. It is also relevant that the <italic>tma20Δ</italic> deletion was shown to confer an elevated free 40S/60S ratio, which may result from a 60S biogenesis defect (Fleischer et al., 2006); if so, this could offset the depletion of free 40S subunits expected from accumulation of unrecycled 40S subunits at stop codons and in 3’UTRs. All of these points have been added to the Discussion to provide a plausible explanation for the absence of a diminished ratio of free 40S to 60S subunits in <italic>tmaΔΔ</italic> cells. Moreover, we have added a statement in the Discussion that we cannot eliminate the possibility that the impaired ribosome recycling in <italic>tmaΔΔ</italic> cells is not the major defect responsible for the reprogramming of translation with the features characteristic of a reduction in 43S PIC assembly. We admit that the complete loss of eIF2-independent Met-tRNAi recruitment could be involved, or that a defect in ribosome biogenesis may result in aberrant 40S subunits in addition to reducing 60S subunit levels, either of which could be exacerbated by the defective 40S recycling in this strain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, the authors observe &quot;halfmer&quot; peaks indicative of small ribosomal subunits that are stuck at some point between transcript binding by the small subunit and large subunit joining. The halfmer intermediate is after the 43S PIC stage when the small subunit has bound the transcript, so in my view is not evidence for reduced 43S PIC levels. Consistent with this view, the RP deletion strain which serves as a reference for actual reduced 43S PIC levels does not show these half-mer peaks.</p></disp-quote><p>While it is true that halfmers result from a defect in 60S subunit joining to late-stage 48S PICs containing initiator tRNA base-paired to AUG start codons, they could also result, as we had suggested, from accumulation of unrecycled 40S subunits at stop codons, as both defects will yield an extra 40S subunit bound to mRNAs containing translating 80S ribosomes. However, since we expect the unrecycled 40S subunits at stop codons or scanning in 3’UTRs to dissociate from the mRNA during sedimentation (as just described above), we agree that the halfmers we observe in the tmaΔΔ mutant more likely arise from the 60S biogenesis defect conferred by tma20Δ with attendant accumulation of 48S PICs at AUG start codons. Accordingly, we have removed the claim that halfmers provide evidence corroborating the recycling defect in the tmaΔΔ mutant and rely instead on the queuing of 80S ribosomes upstream of stop codons and the elevated translating 80S ribosomes in 3’UTRs (both shown in Figure 1A-B) as evidence confirming the known recycling defect in the tmaΔΔ mutant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The detailed analyses of translational efficiency in tmaΔΔ strains are interesting, but the connection to post-termination recycling is established via comparisons to control strains which I do not fully follow. A comparison of the tmaΔΔ strain with a tma64 single deletion is used to make the case that the double deletion asserts its effects through a recycling defect rather than a translation initiation defect. This test is based on the observation that the mammalian TMA64 homologue can act as a translation factor. An implicit assumption in this experiment is that Tma64 and Tma20/22 have homologous activities in recycling, but only Tma64 could potentially act in translation initiation. What is the rationale for this assumption?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point, as the MCT-1/DENR heterodimer was also shown to function in eIF2-independent Met-tRNAi recruitment to AUG codons when the AUG was placed in the P site by a viral IRES (Skabkin et al., 2010). Realizing this, we were careful to limit our conclusion by saying that eliminating a function for eIF2D in initiation does not lead to re-programming of translation in the manner observed in the <italic>tmaΔΔ</italic> strain. While we think this evidence is valuable to include in the paper, we have qualified its interpretation by stating that it does not rule out the possibility that eIF2D or MCT-1/DENR are fully redundant for the putative eIF2-independent Met-tRNAi recruitment in vivo such that MCT-1/DENR would be sufficient for a completely WT level of this activity in cells lacking eIF2D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) For the metagene profiles in Figure 1A it is stated in the text that the WT profile shows &quot;the expected three nucleotide periodicity and a peak at the stop codon&quot;. In the tmaΔΔ strains, the stop codon peak is ablated but a new peak appears -30 to -40 nt upstream of the stop codon. The transition from the stop codon peak to the upstream peak is one of the main pieces of evidence for the recycling defect of the tmaΔΔ strain. In the experiment in Figure 3B which displays the tma64 control, the wild-type strain and the tma64 deletion control have neither a stop-codon peak nor a -30 peak, which makes me wonder whether this experiment was actually done under conditions comparable to the tmaΔΔ profiling.</p></disp-quote><p>The absence of a peak at -30 nt upstream of the stop codon is expected, as neither the WT strain nor <italic>tma64Δ</italic> mutant have recycling defects. In our experience, the presence of a pronounced 80S peak at stop codons varies for wild-type strains from one profiling experiment to the next, perhaps reflecting the lability of unrecycled 80S post-termination complexes in vitro. As such, the presence of translating 80S ribosomes queued upstream from stop codons and the elevated 3’UTR occupancies of translating 80S ribosomes—both stabilized by cycloheximide addition to the extracts—are the key indicators of a defect in 40S recycling at stop codons, which we have observed reproducibly in the <italic>tmaΔΔ</italic> strain (Figure 1A-B), but not in the <italic>tma64Δ</italic> single mutant (Figure 3B-C). We have modified the Results to include this explanation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The tmaΔΔ strain is compared to an amino acid starvation condition (&quot;+SM&quot;) known to lead to eIF2 phosphorylation that reduces the activity of this translation initiation factor, and later to a ribosomal protein deletion which serves as a reference for 40S subunit depletion. The TE changes in the tmaΔΔ strain appear to resemble the translation initiation defect more closely than 40S subunit depletion (Figure 5D), yet the authors conclude that the main effect of the tmaΔΔ strain is a recycling defect. This does not make sense to me.</p></disp-quote><p>As pointed out in the text, all three conditions exhibit a similar reprogramming of TEs in which inherently strong mRNAs tend to show increased TEs at the expense of weak mRNAs. We have also clearly noted the appearance of TE changes that are limited to only one of the three conditions. Although these condition-specific differences between the <italic>tmaΔΔ</italic> mutant and the other two conditions are relatively greater for the <italic>rps26ΔΔ</italic> versus SM-treated WT cells, this does not invalidate the conclusion that the <italic>tmaΔΔ</italic> mutant shows TE changes indicative of increased competition for limiting 43S PICs that favors inherently stronger mRNAs. We have discussed possible reasons for condition-specific TE changes in the Discussion, and acknowledged that more work is required to achieve a comprehensive accounting of them.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In sum of the major points, I remain unconvinced that the TE changes observed in the study really stem from recycling defects.</p></disp-quote><p>Given the strong evidence published previously by Young et al., 2018, there is little doubt that 40S recycling is impaired in the <italic>tmaΔΔ</italic> mutant. We have found no evidence for altered reinitiation following translation of uORFs in this mutant, suggesting that the other function for MCT-1/DENR established by in vivo studies in mammalian cells in regulating reinitiation following translation of certain uORFs, is not a significant driver of TE changes in the <italic>tmaΔΔ</italic> mutant. The only other viable possibility is that these proteins provide an alternative to eIF2 for recruitment of Met-tRNA to ribosomes. As noted above, having found no TE changes nor recycling defects in the <italic>tma64Δ</italic> mutant lacking eIF2D, combined with the ability of eIF2D to function on its own in Met-tRNAi recruitment in vitro established by others, the simplest interpretation of the data is that the recycling defect observed in <italic>tmaΔΔ</italic> cells contributes to the TE changes observed in the double mutant. Nevertheless, as noted above, we have added a sentence in the Discussion indicating that a 40S recycling defect and attendant sequestration of 40S subunits at stop codons and in scanning or translating 3’UTRs may not be sufficient to account for the translational reprogramming and that some other defect in the <italic>tmaΔΔ</italic> strain also contributes, which might include a ribosome biogenesis defect conferred by <italic>tma20Δ.</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>5) What is the difference between Figure 1A and supplemental figure 2?

Rather, our analysis of TE changes in this mutant, not analyzed previously, indicate a distinctive signature in which mRNAs enriched for all of the attributes of well-translated mRNAs, including greater than average TEs in WT cells, tend to show TE increases in the mutant. As this trend is predicted by theory for reductions in the availability of 43S PICs, and was also observed in the two other conditions of eIF2α phosphorylation and depletion of bulk 40S subunits analyzed here, we think it is justified to propose that a reduction in 43S PICs is an important (but not necessarily the sole) driver of the reprogramming of TEs that accompanies defective 40S recycling in the <italic>tmaΔΔ</italic> mutant. In choosing the title of the paper, we have been careful to emphasize the results that were experimentally determined, and to indicate in the Abstract that the results are consistent with a reduction in 43S PICs being an important driver of the major trend identified in the TE reprogramming observed in the <italic>tmaΔΔ</italic> mutant.

Previous work by the authors showed that depletion of the Tma proteins Tma64, Tma20, and Tma22 led to defects in small subunit recycling and reinitiation in 3'UTRs. Building off that study, the authors asked if depletion of free 40S subunits led to significant reprogramming in translated genes due to reduced initiation, namely, reduced levels of available 43S PICs. Using ribosome profiling, the authors found a significant subset of genes that were affected by loss of Tma64 and Tma20. To ascertain if these effects were due to changes in initiation, the authors also conducted ribosome profiling of cells that were starvation induced using sulfometuron methyl (SM). They found a significant overlap between affected genes in both conditions, indicating that reduced initiation was primarily responsible for these effects, although several genes showed marked differences. To modulate initiation using a different approach, the authors also conducted ribosome profiling in a rps26 depletion mutant. Again, the results showed overlaps between the three conditions with a significant number of genes also showing marked differences. From these data the authors concluded that translational reprogramming was skewed to favor &quot;strong&quot; transcripts – those transcripts that are abundant and efficiently translated – at the cost of &quot;weak&quot; transcripts, and that the responsible mechanism was changes in competition for 43S PICs due to a reduction in free 40S subunits.</p><p>The data appear of high quality and support the main conclusions of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We were gratified to see that this reviewer found our results to be both of high quality and supportive of our main conclusions, and had only minor concerns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I have a few minor concerns however:</p><p>1) Among the three different conditions tested, there were unique genes whose changes in TE did not match with others. The authors noted that the differences in the mechanisms of reduced ternary complex (TC) levels, impaired ribosome recycling, or altered ratios of free 60S to 40S subunits could act differently on specific mRNAs. This is likely to be true; for example, reduced TC clearly affects translation of genes with uORFs like GCN4, while the other two deficiencies do not. Arguably, however, this can also complicate analysis since some of these genes can have global effects on transcription (the denominator when measuring TEs). Taking GCN4 as an example, its induction leads to dramatic changes in transcript levels and in particular affects the very same genes whose TEs are used to make the main conclusion of the paper. It would be nice if the authors conducted ribosome profiling in the presence of SM, but in a GCN4-deletion strain to offset this effect.</p></disp-quote><p>It should be noted that all three conditions we analyzed lead to a down-regulation of mRNA levels and up-regulation of TEs for the ribosomal protein gene (RPG) mRNAs, a major group of highly translated, strong closed-loop mRNAs. As such, an increase in TE that buffers the decrease in abundance for these mRNAs was found in all three conditions and is not unique to the SM-treatment that induces Gcn4. Nevertheless, we have conducted ribosome profiling of SM-treated isogenic <italic>gcn4Δ</italic> cells and found that the characteristic reprogramming of TEs observed in SM-treated WT cells remains evident in the absence of the transcriptional changes induced by Gcn4. These new data have been incorporated into a new supplementary figure (Figure 2—figure supplement 2D) and described in Results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Another additional analysis that would strengthen the authors conclusions might be to analyze ribosomal profiling data of yeast subjected to other stressors (eg. Oxidative stress, glucose starvation, heat shock, etc.). Some of these are known to also inhibit initiation through various mechanisms. While those studies will not be done under the same conditions as this work, analyzing responsive genes in various contexts could further inform the ways in which these genes maintain translation even under conditions where initiation is altered. It could also highlight trends in the attributes of these transcripts or the pathways in which they operate.</p></disp-quote><p>We have analyzed other published ribosome profiling datasets to determine whether or not we observe a similar reprogramming of translation as observed in the three conditions we analyzed, involving rapamycin and diamide treatment of WT cells isogenic to the strains analyzed here. Although both conditions are reported to induce eIF2α phosphorylation, we observed induction of <italic>GCN4</italic> translation only in the rapamycin data set. These two conditions might also impact initiation in other ways, including down-regulation of eIF4G abundance or eIF4F assembly (at least for rapamycin), which could alter the pattern of translational reprogramming for mRNAs for which some other aspect of initiation is rate-limiting besides recruitment of 43S PICs to activated mRNAs. The results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> indicate that neither of these two stress conditions closely resembles the pattern of translational reprogramming we observed in all three of our conditions, with the <italic>tmaΔΔ</italic> mutant data shown for comparison.

These could have important ramifications for understanding how certain ribosomopathies can have seemingly specific effects on gene expression.</p><p>Reviewer #3 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>Summary</p><p>This manuscript examines the effect of impaired ribosome recycling on the translation of endogenous mRNAs in the budding yeast, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. They use the genome-wide techniques of ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) and RNA-seq to estimate the relative translation efficiency of each mRNA (TE: Ribo-seq counts / RNA-seq counts) and compare this quantity between mutant strains and wild-type strain. Their first major finding is that a large group of mRNAs with high baseline TE in the wild-type strain also have positive changes in TE (ΔTE) in the mutant strain with impaired ribosome recycling. These mRNAs with high baseline TE also have short CDS and 5'UTR in comparison with other mRNAs, and have been previously implicated (Costello, 2015) in strong closed loop formation through association with eIF4E, eIF4G and PABP. Their second major finding is that two other perturbations, decrease in 43S complex formation through eIF2α phosphorylation and depletion of the Rps26 ribosomal protein, also exhibit the same trend as the ribosome recycling mutant with regards to the high baseline TE mRNAs having positive ΔTE. They conclude that the high baseline TE directly drives the positive ΔTE when the availability of ribosomes for translation initiation is limited by different perturbations. This conclusion is based on a previous kinetic model and measurements by Lodish, 1974 showing that protein synthesis from well-translated β-globin mRNA is more robust against ribosome concentration decrease than protein synthesis from the less-translated α-globin mRNA. The authors suggest that their observations might be applicable to human ribosomopathy disorders which also exhibit a decrease in cellular ribosome concentration.</p><p>Major comments</p><p>1) The authors' key conclusion is that under conditions of depleted 43S complex concentration, mRNAs with inherently high rates of translation efficiency are favored for translation over other mRNAs. I am not convinced by this conclusion since it based on just correlation between ΔTE and TE without any other experiment that controls for the many confounding variables. For example, as the authors themselves note (Figure S4), ΔTE is just as strongly correlated with CDS length as it is with basal TE in all three of their key experiments (first vs. last bar in each panel in Figure S4). The authors do not present any experimental evidence that favors high TE over CDS length. It will be more accurate to present an unbiased discussion of the different possible driver parameters instead of favoring TE over other parameters.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it is formally possible that CDS length is a more fundamental driver of TE changes than the basal TE in the WT control cells, but this would beg the question of the molecular mechanism involved. Shorter mRNAs might be more capable of forming the closed-loop intermediate, which could enhance eIF4F association owing to eIF4G-PABP interaction, or more capable of recycling of ribosomes <italic>in cis</italic> from the stop codon to start codon; and both features would help them to compete for limiting 43S PIC at the initiation step. It is also important to note that all of features known to be associated with high basal TE in WT cells are also associated with increased TE in our three mutants/conditions, including elevated propensity for closed-loop formation, higher than average Kozak context scores, higher than average mRNA abundance, and longer than average mRNA half-lives. (The non-intuitive correlation between TE and mRNA abundance likely reflects the fact that efficiently expressed genes are both highly transcribed and endowed with multiple mRNA features that optimize them for translation, including a short CDS.) Given the highly conserved inverse relationship between CDS length and TE across many different species, it is likely that our finding that short CDS is a predictor of enhanced TE in all three mutant/stress conditions we examined reflects the fact that mRNAs with short CDSs tend to be inherently stronger mRNAs better able to compete for limiting PICs during initiation. We have now treated this issue thoroughly in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To substantiate the claim that TE and not some other variable such as CDS length is driving the observed ΔTE, the authors should perform reporter experiments where one of these variables is changed while the other is held constant (for example, see Thompson, 2016 Figure 3E who conclude that CDS length is critical for ΔTE when the RP Asc1 is deleted). The authors can vary TE while holding length constant and measure ΔTE in different mutant backgrounds. These experiments should not take more than a few weeks to conduct given the expertise of the authors. In fact, they use similar reporter experiments to study uORF-mediated control in this manuscript (Figure 7A).</p></disp-quote><p>For all of the reasons mentioned above regarding the strong, conserved inverse correlation between CDS length and basal TE, it is likely impossible to vary the CDS length while holding TE constant in a set of reporter constructs. We also note that for the CDS length reporters analyzed by Thompson et al. cited by the reviewer, the protocol for quantifying their translation does not allow measurement of the individual TEs for long and short CDS reporters in each strain, only the ratios of TE in mutant/WT for each reporter. As such, it cannot be ascertained whether the reporter with longer CDS actually shows a lower basal TE in WT compared to the shorter CDS reporter. In addition, these reporters require induction by galactose, which is incompatible with the culture conditions we employed in our profiling experiments. The additional suggestion for reporter assays (as we understand it) to analyze <italic>GCN4-lacZ</italic> reporters with or without uORFs as a way of varying TE while holding CDS length fixed seems to overlook the fact that this regulation by uORFs is known to be exquisitely sensitive to levels of the eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNAi ternary complex, which governs the rate of reassembly of scanning 43S PICs following termination at uORF1. We have seen in our ribosome profiling data that SM induction in WT induces <italic>GCN4</italic> translation (as expected), the <italic>tmaΔΔ</italic> mutation has no effect, and the <italic>rps26ΔΔ</italic> mutation reduces <italic>GCN4</italic> translation, which likely results from enhanced 60S subunit joining at the inhibitory uORFs owing to the elevated free 60S concentration (as we discussed). Thus, the three conditions we analyzed can have differential effects on translation of an mRNA with particular cis-acting regulatory elements, such as the <italic>GCN4</italic> uORFs, independently of their common effects in reducing 43S PIC concentrations discernible by examining large ensembles of mRNAs by ribosome profiling. As an alternative to the reviewer’s suggestion, however, we have analyzed the effect of the <italic>tmaΔΔ</italic> mutations on expression of a panel of luciferase reporters containing or lacking insertions of stem-loop structures of differing stabilities in the 5’UTR situated either close to the cap or at a cap-distal position. Importantly, we found that the <italic>tmaΔΔ</italic> mutation substantially reduced expression only of the reporters harboring a cap-proximal stem-loop, predicted to impede PIC attachment. These new data, presented in a new supplementary figure (Figure 6—figure supplement 2), support the idea that the <italic>tmaΔΔ</italic> mutation preferentially reduces the translation of poorly translated mRNAs with a relatively greater effect on mRNAs expected to be impaired for 43S PIC loading.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The relevance to ribosomopathies is highly speculative and likely not to hold given the well-known features of mammalian translation. In mammals, ribosomal protein mRNAs are down-regulated in comparison to other mRNAs due to their 5'TOP motifs when eIF2α is phosphorylated (see Sidrauski, 2015). This is the opposite of what the authors observe in yeast. The effect of ribosome depletion on translation of mammalian mRNAs is unclear (see contrasting claims by Khajuria, 2017 and Tiu, 2020).</p></disp-quote><p>While it is true that Sidrauski et al., 2015, observed a modest down-regulation of the TEs of a subset of RPG mRNAs when eIF2 is phosphorylated, they concluded that this might not involve the 5’TOP motifs of these mRNAs and the inhibition of mTORC since the effect was reversed by the eIF2B activator ISRIB and thus apparently results from eIF2α phosphorylation. Nevertheless, the regulation of RPG mRNAs in mammalian cells might not conform to the situation we observed in yeast owing to other regulatory circuits like TORC-mediated control via TOP sequences. We also agree that the reprogramming of TE changes we observed in <italic>rps26ΔΔ</italic> yeast cells is distinct from that reported for 40S protein depletions studied by Khajuria et al., 2017; which we have already treated in detail in our Discussion. We think it is worth mentioning that our results in yeast are in fact consistent with the ribosome concentration/competition model for TE changes, and that this model should be considered in evaluating TE changes in ribosomopathies, as proposed already by Eric Mills and Rachel Green, 2017, especially since there are conflicting results in different studies of mammalian 40S protein depletions. Nevertheless, we have added a statement to the Discussion indicating that other regulatory mechanisms present in mammalian cells but lacking in yeast, such as TORC-mediated control via TOP sequences, could alter the outcome from the expectations of the ribosome concentration model for TE changes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) I highly recommend providing the code used to generate the plots from raw data (or from TE tables) even if it not well organized.

This study concluded, in agreement with the findings of Khajuria et al., 2018, for human cells, that “genes for which translation was consistently lower in RP-deficient yeast cells were moderately shorter than the overall spectrum of ORF lengths, and that the genes for which translation was consistently higher in RP-deficient cells were dramatically and significantly longer than the overall spectrum of ORF lengths”. However, using the Ribo-Seq and mRNA-Seq data from this study to calculate TE changes, we observed no clear relationship between TE changes and CDS lengths conferred by the two 40S RPG deletions with the strongest reductions in free 40S levels, <italic>rps29bΔ</italic> and <italic>rps0bΔ,</italic> comparable to the depletion of 40S subunits observed in our <italic>rps26ΔΔ</italic> mutant. Compared to the two WT strains analyzed in that study, the <italic>rps29bΔ</italic> and <italic>rps0bΔ</italic> mutants do not exhibit reduced relative TEs for the 20% of all mRNAs with the shortest CDS (Figure 5—figure supplement 5A, 1<sup>st</sup> pentile); nor for the group of RPG mRNAs, which have very short CDSs and high basal TE values in WT cells (Figure 5—figure supplement 5B, RPG mRNAs). Whereas <italic>rps0bΔ</italic> confers a small increase in relative TE for the pentile of mRNAs with longest CDSs (Figure 5—figure supplement 5A, 5th pentile), this mutation conferred a comparable increase for all mRNAs (Figure 5—figure supplement 5B, all mRNAs). Thus, although these results are incongruent with our findings on the <italic>rps26ΔΔ</italic> mutant, they also differ from the findings of Khajuria et al., 2018, on the effects of depleting ribosomal subunits in human HSPCs. As pointed out already in our Results section, our conclusion that limiting 43S PICs in the three conditions we studied upregulates the TEs of the high-TE group of strong closed loop mRNAs, which have shorter than average CDS lengths and are highly enriched for the RPGs, is also supported by data from Thompson et al., 2016 who reported upregulation of the TEs of SCL mRNAs in two mutants lacking different ribosomal proteins. We’re not sure why the results in Cheng et al. on the RPG mRNAs do not agree more strongly with ours.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors have many sentences and even a section title that refer to increase in translation efficiency or translation upregulation in their experiments. Translation efficiency of most mRNAs (perhaps except GCN4) likely does not actually increase under any of these conditions. The authors note this point in their discussion, but it will be more accurate and helpful for a non-expert reader if it is discussed early in the Results section or the authors conclusions are re-worded to be more accurate. I recommend calling the Ribo-seq / RNA-seq ratio as RTE (relative translation efficiency between genes) instead of TE to avoid misinterpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have added text at the first mention of TE to indicate that relative TE values are being reported throughout; and also added the term “relative” to section headings and at relevant places in the main text that contain the word “TE”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors use Venn Diagrams to show that changes in mRNA abundance and TE are not correlated (Figure 1E, 4C). These Venn Diagrams do not allow the reader to evaluate the raw data nor do they have any statistical significance. It will be more transparent and robust if the authors plot the fold-changes in mRNA and TE against each other as a scatter plot (at least for all the TE-changing mRNAs if not all mRNAs) and indicate the correlation coefficient and associated P-value.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the P values to the Venn diagrams calculated using Fisher's exact test and have shown the values for significant over-enrichment compared to expectation by chance.

However, extensive discussion of the ribosome concentration hypothesis when it is just one possible interpretation of their data tempered my enthusiasm for this otherwise well-conceived and executed project. Rather than strongly implying that the observed results might be relevant to ribosomopathies, a more nuanced discussion of potential differences between the yeast and mammalian experiments models (while also including a discussion of Cheng, 2019) will serve to enlighten rather than confuse the non-expert reader.</p></disp-quote><p>We were gratified that this reviewer also found our evidence convincing in revealing coherent translational re-programming in response to three disparate conditions that should negatively impact 43S PIC assembly, and also judged the findings to be important, novel and of broad interest to the translation field. As indicated above, we have added a discussion of the alternative hypothesis that CDS length per se is a driver of TE re-programming and explain why we favor the idea that it is the highly conserved, inverse relationship between CDS length and inherent TE that is responsible for the tendency of short mRNAs to be upregulated under conditions of limiting 43S PICs, which can be rationalized by the ribosome concentration hypothesis. We have also tempered our claims that our findings are relevant to an understanding of TE changes in ribosomopathies, and note only that our findings in yeast are generally consistent with the ribosome concentration hypothesis, and cite published literature in which this hypothesis has been considered in examining the mechanism of translation changes in these human diseases. We have also noted that there are significant differences between the mechanism of translation initiation and cis-acting regulatory sequences in mRNAs between yeast and mammals, that might distinguish our findings from those in mammalian cells.</p><p>As noted above, we have included in the Discussion a comparison of our findings and those reported by Cheng et al., 2019, on genome-wide changes in translation conferred by deletions of different ribosomal proteins. Analyzing their data for the two 40S protein deletions with the strongest effects on cell growth and depletion of free 40S subunits, and thus most similar to our <italic>rps26ΔΔ</italic> strain, we found that their results do not appear to support their stated conclusion that, “in agreement with the findings of Khajuria et al., 2018, genes for which translation was consistently lower in RP-deficient yeast cells were moderately shorter than the overall spectrum of ORF lengths, and that the genes for which translation was consistently higher in RP-deficient cells were dramatically and significantly longer than the overall spectrum of ORF lengths (Figure 3F).” Thus, while the Chang et al. findings do not show the tendency for short, high-TE mRNAs like those of the RPGs to exhibit increased TE on depletion of 40S subunits, it is not the case that they show the exact opposite trends described in mammalian cells by Khajuria et al., 2018,. We don’t understand the differences between our two sets of findings but feel it is important that our data and analysis be published for comparison to the previously published findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewers Cross-Commenting</p><p>I agree with reviewer #1's comment about the unchanged 40S/60S ratio in the tmaΔΔ strain leading to the question of whether 43S availability is really reduced in this strain.</p><p>What do the other 2 reviewers think about the central claim in the Title and Abstract that efficiently translated mRNAs are translationally favored in the different mutant strains?
