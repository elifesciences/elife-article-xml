Through analysis of extant and ancestrally reconstructed drosophilid olfactory receptors from the Ionotropic receptor (Ir) family, we investigated evolution of two organic acid-sensing receptors, Ir75a and Ir75b. Despite their low amino acid identity, we identify a common ‘hotspot’ in their ligand-binding pocket that has a major effect on changing the specificity of both Irs, as well as at least two distinct functional transitions in Ir75a during evolution. Moreover, we show that odor specificity is refined by changes in additional, receptor-specific sites, including those outside the ligand-binding pocket. Our work reveals how a core, common determinant of ligand-tuning acts within epistatic and allosteric networks of substitutions to lead to functional evolution of olfactory receptors.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>olfactory receptor</kwd><kwd><italic>Drosophila sechellia</italic></kwd><kwd>mutation</kwd><kwd>parallel

is particularly flexible over evolutionary time, enabling animals to adapt their recognition of the vast, ever-changing universe of volatile chemicals in the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bargmann, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ramdya and Benton, 2010</xref>). This flexibility is reflected in the evolution of large, divergent families of olfactory receptors with different odor tuning properties. Several functional surveys of receptor repertoires in vertebrates (e.g., humans and the house mouse <italic>Mus musculus</italic>) and insects (e.g., the vinegar fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and the malaria mosquito <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic>) have identified ligands for many receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Carey et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hallem and Carlson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Saito et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, comparative sequence and functional analyses of orthologous receptors across species have started to identify amino acid differences that can explain species-specific receptor tuning properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adipietro et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Auer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Del Mármol et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Leary et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mainland et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Prieto-Godino et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). However, the molecular basis of functional changes in receptors over evolutionary timescales – and whether common principles in this process exist between different receptors – remains unclear.</p><p>A powerful model to study olfactory receptor evolution is the Ionotropic receptor (Ir) repertoire, a protostomian chemosensory subfamily of ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Benton et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Croset et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ni, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rytz et al., 2013</xref>). Although Irs and iGluRs have limited amino acid sequence identity, their overall conserved (predicted) secondary and tertiary structural organization suggests that the chemosensory receptors share many mechanistic similarities with their iGluR ancestors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abuin et al., 2011</xref>). The best-characterized Irs are predicted to be heterotetramers formed of two subunits of a conserved coreceptor and two subunits of a ‘tuning’ receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abuin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abuin et al., 2019</xref>). The latter are more variable in sequence both within and between species, particularly in the extracellular ligand-binding domain (LBD), consistent with their diverse odor recognition properties.</p><p>Functional characterization of Irs in different drosophilid species has revealed orthologous receptors that have distinct odor recognition properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Prieto-Godino et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Prieto-Godino et al., 2016</xref>), notably Ir75a, a receptor that probably originated in the Neodipteran ancestor (&gt;200 million years ago) and its paralog Ir75b, which arose through duplication of <italic>Ir75a</italic> in the Drosophilidae ancestor (~60–70 million years ago) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Croset et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Prieto-Godino et al., 2017</xref>). In <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. simulans</italic>, two cosmopolitan species that feed on a wide range of fermented fruit, these receptors exhibit different sensitivity toward carboxylic acids: Ir75a is tuned predominantly to acetic acid, while Ir75b responds maximally to butyric acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Prieto-Godino et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Prieto-Godino et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Silbering et al., 2011</xref>). By contrast, in the closely related island endemic <italic>D. sechellia</italic>, which feeds and breeds exclusively on the ripe noni fruit of the <italic>Morinda citrifolia</italic> shrub (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), Ir75a and Ir75b preferentially respond to butyric acid and hexanoic acid, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Prieto-Godino et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Prieto-Godino et al., 2016</xref>). These differences are likely to be ecologically significant: for example, acetic acid is a key product of microbial fermentation of vegetal material and regulates numerous behaviors in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> including attraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Becher et al., 2010</xref>), sexual receptivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gorter et al., 2016</xref>), and oviposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Joseph et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2018</xref>). Hexanoic acid is a dominant component of noni fruit and elicits attractive behaviors in <italic>D. sechellia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Amlou et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dekker et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Prieto-Godino et al., 2017</xref>). In this work, we combine comparative in vivo functional analyses of these receptors across the drosophilid phylogeny, with ancestral sequence reconstruction, site-directed mutagenesis and protein modeling to investigate their evolution.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Evolution of olfactory responses of Ir75a neurons across the drosophilid phylogeny.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Phylogeny of analyzed drosophilid species and their known ecological niches adapted from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Markow, 2015</xref>.

We tested this hypothesis by measuring odor-evoked responses of Ir75a-expressing olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) across the drosophilid phylogeny, representing &gt;40 million years divergence time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>, see Materials and methods). As stimuli we used a panel of linear carboxylic acids spanning from one- to six-carbon chains (hereafter abbreviated to C1–C6, where acetic acid is C2 and butyric acid is C4). All tested species within the <italic>melanogaster</italic>/<italic>obscura</italic> group (except for <italic>D. sechellia</italic>) displayed strongest responses to C2, similar to <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. simulans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C</xref>).

The first principal component (PC1) explains 67.5% of the variance in the data, mostly capturing the inverse variation between C2 and C4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). When plotting the C2 and C4 responses against each other, Ir75a neurons of different species segregated into two clusters with either high responses to C2 and low to C4 or vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

As this level of divergence precluded straightforward experimental determination of the relevant sites, we first approached the problem by focusing on the more recent ‘reverse’ transition of C2-sensing to C4-sensing that occurred on the branch leading to <italic>Dsec</italic>Ir75a. We had previously narrowed down this tuning switch to three amino acid positions within the internal pocket of the bilobed (S1–S2) LBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Prieto-Godino et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Simultaneous substitution of these sites in <italic>Dmel</italic>Ir75a with the residues found in <italic>Dsec</italic>Ir75a (i.e., T289S, Q536K, and F538L) produced a receptor that faithfully recapitulated the response properties of <italic>Dsec</italic>Ir75a when assessed in the Ir decoder neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Prieto-Godino et al., 2016</xref>).

If we assume that all steps along this line would be favored by selection, this observation suggests the hypothesis that the F538L change might have been the first one of the three substitutions to occur, as de novo mutations with larger effect are typically substituted first followed by those with smaller effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Holder and Bull, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Orr, 2005</xref>). An alternative hypothesis is that T289S variant already existed, perhaps as standing variation in the population (despite the lack of evidence from sequences of extant populations): T289S has little phenotypic consequence by itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and E</xref>), but it greatly augments the effect of the F538L substitution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and E</xref>). In this case, T289S and F538L would have reached fixation together in the same genetic background because their combined effect allows for a large adaptive leap from one peak (C2) to the other (C4).The Q536K change alone has an intermediate phenotype, but we suspect is unlikely to have been the first to occur, as combination with either other amino acid change leads to a less specific receptor (<italic>Dmel</italic>Ir75a<sup>Q536K,F538L</sup>, lying above-right of the line), or a receptor with overall weak sensitivity (<italic>Dmel</italic>Ir75a<sup>T289S,Q536K</sup>, lying below-left of the line) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and E</xref>).</p><p>To formalize this analysis, we calculated epistasis (i.e., nonadditive effects of different mutations), which can constrain the available evolutionary paths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aguilar-Rodríguez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Phillips, 2008</xref>). Using the projection of our physiological responses onto PC1 as our phenotypic readout, we calculated for each of the combinations of mutants (i.e., single with single, or single with double) whether the sum of the effects of each of the starting substitutions on the wild-type background was significantly different from the effect of introducing both mutations simultaneously (see Materials and methods). Notably, negative magnitude epistasis was observed in all combinations of Q536K and F538L (whether T289S was also present the background or not) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, red lines). This observation supports our previous hypothesis that whether F538L or T289S was the first mutation to occur, the second one would be the other of these two, because Q536K incurs in negative epistasis when combined with F538L and it does not lead to a monotonic increase in responses when combined with T289S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Furthermore, this visualization highlights the significant effect on tuning of the F538L substitution, as well as the minimal (statistically nonsignificant) effect of the T289S substitution, supporting its possible segregation in the population without deleterious effects.

It will be interesting to examine whether the hotspot position of Ir75a and Ir75b is relevant for understanding the evolution of ligand specificity of other Irs, and whether analogous hotspots exist in different receptor types, revealing favored (or constrained) mechanisms through which new odor detection properties evolve. Indeed, recent characterization of the functional divergence of Odorant receptor 22a (Or22a) in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. sechellia</italic> identified a key position that contributes to determining tuning specificity in other insect Ors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Auer et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The mechanistic role of the hotspot is unclear, as we still know very little about how ligands are recognized by Irs. Ir75a orthologs across the drosophilid phylogeny conserve all three main agonist-binding residues characteristic of iGluRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Benton et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mayer, 2006</xref>), suggesting that the core contacts between odors and this receptor are similar to the ancestral ligand-binding mechanism of this superfamily. One of these residues, an arginine (R297 in <italic>Dmel</italic>Ir75a), is globally conserved in diverse acid-sensing Irs, but not in nonacid-sensing receptors; this residue has previously been speculated to interact with the carboxyl group of acidic odors, analogous to the interaction of iGluRs and the α-carboxyl group of the glutamate ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abuin et al., 2011</xref>). Consistently, mutation of this residue in one receptor (Ir84a) completely abolishes ligand-evoked responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abuin et al., 2011</xref>). The hotspot in Ir75a and Ir75b is located at some distance from this arginine (predicted &gt;9 Å, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), which, together with the less drastic effect of its mutation, suggests the hotspot may only indirectly impact ligand–receptor interactions and/or influence ligand-induced LBD conformational changes. The latter mechanism may be a more subtle way of modifying the tuning profile of these receptors without the risk of complete loss of function. Determination of the mechanistic impact of hotspot mutations is an important future priority, but will likely require experimentally determined structures of odor-free and odor-bound Ir LBDs. Such knowledge may also inform our understanding of the mechanism of ligand-induced gating in iGluRs, where the equivalent position (Y732 [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>]) is thought to have a function in ligand-induced channel gating although its precise role is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Armstrong and Gouaux, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mamonova et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>While the hotspot is clearly important, its contribution to modification of tuning properties is shaped by additional changes in these receptors. For Ir75a, there are two additional substitutions within the ligand-binding pocket, while for Ir75b, one or more residues located on the external surface of the LBD are relevant. In both cases, the functional consequences of combining these substitutions with that of the hotspot are not easily predicted from their individual impact, revealing complex epistatic interactions. Moreover, the distance of these additional residues from the predicted odor-binding site suggests the existence of allosteric effects of certain amino acid positions on odor/receptor interactions. These results are of interest in light of molecular evolutionary analyses of olfactory receptor repertoires, which have identified numerous residues under positive selection (or relaxed purifying selection) in different receptors – implying a contribution to functional divergence – in regions far from the predicted ligand-binding pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arguello et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gardiner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Smadja et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Steiger et al., 2010</xref>). Together, such observations argue that the evolution of olfactory receptor specificity does not simply arise by alterations in direct contacts of receptors with odor ligands, but rather can emerge from a complex network of interactions of amino acid substitutions – with major or minor effects – both near and far from the ligand-binding site.</p><p>One clear limitation of our study is the restriction of our profiling to a set of linear carboxylic acids at a single concentration. While these ligands are found in nature and are the best agonists for these receptors among many screened odors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Silbering et al., 2011</xref>), they necessarily only give a partial insight into the functional changes of individual receptors. The C4 to C6 switch of Ir75b in <italic>D. sechellia</italic> is likely related to high abundance of C6 in its sole host fruit (noni). For Ir75a, the ecological framework is less clear: we speculate that the C4 to C2 switch in the <italic>melanogaster</italic>/<italic>obscura</italic> ancestor may be related to the use of host fruits with acetic acid producing bacteria. Such sensitivity may have been no longer relevant for <italic>D. sechellia</italic> which preferentially feeds upon ripe (nonfermenting) noni fruit (which contains much more C4 than C2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Auer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Farine et al., 1996</xref>]). Future expansion of the odor profiling of these species’ receptors will be essential to understand the pressures in the natural world that have selected for olfactory receptor proteins with new chemical recognition properties. Such knowledge, together with mechanistic insight into ligand/receptor interactions, may be useful to reengineer the ligand-binding specificities of receptors to create, for example, chemogenetic tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fukabori et al., 2020</xref>) or design pharmacological manipulators to control the olfactory-guided behaviors of pest insects.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> strains and culture</title><p>Flies were maintained on a standard culture medium at 25°C in 12 hr light:12 hr dark conditions.

For all stimuli, 10 μl odor (1% vol/vol in solvent) were used, and presented to the animal in a 500 ms pulse. ac2 sensilla were identified in different species by targeting sensilla at antennal locations where ac2 are found in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, and using pyridine as a diagnostic odor, which activates the ac2 neuron expressing Ir41a and appears to be conserved across species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). CAS numbers of odors are as follows: formic acid (64-18-6), acetic acid (64-19-7), propionic acid (79-09-4), butyric acid (107-92-6), pentanoic acid (109-52-4), hexanoic acid (142-62-1), pyridine (110-86-1) (diagnostic for ac2), and octanol (111-87-5) (diagnostic for ac3). Odor-evoked responses were calculated by summing the activity of all OSNs in a sensillum to a given stimulus, as reliable spike sorting is not possible and other neurons housed in the ac2 or ac4 sensilla do not respond to acidic odors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Silbering et al., 2011</xref>). We counted the number of spikes in a 500 ms window at stimulus delivery (200 ms after stimulus onset due to a delay introduced by the air path), subtracted the number of spikes in a 500 ms window 2 s before stimulus delivery, and doubled the result to obtain spikes/s. To calculate solvent-corrected responses (as shown in the figures), we subtracted from the response to each diluted odor, the response obtained when stimulating with the corresponding solvent, water for all odors except for pyridine and octanol, which were dissolved in paraffin oil (8012-95-1). A maximum of four sensilla were tested per animal, and individual genotypes were measured, in an interleaved fashion, on multiple independent days. Normalized responses were calculated by dividing solvent-corrected responses of a given sensillum to each odor by the maximal response of that sensillum, such that each sensillum always had one odor whose normalized response was 1. A prerequisite for PCA analysis is to input <italic>z</italic>-scored responses; these were calculated with the in-built function of MATLAB, which works according to the definition of <italic>z</italic>-scoring, that is, across each sensillum recording, each response was subtracted from the mean response of all sensillar responses and divided by the standard deviation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>PCA was carried with in-built MATLAB functions.

When performing multiple comparisons, p values were corrected using the Bonferroni method. Epistasis was calculated by determining whether the effects of each individual mutation added linearly, by comparing the observed responses of the combination of two (or three) mutations with the expected distribution of responses if those mutations were added linearly. Briefly, to generate expected response distributions for the linear combination of the mutations, we subtracted the mean responses of the initial receptor from the two ‘intermediate’ receptors, which provides the ‘effect’ of each mutation(s) individually; we then we took 1000 random samples from the ‘effects’ of each of the two mutations and summed them to generate a distribution of the expected responses if the two effects of each mutation added linearly. To determine whether two mutations interacted epistatically, we statistically compared the expected distribution with the actual distribution (the double (or triple) mutant combination) using a Wilcoxon test. If the result of this test was p &lt; 0.05 after correction for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni method, the two mutations were considered to interact epistatically.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Protein model visualization and comparison</title><p><italic>Dmel</italic>Ir75a and <italic>Dmel</italic>Ir75b models were predicted by AlphaFold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Catherine Dulac as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>As you will see below, all reviewers were enthusiastic about the study, but noted that certain aspects of the paper required additional attention. In preparing your revision, please prioritize the following items. I have also included all reviewer comments for your benefit.</p><p>1) All reviewers had concerns about the structural modeling and ligand docking, and suggested either substantial additional validation or removal of this portion of the paper.</p><p>2) All reviewers agreed that analysis of ligand preference based on a single concentration was insufficient, and asked for more detailed receptor/ligand dose response curves.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Conclusions about odor preference of the ancestral receptor presumably boil down to whether position 538 in the ancestral receptor is F or L. Does mutation of that one position flip the ligand preference of the ancestral receptor, and if so, what is the level of mathematical confidence for assignment of L rather than F at this position in the ancestral state?</p><p>2. IR75a assignments in Figure 1 appear to be based on anatomical proximity to pyridine-responsive sensilla. It seems possible that this anatomical arrangement could change in divergent species. The authors should provide additional supportive evidence that C4 preference in the measured sensilla of D. Wil and D. moj is in fact due to IR75a; one way to do this would be to test in the empty neuron model used in Figure 2.</p><p>3. The authors analyze responses at a single concentration- the sensitivity and amplitude of olfactory receptor responses amplitude are not always correlated across ligands. It would be useful to extend analysis in Figure 2 and/or Figure 1 to a few additional test concentrations.</p><p>4. Two aspects of the manuscript: the structural modeling and evolutionary timeline (p5-6) are pretty speculative. The authors appropriately acknowledge the caveats of modeling in the discussion, yet conclusions based on these models may still be highlighted too much. The evolutionary timeline seems like even more of a reach as it is not yet clear whether changes in ligand preference are capable of driving selective pressure on evolution of these receptors (in the absence of behavioral experiments), or whether ligands analyzed are the most ecologically relevant.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Following up on the 3 points raised earlier, it would be most insightful to see whether intraspecific variation matches their hypotheses on the fixation rate or frequency of the analyzed polymorphisms. This would provide an independent source of validation of their analysis, as well as ecological support to the premise of focusing on C2-C4 ligands, addressing most of the points raised earlier as weaknesses. Datasets that contain population genomic data are available for <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D.sechellia</italic> (generated by the Benton group and others), and the authors mention briefly that they were unable to retrieve relevant information, I wonder if they could expand on their findings when parsing these data.</p><p>In terms of docking results, I am inclined to suggest removing this section altogether, as I truly believe the remainder of the work is extremely valuable on its own. However, if the authors choose to keep it, I think this section would be stronger if there was more extensive characterization to validate the proposed models. For example, the authors dock various C2 and C4 ligands onto a Dmel homology model of Ir75a. Since these experiments are in silico and relatively fast and inexpensive, it would be helpful to dock other known ligands and evaluate whether an overall qualitative agreement between docking scores and ligand activity can be found. Alternatively, they could generate models of the orthologous Ir75a proteins in the clade for which they have collected experimental data, and dock C2-C4 ligands and attempt to find agreement between modeling results and experimental results.</p><p>An alternative approach that would increase the value of this section would be to show that indeed the identity of the 538 residue impacts perhaps the neuronal behavior in terms of spiking dynamics or amplitudes, or otherwise any other aspect that could show that the coupling between ligand-binding and receptor function differs between mutants. This is I imagine less trivial than extending the modeling attempts, so it is entirely optional, but is an alternative that would help support the idea that this residue does not immediately interact with the ligand but rather has a coupling role.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The definition of 'hotspot' is unclear. As the authors mentioned in Discussion, if they want to say that this is a 'hotspot' residue in the IR family and to expand the argument to the entire IR family, other IRs should be examined. If they want to argue in terms of evolution whether it is random or positive under the selective pressure, evidence is not enough. Although the biological meaning of IR75a in Dsec is unclear, the authors seem to be claiming that C4-specific evolution is a positive selection. These points regarding 'hotspot' should be carefully discussed in the paper.</p><p>2. In the same line with the above comment, the authors should give discussion about the recent report that tuning of Or22a is important for attraction to noni and thus, a molecular evolution of Or22a appears to affect food preference and selection (Nature 579, 402-408, 2020).</p><p>3. In Figure 1c, the response amplitude in Dmel and Dsec to C2 looks similar, and thus, I wonder whether we can conclude that Dmel but not Dsec is 'C2-sensing'. Since the responsiveness of Dmel IR75a is much weaker than other species, it may be a unique receptor and have evolved independently.</p><p>4. Why is the responsiveness of Dsec to C4 in Figure 1C and 2C different (i.e. 200 Hz in Figure 1C and 70 Hz in Figure 2C)? Is it possible that the complex with endogenous co-receptor DmelIR8a is not properly formed? I wonder whether the responsiveness in <italic>Drosophila</italic> other than Dmel is indeed recapitulated in 'IR decoder neuron'.</p><p>5. A289 also appears in the course of C4-C2 evolution, and further, this residue seems to be involved in ligand binding according to the double mutation result in Figure 3. Therefore, I am curious about T289A.</p><p>6. In Docking simulation (Figure 4), only the binding mode of the top rank is argued. Since the homology modeling is not accurate, at least top 10 stable models should be analyzed.</p><p>7. In Figure 4C, the docking score is better for C4 than C2, which is inconsistent with the responsiveness of DmelIR75a.</p><p>8. In comparison with the GluA2 LBD/glutamate co-crystal, the authors mention 'equivalent to that of the a-carboxyl group of the glutamate ligand with a conserved arginine in iGluRs (line 313-314), but it looks to me that the angle of the binding is quite different,. Based on this observation, I am not sure whether it can be concluded that F538 and T523 are not involved in ligand binding.</p><p>9. I would like to see the docking simulation of F528L to see whether the simulation method itself is reliable.</p><p>10. Docking simulation for IR75b would be a good comparison, since the ligand selectivity is similar with IR75a.</p><p>11. I cannot find a logic for choosing amino acids for mutation in Figure 5A. In addition, we cannot tell which amino acid is important for ligand selectivity from the swapping of the entire S1.</p><p>12. The X-axis label in Figure 1e is wrong?</p><p>13. The color is hard to be distinguished in Figure 3B and C.</p><p>14. In Figure 5B, DsecIR75b should be read DmelIR75b?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69732.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>As you will see below, all reviewers were enthusiastic about the study, but noted that certain aspects of the paper required additional attention.

For example, secondary structural elements have better continuity (in the previous models, there were several secondary structural elements that were connected by “spaghetti-like” strings of residues), and the amino-acid side chains generally have more natural poses (in the previous models, certain side chains had odd geometries or were buried unnaturally in pockets). Thus, we consider presenting the new models to show the relative location of various residues within the context of the LBD and the putative subunit interfaces is still useful.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-69732-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>We repeated the ligand docking analyses using the AlphaFold models. While ligands could be docked deeper in the binding pocket – which might be consistent with more plausible poses – and often showed the interaction between the carboxyl group with the conserved Arg residue (as highlighted in the first submission), several poses revealed less clear physical separation of ligand and hotspot. As in our original analysis, the docking scores of different poses was rather similar, preventing any sort of confident ranking. Beyond the caveats of ligand docking into protein models, the docking software was designed to best dock ligands with low μM or even nM affinity, while limited pharmacological data on other Irs indicate that these receptors can have EC50 values of several 10s-100s μM (e.g., PMID 28067294). As such, we agree with the reviewers’ caution regarding the docking, and do not include any such analyses in the revised manuscript. All speculation about the mechanistic role of the hotspot is limited, briefly, to the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) All reviewers agreed that analysis of ligand preference based on a single concentration was insufficient, and asked for more detailed receptor/ligand dose response curves.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree, as we acknowledge in the Discussion, that the single concentration used for the experiments only provides a partial view of the changes in odor tuning profile.</p><p>We have now generated dose-response curves for endogenous ac2 Ir75a neurons in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. sechellia</italic> (the two key comparison species of the work) for acetic acid (C2), propionic acid (C3) and butyric acid (C4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>) .</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-69732-sa2-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Several observations can be made from these data. First, the dynamic range of neuronal responses is relatively narrow: for example, for <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> ac2, none of these ligands evoke clear responses at the 10<sup>-4</sup> (v/v) concentration. The low sensitivity of Ir neurons to their ligands (compared, for example, to Or neurons) has previously been recognized (e.g., PMID 23162431, Figure 1). Second, we find the highest odor doses (10<sup>-1</sup>) evokes, for several neuron/odor combinations, a smaller number of spikes than lower odor concentrations (e.g., C3 and C4 in <italic>D. sechellia</italic>). We do not think this non-linearity reflects an unusual pharmacological property of the Ir itself, but rather technical limitations of in vivo recordings from insect olfactory sensilla. High odor doses can lead to changes in spike amplitude (either “pinching” or increases) and non-specific activation of multiple neurons within a sensilla (with the potential for ephaptic inhibition between these neurons, e.g., PMID 23172146). Determination of the isolated spiking response of a given neuron to an odor can therefore be difficult; we also note that spiking is a fairly distal signaling event from the biochemical process of odor activation of the receptor. As such, defining the real “saturated” neuronal responses – to be able to calculate neuronal/receptor pharmacological properties, such as EC50 – is not trivial in vivo, at least in Ir neurons. Despite these drawbacks, we highlight that relative potency of the ligands is maintained across the concentrations tested, e.g., C2 always evokes the highest responses in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> Ir75a neurons, and C4 always evokes the highest response in <italic>D. sechellia</italic> Ir75a neurons (and vice versa). Thus, we believe our analysis of a single concentration still captures the fundamental differences in tuning profile of these receptors. We have made substantial efforts to pharmacologically characterize these Irs in <italic>Xenopus oocytes</italic>, through two-electrode voltage clamp recordings, with the goal of determining the contribution of specific residues to ligand/receptor affinity and/or channel gating efficiency. Unfortunately, difficulties to obtain reliable Ir-dependent current responses to odor presentation, and to establish the plateau of dose response curves – as was already evident from our first published TEVC recordings (PMID 21220098, Figure 4F) preclude clear conclusions. Similar efforts to functionally express in Irs in cultured mammalian cells has proven even less successful. Regarding the choice of concentration, the starting point of our work was in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, where the 10<sup>-2</sup> concentration effectively separates the responses of C2, C3 and C4, while avoiding the potential issues with higher stimulus concentrations. 10<sup>-2</sup> is a very standard concentration used in the field, though of course we note that the (unknown) number of odor molecules reaching the antennae also depends upon the method of stimulus delivery (e.g., odor volume, air flow). Whether the 10<sup>-2</sup> stimulus is ecologically relevant is difficult to know, but we do point out that as this concentration evokes a sub-maximal neuron spiking frequency, it is presumably within the range of what a neuron can respond to in nature. Moreover, natural odor sources can have high chemical concentrations, such as vinegar (where the proportion of C2 can be 4-8% or more) and noni fruit (where hexanoic acid (C6), may represent up to 40% of the volatiles, PMID 32132713). We do acknowledge that, based upon the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>, for <italic>D. sechellia</italic> Ir75a neurons, 10<sup>-3</sup> better discriminates responses to different odors. However, the vast majority of analyses in our paper use the Ir decoder system, where spiking responses of Ir75a receptor variants are generally lower, so 10<sup>-2</sup> is likely to have been a good compromise.We hope these data and discussion will satisfy the reviewers. We fully acknowledge that, short of repeating all the experiments in this manuscript with dose-response curves of all receptors to all odors (which may or may not produce biologically meaningful “curves” due to the issues described above), we have only a partial view of the functional properties of these receptors. Nevertheless, we do not think that this limitation impacts the most important conclusions of our work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. Conclusions about odor preference of the ancestral receptor presumably boil down to whether position 538 in the ancestral receptor is F or L. Does mutation of that one position flip the ligand preference of the ancestral receptor, and if so, what is the level of mathematical confidence for assignment of L rather than F at this position in the ancestral state?</p></disp-quote><p>We do not know whether mutation of this one position in the ancestral receptor is sufficient to flip the specificity, though we agree this would be a simple prediction we can test in the future. However, in all reconstructions L538 has a marginal posterior probability of 1 (i.e., maximal confidence).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. IR75a assignments in Figure 1 appear to be based on anatomical proximity to pyridine-responsive sensilla. It seems possible that this anatomical arrangement could change in divergent species. The authors should provide additional supportive evidence that C4 preference in the measured sensilla of D. Wil and D. moj is in fact due to IR75a; one way to do this would be to test in the empty neuron model used in Figure 2.</p></disp-quote><p>The Ir75a neuron assignments are based upon (i) presence in the morphologically-distinguishable coeloconic sensilla, (ii) stereotyped spatial location of the ac2 sensillum class on the antennal surface, and (iii) pairing of these acid-sensing neurons with a pyridine-responsive neuron (diagnostic of Ir41a neurons). Changes in neuron pairing in the drosophilid genus appears to be incredibly rare, as indicated by surveys of multiple sensilla types in multiple species (e.g., PMID 28111079 and 14667348). In fact, we do not know of <italic>any</italic> cases where the grouping of neurons within a sensillum has changed between these species. This may be because such an adaptation would require developmental reprogramming of these lineages, which is genetically presumably more complex than “simple” re-tuning of a receptor. Of particular relevance to our study, a previous survey in <italic>D. mojavensis</italic> of responses of Ir-expressing coeloconic sensilla OSNs to a large odor panel revealed global strong conservation compared to <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (PMID 30107159). (We note that in this study acetic acid was not included in the odor panel, so the important switch of odor specificity that we describe in our work was not appreciated). We believe it is highly unlikely therefore that there has been a switch in receptor identity.</p><p>We have attempted to visualize the pairing of Ir75a and Ir41a neurons in ac2, but RNA FISH for Ir41a has never been successful (perhaps due to low expression levels). We acknowledge that definitive evidence that the responses we assign to the “Ir75a neuron” in the different species is due to Ir75a function would require mutation of these genes in these species, or misexpression of the receptor genes in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, but we do not currently have the necessary genetic reagents.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors analyze responses at a single concentration – the sensitivity and amplitude of olfactory receptor responses amplitude are not always correlated across ligands. It would be useful to extend analysis in Figure 2 and/or Figure 1 to a few additional test concentrations.</p></disp-quote><p>We respond to this point in the general comments above. Importantly, the relative sensitivity to different odors is maintained across the range of concentrations tested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Two aspects of the manuscript: the structural modeling and evolutionary timeline (p5-6) are pretty speculative. The authors appropriately acknowledge the caveats of modeling in the discussion, yet conclusions based on these models may still be highlighted too much.</p></disp-quote><p>As described above in the general comments, we now present what we consider are better protein models to illustrate the relative position of different residues in the LBD but have removed all docking analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The evolutionary timeline seems like even more of a reach as it is not yet clear whether changes in ligand preference are capable of driving selective pressure on evolution of these receptors (in the absence of behavioral experiments).</p></disp-quote><p>We are not quite sure what the reviewer means by “whether changes in ligand preference are capable of driving selective pressure on evolution of these receptors” but if we interpret the sense of this statement correctly we agree we cannot (and have not) made any direct inference about how changes in ligand specificity may have occurred in response to environmental selection pressures through changes in reproductive success (which ultimately is what leads to alteration in allele frequencies in a population). Evidence for selection on specific residues can only be derived from population genetic studies, which is not possible for these sites (as they are unvarying within species in at least the sequenced populations of drosophilids). The “evolutionary timeline” we discuss concerns the potential order of mutations in Ir75a based solely upon their phenotypic contribution to the receptor response properties. To our knowledge, such questions have not been widely discussed in the olfactory receptor literature, though they are extensively studied in other types of evolving proteins. We were simply keen to air such interesting questions in this study system, while aiming to be appropriately circumspect about the strength of the evidence for any particular model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Or whether ligands analyzed are the most ecologically relevant.</p></disp-quote><p>Whether the “best”/ecologically-relevant ligand has been identified is an issue at the crux of many olfactory studies. For the Irs we study here, our starting point was information from electrophysiological deorphanization screens of their neurons using diverse chemical classes of odors (PMID 21940430 and 16162917). The ligands we use evoke the highest (or among the highest) responses for each receptor; these chemicals are also found in relevant ecological contexts of the drosophilid species. We cannot of course exclude that better ones exist, but we presume that these are likely to be different types of carboxylic acids.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Following up on the 3 points raised earlier, it would be most insightful to see whether intraspecific variation matches their hypotheses on the fixation rate or frequency of the analyzed polymorphisms. This would provide an independent source of validation of their analysis, as well as ecological support to the premise of focusing on C2-C4 ligands, addressing most of the points raised earlier as weaknesses. Datasets that contain population genomic data are available for <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D.sechellia</italic> (generated by the Benton group and others), and the authors mention briefly that they were unable to retrieve relevant information, I wonder if they could expand on their findings when parsing these data.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added additional information to the manuscript on the results of our (ultimately uninformative) survey of intraspecific genetic variation in these drosophilids.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In terms of docking results, I am inclined to suggest removing this section altogether, as I truly believe the remainder of the work is extremely valuable on its own. However, if the authors choose to keep it, I think this section would be stronger if there was more extensive characterization to validate the proposed models. For example, the authors dock various C2 and C4 ligands onto a Dmel homology model of Ir75a. Since these experiments are in silico and relatively fast and inexpensive, it would be helpful to dock other known ligands and evaluate whether an overall qualitative agreement between docking scores and ligand activity can be found. Alternatively, they could generate models of the orthologous Ir75a proteins in the clade for which they have collected experimental data, and dock C2-C4 ligands and attempt to find agreement between modeling results and experimental results.</p></disp-quote><p>As described above in the general comments, we now present what we consider are better protein models to highlight the relative position of different residues in the LBD but have removed all docking analyses.

This is I imagine less trivial than extending the modeling attempts, so it is entirely optional, but is an alternative that would help support the idea that this residue does not immediately interact with the ligand but rather has a coupling role.</p></disp-quote><p>We are also very keen to gain mechanistic insight into the effect of these mutations, but such efforts are indeed not trivial and extend beyond the work of the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. The definition of 'hotspot' is unclear. As the authors mentioned in Discussion, if they want to say that this is a 'hotspot' residue in the IR family and to expand the argument to the entire IR family, other IRs should be examined. If they want to argue in terms of evolution whether it is random or positive under the selective pressure, evidence is not enough. Although the biological meaning of IR75a in Dsec is unclear, the authors seem to be claiming that C4-specific evolution is a positive selection. These points regarding 'hotspot' should be carefully discussed in the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We have rephrased the Discussion text to clarify that our definition of hotspot pertains <italic>only</italic> to the Irs studied in our work.

In the same line with the above comment, the authors should give discussion about the recent report that tuning of Or22a is important for attraction to noni and thus, a molecular evolution of Or22a appears to affect food preference and selection (Nature 579, 402-408, 2020).</p></disp-quote><p>We now refer to this study in the same paragraph: “Indeed, recent characterization of the functional divergence of Odorant receptor 22a (Or22a) in</p><p><italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. sechellia</italic> identified a key position that contributes to determining tuning specificity in other insect Ors (Auer et al., 2020).”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In Figure 1c, the response amplitude in Dmel and Dsec to C2 looks similar, and thus, I wonder whether we can conclude that Dmel but not Dsec is 'C2-sensing'.

Side-by-side comparison of endogenous neuronal responses in different species can be difficult, as other factors can impact absolute spiking rates (as the reviewer notes, for this wild-type strain of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, maximal spike frequencies are overall lower than for other species). Comparisons of responses of the receptor heterologously expressed in the Ir decoder neuron (Figure 2), more clearly shows that <italic>Dmel</italic>Ir75a responds more strongly to C2 than <italic>Dsec</italic>Ir75a. We have taken care in this revision to avoid the simplistic terminology that <italic>Dmel</italic>Ir75a is a “C2 sensor” and <italic>Dsec</italic>Ir75a is a “C4 sensor”, as it is clear from all the profiles that these receptors respond predominantly to one ligand but often more weakly to neighboring odors in the linear series of acids.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Why is the responsiveness of Dsec to C4 in Figure 1C and 2C different (i.e. 200 Hz in Figure 1C and 70 Hz in Figure 2C)? Is it possible that the complex with endogenous co-receptor DmelIR8a is not properly formed? I wonder whether the responsiveness in <italic>Drosophila</italic> other than Dmel is indeed recapitulated in 'IR decoder neuron'.</p></disp-quote><p>This difference in responsiveness is most easily explained by the fact that these recordings are from different neurons in different sensilla types (endogenous ac2 neuron vs heterologous ac4 neurons) as absolute number of spikes may be impacted by receptor protein expression levels, sensilla ultrastructure etc. The reviewer’s proposal that complex formation between <italic>Dmel</italic>Ir8a and an Ir from another species might be a further factor, but we suspect this has a fairly minor influence as Ir8a is highly conserved between <italic>Dmel</italic> and <italic>Dsec</italic> (97% amino acid identity); moreover, differential responses have been observed for <italic>Dmel</italic> receptors when expressed in their native and heterologous (but still <italic>Dmel</italic>) neuronal environment, e.g., Ir84a (PMID 21220098) and Ir75a (PMID 27776356).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

The set of mutations along the bottom row of panel A represent a test of these S1 residues alone (“DsecS1”) alone, in combination with the hotspot (“DsecS1,T523S”) and finally in combination with all of the LBD pocket residues in S2 (“DsecS1,4mutS2”).</p><p>The reviewer is correct that our data do not reveal which amino acid(s) are important within S1.
