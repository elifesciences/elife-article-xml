endogenous EGF receptor (EGFR) with GFP and demonstrate that picomolar concentrations of EGFR ligand drive signaling and endocytosis of EGFR in tumors in vivo (Pinilla-Macua et al., 2017). We now use gene-editing to insert a fluorogen activating protein (FAP) in the EGFR extracellular domain. Binding of the tandem dye pair MG-Bis-SA to FAP-EGFR provides a ratiometric pH-sensitive model with dual fluorescence excitation and a single far-red emission. The excitation ratio of fluorescence intensities was demonstrated to faithfully report the fraction of FAP-EGFR located in acidic endosomal/lysosomal compartments. Coupling native FAP-EGFR expression with the high method sensitivity has allowed development of a high-throughput assay to measure the rates of clathrin-mediated FAP-EGFR endocytosis stimulated with physiological EGF concentrations. The assay was utilized to screen a phosphatase siRNA library. These studies highlight the utility of endogenous pH-sensitive FAP-receptor chimeras in high-throughput analysis of endocytosis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>EGF receptor</kwd><kwd>endocytosis</kwd><kwd>RNAi</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM124186</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Watkins</surname><given-names>Simon C</given-names></name><name><surname>Sorkin</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01EB017268</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bruchez</surname><given-names>Marcel P</given-names></name><name><surname>Watkins</surname><given-names>Simon C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM114075</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bruchez</surname><given-names>Marcel P</given-names></name><name><surname>Watkins</surname><given-names>Simon C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing was used to generate a novel endogenous pH-sensitive EGF receptor chimera with the unique utility to study receptor endocytosis in a single-cell and high-throughput experimental formats.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ligand binding to EGFR at the cell surface leads to activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase activity, initiation of multiple signaling cascades and ultimately cell proliferation, differentiation or oncogenic transformation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lemmon and Schlessinger, 2010</xref>). Ligand binding also results in rapid endocytosis of EGFR and subsequent degradation of the receptor in lysosomes (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sorkin and Goh, 2009a</xref>). Endocytosis and lysosomal degradation are thought to be the major regulators of EGFR signaling (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sigismund et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sorkin and von Zastrow, 2009b</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms of EGFR endocytosis are not well understood. Multiple pathways of EGFR endocytosis have been documented including clathrin-mediated (CME) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gorden et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hanover et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Motley et al., 2003</xref>) and clathrin-independent endocytosis (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Caldieri et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Orth et al., 2006</xref>). While receptor ubiquitination by the Cbl E3 ubiquitin ligase has been proposed to be one of the redundant mechanisms of the EGFR CME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fortian et al., 2015</xref>), EGFR internalization was shown to be normal in mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from a double-knockout of c-Cbl and Cbl-b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mohapatra et al., 2013</xref>). Further, despite the well-established importance of the receptor kinase activity and phosphorylation in EGFR CME (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sorkin and von Zastrow, 2009b</xref>), phosphatases involved in the endocytic process have not been identified. These deficiencies and inconsistencies in our understanding of EGFR endocytosis can be, in large part, explained by the unusual dose-dependence of the various EGFR endocytic mechanisms, their apparent redundancies and the experimental conditions used. Specifically, the use of overexpressed recombinant EGFR and high ligand concentrations favor EGFR internalization through clathrin-independent rather than CME pathways. To resolve these experimental inconsistences, we were prompted to renew our efforts to systematically analyze proteins and processes involved in fundamental mechanisms underlying EGFR trafficking.</p><p>Our recent study using endogenously expressed GFP-tagged EGFR allowed the demonstration that low concentrations of EGFR ligands are sufficient to drive EGFR-dependent growth of mouse tumor xenografts and that EGFR endocytosis in tumors in vivo is clathrin-mediated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pinilla-Macua et al., 2017</xref>). These results inspired us to develop a more sophisticated endocytosis assay that would allow a quantitative analysis of the receptor traffic under physiological conditions. To implement this, we used CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing to generate a new functional fusion protein of endogenous EGFR that can be used in an endocytosis assay that reports the pH difference between extracellular and endosomal pH. We took advantage of a pH-sensitive, membrane-impermeant tandem dye MG-Bis-SA that becomes fluorescent only when bound to the fluorogen activating protein (FAP) and whose dual fluorescence excitation results in pH-dependent far-red ratiometric emission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Perkins et al., 2018b</xref>). In the latter study, the effectiveness of MG-Bis-SA for studying endocytosis and recycling of FAP-tagged β2-adrenergic receptor (B2AR) overexpressed in HEK293 cells at single-endosome level was demonstrated. We have previously developed FAP-tagged antibodies and nanobodies to EGFR to study its expression and endocytosis in cells with high receptor levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackerman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). However, combining the MG-Bis-SA/FAP-based methodology and cells expressing endogenous EGFR with FAP at the amino-terminus allowed the development of an experimental model system that is amenable to a simple and highly sensitive single-cell readout, although in a high-throughput assay format, such that we can monitor and measure constitutive or ligand-induced EGFR endocytosis under physiological conditions, for example using low EGFR ligand concentrations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>To generate the pH-sensitive EGFR, FAP was inserted at the amino-terminus of the EGFR molecule in the <italic>EGFR</italic> gene locus downstream of the sequence encoding the signal peptide and upstream of the sequence of the mature EGFR using CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Genome editing was performed in HeLa cells because EGFR endocytosis and signaling have been extensively studied and well characterized in these cells by others and ourselves. Several single-cell clones expressing FAP-EGFR were selected, and the clone EE7 with the most homogenous expression of FAP-EGFR within the cell population was used for subsequent experiments. Western blotting analysis confirmed FAP-EGFR fusion and demonstrated that FAP was inserted in all three copies of the <italic>EGFR</italic> gene in the EE7 clone as no untagged EGFR was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). While this clone did express a higher level of EGFR compared to parental HeLa cells, the activity of FAP-EGFR in EE7 cells measured as receptor phosphorylation at Tyr1068 per ligand-occupied receptor was equivalent to parental HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). The <sup>125</sup>I-EGF internalization rates were high and also essentially similar in parental HeLa and EE7 cells (Ke = 0.49–0.51/min; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Such rates are within the range of typical internalization rates via clathrin-coated pits (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sorkin and Goh, 2009a</xref>). The functionality of FAP-EGFR demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–E</xref> is consistent with the previous demonstration that the insertion of a large tag, such as YFP, in the amino-terminus of EGFR does not affect receptor activity and endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kozer et al., 2011</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46135.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Generation and characterization of cells expressing endogenous FAP-tagged EGFR.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematics of the gene-editing of <italic>EGFR</italic> gene by inserting the FAP dL5 sequence between the sequence encoding the signal peptide and the mature EGFR.

Together, the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> validate EE7 cells expressing endogenous FAP-EGFR as an appropriate model to study EGFR endocytosis.</p><p>To develop and employ a quantitative internalization assay, EE7 cells were labeled with MG-Bis-SA, a tandem dye sensor consisting of a fluorogenic acceptor, MG, and a pH-dependent Cy3 FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) donor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Perkins et al., 2018b</xref>). The properties of MG-Bis-SA and the principles of the ratiometric internalization assay using this dye are described in the latter study. In brief, the Cy3 excitation energy is transferred non-radiatively by FRET to MG; in solution MG acts as a quencher, whereas in FAP-bound state, the MG displays sensitized FRET emission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). At low pH, Cy3 (donor) absorption and energy transfer to MG are increased. Therefore, the excitation contribution of the pH-sensitive moiety (561 nm excitation) to far-red emission (680–700 nm) from the MG-FAP complex, increases at an acidic pH, whereas MG fluorescence (680–700 nm) by direct excitation at 640 nm is independent of pH. The ratio of the fluorescence emission intensities of MG-Bis-SA (680–700 nm) bound to FAP excited at 561 nm and 640 nm (termed as the ‘561/640’ ratio) increases several fold at pH of endosomes (~pH 5.5) as compared to pH 7.4 of the medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Perkins et al., 2018b</xref>). In our measurements in EE7 cells, the 561/640 ratio of MG-Bis-SA bound to FAP-EGFR was ~3 fold higher at pH 5.5 than at pH 7.4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Therefore, 561/640 ratio was used as a measure of the abundance of endosomal FAP-EGFR in subsequent experiments.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46135.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Quantitative analysis of FAP-EGFR endocytosis in EE7 cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The basis of the pH dependence of the 561/640 ratio of the fluorescence emission of MG-Bis-SA bound to FAP-EGFR and its use to measure the amount of FAP-EGFR in endosomes.

Tagging transmembrane proteins (‘cargo’) with pH-sensitive fluorescent proteins (FPs), such as pHluorin, has been widely used (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bizzarri et al., 2009</xref>), but this approach has a major disadvantage due to its inability to distinguish biosynthetic and internalized pools of intracellular FP-tagged cargo. A number of methods using pH-sensitive fluorophores that can be conjugated to genetically encoded tags, such as SNAP or Halo, were also applied to study membrane traffic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Los and Wood, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martineau et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Takeda et al., 2012</xref>). However, such methods often require long incubations with the fluorophore dye, washing off unbound fluorophores and may result in substantial background fluorescence. Recently developed radiometric pH biosensors called SRpHi are excellent endosomal pH probes but they are not intended for labeling of endocytic cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Richardson et al., 2017</xref>). In the FAP-based approach, low backgrounds are achieved due to the ‘dark’ state of unbound MG. Moreover, labeling of surface-exposed FP-tagged cargo with MG-Bis-SA is virtually instantaneous, which allows monitoring the endocytic process from its initial steps at the plasma membrane and through the sorting in endosomes without an interference from constitutive endosomal and biosynthetic pools of the cargo.</p><p>An example of the ratiometric imaging of FAP-EGFR endocytosis in EE7 cells is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>. The cells were labeled with MG-Bis-SA for 1 min and then incubated without or with EGF (4 ng/ml) for 15 min at 37°C. Strong FRET signal (excitation at 561 nm, emission at 680 nm) was observed in the vesicular compartments of cells stimulated with EGF but not in non-stimulated cells. By contrast, a strong far-red fluorescence excited at 640 nm with minimal FRET signal was detected at the plasma membrane of non-stimulated cells, primarily at the cell edges, ruffles and protrusions; this signal was clearly reduced in EGF-stimulated cells. This single-cell analysis shows an overall increase in the 561/640 ratio, clearly demonstrating that a quantitative analysis of FAP-EGFR endocytosis is feasible using this tool.</p><p>Subsequently, we used 96-well plates to measure the rates of FAP-EGFR endocytosis in a high-throughput format using the ratiometric assay. Cells were grown to confluence and serum-starved overnight, surface-exposed FAP-EGFR was labeled with impermeant MG-Bis-SA, and endocytosis was stimulated by EGF. The value of the 561/640 ratio increased during the first 10–15 min after EGF (1–20 ng/ml) stimulation at 37°C reaching a plateau at 15 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Therefore, the 15 min EGF incubation timepoint, the condition of a maximally high accumulation of FAP-EGFR in endosomal compartments, was used to measure the 561/640 ratio in subsequent high-throughput experiments.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46135.004</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Time-course, dose-dependence and receptor-kinase-dependence of FAP-EGFR endocytosis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Time-course of the 561/640 ratio measured in serum-starved EE7 cells grown in 96-well plates.

(<bold>B</bold>) To test the robustness of the assay at physiologically relevant EGF concentrations, we calculated the Z’-factor from the assay run with half a plate run as control and the other half with the addition of 1, 2 or 4 ng/ml EGF.

Importantly, endocytosis of FAP-EGFR stimulated with low EGF concentrations was blocked by the inhibitor of EGFR kinase activity (PD158780), whereas a significant component of kinase-insensitive FAP-EGFR endocytosis was observed when high, saturating concentrations of EGF were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). These data are consistent with the concept that EGFR tyrosine kinase activity is important at low concentrations of EGF (conditions favoring internalization through the CME pathway) but not at high EGF concentrations (conditions favoring clathrin-independent endocytosis) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Honegger et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lund et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sorkina et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wiley, 1988</xref>).

Each 96-well plate included 80 siRNA pools targeted to phosphatases, negative controls (non-targeting siRNAs), and siRNAs to clathrin heavy chain (CHC) and dynamin-2, proteins essential for CME (positive controls) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The same siRNAs targeting CHC and dynamin-2 were shown to block internalization of 1 ng/ml <sup>125</sup>I-EGF in our early studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huang et al., 2004</xref>). To identify phosphatases involved specifically in the CME of EGFR, the cells labeled with MG-Bis-SA were stimulated with 1 ng/ml EGF for 15 min at 37°C, and the 561/640 ratio was measured in four microscopic fields for each well as described in ‘Material and methods’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Importantly, the use of a high-magnification objective lens allowed real-time visual inspection of potential aberrant cell morphologies in individual wells of interest. As shown in the dual-flashlight plot that represents a summary of three independent repeats of screening experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), FAP-EGFR endocytosis was strongly inhibited by CHC and dynamin-2 depletion, confirming that under conditions of this assay the endocytosis is clathrin-mediated. Several siRNA pools to phosphatases were found to significantly inhibit FAP-EGFR endocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). Interestingly, among phosphatases identified in the screen as potentially important for EGFR endocytosis, are several phosphotidyl-inositide phosphatases, such as IPDD5D (SHIP1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), INDDL1 (SHIP2) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>) and INDD4A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

EGFR endocytosis has been previously analyzed using high-throughput screens of targeted and whole-genome siRNA libraries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Collinet et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pelkmans et al., 2005</xref>). These studies used labeled EGF to follow endocytosis of EGFR and a complexed multi-parameter single-cell image analysis to score for the effects of siRNAs. These screens were instrumental in identifying several new regulatory processes and proteins, although findings did not advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of EGFR endocytosis. Importantly, the downstream analysis in those screens required high concentrations of labeled EGF. By contrast, the screening approach using a combination of receptor tagging by gene-editing and ratiometric measurements described here is based on monitoring the localization of the endogenous receptor itself. Therefore, the FAP-based method allows exquisitely sensitive screening for regulators of the constitutive EGFR endocytosis, and EGFR endocytosis induced by other EGFR ligands, that are technically difficult to label. Also, as we are directly and selectively labeling surface EGFR, it can be used to study ligand-independent endocytosis, such as endocytosis induced by activated p38 MAP kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Frey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vergarajauregui et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zwang and Yarden, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Constitutive endocytosis of EGFR has been previously studied by measuring the uptake rates of radiolabeled and biotinylated antibodies bound to the EGFR extracellular domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burke et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burke and Wiley, 1999</xref>). Such methods, especially using radiolabeled antibody, are highly sensitive, although their implementation in a high-throughput assay format is technically difficult. Further, antibody-based measurements can be affected by the inability of an antibody to recognize receptors irrespective of their conformation and ligand occupancy, and by the bi-valent IgG binding; and these assays involve a ‘terminal’ antibody-stripping step at 4°C at each point of a time-course. Imaging-based FAP-EGFR methodology, besides its demonstrated amenability to a high-throughput screening, adds extra dimensions to the receptor endocytosis analysis. First, it allows quantitative monitoring of the entire time-course of FAP-EGFR internalization in a single living cell or a group of cells because no washing and stripping are required. Second, FAP-EGFR live-cell imaging can be performed on a pixel-by-pixel basis at high resolution, and thus can report the subcellular localization of the receptor in living cells. Therefore, the FRET signal (561 nm excitation) can be measured specifically in the endosome/lysosome compartments containing FAP-EGFR rather than in an entire cell. The fold-increase of the endolysosomal 561-nm-excited fluorescence of MG-Bis-SA bound to FAP-EGFR during endocytosis of this complex is significantly higher that the fold-increase of the total cellular fluorescence at 561 nm excitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Thus, the endosomal 561 nm-excited fluorescence alone can be utilized as the measure of FAP-EGFR internalization if screening is performed in cells expressing high receptor levels. In such cells, the concentration of EGFR at the cell surface remains practically constant during endocytosis triggered by low ligand concentrations because only a very small fraction of surface-exposed receptors is internalized.</p><p>Development of the experimental system described here can be technically challenging and time consuming as it involves labeling of endogenous EGFR by gene-editing. Because various types of cells may display different kinetics and mechanisms of constitutive and stimuli-induced endocytosis (see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burke and Wiley, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jiang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mohapatra et al., 2013</xref>), application of the MG-Bis-SA/FAP-EGFR approach would require a FAP knock-in in each cell line of interest. However, engineering the FAP-EGFR by CRISPR/Cas9 method in human cell lines will be dramatically facilitated by the availability of the donor construct, efficient gRNAs and other technical information obtained in our experiments with HeLa cells. We believe that using these tools it is feasible to generate a cell line expressing endogenous FAP-EGFR within 1 month.</p><p>In conclusion, as more examples of the application of FAP-based pH sensors to measure and analyze the endocytosis of various cargo in single cells are documented (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Emmerstorfer-Augustin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr"

rid="bib39">Pratt et al., 2017</xref>), the feasibility and utility of the high-throughput method described here for systems biology studies of the endocytic trafficking of different, endogenous transmembrane proteins, and especially, ligand-independent transporters, channels and other cargoes, will become increasingly important.</p></sec><sec id="s3"

Non-targeting siRNA was from Dharmacon.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Single-cell fluorescence microscopy</title><p>For live-cell imaging, glass coverslips with EE7 cells were mounted into the microscope chamber in 1 ml DMEM/0.1% BSA medium, placed onto the microscope stage adaptor, and z-stacks of confocal images were acquired using a spinning disk confocal imaging system based on a Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 inverted fluorescence microscope (with 63x Plan Apo PH NA 1.4), equipped with a computer-controlled Spherical Aberration Correction unit, Yokogawa CSU-X1, Photometrics Evolve 16-bit EMCCD camera, environmental chamber and piezo stage controller and lasers (405, 445, 488, 515, 561, and 640 nm), all controlled by SlideBook6 software (Intelligent Imaging Innovation, Denver, CO). 15 (unless indicated otherwise) serial two-dimensional confocal images at 400 nm intervals were acquired by exciting at 561 nm and 640 nm with the emission at 680 (70) nm for MG-Bis-SA and using a 561 nm channel for Rhodamine in the environmental chamber ensuring a constant temperature (37°C), humidity and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere throughout the duration of imaging. EGF-Rh or unlabeled EGF was injected into the stage chamber in large volume (0.2 ml), thus ensuring rapid distribution of the ligand. Z-plane change time was ~3 ms. All image acquisition settings were identical for experimental variants in each experiment.</p><p>The 561/640 ratio images are presented in a quantitative pseudocolor mode. The value of the ratio is displayed stretched between the low and high values, according to a temperature-based lookup table with blue (cold) indicating low values and red (hot) indicating high values. To eliminate the distracting data from regions outside of cells, the 640 nm channel was used as a saturation channel, and the 561/640 ratio images are displayed as 640 nm-channel intensity modulated images. In these images, ratio data with 640 nm values greater than the high threshold of the fluorescence intensity are displayed at full saturation, whereas data values below the low threshold are displayed with no saturation (i.e. black).</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Western blotting</title><p>To probe for EGFR, and phosphorylated EGFR and ERK1/2, cells in 12-well plates were serum-starved overnight, treated with EGF at 37°C for 5 min, lysed in Triton X-100/Glycerol/Hepes buffer in the presence of orthovanadate and sodium fluoride as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pinilla-Macua et al., 2017</xref>). The lysates were resolved by 6% or 10% SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to the nitrocellulose membrane. Western blotting was performed with appropriate primary and secondary antibodies conjugated to far-red fluorescent dyes (IRDye-680 and −800) followed by detection using an Odyssey LI-COR system. Quantifications were performed using LI-COR software.</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title><sup>125</sup>I-EGF binding and internalization</title><p>Mouse receptor-grade EGF (Collaborative Research Inc, Bedford, MA) was iodinated using a modified Chloramine T method as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sorkin and Duex, 2010</xref>).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Endogenous pH-sensitive EGF receptor and its application in high-throughput analysis of clathrin-mediated endocytosis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by John Kuriyan as the Reviewing Editor and Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: H Steven Wiley (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. You will see that no new experiments are asked for, and so we do not anticipate any difficulties in revising the paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a nice technical advance that describes a novel approach for high-throughput screening of EGFR endocytosis. Larsen et al. report development and characterization of an assay to measure the rate of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) of EGFR using HeLa cells in which CRISPR has been used to replace endogenous EGFR with a form of EGFR that can be labeled with a pH-sensitive fluorophore. The controls show that this tagging (FAP tagging) does not impact the internalization or physiological activity of the EGFR. In addition, they show that the sensitivity of the ratiometric technique is sufficient to allow assessment of physiological levels of ligand, and thus can be used to follow relevant mechanisms that regulate trafficking under physiological conditions.</p><p>This assay closely resembles a similar assay developed using transfection of a labeled β2-adrenergic receptor in HEK293, which was published by the Bruchez group in Biochemistry in 2018. The authors employ this assay in an siRNA screen of 240 phosphatases to identify phosphatases involved in CME of EGFR. At least three phosphotidyl-inositide phosphatases along with several phosphatases previously implicated in dephosphorylation of EGFR were identified in this screen. The precise roles of these phosphatases in CME of EGFR will be the subject of future studies.</p><p>On balance, the FAP-tagging approach seems ideally suited for high-throughput screening experiments because of its ability to use a single emission wavelength for the readout, the uniformity of the labeling, the relatively high S/N ratio that permits the use of low ligand concentrations and the ability to follow both empty and occupied receptors. The clean and consistent results obtained with both clathrin and dynamic siRNA pools is impressive (Figure 4). For screens of molecules that perturb the endocytosis of the EGFR (or other surface-associated proteins that can be tagged), this is certainly a powerful approach. It also shows the power of CRISPR-mediated tagging approaches and is likely to inspire the application of this technology to similar problems in biology.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Please discuss the following issues, to place the work in better context, noting the comments made by the reviewers below.</p><p>Please discuss the earlier work by others on the β2-adrenergic receptor more clearly, showing that the present work is an extension of work that had already developed the basic technology. We recognize that the advance here is to tag the endogenous receptor.</p><p>Although this is clearly a very powerful technological advance, there needs to be more discussion of both previous approaches and the advantages and disadvantages of the FAP-tagging approach as compared to those approaches. In particular, the need to genetically modify a cell line prior to use is a substantial disadvantage.</p><p>Also, the paper implies that endocytosis in their current cell line of choice (HeLa) is the same as all other cells, which the authors themselves have shown not to be true. For example, constitutive internalization of EGFR in mammary epithelial cells is quite distinct from most other cell lines, such as HeLa and fibroblasts (Burke and Wiley, 1999). EGFR endocytosis in mouse fibroblasts is also quite distinct from what is observed in HeLa and endothelial cells (Jiang et al., 2003). Thus, the approach outlined here would require tagging a variety of different cell lines to fully explore endocytic mechanisms and screen for regulators, which could be technically difficult.</p><p>It also has the disadvantage of being most useful for cells that express relatively low levels of receptors so that the signal from low levels of internalized receptors is not swamped out by high levels of receptors remaining on the cell surface.</p><p>Conversely, their approach has many advantages as compared to commonly used techniques. In particular, virtually all described methods for examining endocytosis of the EGFR are restricted to ligand-occupied receptors that behave dramatically different than empty receptors. In this respect, the technique is similar to the antibody-tagging technique (e.g. Burke, Schooler and Wiley, 2001), which has its own set of disadvantages, such as either blocking receptor occupancy (e.g. 225 mAb) or restricting the ligand which can be used (e.g. 13A9 mAb). However, radiolabeled antibodies have the advantage of yielding extremely high S/N ratios, thus also permitting evaluation of very low levels of receptor occupancy, even in cells with high levels of receptors.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46135.011</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Please discuss the following issues, to place the work in better context, noting the comments made by the reviewers below.</p><p>Please discuss the earlier work by others on the β2-adrenergic receptor more clearly, showing that the present work is an extension of work that had already developed the basic technology.

Please see Results and Discussion, fourth paragraph.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the necessity to label endogenous EGFR to implement our approach is a disadvantage. However, with the fast development of genome-engineering techniques, we think that tagging of endogenous proteins in multiple cell lines is becoming feasible. We included an additional comment discussing this point in the eleventh paragraph of the Results and Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, the paper implies that endocytosis in their current cell line of choice (HeLa) is the same as all other cells, which the authors themselves have shown not to be true.

We included examples demonstrating the variability of endocytosis in various cell types. Here again, we think that studying endogenous proteins is highly important and feasible, especially in the case of EGFR, because the key tools to gene-edit EGFR and insert FAP are developed in our study and will be available. Please see Results and Discussion, eleventh paragraph.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It also has the disadvantage of being most useful for cells that express relatively low levels of receptors so that the signal from low levels of internalized receptors is not swamped out by high levels of receptors remaining on the cell surface.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the signal-to-noise ratio will be lower if measurements of the “whole-cell” 561/640 ratio are performed in cells expressing very high levels of FAP-EGFR. In fact, we have already generated FAP-EGFR-expressing gene-edited human squamous carcinoma HSC3 cells that express ~500,000 receptors per cell. Indeed, high-throughput screening for endocytosis regulators in the presence of 1 ng/ml EGF using the 561/640 nm ratio method in these cells was not as effective as in HeLa cells, although using 2 ng/ml resulted in statistically significant data. Therefore, we discuss a modified assay (see Results and Discussion, tenth paragraph) that we found to be more appropriate and reliable in cells like HSC3. New gene-edited HSC3 cell lines are currently in a process of final characterization in the laboratory, and therefore, we did not include experiments with these cells in the present manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Conversely, their approach has many advantages as compared to commonly used techniques.
