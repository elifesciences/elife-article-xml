They dock and prime synaptic vesicles, couple them to voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, and direct neurotransmitter release toward postsynaptic receptor domains. Simultaneous RIM + ELKS ablation disrupts these scaffolds, abolishes vesicle docking, and removes active zone-targeted Munc13, but some vesicles remain releasable. To assess whether this enduring vesicular fusogenicity is mediated by non-active zone-anchored Munc13 or is Munc13-independent, we ablated Munc13-1 and Munc13-2 in addition to RIM + ELKS in mouse hippocampal neurons. The hextuple knockout synapses lacked docked vesicles, but other ultrastructural features were near-normal despite the strong genetic manipulation. Removing Munc13 in addition to RIM + ELKS impaired action potential-evoked vesicle fusion more strongly than RIM + ELKS knockout by further decreasing the releasable vesicle pool. Hence, Munc13 can support some fusogenicity without RIM and ELKS, and presynaptic recruitment of Munc13, even without active zone anchoring, suffices to generate some fusion-competent vesicles.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>synapse</kwd><kwd>active zone</kwd><kwd>munc13</kwd><kwd>readily releasable pool</kwd><kwd>synaptic vesicle priming</kwd><kwd>fusion competence</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH113349</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaeser</surname><given-names>Pascal S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS083898</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaeser</surname><given-names>Pascal S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006691</institution-id><institution>Harvard Medical School</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaeser</surname><given-names>Pascal S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Max Planck Institute for Multidisciplinary Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>open access funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Imig</surname><given-names>Cordelia</given-names></name><name><surname>Brose</surname><given-names>Nils</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>German Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EXC 2067/1-390729940</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brose</surname><given-names>Nils</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Hextuple knockout of key active zone proteins strongly reduces the pool of synaptic vesicles available for release, but synapse formation persists.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neurotransmitter release is mediated by synaptic vesicle fusion at presynaptic active zones, and Munc13 proteins have a central role in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brunger et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dittman, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wojcik and Brose, 2007</xref>). In addition to Munc13, active zone scaffolds contain RIM, ELKS, RIM-BP, Bassoon/Piccolo, and Liprin-Î±. Together, they form a protein machine that controls the speed and precision of synaptic transmission by docking and priming of synaptic vesicles, by organizing the coupling of these vesicles to sites of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, and by targeting transmitter release toward postsynaptic receptor domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Biederer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">SÃ¼dhof, 2012</xref>). Given the molecular complexity of the active zone and the essential roles of several of its protein components, understanding its assembly and mode of action has remained both a key aim and a challenge in cellular neuroscience.</p><p>Mouse knockout studies established major roles for Munc13 in vesicle priming at central nervous system synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Augustin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Varoqueaux et al., 2002</xref>). This process renders vesicles fusion-competent and adds them to the pool of readily releasable vesicles (RRP) that can rapidly undergo exocytosis upon action potential arrival. The functional RRP can be probed experimentally by applying stimuli that deplete it, for example, superfusion with hypertonic sucrose solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kaeser and Regehr, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rosenmund and Stevens, 1996</xref>). When Munc13 is deleted, release competence of vesicles is abolished or strongly decreased across all tested synapses in multiple model organisms, including mouse, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster,</italic> and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aravamudan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Augustin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Richmond et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Varoqueaux et al., 2002</xref>). Munc13 ablation also results in an almost complete loss of docked vesicles, as defined by plasma membrane attachment in electron micrographs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hammarlund et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Imig et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Siksou et al., 2009</xref>). These findings led to the model that vesicle docking and priming are morphological and functional states that correspond to release competence, a notion that is supported by similar correlations upon ablation of SNARE proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hammarlund et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Imig et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kaeser and Regehr, 2017</xref>). Due to their core function in vesicle priming, Munc13s mediate the resupply of fusion-competent vesicles as they are spent during synaptic activity and thereby control short-term plasticity and recovery from synaptic depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lipstein et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lipstein et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rosenmund et al., 2002</xref>). Furthermore, Munc13 nano-assemblies may account for secretory hotspots and recruit the SNARE protein syntaxin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reddy-Alla et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sakamoto et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Several recent studies took the approach to ablate combinations of active zone protein families, allowing analyses of active zone assembly and function upon elimination of redundant components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acuna et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brockmann et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kushibiki et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Oh et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zarebidaki et al., 2020</xref>). We simultaneously deleted RIM1, RIM2, ELKS1 and ELKS2, which resulted in a loss of RIM, ELKS, and Munc13, and in strong decreases of Bassoon, Piccolo, and RIM-BP levels at active zones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wong et al., 2018</xref>). This disruption of active zone assembly led to a near-complete loss of synaptic vesicle docking as studied by electron microscopy and to an ~85% decrease in single action potential-evoked exocytosis as assessed electrophysiologically. However, some transmitter release persisted: up to ~35% of release evoked by hypertonic sucrose and ~50% of spontaneous release events remained under the tested experimental conditions, increasing extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> to increase vesicular release probability p strongly enhanced single action potential-evoked release, and stimulus trains released vesicles surprisingly efficiently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). Hence, some releasable vesicles persisted despite the loss of most docked vesicles. These findings supported alternative mechanistic models in which docking and priming are independent processes mediated by distinct molecular functions of Munc13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kaeser and Regehr, 2017</xref>). Further support for this model came from experiments with artificial retargeting of Munc13 to synaptic vesicles rather than to active zones, which increased vesicle fusogenicity but not docking in mutants that lack most RIM and ELKS sequences and docked vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tan et al., 2022</xref>). Together, these findings suggest that non-docked vesicles can contribute to the functional RRP after removal of RIM and ELKS. What remained enigmatic, particularly in view of the near-complete loss of Munc13 from the target membrane after RIM + ELKS ablation, was whether undocked vesicles engaged Munc13 for vesicle priming or used an alternative priming pathway.</p><p>In this study, we tested directly whether Munc13 is necessary to prime vesicles after the strong active zone disruption upon RIM + ELKS knockout. We generated mice to ablate Munc13-1 and Munc13-2 in addition to RIM and ELKS (that is RIM1, RIM2, ELKS1, and ELKS2) and compared phenotypes of hextuple knockout neurons with those from conditional RIM + ELKS knockouts only. We found that synapses formed despite this strong genetic manipulation and that overall their ultrastructure was largely normal except for a lack of docked vesicles. However, Munc13 ablation on top of RIM and ELKS knockout further impaired single action potential-evoked release and decreased the RRP at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Paired pulse ratios, used to monitor p, were not further affected by the additional removal of Munc13. Our data establish that Munc13 can functionally prime some vesicles in the absence of RIM and ELKS, indicate that Munc13 away from active zones is sufficient to confer vesicle fusogenicity, and support a growing body of evidence showing that synapse formation is overall resilient to severe perturbations of synaptic protein content and of synaptic activity. We propose that Munc13 recruitment to presynapses is rate-limiting to generate fusion competence of synaptic vesicles.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Some synaptic Munc13 remains after RIM + ELKS knockout</title><p>With the overall goal to determine whether Munc13 mediates addition of vesicles to the functional RRP after RIM + ELKS knockout, we first confirmed key effects on synaptic transmission and Munc13 active zone levels in cultured neurons after ablation of RIM + ELKS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) that we had described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). We cultured primary hippocampal neurons of mice with floxed (fl) alleles for RIM1, RIM2, ELKS1 and ELKS2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). At 5 days in vitro (DIV5), a time point that is before the detection of functional synapses in these cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Held et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mozhayeva et al., 2002</xref>), the neurons were transduced with Cre-expressing lentiviruses or control lentiviruses (that express an inactive mutant of cre) to generate cKO<sup>R+E</sup> neurons or control<sup>R+E</sup> neurons, respectively. We previously established that this induces strong defects in active zone assembly and neurotransmitter release, but the neurons form synapses at normal numbers, and postsynaptic receptor assemblies and functions are preserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). We first confirmed that excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission are strongly impaired in cKO<sup>R+E</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1BâF</xref>). Synaptic responses were induced by focal electrical stimulation, and whole-cell recordings served to monitor excitatory and inhibitory transmission via glutamate and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs), respectively. Action potential-evoked excitatory transmission was monitored via NMDA receptors (NMDARs) to prevent the strong reverberant activity that is induced by stimulation of these neuronal networks when AMPA receptors (AMPARs) are not blocked.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Action potential-evoked neurotransmitter release and Munc13 active zone levels after ablation of RIM + ELKS.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Strategy for deletion of RIM1, RIM2, ELKS1, and ELKS2 in cultured hippocampal neurons.

In these experiments, side-view synapses are defined as a synaptic vesicle cluster with an elongated PSD-95 structure aligned at one side of the vesicle cloud as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Emperador-Melero et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Held et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nyitrai et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wong et al., 2018</xref>).

We used mice with floxed alleles for Munc13-1 and constitutive knockout alleles for Munc13-2 and Munc13-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Augustin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banerjee et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Varoqueaux et al., 2002</xref>). In cultured neurons of these mice, Cre expression removes Munc13-1 (cKO<sup>M</sup>) without the potential for compensation by Munc13-2 or -3. Control experiments were performed on the same cultures but with lentiviral expression of an inactive Cre (control<sup>M</sup>). Munc13-1 was ablated efficiently in cKO<sup>M</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1BâF</xref>), with the leftover signal not distinguishable from background levels that are typically observed in this approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Held et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nyitrai et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wong et al., 2018</xref>). When we compared Munc13-1 levels in cKO<sup>R+E</sup> and cKO<sup>M</sup> synapses, the remaining signal was somewhat higher in cKO<sup>R+E</sup> synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1G</xref>). These higher levels did not arise from a peak at the position of the active zone area (around â70 to â20 nm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wong et al., 2018</xref>). Instead, Munc13-1 levels appeared higher more broadly, and the ratio of Munc13-1 at cKO<sup>R+E</sup> vs. cKO<sup>M</sup> synapses shifted upward throughout the presynaptic bouton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1G</xref>). In both types of neurons, Synaptophysin signals remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1H and I</xref>). As observed before in autaptic cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banerjee et al., 2022</xref>), there was some release left at these Munc13 knockout synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). This is likely due to the very small amount of remaining Munc13-1 when using this conditional allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banerjee et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Because some Munc13-1 could be detected in cKO<sup>R+E</sup> neurons by STED microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1GâK</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1G</xref>) and Western blotting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2016</xref>), we compared synaptic Munc13-1 levels in cKO<sup>R+E</sup> and cKO<sup>M</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>).

Similarly, a slight Munc13-1 band was detected in Western blots of cKO<sup>R+E</sup> neurons, but not of cKO<sup>M</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3C and F</xref>). The remaining Munc13-1 signal in immunostainings detected in cKO<sup>M</sup> neurons is likely mostly composed of antibody background in these experiments as quantifications were done without background subtraction and noise levels of ~25% are common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). Altogether, our data indicate that some Munc13-1 might remain in nerve terminals of cKO<sup>R+E</sup> synapses, but the remaining Munc13 is not efficiently concentrated in the active zone area apposed to the PSD, supporting previous data on RIM-mediated recruitment of Munc13 to the active zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrews-Zwilling et al., 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Synapses form after deletion of Munc13 in addition to RIM and ELKS</title><p>With the overall goal to test whether Munc13-1 mediates the remaining release in cKO<sup>R+E</sup> neurons, we crossed the conditional knockout mice for RIM1, RIM2, ELKS1, and ELKS2 to conditional Munc13-1 and constitutive Munc13-2 knockout mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Cultured hippocampal neurons from these mice were infected with Cre-expressing or control lentiviruses at DIV5 to generate cKO<sup>R+E+M</sup> and control<sup>R+E+M</sup> neurons, respectively, to remove Munc13 in addition to RIM + ELKS. We first used STED microscopy to analyze the localization and levels of RIM1 and Munc13-1 . RIM1 and Munc13-1 were effectively removed from active zones of cKO<sup>R+E+M</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2BâK</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). PSD-95 levels as judged by this method were unaffected in most quantifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, E, and J</xref>), but a very small change was detected in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>. Because PSD-95 is used for synapse selection (see âMaterials and methodsâ), this isolated change likely reflects small differences in synapse selection in the two conditions in this specific experiment. The Munc13-1 signal that remained in STED experiments of cKO<sup>R+E</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I and K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1G</xref>) further decreased in cKO<sup>R+E+M</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). In confocal images, there was a further decrease in synaptic Munc13-1 levels in cKO<sup>R+E+M</sup> neurons compared to cKO<sup>R+E</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1CâE</xref>), and Munc13-1 was below detection threshold in Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1F</xref>). Finally, Synaptophysin puncta number, size, and intensity, analyzed with a custom-written code to perform automatic two-dimensional segmentation for object detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Emperador-Melero et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Held et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2018</xref>), were indistinguishable between control<sup>R+E+M</sup> and cKO<sup>R+E+M</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2LâO</xref>).

(<bold>C</bold>) Example of how resampling with replacement was performed in a hierarchical, nested manner. Starting with the cKO<sup>R+E</sup> group, we first resampled with replacement from the batches of cells. In all cases, there were three batches of cultures per experiment, and B2, B2, B1 might be drawn for this iteration. Starting with batch 2, the number of cells sampled in this batch is determined, and randomly resampled from the cells in this batch, replicating the same number but containing a different combination of cells. In the first example, the bootstrap cells C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>, C<sub>7</sub>, C<sub>6</sub>, C<sub>7</sub>, C<sub>5</sub>, C<sub>6</sub> were drawn; cells 6 and 7 were included twice and cells 2 and 4 not included at all. Then we proceeded through this list of cells, each time randomly resampling (always with replacement) from the set of technical replicates for that cell and appending these resampled measurements to the bootstrap sample for this group. After doing this for each of the seven cells in the list, the entire process was repeated, first for batch 2 (again), but selecting a different sample of the seven cells, and then for batch 1. At the end, the bootstrap sample for this experimental group was exactly the same size as the original dataset, but containing a different subset of measurements and, importantly, preserving the nested, hierarchical structure of the original data. The above process was then repeated for the remaining three groups (control<sup>R+E</sup>, cKO<sup>R+E+M</sup>, control<sup>R+E+M</sup>), and T* was calculated using the formula T* = [mean(cKO<sup>R+E</sup>)/mean(control<sup>R+E</sup>)]/[mean(cKO<sup>R+E+M</sup>)/mean(control<sup>R+E+M</sup>)]; '*' denotes a bootstrap replicate of the test statistic.

The cKO<sup>R+E+M</sup> neurons had very strong reductions in evoked release, both at excitatory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G and H</xref>) and inhibitory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4IâK</xref>) synapses compared to control<sup>R+E+M</sup> neurons. To directly test whether the additional Munc13 ablation further reduced release compared to cKO<sup>R+E</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1BâE</xref>), we normalized the PSC amplitudes measured in cKO<sup>R+E</sup> and cKO<sup>R+E+M</sup> neurons to their own controls, which are genetically identical within each mouse line except for the expression of Cre recombinase. We then compared the normalized data using standard statistical tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L and M</xref>). These analyses revealed that for both excitatory and inhibitory synapses, Munc13 knockout in addition to RIM + ELKS knockout decreased the remaining PSCs by ~40â50% compared to RIM + ELKS knockout only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L and M</xref>). The design of the experiments imparts structure to the data: repeated measurements (sweeps) from one cell are more similar to each other than to measurements from another cell, and the cells from one culture batch might be more similar to each other than to those from other batches. To account for this structure in our experiments, we performed a hierarchical bootstrap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Saravanan et al., 2020</xref>) following the workflow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>. Through hierarchical resampling, we calculated 100,000 bootstrap replicates (T* values) of our test statistic T (the control-normalized PSC ratio of cKO<sup>R+E</sup> to cKO<sup>R+E+M</sup>), thus allowing us to estimate the sampling distribution of T, to calculate 95% confidence intervals, and to calculate the probability P<sub>H0</sub> of the null hypothesis (T* â¤ 1) given the data. For both datasets, these distributions were robustly above 1 with correspondingly low probabilities for the null hypothesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4N and O</xref>). Thus, using both standard statistical tests and a hierarchical bootstrap, we found strong evidence for a robust, additional decrease in action potential-evoked release after ablation of Munc13. The remaining release in cKO<sup>R+E+M</sup> neurons might be due to the low amount of exon 21/22-deficient Munc13-1 that persists after conditional Munc13-1 knockout with this allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banerjee et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>), to Munc13-1 that persists beyond 11 days of Cre expression, to very low levels of Munc13-3 that escaped our detection in previous studies as Munc13-3 was not deleted in the hextuple knockout mice, or to an alternative release pathway that does not depend on RIM, ELKS, and Munc13. Altogether, however, the data establish that the remaining neurotransmitter release after RIM and ELKS knockout depends at least partially on the presence of Munc13-1 and Munc13-2.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Munc13 contributes to a remaining functional RRP after active zone disruption</title><p>Given the further reduction of synaptic transmission when Munc13 is ablated in cKO<sup>R+E</sup> neurons, we analyzed vesicle priming and release probability in cKO<sup>R+E+M</sup> neurons. The goal was to determine which release properties are controlled by Munc13 through comparison of these parameters with cKO<sup>R+E</sup> neurons. We assessed the functional RRP at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses through the application of hypertonic sucrose, a method that has been broadly used to evaluate correlations between vesicle docking and priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Imig et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rosenmund and Stevens, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zarebidaki et al., 2020</xref>). We detected robust reductions of the vesicle pool assessed by this method for both AMPAR and GABA<sub>A</sub>R-mediated responses in cKO<sup>R+E</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5AâD</xref>), but the functional RRP was not fully eliminated. Deletion of Munc13 on top of RIM and ELKS revealed an additional decrease, with an almost complete loss of releasable vesicles at excitatory cKO<sup>R+E+M</sup> synapses and an &gt;80% reduction at inhibitory cKO<sup>R+E+M</sup> synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5EâH</xref>).

We conclude that the fusion competence of vesicles that remains after active zone disruption by RIM + ELKS knockout is mediated at least in part by Munc13. Because Munc13 is not active zone-anchored and docked vesicles are barely detectable in cKO<sup>R+E</sup> neurons, these vesicles are undocked, but likely associated with Munc13 at some distance away from the active zone.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>The remaining functional RRP in RIM + ELKS-deficient synapses depends at least in part on Munc13.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Sample traces (<bold>A</bold>) and quantification (<bold>B</bold>) of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) triggered by hypertonic sucrose in control<sup>R+E</sup> and cKO<sup>R+E</sup> neurons, the first 10 s of the EPSC were quantified to estimate the RRP, control<sup>R+E</sup> 18 cells/3 cultures, cKO<sup>R+E</sup> 17/3.

Here, we show that fusion of these remaining RRP vesicles depends at least in part on Munc13. Even though Munc13-1 is not active zone-anchored after RIM + ELKS ablation, knocking out Munc13 in addition decreased the remaining pool of releasable vesicles at excitatory and inhibitory hippocampal synapses. We conclude that Munc13 can render some vesicles fusogenic in the absence of RIM and ELKS. Our work adds a very strong compound knockout mutation to disrupt synaptic function, with removal of six important active zone proteins, to a growing body of literature that is based on the compound mutant approach. Beyond its relevance for mechanisms of neurotransmitter release, our work further supports that synapse formation is remarkably resilient to even massive perturbations of presynaptic function and protein composition.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Disrupting active zones by removing redundancy</title><p>Knockout studies on active zone gene families have defined multiple roles for these proteins in the neurotransmitter release process. While some functions and mechanisms, for example, vesicle priming, strongly depend on single proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aravamudan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Augustin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Richmond et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Varoqueaux et al., 2002</xref>), other functions are redundant between members within a protein family or across protein families, and hence much more difficult to study mechanistically. This is particularly true for the scaffolding mechanisms that hold the active zone together and connect it with the plasma membrane and the vesicle cluster. These mechanisms are not well defined, and models ranging from self-assembly of complexes with defined stoichiometries to phase separation via multivalent low-affinity interactions have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Emperador-Melero and Kaeser, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">SÃ¼dhof, 2012</xref>). Recent studies with compound mutants to remove combinations of active zone protein families started to identify the required active zone scaffolds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acuna et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kushibiki et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Oh et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). We found previously that simultaneous deletion of RIM and ELKS in hippocampal neurons strongly disrupts active zone protein assemblies with subsequent loss of Munc13, RIM-BP, Piccolo, and Bassoon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wong et al., 2018</xref>). This loss of active zone material causes a near-complete disruption of vesicle docking and strongly impairs action potential-triggered neurotransmitter release. Unexpectedly, however, some release persists either due to the presence of remaining release-competent but non-docked vesicles or due to the rapid generation of release-competent vesicles in response to stimulation. The present study establishes that the transmitter release that remains after RIM and ELKS deletion relies at least in part on Munc13 as ablating Munc13 on top of RIM and ELKS decreased the remaining functional RRP further. The remaining release in cKO<sup>R+E+M</sup> neurons might be Munc13-independent, which is currently not possible to establish. Perhaps more likely, it is mediated by the small amount of remaining Munc13-1 protein in the neurons derived from the conditional mutant mice used here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banerjee et al., 2022</xref>), which is not seen with the constitutive Munc13-1 knockout mouse line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Augustin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Man et al., 2015</xref>). We further found that synapse structure per se is resilient to this major genetic and functional perturbation as synapses formed at normal densities and showed overall near-normal ultrastructure despite the knocking out of six important active zone genes in the cultured neurons. Our work adds to a growing body of data demonstrating that neurotransmitter release, presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, and active zone scaffolding are all dispensable for the formation of prominent types of central nervous system synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Held et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sando et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sigler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Verhage et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>One way to interpret our data is to compare them with properties of fusion in other secretory pathways. Synaptic vesicle exocytosis after RIM and ELKS knockout has resemblance with secretion from chromaffin cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Neher, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). In these cells, the release-ready pool of vesicles depends on Munc13, has relatively slower kinetics compared to synapses, but appears to not rely on the sequences of Munc13 that interact with RIM or on active zone scaffolds more generally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Betz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Man et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Neher, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stevens et al., 2005</xref>). The similarities of the remaining fusion after disrupting active zone assembly by knockout of RIM and ELKS are striking in that the release kinetics appear slowed down (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2016</xref>), the remaining fusion depends at least in part on Munc13, and docking and the functional RRP are not fully correlated. Some of these similarities are also reminiscent of recent studies in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, where vesicle priming does not rely on the interaction of unc-13/Munc13 with unc-10/RIM, and possibly unc-10/RIM itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). Altogether, these studies and our work indicate that disrupting the active zone through RIM + ELKS knockout renders synaptic vesicle exocytosis similar to chromaffin cell secretion. Notably, there are specific vertebrate synapses with similar properties. For example, at hippocampal mossy fiber synapses, strong depolarizations lead to RRP estimates that are larger than the number of docked vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maus et al., 2020</xref>), supporting the model that RRP vesicles can be rapidly generated and released during such stimuli, perhaps similar to the remaining RRP at cKO<sup>R+E</sup> synapses.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Can Munc13 prime vesicles in the absence of RIM?</title><p>Our data reveal that the transmitter release that remains after active zone disruption upon RIM and ELKS deletion depends at least in part on Munc13. Thus, Munc13 might render some vesicles fusion-competent in the absence of RIM and when Munc13 is not anchored at the active zone. This mechanism, however, is inefficient as it only maintains a fraction of the functional RRP of a wildtype synapse. An alternative or complementary model is that fusion competence is rapidly generated and immediately followed by exocytosis during pool-depleting stimuli. We recently established that the functional RRP after RIM + ELKS knockout can be further boosted by re-expressing RIM zinc finger domains without enhancing vesicle docking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tan et al., 2022</xref>). When the RIM zinc finger domain was expressed in RIM + ELKS knockout neurons, it co-localized with the vesicle cluster, it was not concentrated at the active zone, and it recruited Munc13 to the vesicle cluster. Hence, Munc13 can enhance vesicle fusogenicity through association with non-docked vesicles, at least when this association is generated artificially. Here, we show that the remaining fusion in RIM + ELKS knockouts depends at least in part on Munc13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>), but that Munc13-1 is barely detectable at active zones, while some Munc13 is present at synapses. These data indicate that endogenous Munc13 can be near vesicles and enhance their fusogenicity even if Munc13 is not active zone-anchored. Hence, Munc13 on non-docked vesicles might mediate the remaining fusion through generation of a pool of vesicles that can be rapidly primed and released upon stimulation. Altogether, a model arises that the rate-limiting step for generation of a functional RRP is the presynaptic recruitment of Munc13, even if Munc13 is not fully anchored and activated at the active zone. Upon stimulation, roles of Munc13 in SNARE complex assembly and fusion can be executed quickly.</p><p>Previous work established that RIM recruits Munc13 to active zones and activates it. This mechanism operates through binding of the RIM zinc finger to Munc13 C<sub>2</sub>A domains, which is necessary for rendering Munc13 monomeric and active in fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrews-Zwilling et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Betz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brockmann et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Camacho et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dulubova et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lu et al., 2006</xref>). In the experiments presented here, the neurotransmitter release remaining in the absence of RIM and ELKS depends at least partially on Munc13. This indicates that not all priming requires the RIM-mediated activation mechanism of Munc13, consistent with previous observations that many but not all RRP vesicles are lost after RIM knockout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Han et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Han et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kaeser et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kaeser et al., 2012</xref>). An alternative mechanism could operate via bMunc13-2 (which lacks the C<sub>2</sub>A-domain that binds to RIM) and ELKS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kawabe et al., 2017</xref>). While ELKS provides a Munc13-recruitment and priming mechanism that is independent of RIM, most ELKS is also removed in the RIM + ELKS knockout neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kaeser et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2016</xref>), and only a very small subset of synapses relies on bMunc13-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kawabe et al., 2017</xref>). Hence, this mechanism might be insufficient to explain the remaining release from RIM + ELKS knockout neurons. An alternative and perhaps more likely explanation is that not all C<sub>2</sub>A-domain-containing Munc13 requires RIM. Monomeric, active Munc13 is in equilibrium with dimeric, inactive Munc13, and RIM shifts the equilibrium to the active form. Even in the absence of RIM, some Munc13 will be monomeric and available for assembling SNARE complexes, accounting for the vesicular exocytosis that remains in RIM + ELKS knockout neurons. Finally, this mechanism may not be restricted to docked vesicles, but vesicles associated with Munc13 may be amenable to release, explaining why some release persists in RIM + ELKS mutants despite the loss of active zone-anchored Munc13 and of a strong reduction in docked vesicles.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Rims1<sup>tm3Sud</sup></italic>/J<break/>(RIM1Î±Î²<sup>fl/fl</sup>)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kaeser et al., 2008</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:IMSR_JAX:015832">:IMSR_JAX:015832</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Rims2<sup>tm1.1Sud</sup></italic>/J<break/>(RIM2Î±Î²Î³<sup>fl/fl</sup>)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kaeser et al., 2011</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:IMSR_JAX:015833">:IMSR_JAX:015833</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Erc1<sup>tm2.1Sud</sup></italic>/J<break/>(ELKS1Î±<sup>fl/fl</sup>)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2014</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:IMSR_JAX:015830">:IMSR_JAX:015830</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Erc2<sup>tm1.2Sud</sup></italic>/J<break/>(ELKS2Î±<sup>fl/fl</sup>)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kaeser et al., 2009</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:IMSR_JAX:015831">:IMSR_JAX:015831</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Unc13a<sup>tm1.1Bros</sup></italic><break/>(Munc13-1<sup>fl/fl</sup>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banerjee et al., 2022</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MGI:7276178</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Unc13b<sup>tm1Rmnd</sup></italic><break/>(Munc13-2<sup>-/-</sup>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Varoqueaux et al., 2002</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:MGI:2449706">MGI:2449706</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Unc13c<sup>tm1Bros</sup></italic><break/>(Munc13-3<sup>-/-</sup>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Augustin et al., 2001</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:MGI:2449467">MGI:2449467</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HEK293T cells</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat# CRL-3216;

To avoid network activity induced by AMPAR activation, NMDAR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (NMDAR-EPSCs) were measured to assess action potential-triggered excitatory transmission. For NMDAR-EPSCs, 6-Cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX, 20 ÂµM) and picrotoxin (PTX, 50 ÂµM) were present in the extracellular solution.

Recordings were performed at room temperature (20â24Â°C). Action potentials were elicited with a bipolar focal stimulation electrode fabricated from nichrome wire. Paired pulse ratios were calculated as the amplitude of the second PSC divided by the amplitude of the first at each interval from the average of three to four sweeps per cell and interval. The baseline value for the second PSC was taken immediately after the second stimulus artifact. For analysis of action potential trains (50 stimuli at 10 Hz), the baseline value of each IPSC within the train was taken immediately after the corresponding stimulus artifact. For AMPAR-mediated transmission (mEPSC and sucrose-induced EPSCs), TTX (1 ÂµM), PTX (50 ÂµM), and D-APV (50 ÂµM) were added to the extracellular solution. For mIPSC and sucrose-induced IPSC recordings, TTX (1 ÂµM), CNQX (20 ÂµM), and D-APV (50 ÂµM) were added to the extracellular solution. The RRP was estimated by application of 500 mM sucrose in extracellular solution applied via a microinjector syringe pump for 10 s at a rate of 10 ÂµL/min through a tip with an inner diameter of 250 Âµm. mEPSCs and mIPSCs were identified with a template search followed by manual confirmation by an experimenter, and their frequencies and amplitudes were assessed during a 100 s recording time window after reaching a stable baseline (&gt;3 min after break-in). Glass pipettes were pulled at 2â5 MÎ© and filled with intracellular solutions containing (in mM) for EPSC recordings: 120 Cs-methanesulfonate, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 EGTA, 4 Na<sub>2</sub>-ATP, 1 Na-GTP, 4 QX314-Cl, 10 HEPES-CsOH (pH 7.4, ~300 mOsm); and for IPSC recordings: 40 CsCl, 90 K-gluconate, 1.8 NaCl, 1.7 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 3.5 KCl, 0.05 EGTA, 2 Mg-ATP, 0.4 Na<sub>2</sub>-GTP, 10 phosphocreatine, 4 QX314-Cl, 10 HEPES-CsOH (pH 7.2, ~300 mOsm). Cells were held at +40 mV for NMDAR-EPSC recordings and at â70 mV for evoked IPSC, mEPSC, mIPSC, sucrose EPSC, and sucrose IPSC recordings. Access resistance was monitored and compensated to 3â5 MÎ©, and cells were discarded if the uncompensated access exceeded 15 MÎ©. Data were acquired at 5 kHz and lowpass filtered at 2 kHz with an Axon 700B Multiclamp amplifier and digitized with a Digidata 1440A digitizer. Data acquisition and analyses were done using pClamp10. For electrophysiological experiments, the experimenter was blind to the genotype throughout data acquisition and analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>STED and confocal imaging</title><p>Light microscopic analyses were in essence performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Emperador-Melero et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Emperador-Melero et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Held et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wong et al., 2018</xref>).

Alexa Fluor 488 (anti-rabbit, RRID<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2576217">:AB_2576217</ext-link>, S5), 555 (anti-mouse IgG2a, RRID<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_1500824">:AB_1500824</ext-link>, S20), and 633 (anti-guinea pig, RRID<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2535757">:AB_2535757</ext-link>, S34) conjugated antibodies were used as secondary antibodies at 1:200 (Alexa Fluor 488 and 555) or 1:500 (Alexa Fluor 633) dilution in TBP, incubated for 24â48 hr at 4Â°C followed by rinsing two times and washing 3â4 times 5 min in TBP. Stained coverslips were post-fixed for 10 min with 4% PFA in PBS, rinsed two times in PBS + 50 mM glycine, and once in deionized water, air-dried, and mounted on glass slides. STED images were acquired with a Leica SP8 Confocal/STED 3X microscope with an oil immersion 1.44 numerical aperture 100x objective and gated detectors as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Emperador-Melero et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Held et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wong et al., 2018</xref>). Images of 46.51 Ã 46.51 Âµm<sup>2</sup> areas were scanned at a pixel density of 4096 Ã 4096 (11.4 nm/pixel). Alexa Fluor 633, Alexa Fluor 555, and Alexa Fluor 488 were excited with 633 nm, 555 nm, and 488 nm using a white light laser at 2â5% of 1.5 mW laser power. The Alexa Fluor 633 channel was acquired first in confocal mode using 2Ã frame averaging. Subsequently, Alexa Fluor 555 and Alexa Fluor 488 channels were acquired in both confocal and STED modes. Alexa Fluor 555 and 488 channels in STED mode were depleted with 660 nm (50% of max power, 30% axial depletion) and 592 nm (80% of max power, 30% axial depletion) depletion lasers, respectively. Line accumulation (2â10Ã) and frame averaging (2Ã) were applied during STED scanning. Identical settings were applied to all samples within an experiment. Synapses within STED images were selected in side-view, defined as synapses that contained a synaptic vesicle cluster labeled with Synaptophysin and associated with an elongated PSD-95 structure along the edge of the vesicle cluster as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Emperador-Melero et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Emperador-Melero et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Held et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Jong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nyitrai et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wong et al., 2018</xref>). For intensity profile analyses, side-view synapses were selected using only the PSD-95 signal and the vesicle signal for all experiments by an experimenter blind to the protein of interest. A region of interest (ROI) was manually drawn around the PSD-95 signal and fit with an ellipse to determine the center position and orientation. A ~1200-nm-long, 200-nm-wide rectangle was then positioned perpendicular to and across the center of the elongated PSD-95 structure. Intensity profiles from â400 nm (presynaptic) to +200 nm (postsynaptic) relative to the center of the PSD-95 signal were obtained for all three channels within this ROI. To align individual profiles, the PSD-95 signal only was smoothened using a moving average of 5 pixels, and the smoothened signal was used to define the peak position of PSD-95. All three channels (vesicle marker, test protein, and smoothened PSD-95) were then aligned to the PSD-95 peak position and averaged across images for line profile plots. Peak values for each line profile were determined independent of peak position and used to generate the plots of peak levels.

At DIV16â18, cultured neurons were frozen using a Leica EM ICE high-pressure freezer in extracellular solution containing (in mM) 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4), 10 glucose (~300 mOsm), with PTX (50 ÂµM), CNQX (20 ÂµM), and D-AP5 (50 ÂµM) added. After freezing, samples were first freeze-substituted (AFS2, Leica) in anhydrous acetone containing 1% glutaraldehyde, 1% osmium tetroxide, and 1% water. The process of freeze substitution was as follows: â90Â°C for 5 hr, 5Â°C per hr to â20Â°C, â20Â°C for 12 hr, and 10Â°C per hr to 20Â°C. Following freeze substitution, samples were Epon-infiltrated and baked for 48 hr at 60Â°C followed by 80Â°C overnight before sectioning at 50 nm. For ultrathin sectioning, the sapphire coverslip was removed from the resin block by plunging the sample first in liquid nitrogen and followed by warm water several times until the sapphire was completely detached. The resin block containing the neurons was then divided into four pieces, and one piece was mounted for sectioning. Ultrathin sectioning was performed on a Leica EM UC7 ultramicrotome, and the 50 nm sections were collected on a nickel slot grid (2 Ã 1 mm) with a carbon-coated formvar support film. The samples were counterstained by incubating the grids with 2% lead acetate solution for 10 s, followed by rinsing with distilled water. Images were taken with a transmission electron microscope (JEOL 1200 EX at 80 kV accelerating voltage) and processed with ImageJ. The total number of vesicles, the number of docked vesicles per synapse profile, the area of the presynaptic bouton, and the length of the PSD were analyzed in each section. Docked vesicles were defined as vesicles for which the electron densities of the vesicular membrane and the presynaptic plasma membrane merged such that the two membranes were not separated by less electron-dense space. Bouton size was calculated from the measured perimeter of each synapse. Experiments and analyses were performed by an experimenter blind to the genotype.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Western blotting</title><p>At DIV15â19, cultured neurons were harvested in 20 ÂµL 1Ã SDS buffer per coverslip and run on standard SDS-PAGE gels followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membranes.

Data are displayed as mean Â± SEM unless noted otherwise, and significance of standard tests is presented as *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, and ***p&lt;0.001. Sample sizes were determined based on previous studies, and no statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. No outliers were excluded. Parametric tests were used for normally distributed data (assessed by ShapiroâWilk tests) or when sample size was n â¥ 30. Unpaired two-tailed Studentâs <italic>t</italic>-tests were used for datasets with equal variance, or Welchâs unequal variances <italic>t</italic>-tests for datasets with unequal variance. For non-normally distributed data, MannâWhitney tests or KruskalâWallis tests followed by Dunnâs multiple-comparisons post-hoc tests were used. For paired pulse ratios, two-way ANOVA tests with Bonferroniâs post-hoc tests were used. For STED side-view analyses, two-way ANOVA tests with Bonferroniâs post-hoc tests were used on a 200-nm-window centered around the active zone peak. The hierarchical bootstrap analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Saravanan et al., 2020</xref>) were performed using a custom-written MATLAB code (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/kaeserlab/Hierarchical_Bootstrap_Analysis_RB">https://github.com/kaeserlab/Hierarchical_Bootstrap_Analysis_RB</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Born, 2022</xref>). This method is similar to other hierarchical statistical approaches, such as repeated-measures ANOVA and linear mixed-effects models; however, it has the added advantage of not making any distributional assumptions about the underlying data and allows for unequal variance among the groups.

For each bootstrap iteration, group identity (control<sup>R+E</sup>, cKO<sup>R+E</sup>, control<sup>R+E+M</sup>, or cKO<sup>R+E+M</sup>) was preserved. Resampling was done at three nested levels: batch of culture, cell, and sweep (except for sucrose-evoked release for which only one sweep was recorded). After each bootstrap iteration for the four groups, a bootstrap replicate of T called T* was calculated using the above formula. The procedure was repeated 100,000 times, producing an estimate of the sampling distribution of T, which was plotted in the frequency histograms. Based on the distribution of the 100,000 T* values, we calculated 95% confidence intervals using the percentile method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Efron and Tibshirani, 1994</xref>).

ultra-structure in hippocampal cultures of mice lacking the key active-zone proteins RIM (1, 2), ELKS (1, 2), and Munc13 (1, 2). Compared to cultures lacking only RIM and ELKS, additional deletion of Munc13 results in a further decrease of synaptic Munc13-1 levels, a similar reduction of the number of docked synaptic vesicles, and a more pronounced decrease of the readily releasable vesicles. The results support the conclusion of the nonredundant role of Munc13 in synaptic vesicle priming. Overall, this study reinforces the notion that synapse formation is a remarkably resilient process that occurs even under strong perturbation of presynaptic function.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79077.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Brunger</surname><given-names>Axel T</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/006w34k90</institution-id><institution>Stanford University School of Medicine, Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.04.01.486686">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.01.486686v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Lu Chen as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions</p><p>1. It is unclear why Cre mediated removal of the presynaptic scaffold proteins was initiated at DIV 5, at a time point when synapse formation is already well underway. This likely contributed to the hypomorphic phenotype. Please comment.</p><p>2. The authors conclude that postsynaptic response is intact. On the other hand, they find kinetic changes in EPSC and IPSC (Figure 1 and Figure 4) that deserve to be discussed. In addition, they do not show any kinetic analysis of mEPSC and mIPSCs; this type of analysis is straightforward to be obtained and it might be useful to assess in part if there are or not changes at the postsynaptic level.</p><p>3. The major conclusion of the study is that the remaining release after ablation of RIM+ELKS (R+E) is mainly Munc13 dependent. First, the relative changes in mean EPSC/IPSC amplitude or sucrose-dependent RRP size between R+E and RIM+ELKS+Munc13 (R+E+M) KO cultures are comparably small, at most around 15% (Figures 4, 5). This is expected given the strong reduction in Munc13-1 levels in R+E KO (Figure 1; Wang et al., 2016). The relative differences between the experimental groups are smaller than the differences between different control data sets. Moreover, previous data sets obtained from R+E KO cultures under similar conditions by the same group suggest a similar relative decrease in E/IPSC amplitude or RRP size in R+E KO (Wang et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2022) compared to R+E+M KOs (both by ~90%). Given the parameter distributions (e.g., control EPSC amplitudes range between 0.5 and &gt;1.5 nA and display clusters that likely reflect different cultures, Figure 4H), how confident can the authors robustly resolve average relative changes by ~10%? To evaluate whether the remaining release in R+E KOs is indeed Munc13-dependent, it would be helpful to report effect sizes and to provide a post-hoc power calculation. Irrespectively of the outcome of a power analysis, it may be advisable to increase sample sizes for some of the major experiments.</p><p>4. Although EPSC/IPSC amplitude, RRP size, and mEPSC/mIPSC frequency are strongly reduced in R+E+M hextuple KO cultures, these cultures still display significant evoked and spontaneous synaptic transmission. For instance, ~20% of the IPSC RRP (Figure 5H) or ~40% of mEPSCs (Figure 4B) remain in R+E+M KO neurons. The authors attribute this to incomplete loss of Munc13 or Munc13-independent release (Discussion). In line with the first hypothesis and previous reports, their confocal data of Munc13-1,-2,-3 KO cultures indicate a significant anti-Munc13-1 signal (~25% of control; Figure 1 âfigure supplement 2B). Thus, it remains unclear whether the remaining release in R+E KO neurons is Munc13 dependent. An alternative hypothesis is that a significant fraction, if not the majority, of the remaining release is Munc13 independent. This would be equally, if not more interesting. Thus, unless the authors directly demonstrate that the release remaining in R+E KO neurons indeed requires Munc13, all respective statements in the manuscript should be revised accordingly (e.g., &quot;Our data reveal that the transmitter release that remains after active zone disruption upon RIM and ELKS deletion depends on Munc13., l. 324)&quot;. Indeed, an alternative interpretation of the current data could be quite similar to that of Wang et al. 2016: Fusion competent vesicles persist upon ablation of RIM-1/2, ELKS<sup>-1</sup>/2, and Munc13-1/2.</p><p>5. The rise time of NMDAR EPSCs was previously shown to be strongly attenuated in R+E KO cultures (Wang et al., 2016). How does the EPSC rise time in R+E+M KO cultures relate to the one in R+E KO neurons?</p><p>6. The paired-pulse ratio data does not suggest changes in release probability (pr) between R+E and R+E+M conditions (Figure 6). Could the authors provide an additional, independent pr (and RRP?) estimate, e.g., based on (IPSC?) trains? Moreover, it would be interesting to plot the relative decrease in mini frequency for R+E KO and R+E+M KO and discuss how a potential change would relate to pr.</p><p>7. Regarding the quantification of STED fluorescence intensity data: Can the authors exclude that crosstalk between both channels causes the remaining Munc13-1 fluorescence in R+E+M cultures (Figure 1J, 2I)? How do the changes in fluorescence intensity at STED resolution compare to the corresponding changes at confocal resolution? What is the justification for restricting the analysis to side-view synapses? Finally, it would be helpful to plot relative changes in fluorescence intensity for R+E and R+E+M, similar to Figure 1 âfigure supplement 1F.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Munc13 supports vesicle fusogenicity after disrupting active zone scaffolds and synaptic vesicle docking&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Regarding the major finding and effect sizes: Release is strongly compromised in both, RE KO (IPSC amplitude by ~82% of control) and REM KO cultures (~89% of control). EPSCs or IPSC amplitudes recorded in RE cultures were reduced by 90% and 81% (Wang et al., 2016), or by ~90% and ~85% (Tan et al., 2022) compared to time-matched controls in previous papers by the same group. Hence, the question arises whether the relative release defect of REM compared to RE cultures observed in the present study would persist in subsequent data sets.</p><p>Furthermore, the authors base their interpretation and effect size estimation on data that are normalized to the mean of the respective control group. Crucially, although the relative difference seems very high (~60%, comparing 11% with 18%), it strongly depends on the magnitude of the release defect. Conversely, the authors could have compared the relative reduction by 80% vs. 90% instead of the remaining fraction, which would give a relative difference of only ~13%. Thus, power calculations based on the relative effects of data normalized to the control mean are not informative in this context. Moreover, basing the sample sizes of the present study on previous studies with effect sizes of 80-90% appears inappropriate as well. To assess if release is indeed more strongly reduced in REM cultures, the authors could perform a two-way ANOVA and test for an interaction effect after not only normalizing the RE and REM datasets to the respective control means but also the control groups to their respective mean values. This analysis would reveal if there were indeed a significant difference between RE and REM. Otherwise, new data has to be collected to support this central finding of the paper.</p><p>2. Based on their data, the authors put forward a model in which the remaining release in RE KOs &quot;depends on&quot; Munc13. As most readers will unlikely know/look up the definition of &quot;depend on&quot;, we strongly suggest using the term &quot;partially depends on&quot; (or the likes) throughout the text to clearly emphasize that they cannot differentiate between Munc13-dependent and independent mechanisms.</p><p>3. In their response, the authors claim that the relationship between confocal and STED fluorescence intensity measurements has been characterized extensively in previous papers (for example in Figures 1 and S1 of (Wong et al., 2018) and Figure S2 of (Tan et al., 2022)). However, data showing a clear correlation between confocal and STED fluorescence intensities were not presented in these references. Although we do not doubt the major conclusions based on the STED data, the authors should either cite another paper or provide a corresponding correlation in the present manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79077.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions</p><p>1. It is unclear why Cre mediated removal of the presynaptic scaffold proteins was initiated at DIV 5, at a time point when synapse formation is already well underway. This likely contributed to the hypomorphic phenotype. Please comment.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers and editors for giving us the opportunity to comment, and we have performed a new experiment to address this important point. As a matter of background, in the culture system we use here, functional synapses are not detected at this time point. Spontaneous release is typically detectable only at DIV8-DIV9 (Mozhayeva et al., 2002), and evoked release builds up after DIV10. We have established before that with DIV5 cre infection to remove Ca<sub>V</sub>2 channels (Held et al., 2020), for example, release never builds up to robust levels (see Figure S4A and S4B, in (Held et al., 2020)). Thus, we think that DIV5 infection is appropriate in general. This point has been added on lines 119-120 of the manuscript.</p><p>In a previous study, we have shown that even when the Munc13-1 allele used here is knocked out throughout development by constitutive deletion in the germline, there continues to be some release in cultured autaptic neurons (see Figure S3 in (Banerjee et al., 2022)). We now include data that this is very similar in the Munc13 conditional knockout mice in the cultured neurons with DIV5 cre lentivirus infection (cKO<sup>M</sup> neurons, new Figure 1 âfigure supplement 2). We think that together, these observations make it highly likely that the persistence of some release in cKO<sup>R+E+M</sup> neurons is not due to DIV5 cre infection, but to the allele that we use. This allele is described in detail in (Banerjee et al., 2022) and discussed in the present manuscript on lines 161-164.</p><p>We felt that the most important point was to establish that the persistence of synapse formation in the hextuple knockout neurons was not due to late infection. Therefore, we pursued an additional experiment in which Cre expression was initiated by lentiviral infection at DIV2 (Figure 2 âfigure supplement 2). The density of synapses identified by Synaptophysin and PSD-95 was unaffected, indicating the synapse formation proceeds when RIM, ELKS and Munc13 are deleted with early cre infection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors conclude that postsynaptic response is intact. On the other hand, they find kinetic changes in EPSC and IPSC (Figure 1 and Figure 4) that deserve to be discussed. In addition, they do not show any kinetic analysis of mEPSC and mIPSCs; this type of analysis is straightforward to be obtained and it might be useful to assess in part if there are or not changes at the postsynaptic level.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for bringing this up and have added analyses of kinetics of mEPSCs and mIPSCs (Figure 4 âfigure supplement 1). There was a small increase of mEPSC rise times, similar to what we showed before in cKO<sup>R+E</sup> neurons (Tan et al., 2022), while mEPSC decay times and mIPSC kinetics were unchanged. Overall, we think that together with the unchanged mPSC amplitudes, this argues that receptors are fundamentally there and detect neurotransmitter. It is currently not possible to fully exclude any postsynaptic effects, but we think in general they cannot be large effects dominating the phenotypes. We added this point on lines 223-226 and used wording that does not exclude that small effects may be present.</p><p>Kinetic changes in evoked IPSCs are indeed present in cKO<sup>R+E</sup> synapses (as shown before (Wang et al., 2016)) and cKO<sup>R+E+M</sup> synapses, and are presented in Figures 1 and 4. We think that they may reflect asynchrony of release, but drawing strong conclusions is not possible in the studied synapses, and we hope that the reviewers and editors agree that presenting the specific data point of increased IPSC rise times in a descriptive way is appropriate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The major conclusion of the study is that the remaining release after ablation of RIM+ELKS (R+E) is mainly Munc13 dependent. First, the relative changes in mean EPSC/IPSC amplitude or sucrose-dependent RRP size between R+E and RIM+ELKS+Munc13 (R+E+M) KO cultures are comparably small, at most around 15% (Figures 4, 5). This is expected given the strong reduction in Munc13-1 levels in R+E KO (Figure 1; Wang et al., 2016). The relative differences between the experimental groups are smaller than the differences between different control data sets. Moreover, previous data sets obtained from R+E KO cultures under similar conditions by the same group suggest a similar relative decrease in E/IPSC amplitude or RRP size in R+E KO (Wang et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2022) compared to R+E+M KOs (both by ~90%). Given the parameter distributions (e.g., control EPSC amplitudes range between 0.5 and &gt;1.5 nA and display clusters that likely reflect different cultures, Figure 4H), how confident can the authors robustly resolve average relative changes by ~10%? To evaluate whether the remaining release in R+E KOs is indeed Munc13-dependent, it would be helpful to report effect sizes and to provide a post-hoc power calculation. Irrespectively of the outcome of a power analysis, it may be advisable to increase sample sizes for some of the major experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers and editors for raising this point and for allowing us to comment on it. We have performed power analyses as requested and describe it below. We think that there are two important components to the point that is raised and we have made a concerted effort in the revised manuscript to be exceedingly clear on them.</p><p>Comparisons of controls across experiments. We think that these comparisons are complicated by a number of factors. The experiments are often months or years apart. There are genetic background differences between the mouse lines. In the specific case of the work presented here, there are genotype differences between the controls (the control<sup>R+E+M</sup> neurons are Munc13-2 constitutive knockout neurons). Therefore, appropriate controls have to be performed for each experiment, which is now clearly described in the manuscript on lines 120-122, 147-152, 182-186. In the case of the presented experiments, this means that recordings are always done interleaved on the same day and with neurons that are identical in genotype except for the application of cre-expressing virus vs. Îcre-virus (a recombination-deficient version of cre). Hence, any cross-comparison of effects requires normalization to these controls, rather than direct comparison of absolute values, and controls should not be directly compared.</p><p>Effect magnitudes of control-normalized data. The only way to cross-compare is to normalize the mutant data to their controls that are matched in terms of genotype and interleafed on the day of recording. By doing so, in Figures 4 and 5, we compare means with 40-70% differences and assess significance based on this comparison. In these figures, the data are shown on a scale to 1.0 (100%) to reveal clearly that the data are normalized, but comparisons and statistics are done on effects sized &gt;40%, not on 10-15% effect sizes. We are confident about these effects based on these numbers, and also based on the observation that they are present in EPSCs, IPSCs, and EPSC-RRP and IPSC-RRP measurements, which cross-validates the observations to some extent.</p><p>As instructed, we have also done post-hoc power analyses on these effects. Based on this analysis, the confidence to conclude that we detected an effect correctly in Figures 4L, 4M, 5I and 5J is 90.1%, 86.4%, 99.7% and 65.3% respectively. A different way to use post-hoc power analyses is to ask how many nâs we need minimally to detect the observed effect sizes with 90% confidence given the control data and its variability. We calculated this as well and found that we would need 16 cells in Figure 4L (actual experiment: 19 and 20 cells), 13 cells in Figure 4M (actual: 18 and 31 cells), 7 cells in Figure 5I (actual: 17 and 23 cells), and 9 cells in Figure 5J (actual: 18 and 21 cells). Altogether, these post-hoc calculations support that the number of observations we used in these experiments are sufficient to detect the observed effects with reasonable confidence.</p><p>Finally, we think that it is inappropriate to add n after an experiment is completed as we set n before we started the experiment. The only possible approach would be to repeat the entire experiment from the beginning independently with a larger n, which is not feasible for a revision (and we think not necessary given the points above). In summary, we feel that the effects are robust and established, and we hope that the reviewers and editors agree.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Although EPSC/IPSC amplitude, RRP size, and mEPSC/mIPSC frequency are strongly reduced in R+E+M hextuple KO cultures, these cultures still display significant evoked and spontaneous synaptic transmission. For instance, ~20% of the IPSC RRP (Figure 5H) or ~40% of mEPSCs (Figure 4B) remain in R+E+M KO neurons. The authors attribute this to incomplete loss of Munc13 or Munc13-independent release (Discussion). In line with the first hypothesis and previous reports, their confocal data of Munc13-1,-2,-3 KO cultures indicate a significant anti-Munc13-1 signal (~25% of control; Figure 1 âfigure supplement 2B). Thus, it remains unclear whether the remaining release in R+E KO neurons is Munc13 dependent. An alternative hypothesis is that a significant fraction, if not the majority, of the remaining release is Munc13 independent. This would be equally, if not more interesting. Thus, unless the authors directly demonstrate that the release remaining in R+E KO neurons indeed requires Munc13, all respective statements in the manuscript should be revised accordingly (e.g., &quot;Our data reveal that the transmitter release that remains after active zone disruption upon RIM and ELKS deletion depends on Munc13., l. 324)&quot;. Indeed, an alternative interpretation of the current data could be quite similar to that of Wang et al. 2016: Fusion competent vesicles persist upon ablation of RIM-1/2, ELKS<sup>-1</sup>/2, and Munc13-1/2.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the overall assessment, and we have made a concerted effort in the manuscript to be clear in phrasing. In respect to the cited statement above: we use the word âdepends onâ to express that release is further impaired in the RIM+ELKS+Munc13 knockouts, and we do not understand it equal to âis required forâ. We think that this use is correct. For example, it is difficult to disagree with the following statement that we provide to illustrate our use of âto depend onâ: âWhile our everyday lives depend a lot on email by now, email is not required for lifeâ. Indeed, the Merriam-Webster definition of âdepend onâ is âto need (someone or something) for supportâ. We think that in that sense, the use of âdepends onâ is appropriate; our data reveal that the remaining release in cKO<sup>R+E</sup> neurons depends on Munc13 because it is reduced by ~50% in cKO<sup>R+E+M</sup> neurons. We have scrutinized the revised manuscript for the correct wording around this topic, and have changed âdepends onâ to âdepends on at least partiallyâ (or similar) in many cases, for example on lines 242, 261, 285, 315 and 349. The wording we use in captions is: âMunc13 contributes to a remaining functional RRP after active zone disruptionâ (results); âThe remaining functional RRP in RIM+ELKS-deficient synapses depends on Munc13.â (Figure 5 caption).</p><p>The key question is of course why there is release left in cKO<sup>R+E+M</sup>. We think that there are two alternative, fundamentally different explanations for this point:</p><p>Incomplete loss of Munc13-1. A previous study has established in cultured autaptic neurons after germline deletion of Munc13-1 that excitatory synaptic transmission was impaired but not abolished in the allele we used here (Banerjee et al., 2022), different from previous Munc13-1 null alleles (Augustin et al., 1999). In a new experiment (Figure 1 âfigure supplement 2), we confirm that this is also the case in dissociated mixed cultures and with application of cre-lentiviruses instead of germline recombination. The previous study (Banerjee et al., 2022) has described that a very small amount of spliced-over Munc13-1 remains after cre-recombination (estimated to be &lt;5%). In our study, it was required to use the conditional allele because a hextuple knockout experiment would be excruciatingly complicated to do with a lethal allele. This is described on lines 161-164 of the manuscript.</p><p>Munc13-1 independent release. The alternative possibility is that some release remains because it is fully Munc13-independent. While this is an exciting possibility, it is impossible to make this conclusion in our experiments because there is a small amount of Munc13-1 left (point above) (Banerjee et al., 2022). We have included it as a possibility on lines 240-241 and 317-320 of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The rise time of NMDAR EPSCs was previously shown to be strongly attenuated in R+E KO cultures (Wang et al., 2016). How does the EPSC rise time in R+E+M KO cultures relate to the one in R+E KO neurons?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing this out. The 20-80% rise time of NMDAR-EPSCs is significantly increased in cKO<sup>R+E+M</sup> synapses compared with that in control<sup>R+E+M</sup> synapses (control<sup>R+E+M</sup>: 7.6 Â± 0.4 ms, cKO<sup>R+E+M</sup>: 9.1 Â± 0.5 ms, p = 0.037, 20 cells/3 cultures each). This effect is qualitatively similar to cKO<sup>R+E</sup> synapses. The effect magnitude is somewhat smaller here than in Ref. (Wang et al., 2016). Possible explanations are: (i) Munc13-2 is knocked out in control<sup>R+E+M</sup> synapses but not in control<sup>R+E</sup> synapses; (ii) different extracellular calcium concentrations are used here (1.5 mM) vs. before (2 mM) (Wang et al., 2016); (iii) other technical factors, for example cre infection time points or other differences between the current experiments and the ones that were done ~8 years ago (exact composition of some of the culture media ingredients). Finally, we note that the kinetics of these NMDAR responses are very slow (~5-10 ms rise kinetics) compared to the sub-millisecond kinetics of the fusion reaction. Hence, it is unclear how much of the slowdown reflects changes in release kinetics. Because of this uncertainty, we would prefer to not include the NMDAR kinetic analyses in the paper although they are slowed down and consistent with previous results. We believe that no interpretation should be made. We also think that this is different for IPSC kinetics, which are included in the manuscript because they are much faster and hence likely provide insight into release kinetics. We hope that the reviewers agree given our explanations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The paired-pulse ratio data does not suggest changes in release probability (pr) between R+E and R+E+M conditions (Figure 6). Could the authors provide an additional, independent pr (and RRP?) estimate, e.g., based on (IPSC?) trains? Moreover, it would be interesting to plot the relative decrease in mini frequency for R+E KO and R+E+M KO and discuss how a potential change would relate to pr.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for these suggestions and have performed new experiments for both points.</p><p>Comparison of mini frequencies. For comparison of spontaneous synaptic transmission in cKO<sup>R+E+M</sup> synapses and cKO<sup>R+E</sup> synapses, we performed new recordings of mEPSCs and mIPSCs in control<sup>R+E</sup> and cKO<sup>R+E</sup> synapses (Figure 6 âfigure supplements 1A, 1B, 1E, 1F; note that (Wang et al., 2016) used a different extracellular calcium concentration). At the same time, we performed new recordings of mEPSCs and mIPSCs in control<sup>R+E+M</sup> synapses and cKO<sup>R+E+M</sup> synapses such that the recordings were done during the same time frame and not years apart (Figures 4A-4F). This analysis reveals that the mini frequencies in cKO<sup>R+E+M</sup> synapses and cKO<sup>R+E</sup> synapses are similar (Figure 6 âfigure supplements 1D and 1H). We also have previous datasets that were done simultaneously ~2 years ago (Figure 4A), allowing for an independent comparison of mEPSC frequencies in cKO<sup>R+E+M</sup> and cKO<sup>R+E</sup> synapses (the cKO<sup>R+E</sup> results were published in (Tan et al., 2022)). In this earlier dataset as well, mEPSC frequencies were similar in the two genotypes.</p><p>Comparison of responses to stimulus trains. We now provide data recorded during train stimulation, and we find that the reduced depression during these stimulus trains is very similar in cKO<sup>R+E</sup> synapses and cKO<sup>R+E+M</sup> synapses (Figure 6 âfigure supplements 1I-1L).</p><p>We think that overall, these data support the PPR data in Figure 6 to establish that release probability is not further affected by additional knockout of Munc13.</p><p>One often performed analysis is an RRP-determination based on back-extrapolation of trains, a method that might be pursued based on the reviewer comment above. We performed the analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>), and overall, the outcomes look reasonable and consistent with all of our data. We note however, that assumptions that these methods require are not met by our data. Most importantly, vesicular release probability p has to be high in order for this analysis to be valid (Kaeser and Regehr, 2017; Neher, 2015; Thanawala and Regehr, 2016). In our mutants, p is severely affected after multi-protein knockout, and it cannot be rendered high enough, even by increasing extracellular calcium (Wang et al., 2016). A second important point is that the analysis should only be done on a homogenous population of synapses, which is not the case in our cultured hippocampal neurons. Hence, although the overall outcomes look reasonable, we strongly feel that the analyses should not be added to the paper because key assumptions are not met. We hope that the reviewers agree that just showing the IPSCs during stimulus trains (Figure 6 âfigure supplements 1I-1L), but not the back-extrapolation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>), is the most appropriate way to present these data.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>(a, b) Cumulative IPSC amplitude plots in stimulus trains (original data from Figure 6 âfigure supplements 1I-1L, nâs as in those figures).

Regarding the quantification of STED fluorescence intensity data: Can the authors exclude that crosstalk between both channels causes the remaining Munc13-1 fluorescence in R+E+M cultures (Figure 1J, 2I)? How do the changes in fluorescence intensity at STED resolution compare to the corresponding changes at confocal resolution? What is the justification for restricting the analysis to side-view synapses? Finally, it would be helpful to plot relative changes in fluorescence intensity for R+E and R+E+M, similar to Figure 1 âfigure supplement 1F.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed two new experiments as outlined below. As a matter of background: we have used the method of side-view analyses extensively in the past five years and have published it in many papers (Emperador-Melero et al., 2021a, 2021b; Held et al., 2020; de Jong et al., 2018; Nyitrai et al., 2020; Tan et al., 2022; Wong et al., 2018). We also provide revised methods in the manuscript that refer to these papers and describe the methods in great detail. We note that we have also previously provided detailed supplemental figures on the justification and process of side-view synapse selection (Figure S3 in (Held et al., 2020), Figure S2 in (Nyitrai et al., 2020), Figure S6 in (Emperador-Melero et al., 2021b) and Figure S1 in (Tan et al., 2022)) and on the comparison between confocal and STED microscopy in this specific system (Figure S1 in (Wong et al., 2018), Figure S2 in (Tan et al., 2022)).</p><p>Crosstalk between channels. Based on our extensive experience with the use of this method for the characterization of knockouts, we are confident that there is no detectable crosstalk. To exclude the crosstalk for our specific conditions, we performed a new experiment in which we included a negative control without primary antibodies for the protein of interest, Munc13-1, with the same combination of primaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>). In the âno primary antibodyâ condition, no detectable signal in the relevant STED channel was detected, indicating that crosstalk is not the reason for background in our experimental setup.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>(a-c) Sample STED images (a) and quantification (b, c) of side-view synapses stained for Munc13-1 (imaged in STED), PSD-95 (imaged in STED), and Synaptophysin (imaged in confocal).

Side-view synapse selection is necessary because the analysis of active zone localization depends on assessing distances between the PSD and the active zone. This distance cannot be measured in synapses in other orientations, for example top-view, for two reasons. First, z-resolution in STED is worse than x-y resolution. Second, and critically, STED microscopy bleaches significantly in the area of signal acquisition. Hence, we only take single sections and do not reconstruct individual synapses in 3D. In a top-view synapse, the active zone and the PSD are overlayed in a single section and it is not possible to measure their distance. Hence, side-view selection is required. Because it is an experimenter-based selection process, this is done only based on the Synaptophysin and PSD-95 signals; at the time of side-view selection the experimenter is blind to the protein of interest. This is described in detail on lines 688-699.</p><p>Relationship of fluorescence intensities in confocal and STED imaging. We have characterized this in previous papers extensively, for example in Figures 1 and S1 of (Wong et al., 2018) and Figure S2 of (Tan et al., 2022). Hence, if there are changes in overall levels of a protein in a synapse, STED and confocal intensities typically correlate well. To directly compare Munc13-1 confocal (Figure 2 âfigure supplements 1C and 1D) and STED levels (Figures 2G-2K) in cKO<sup>R+E+M</sup> synapses, STED and confocal images stained for Synaptophysin, PSD-95 and Munc13-1 in control<sup>R+E+M</sup> and cKO<sup>R+E+M</sup> neurons were taken at the same time in new experiments. The Munc13-1 signals were removed efficiently at the active zone area in STED (Figures 2G-2K) and from synapses in confocal (Figure 2 âfigure supplements 1C and 1D), and the reductions correlated well with one another.</p><p>Relative changes in fluorescence intensity for cKO<sup>R+E</sup> and cKO<sup>R+E+M</sup> synapses. We now provide this comparison in Figure 2 âfigure supplement 1B. These analyses show that Munc13-1 levels in cKO<sup>R+E</sup> synapses were higher than that in cKO<sup>R+E+M</sup> synapses with a broad shoulder towards the inside of the nerve terminal, similar to what we observed in confocal microscopy (Figure 2 âfigure supplement 1E).</p><p>We hope that these points, together with our previous extensive work on establishing this STED microscopy workflow, sufficiently answer the reviewersâ comments.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In general, most points have been addressed by new experiments and text revisions.

Regarding the major finding and effect sizes: Release is strongly compromised in both, RE KO (IPSC amplitude by ~82% of control) and REM KO cultures (~89% of control). EPSCs or IPSC amplitudes recorded in RE cultures were reduced by 90% and 81% (Wang et al., 2016), or by ~90% and ~85% (Tan et al., 2022) compared to time-matched controls in previous papers by the same group. Hence, the question arises whether the relative release defect of REM compared to RE cultures observed in the present study would persist in subsequent data sets.</p><p>Furthermore, the authors base their interpretation and effect size estimation on data that are normalized to the mean of the respective control group. Crucially, although the relative difference seems very high (~60%, comparing 11% with 18%), it strongly depends on the magnitude of the release defect. Conversely, the authors could have compared the relative reduction by 80% vs. 90% instead of the remaining fraction, which would give a relative difference of only ~13%. Thus, power calculations based on the relative effects of data normalized to the control mean are not informative in this context. Moreover, basing the sample sizes of the present study on previous studies with effect sizes of 80-90% appears inappropriate as well. To assess if release is indeed more strongly reduced in REM cultures, the authors could perform a two-way ANOVA and test for an interaction effect after not only normalizing the RE and REM datasets to the respective control means but also the control groups to their respective mean values. This analysis would reveal if there were indeed a significant difference between RE and REM. Otherwise, new data has to be collected to support this central finding of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>After discussion of this point with the reviewing and senior editors for obtaining guidance, we have consulted with three biostatistics experts. As outlined below, we have added new statistical analyses. We thank the reviewer for insisting on this point, as we think that the newly added analyses, described below (and presented in the paper in Figures 4N, 4O, 5K, 5L, 6K, 6L, Figure 4 âfigure supplement 2, Materials and methods) are a significant addition to this paper and hopefully for the field for better accounting of the data structure that is inherent to the types of analyses we perform.</p><p>Consultation. We consulted with the following experts. (1) Dr. Clement Ma is a Biostatistician and Assistant Professor at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health University of Toronto, he is also Co-Director of the Biostatistics Core Services at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health. (2) The Harvard Biostatistics Student Consulting Center is a service for Harvard Researchers to consult about statistical testing. (3) Dr. Richard Born is a faculty member in the Neurobiology Department at Harvard and an expert in the quantitative analyses of neuroscience data. Dr. Born teaches all Harvard neuroscience graduate students in statistics, and this is a program with a heavy emphasis on quantitative methods. Graduates regularly go on to have careers in highly quantitative fields such as artificial intelligence research and computational neuroscience. The overall outcomes of these consultations were as follows:</p><p>a) The use of conventional statistical testing after control-normalization is appropriate as long as we only reach conclusions for the comparison of the two mutant groups, but not for control groups. We think that this is exactly how we used these comparisons. The controls are different (genetic background, constitutive knockout of Munc13-2) and should not be directly compared unless an experiment is designed to do so.</p><p>b) One general limitation in our analyses is that we compare means of individual measurements, and the statistical methods assume that the measurements are independent. However, this is not necessarily the case <sup>1</sup>, We record multiple sweeps from each cell and multiple cells from each <italic>batch</italic> of culture, and we then average per cell. To account for this nested structure, we adapted an analysis method that does not suffer from this limitation and offers a fully independent test of the hypothesis that additional knockout of Munc13 impairs release over the deficit observed in RIM+ELKS knockout. The null hypothesis is that no further deficit is observed. We used a hierarchical bootstrap to test the probability of the null hypothesis. This method is similar to other hierarchical statistical approaches, such as repeated measures ANOVA and linear mixed effects models, however it has the added advantage of not making any distributional assumptions about the underlying data and it allows for unequal variance among the groups. In addition, it is much more intuitive and straightforward to implement even when there are multiple nested levels to the data â see ref. <sup>1</sup> for details and a comparison with other methods. These new analyses directly address the overarching concern that the detected reduction through the use of normalization and conventional statistics across four data sets may be explained by factors other than genotype.</p><p>Description of the hierarchical bootstrap. Two gene families involved in synaptic release (RIM and ELKS) are removed, which reduces synaptic transmission by about 80%. Now, it is addressed whether knockout of a third gene family, Munc13, further reduces synaptic transmission over this ~80% reduction. However, since the conditional RIM+ELKS knockout is in a different mouse <italic>strain</italic> from the conditional RIM+ELKS+Munc13 knockout, the measured parameters of synaptic transmission in each conditional knockout <italic>strain</italic> must be compared to their own controls. In each <italic>strain</italic>, the controls and test <italic>conditions</italic> are genetically identical except for the absence/presence of Cre recombinase.</p><p>We define: <italic>strain</italic> 1: R+E (short for RIM+ELKS)</p><p><italic>strain</italic> 2: R+E+M (short for RIM+ELKS+Munc13)</p><p>To perform an experiment in a given <italic>strain</italic>, the hippocampi of several newborn mice are dissected out, and the <italic>cells</italic> are dissociated and pooled together in one primary culture. This culture is then divided into two pools subjected to different <italic>conditions</italic>: one is treated with a lentivirus containing Cre (= cKO); the other is treated with a lentivirus containing a catalytically inactive version of Cre (= control). From each culture, multiple <italic>cells</italic> are tested. Each <italic>cell</italic> is patch-clamped and synaptic transmission is tested by measuring the size of the postsynaptic current (EPSC or IPSC) evoked by an action potential or by the application of hypertonic sucrose. This measurement (<italic>sweep</italic>, technical replicate) is repeated 5-6 times for each <italic>cell</italic> for action potential-evoked release, and once per <italic>cell</italic> for sucrose-evoked release. The culture procedure is typically repeated in at least three <italic>batches</italic> of culture.</p><p>We define:</p><p><italic>condition</italic> 1: cKO</p><p><italic>condition</italic> 2: control</p><p>Thus, each measurement is uniquely identified by five numbers, which are variables (columns) in the tabulated data:</p><p><italic>strain</italic>, R+E and R+E+M</p><p><italic>condition</italic>, cKO and control</p><p><italic>batch</italic>, always 3 <italic>batches</italic> per experiment</p><p><italic>cell</italic>, may vary for different <italic>batches</italic>, 6 to 12 <italic>cells</italic> per <italic>batch</italic></p><p><italic>sweep</italic>, 5 or 6 per <italic>cell</italic> (action potential-evoked) or 1 per <italic>cell</italic> (sucrose-evoked)</p><p>Four experimental <italic>groups</italic> are defined:</p><p>cKO<sup>R+E</sup></p><p>control<sup>R+E</sup></p><p>cKO<sup>R+E+M</sup></p><p>control<sup>R+E+M</sup></p><p>The scientific question is whether knocking out Munc13 in addition to RIM+ELKS (cKO<sup>R+E+M</sup>) causes a greater relative decrease (vs. control<sup>R+E+M</sup>) in synaptic transmission as compared to cKO<sup>R+E</sup>. So, we define our test statistic, T, as:</p><p>T = [mean(cKO<sup>R+E</sup>) / mean(control<sup>R+E</sup>)] / [mean(cKO<sup>R+E+M</sup>) / mean(control<sup>R+E+M</sup>)] (1)</p><p>The null value for this statistic is: T = 1, corresponding to no further reduction,</p><p>and the alternate hypothesis is: T &gt; 1, corresponding to a reduction.</p><p>In the hierarchical bootstrap <sup>1</sup>, we estimate the sampling distribution of T by resampling with replacement from the raw data, while preserving the hierarchical relationships created by the design of the experiment. For each bootstrap iteration, <italic>group</italic> identity (combination of <italic>strain</italic> and <italic>condition</italic>) is preserved. Resampling is done at three nested levels: <italic>batch</italic>, <italic>cell</italic> and <italic>sweep</italic>. In the framework of a linear mixed effects model, <italic>group</italic> (= <italic>strain</italic> x <italic>condition</italic>) would be a fixed effect and <italic>batch</italic>, <italic>cell</italic> and <italic>sweep</italic> would be random effects. We developed a MATLAB code to perform the hierarchical bootstrap (https://github.com/kaeserlab/Hierarchical_Bootstrap_Analysis_RB).</p><p>For each of the four experimental <italic>groups</italic>, we perform the following hierarchical resampling. Starting with cKO<sup>R+E</sup>, we first resample with replacement from the <italic>batches</italic> of <italic>cells</italic> in this experiment. In all cases, there were three <italic>batches</italic> per experiment, so we use the MATLAB command 'unidrnd(3,3,1)' to draw 3 random samples from the uniform discrete distribution from 1 to 3. We might, for example, draw B<sub>2</sub>, B<sub>2</sub>, B<sub>1</sub> for this iteration (Figure 4âfigure supplement 2c).</p><p>We then start with <italic>batch</italic> 2, determine the number of <italic>cells</italic> sampled in this <italic>batch</italic>, and randomly resample from the <italic>cells</italic>, replicating the same number of <italic>cells</italic> but containing a different combination from that of the actual experiment. If there were 7 <italic>cells</italic> tested in <italic>batch</italic> 2, we might draw the following bootstrap sample: C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>, C<sub>7</sub>, C<sub>6</sub>, C<sub>7</sub>, C<sub>5</sub>, C<sub>6</sub>, in which <italic>cells</italic> 6 and 7 are included twice and <italic>cells</italic> 2 4 not at all. Then we proceed through this list of <italic>cells</italic>, each time randomly resampling (always with replacement) from the set of technical replicates for that <italic>cell</italic> and appending these resampled measurements to the bootstrap sample for this <italic>group</italic>. After doing this for each of the 7 <italic>cells</italic>, we go back and repeat the entire process, first for <italic>batch</italic> 2 (again), but selecting a different sample of the 7 <italic>cells</italic>, and then for <italic>batch</italic> 1. At the end we have a bootstrap sample for this experimental <italic>group</italic> that is exactly the same size as our original data set, but it contains a different subset of measurements and, importantly, it preserves the nested, hierarchical structure of our experiment. The above process is then repeated for the remaining three <italic>groups</italic> (control<sup>R+E</sup>, cKO<sup>R+E+M</sup>, control<sup>R+E+M</sup>), then T* is calculated using the formula (1) (the '*' denotes a bootstrap replicate of our test statistic). This entire procedure is repeated 100,000 times, producing an estimate of the sampling distribution of T. Based on the distribution of the 100,000 T* values, we calculated 95% confidence intervals using the percentile method <sup>2</sup>. To do this, we sorted the 100,000 values of T* in ascending order, then defined the lower bound as the 2,500<sup>th</sup> value and the upper bound as the 97,500<sup>th</sup> value. In addition, we calculated the probability of the null hypothesis, P<sub>H0</sub>, given our data as:</p><p>P<sub>H0</sub> = #{<italic>T*</italic> â¤ 1} / 100,000</p><p>Note that this is not a traditional p-value calculated with standard statistical tests, which is the probability of obtaining a result as extreme or more extreme assuming the null hypothesis to be true, but rather a measure of the probability of a given hypothesis being true given our data <sup>1</sup>.</p><p>Outcome. Using this method, we found low probabilities for the null hypotheses to be true: 0.042 for action potential-evoked EPSCs (Figure 4N), 0.009 for action potential-evoked IPSCs (Figure 4O), &lt; 0.001 for sucrose-evoked EPSCs (Figure 5K), and 0.084 for sucrose-evoked IPSCs (Figure 5L). This confirms our conclusions reached with conventional statistics that synaptic transmission and the pool of releasable vesicles are further reduced by additional removal of Munc13.</p><p>Additional assessment of data structure. It seems a priori plausible that the design of the experiments would impart structure to our data. That is, it is likely that repeated measurements (<italic>sweeps</italic>) from one <italic>cell</italic> are more similar to each other than to measurements from another <italic>cell</italic>. And we might also expect that the <italic>cells</italic> from one <italic>batch</italic> are more similar to each other than to those from other <italic>batches</italic>, despite our best efforts to standardize the treatment of different <italic>batches</italic>. But is this in fact the case? Might it still be legitimate to treat all of the measurements from a given experimental <italic>group</italic> as independent?</p><p>To address this question, we performed two additional analyses. First, within each experimental <italic>group</italic> (i.e. eliminating the fixed effects of <italic>strain</italic> and <italic>condition</italic>), we performed 2-way ANOVA with <italic>batch</italic> and <italic>cell</italic> as factors. An example distribution of data points for the NMDAR-EPSC is shown in Figure 4âfigure supplement 2b. For the two experiments (action potential-evoked EPSC and IPSC) in which there were repeated measurements for single <italic>cells</italic>, we ran the ANOVA for each of the four <italic>groups</italic>, yielding 8 tests, and found that <italic>cell</italic> was a significant factor in all 8 of them (at p &lt; 0.001) and <italic>batch</italic> was a significant factor in 7 of 8 (also at p &lt; 0.001). Including all four experiments (the above two experiments plus the sucrose-evoked EPSCs and IPSCs), we found <italic>batch</italic> to be a significant factor less frequently, but there was still evidence for higher between-<italic>batch</italic> variance than within-<italic>batch</italic> variance in 50% of the 16 cases (p &lt; 0.05). This is not surprising, because each <italic>batch</italic> represented a mixture of neurons from several animals and were thus likely to be more homogeneous. Nevertheless, the ANOVA provides strong evidence that it is right to consider structure in the data to begin with and hence strengthen the point that a method that accounts for such structure, like the hierarchical bootstrap, should be used for analyses.</p><p>The second analysis was to repeat the bootstrap in a non-hierarchical way and compare the distributions of T* and the resulting confidence intervals with those from the hierarchical bootstrap. To do this, we simply pooled the measurements from all of the <italic>batches</italic> and <italic>cells</italic> from a given experimental <italic>group</italic>, and resampled with replacement from this pool. This instantiates the assumption that all measurements were independent. As expected, these distributions were much narrower and more bell-shaped than the corresponding distributions from the hierarchical bootstrap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>), with the resulting 95% confidence intervals being, on average, less than half the width of their hierarchical counterparts. Importantly, extreme values of T* were much less likely to be represented in the non-hierarchical distribution, and the significance level of the results was overestimated. While this analysis does not directly address the issue of structure in the way that the ANOVA does, it provides a vivid picture of the consequences of not analyzing the data in the appropriate way, and further justifies the use of hierarchical bootstrap as a conservative method to judge the effects assessed here.</p><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Comparison of hierarchical vs. non-hierarchical bootstrap for the analyses of NMDAR-EPSCs.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-79077-sa2-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Assessment of paired pulse ratios with hierarchical bootstrap. Using the same methodology, we also analyzed the paired pulse ratios presented in Figure 6. Using conventional statistics, these ratios were found to be similar between <italic>groups</italic> (cKO<sup>R+E</sup> and cKO<sup>R+E+M</sup>). With the hierarchical bootstrap, we found the probability of the null hypothesis (T â¥ 1) given our data was 0.69 (NMDAR-EPSC paired pulse ratio, Figure 6K), and 0.61 (IPSC paired pulse ratio, Figure 6L). Thus, not only did we fail to reject the null hypothesis by conventional statistics, but we found strong evidence in support of it, confirming that vesicular release probability is not further affected by removal of Munc13 in cKO<sup>R+E</sup> synapses.</p><p>Power calculations. The power calculations (previous response, page 4) were done based on all data including the control conditions. Even though the data were normalized for the calculation, the control values were included in the calculation and the outcomes are hence independent of whether they are based on normalized or absolute data, all groups were part of the calculation. They are accurate regardless of normalization. We apologize that we did not explain this clearly in the previous response. Finally, the hierarchical bootstrap analyses presented here further support the point that sampling was big enough, because our conclusions are supported with an independent analyses method that accounts for the other variables in the experiments.</p><p>Changes to the manuscript.

Based on their data, the authors put forward a model in which the remaining release in RE KOs &quot;depends on&quot; Munc13. As most readers will unlikely know/look up the definition of &quot;depend on&quot;, we strongly suggest using the term &quot;partially depends on&quot; (or the likes) throughout the text to clearly emphasize that they cannot differentiate between Munc13-dependent and independent mechanisms.</p></disp-quote><p>We now use &quot;partially depends on&quot; (or similar) throughout the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In their response, the authors claim that the relationship between confocal and STED fluorescence intensity measurements has been characterized extensively in previous papers (for example in Figures 1 and S1 of (Wong et al., 2018) and Figure S2 of (Tan et al., 2022)). However, data showing a clear correlation between confocal and STED fluorescence intensities were not presented in these references. Although we do not doubt the major conclusions based on the STED data, the authors should either cite another paper or provide a corresponding correlation in the present manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for asserting that there is no doubt about the major conclusion. The best comparison for this point is provided in Figures S2A, S2G, and S2H of reference <sup>3</sup>. This comparison is the most appropriate because RIM1 expression levels are directly controlled using a stronger (RIM1Î±<sub>high</sub>) or weaker (RIM1Î±<sub>low</sub>) promotor.

In fact, there are no experiments with exogenous expression in the current manuscript at all. There are, however, experiments for which a strong correlation is expected.

These stainings are analyzed both with STED microscopy (Figure 1 âfigure supplement 1F) and with confocal microscopy (Figure 1 âfigure supplement 3E). The signal reductions are similar to one another with 28% remaining in confocal microscopy and 21% remaining in STED microscopy (we note that there is a small amount of Munc13-1 left in these mutants, ref. <sup>4</sup>).
