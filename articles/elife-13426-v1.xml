or viral infection; thereby, they enable recognition and annihilation by immune cells that express the powerful activating receptor NKG2D. This receptor is present not exclusively, but primarily on NK cells. Knowledge about the regulatory mechanisms controlling ULBP expression is still vague. In this study, we report a direct interaction of the oncogenic RNA binding protein (RBP) IMP3 with ULBP2 mRNA, leading to ULBP2 transcript destabilization and reduced ULBP2 surface expression in several human cell lines. We also discovered that IMP3 indirectly targets MICB with a mechanism functionally distinct from that of ULBP2. Importantly, IMP3-mediated regulation of stress-ligands leads to impaired NK cell recognition of transformed cells. Our findings shed new light on the regulation of NKG2D ligands and on the mechanism of action of a powerful oncogenic RBP, IMP3.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13426.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13426.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13426.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Tumor cells differ from healthy cells in many aspects. Importantly, tumor cells have the ability to divide and grow much faster than normal cells. To protect ourselves from full-grown cancers, our bodies have developed a surveillance system: when a tumor cell starts to divide without restraint, “stress-induced” proteins start to appear on its surface. These proteins help the immune system recognize abnormal or damaged cells, allowing the immune cells to eliminate the defective cells.</p><p>Despite this system of protection, a tumor cell sometimes manages to avoid having stress-induced proteins placed on its surface, allowing it to remain undetected by the immune system. By studying several different types of human cancer cells, Schmiedel et al. found that a protein called IMP3 is present in cancer cells but not in healthy cells. Further investigation revealed that IMP3 prevents the production of some stress-induced proteins and stops them moving to the cell surface.</p><p>Schmiedel et al. also show that the presence of the IMP3 protein in cancer cells causes nearby immune cells to become much less active. This suggests that developing drugs that block the activity of IMP3 could help the immune system to fight back and destroy cancer cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13426.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13426.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>IMP3</kwd><kwd>RNA-binding protein</kwd><kwd>IGF2BP3</kwd><kwd>immune evasion</kwd><kwd>ULBP2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mandelboim</surname><given-names>Ofer</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mandelboim</surname><given-names>Ofer</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001736</institution-id><institution>German-Israeli Foundation for Scientific Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mandelboim</surname><given-names>Ofer</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004963</institution-id><institution>Seventh Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FP7-PEOPLE-2012-ITN-317013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schmiedel</surname><given-names>Dominik</given-names></name><name><surname>Mandelboim</surname><given-names>Ofer</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The well-established oncogene <italic>IMP3</italic> impairs the interaction between cancer cells and the immune system.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The regulation of protein expression is essential for development, differentiation, maintenance, division and death of cells as well as homeostasis of tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buszczak et al., 2014</xref>). Regulation of protein biogenesis is controlled on transcriptional, translational and post-translational level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Day and Tuite, 1998</xref>). Critical players in this complex process of protein biogenesis are RNA binding proteins (RPBs) that control many important aspects such as RNA trafficking, stability and translation rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gerstberger et al., 2014</xref>). The RBPs are also involved in immunological recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kafasla et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>IMP3 (also known as IGF2BP3) is a member of the family of the insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding proteins.

So far, the role of IMP3 as regulator of cell proliferation, migration and invadopodia formation was mainly studied due to its ability to bind and stabilize mRNAs coding for insulin like growth factor 2 (IGF2) or CD44 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liao et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vikesaa et al., 2006</xref>).

They belong to the innate immune system (although they possess some adaptive features as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sun et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Min-Oo et al., 2013</xref>]) and are able to kill transformed cells, virus-infected cells and to interact with bacteria and fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wu and Lanier, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lodoen and Lanier, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lanier, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Seidel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schmidt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Koch et al., 2013</xref>). The killing by NK cells is mediated by several NK -activating receptors, among them is NKG2D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Seidel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Koch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bauer et al., 1999</xref>). The ligands of NKG2D are MHC class I polypeptide-related sequences A and B (MICA, MICB) and the family of unique length 16 (UL16) binding proteins 1 – 6 (ULBP 1–6), collectively known as stress-induced ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Elias and Mandelboim, 2012</xref>). The stress-induced ligands are differentially expressed on the cell surface following stresses like viral infection, heat-shock or genotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Raulet et al., 2013</xref>). Accordingly, these ligands are important for immune surveillance and both cancer cells and viruses often suppress stress ligand surface expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Elias and Mandelboim, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Salih et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fuertes et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stern-Ginossar and Mandelboim, 2009</xref>). Although mRNAs for some of these stress ligands are found almost in every cell, these ligands are barely expressed on the surface of healthy cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stern-Ginossar and Mandelboim, 2009</xref>). This suggests that the expression of the NKG2D ligands is also controlled at mRNA level, and indeed, we have previously shown that 10 different cellular miRNAs negatively regulate the expression of MICA and MICB proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stern-Ginossar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nachmani et al., 2009</xref>).

As control, we transduced RKO cells with a scrambled shRNA (RKO scrambled shRNA). We confirmed the knockdown using Western Blot (WB) with two different antibodies targeting IMP3 and used GAPDH as reference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, shown is the WB with one of these anti-IMP3 antibodies). Quantification of the WB revealed a remaining protein expression of less than 10 percent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Additionally, we analyzed mRNA levels of IMP3 using qRT-PCR and observed a residual amount of about 13% mRNA of IMP3 compared to scrambled shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Next, we analyzed the mRNA levels of the ULBP ligands in RKO shIMP3 compared to scrambled shRNA and observed a significant increase of ULBP2 mRNA levels following knockdown of IMP3 but no changes in mRNA levels of the other ULBP family members 1 and 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

To this end, we incubated RKO shIMP3 and RKO scrambled shRNA for 16 hr with the transcription inhibitor D-Actinomycin or with DMSO as diluent control. D-Actinomycin blocks the elongation process of the RNA polymerase II thereby suppressing the generation of new mRNAs.

We defined the amount of mRNAs in the DMSO-treated control as 1 and calculated the remaining mRNA levels after D-Actinomycin treatment for RKO shIMP3 and RKO scrambled shRNA. Since no new transcripts can be synthesized due to D-Actinomycin treatment, all observed differences are due to alterations in the RNA decay rate. Interestingly, we observed significantly increased amounts of transcript coding for ULBP2 in absence of IMP3 (shIMP3), but – expectedly – no difference in the levels of ULBP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

To narrow down the exact binding site, we decided to perform a continuous shortening of the ULBP2-3’UTR. Out of the full length 3’UTR of 535 base pairs, we generated four short variants covering the range from 1–100, 1–200, 1–300, 1–400 base pairs and compared it to the constructs with the complete 3’UTR (schematically shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). We observed that the construct ranging from 1 to 100 base pairs yielded an equal ratio of luciferase activity in RKO shIMP3 and RKO shRNA scrambled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). All other constructs, including the construct ranging from 1 to 200bp,had significantly higher luciferase activities in the IMP3 knockdown cells compared to the shRNA scrambled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Thus, we concluded that the binding site for IMP3 must be located between 100 and 200bp of the 3’UTR of ULBP2.</p><p>In 2010, Hafner <italic>et al.</italic> used PAR-CLIP technology to identify putative binding sites of RNA binding proteins and proposed the binding motif ‘CAUU’ for IMP3 equivalent to CATT on DNA level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hafner et al., 2010</xref>). This motif exists twice in the 3’UTR ULBP2, at the positions 161–164 and 292–295 of the 3’UTR. Since we determined that the IMP3 binding site in the 3’UTR of ULBP2 is located between 100 and 200 base pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), we replaced by PCR the TT nucleotides of the CATT motif found at position 164/165 with GG yielding in CAGG (schematically shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Consequently, the ULBP2-3’UTR mutation abrogated the effect of IMP3-dependent luciferase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>) completely.

However, expression of IMP3 could be observed in several kinds of cancer like in colon carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lochhead et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kumara et al., 2015</xref>), adenocarcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bellezza et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gao et al., 2014</xref>), urothelial carcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sitnikova et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Xylinas et al., 2014</xref>), lymphomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">King et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hartmann et al., 2012</xref>) or renal cell carcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hoffmann et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jiang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jiang et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>We demonstrate in several human cell lines of different origins that the knockdown of IMP3 up-regulates surface expression of the NKG2D ligand ULBP2. Consequently, we observed inverse effects on this stress-ligand following the overexpression of IMP3.</p><p>We demonstrate a direct interaction of IMP3 with ULBP2 mRNA. IMP3 was precipitated with biotinylated ULBP2 3’ UTR. We observed an increased half-life of ULBP2 mRNA transcripts and, consequently, elevated luciferase activity in absence of IMP3. We also showed that only a single binding site for IMP3 in the 3’UTR of ULBP2 at the position 161–164 exists since its mutation abolished differences in IMP3-dependent luciferase activity.</p><p>We tested the effect of IMP3 on ULBP2 in several cell lines using knockdown and overexpression of this oncogene. The effect on ULBP2 expression in RKO, HCT116 and 293T cells were in a comparable magnitude. The impact of IMP3 was capable of altering ULBP2 expression up to 35% in the cell lines tested. However, we also observed an effect of IMP3 on another stress-induced ligand, MICB. Higher expression levels of IMP3 correlated with a reduction of MICB mRNA and surface expression. In contrast to ULBP2, we did not observe differences in half-life or a change in the luciferase activity in presence or absence of IMP3 for MICB. Also, the surface expression changes between knockdown and overexpression for ULBP2 and MICB varied tremendously: In the knockdown, the up-regulation of ULBP2 and MICB was more or less similar, but the IMP3 overexpression decreased only moderately ULBP2 expression, but drastically affected MICB expression. Thus, we concluded that the IMP3-dependant alterations in MICB expression are probably indirect. Most likely, IMP3 acts on a so far unidentified transcription factor or regulator that subsequently leads to alterations in MICB gene transcription. The identification and validation of this putative mediating factor requires further investigation which is beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><p>Finally, we assessed the functional significance in an in vitro system by co-culturing NK cells with RKO cells, HCT116 cells or 293T cells with or without IMP3 knockdown. For all knockdown cell lines, we observed higher killing compared to the cells with natural levels of IMP3.</p><p>The physiological significance of IMP3 in healthy, adult tissues is still not completely understood. Obviously, the widely held belief that IMP3 is a strictly oncofetal gene could be disproved by reports that showed expression both in testis and placenta of healthy individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hammer et al., 2005</xref>). The recent discoveries about the role in placental trophoblasts might also shed a light on the array of target genes that are known to be affected by IMP3, for instant CD44 expression that is up-regulated by IMP3 is important in migration of trophoblasts within the placenta. Accordingly, the destabilization of ULBP2 mRNA and regulation of MICB expression described in this study might also protect trophoblasts in the placenta from NK cells, which are the most abundant population of lymphocytes present in the decidua during early pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Varla-Leftherioti, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sánchez-Rodríguez et al., 2011</xref>). This assumption requires further experimental support; nevertheless, it would explain the protection of cancerous cells by IMP3 expression that we spotlighted.</p><p>Although we could investigate a new effect of IMP3, its role in carcinogenesis is still incompletely understood as well. Our knowledge about its multiple targets that are discovered up to now raise the hypothesis that the complexity of action of an oncogenic RNA-binding protein might exceed the complexity of classical oncogenes like cytosolic or receptor tyrosine kinases. Further research is required to elucidate additional target RNAs that this RNA-binding protein can regulate and to ultimately develop an inhibitor for IMP3 that prevents its impacts on tumor cells.</p><p>For cancer therapy, IMP3 might be an excellent drug target due to its restricted occurrence in healthy tissues and its widespread occurrence in different kinds of cancer and especially in cases of unfavorable prognosis. In accordance with our results, an inhibition of IMP3 would - next to other potential benefits - lead to an elevated stress ligand expression and thereby enlighten recent approaches of NKG2D ligand-based cancer treatment, for instance, immunotherapy by Natural Killer cell infusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Locatelli et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Spear et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines</title><p>All cells were cultivated in 37°C, &gt;95% humidity and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Sigma, Israel) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Sigma-Aldrich, Israel) and addition of non-essential amino acids, L-glutamine, sodium pyruvate and penicillin/streptomycin according to manufacturer’s instruction (all Biological Industries, Israel). RKO is a human colon carcinoma cell line (ATCC CRL-2577), HCT116 is a human colorectal carcinoma cell line (ATCC CLL-247), 293T is a human cell line established from embryonic kidney (ATCC CRL-3216). All cells were directly received from the ATCC, Virginia, USA, therefore no further authentication was considered. Prior to transduction, cells were tested negative for mycoplasma contamination. All knockdown and overexpression cell lines showed good viability and proliferation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>RNA affinity purification and mass spectrometry</title><p>The interactions between RNA and RNA-binding proteins were analyzed by RNA affinity purification as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hämmerle et al., 2013</xref>). In short, the 3’UTRs of ULBP2 (both sense and antisense) was cloned into pBluescriptII vector. Additionally, a UTR of a control gene with similar length and GC-content (GBP2) was used. In vitro RNA transcription was performed using the MEGAscript T7 transcription kit (Life Technologies, CA, USA) after linearization of the plasmids with PspOMI restriction enzyme (Thermo Scientific (Fermentas), MA, USA). Around 10 percent of totally incorporated UTPs were Biotin-16-UTPs (GE Healthcare, UK). The biotinylated RNAs were coupled with streptavidin-sepharose beads (GE Healthcare, UK) and incubated with cytoplasmic extracts prepared from 80% confluent RKO cells for at least 12 hr. After purification and elution of proteins that bound specifically to the RNAs, a SDS gel analysis was performed and specific bands detected with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 (Sigma Aldrich, Israel). Specific bands were excised and analyzed by mass spectrometry using either a LTQ Orbitrap or a Q Exative LC-MS/MS (Thermo Scientific, Israel). Analysis was performed by the Smoler Proteomics Center, Haifa, Israel.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Knockdown of IMP3</title><p>Knockdown of IMP3 was executed with MISSION shRNA clones (Sigma Aldrich, Israel) for IMP3 in the vector pLKO (MISSION clone: NM_006547.2-2284s21c1 with following sequence: CCGGTGTTGTAGTCTCACAGTATAACTCGAGTTATACTGTGAGACTACAACATTTTTG). IMP3 mRNA is targeted within the 3’UTR (3’ untranslated region). Lentiviruses were generated in 293T cells and used for transduction of RKO, 293T and HCT116 that express IMP3 as detected by Western Blot analysis. Next to the transduction of a shRNA specifically targeting IMP3 (shIMP3), a control vector containing a scrambled shRNA was transduced (hairpin sequence: CCTAAGGTTAAGTCGCCCTCGCTCGAGCGAGGGCGACTTAACCTTAGG). Transduced cells were selected using 2.5 µg/mL puromycin in DMEM for HCT116 and 293T cells and 3 µg/mL for RKO cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Overexpression of IMP3</title><p>The vector containing the coding sequence for IMP3 was a kind donation of Prof. Joel K Yisraeli (Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel). The insert was transferred into a lentiviral vector and stably transfected into RKO cells. An empty vector served as control. The efficacy of the transduction could be determined using the GFP reporter on the vector. Using limiting dilution, a single RKO clone expressing high GFP was selected and used in all assays described. The overexpression was confirmed using Western Blot. In order to confirm the effects observed in RKO cells, IMP3 was over-expressed as well in HCT116 and 293T cell line without selection of GFP expressing cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Rescue of IMP3</title><p>To rescue IMP3 expression in RKO and 293T, cells that stably express the shRNA targeting IMP3 were transduced with an empty vector as control or the vector containing the coding DNA sequence (CDS) of IMP3. Since the shRNA against IMP3 targets the 3’UTR of the mRNA, the overexpression using the CDS only can’t be targeted and downregulated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Western blot analysis</title><p>Lysates of the various RKO, HCT116 and 293T cells were prepared and SDS gel electrophoresis was executed.

The cells were always analyzed in a confluence of about 60–80%. Anti-hULBP1, anti-hULBP2, anti-hULBP3, anti-MICA and anti-MICB antibodies were obtained from R&amp;DSystems (MN, USA) as well as the mouse isotype IgG antibody. For detection, a goat-anti-mouse IgG antibody coupled to Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 647 (Jackson ImmunoResearch, PA, USA) was incubated in a dilution of 1:250 for 1 hr. Analysis was performed with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, CA, USA). Cells were gated according to their appearance in forward and side scatter (FSC/SSC); to analyze the effects of the overexpression of IMP3 on stress-ligand expression, only GFP-positive cells were gated (both for the overexpression and the rescue of IMP3 after knockdown in RKO and 293T).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>RNA extraction and cDNA preparation</title><p>RNAs for the detection of mRNA levels were prepared using the QuickRNA Kit (Zymo Research, CA, USA).

The vector contains a SV40 promoter replacing the natural gene promoter and a SV40 polyadenylation site. 1.25 x 10<sup>5</sup> RKO cells transfected with scrambled or IMP3-specific shRNA were seeded into 24-well-plates. The next day, the cells were transfected using TransIT-LT1 reagent (MIRUS Bio, WI, USA) with 250 ng of Firefly-Luciferase vector containing the 3’UTRs, and 50 ng of Renilla Luciferase vector (pRL-CMV) as reference. 28 hr post transfection, cells were lysed and luciferase activity measured using Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, WI, USA). For the assessment of differences of luciferase activity of the shortened 3’UTRs of ULBP2, following UTRs were cloned into pGL3: 1–100 bp (basepairs), 1–200 bp, 1–300 bp, 1–400 bp and full length UTR (540 bp). 1 x 10<sup>5</sup> RKO cells were seeded and the following day transfected with constructs coding for these shortened UTRs. Cells were harvested and analyzed 28 hr post transfection. For the binding site analysis of IMP3 in ULBP2-3’UTR, the putative-binding motif CATT at position 162 – 165 was mutated into CAGG to prevent binding of IMP3 to the RNA. 1 x 10<sup>5</sup> RKO cells were transfected with the unchanged, wild type UTR of ULBP2 or the CAGG-mutated UTR and harvested 28 hr post transfection. The empty vector pGL3 was used as control and for normalization. For the readout, a LB 940 Mithras device (Berthold Technologies, Germany) was used. For technical reasons, the device needed to be exchanged between the performance of Figure 6B and Figure 6D/Figure 6F.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>D-Actinomycin treatment</title><p>For the transcription inhibition with D-Actinomycin, RKO cells transfected with a scrambled or IMP3 specific shRNA were seeded in a density of 2.5 x 10<sup>5</sup> in 6-well-plates.

D-Actinomycin effectively inhibits the elongation process of the RNA polymerase II, thereby suppressing the synthesis of new mRNA transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sobell, 1985</xref>). After 16 hr incubation, medium was removed, and cells were harvested following the manufacturers’ protocol for RNA extraction (Zymo Research, CA, USA). cDNA was prepared using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, CA, USA) according to manufacturer’s protocol. qRT-PCR was performed as mentioned in the corresponding section. For analysis, we defined the level of a specific mRNA in the DMSO-treated control cells (diluent control) in both the scrambled shRNA- and shIMP3-transduced cells as 1.

ULBP2 represents one out of eight human stress-induced surface ligands of the activating NKG2D receptor that is expressed on cytotoxic lymphocytes. By mass spectrometry, the authors identified IMP3 as a protein binding in vitro to the 3'UTR of ULBP2 mRNA. A similar unbiased approach has already been used earlier by the authors to describe RPBs for the 3'UTR of another human NKG2D ligand (MICB) (Nachmani et al., 2014; ref. 48). Here, they demonstrate that manipulation of IMP3 expression (shRNA, overexpression) alters cellular expression of ULBP2 in three different cell lines, though the effects appear modest. Functional IMP3 binding to the 3'UTR of ULBP2 transcripts is validated in luciferase reporter assays. Finally, IMP3 down-regulation (by shRNA) is shown to significantly increase susceptibility to NK cytotoxicity in an NKG2D-dependent manner. Overall, the results provide evidence for a novel role of the IMP3 oncogene in cancer immune evasion via down-regulation of ULBP2.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The following major concerns were raised that would be required to be adequately addressed for the manuscript to be acceptable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) The studies appear to rely on a single shRNA or perhaps a pool of shRNAs (details are not provided), raising concerns of possible off-target effects. Additional experiments are needed to establish that the main findings are observed with more than one independent shRNA and/or that the effects of shRNA knockdown can be rescued by expression of an IMP3 mRNA that does not contain the shRNA targeting sequence.</p><p>2) The experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> make the strongest case for a role of IMP3 in regulating cell surface expression of ligands for NKG2D. However, these experiments do not demonstrate that the effect of IMP3 knockdown is due to increased expression of IMP3. In fact, the authors previously showed regulation of MICB by other RNA binding proteins, in Nat Commun. 2014; 5: 4186. This is especially relevant for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, since the effect of shIMP3 on NK killing is out of proportion to its effect on ULBP2 expression. Therefore, demonstrating specificity of the effect of IMP3 knockdown on ULBP2 would require simultaneous evaluation of the other relevant NKG2D ligands expressed in these cells, e.g., MICA and MICB. Specificity of the effect of shRNAs in reducing IMP3 expression would have to be established as in point 1.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13426.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p> <italic>The following major concerns were raised that would be required to be adequately addressed for the manuscript to be acceptable for publication in eLife. 1) The studies appear to rely on a single shRNA or perhaps a pool of shRNAs (details are not provided), raising concerns of possible off-target effects.

Since we transfected a plasmid containing only the coding sequence only for IMP3, the expression of the protein is not affected by the shRNA that targets a part of the mRNA in the untranslated region of the mRNA. Consequently, we observe a downregulation of ULBP2 in the cells with IMP3-rescue as compared to the cells lacking IMP3 proving that the effect is indeed IMP3-specific. The corresponding FACS plot is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and described in the text. Also, we provided the clone number and hairpin sequence of the shRNA that we used for the knockdown in the Materials and methods section.</p><p><italic>2) The experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> make the strongest case for a role of IMP3 in regulating cell surface expression of ligands for NKG2D.

We checked the raised question if also MICA and MICB are dependent of the expression of IMP3. Actually, we also observed for MICB a strong IMP3-dependence in surface expression and RNA levels but not for MICA. Thus, as suggested by the reviewers and editors, the NKG2D dependent killing is not only stimulated by increased ULBP2 levels, but also by MICB up-regulation. However, we checked in shIMP3 RKO cells luciferase activity and MICB mRNA stability and concluded from our results that the regulation of ULBP2 and MICB has unequal underlying mechanisms. ULBP2 is directly targeted by IMP3, whereas MICB is not. We added new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> to the revised manuscript containing all results obtained regarding the expression of MIC family members and discuss our observations amply in the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
